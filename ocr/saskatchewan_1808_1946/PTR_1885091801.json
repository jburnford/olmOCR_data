So much has been said about the Government officials having visited the district, and visits in the past to the immediate neighborhood of the railway line, that we have every hope that at any rate so far as visiting Prince Albert here comes concerned Lord Lansdowne will follow the example of his illustrious predecessor the Marquis of Lorne, and that Mr. White will be a new departure, set an example to Ministers of Public Departments. We have heard of late of this fact because it is only natural to suppose that the expected visitors will have the natural desire to visit the scenes of the several encounters which took place during the recent elections, and this visitation and do their best to gratify it. Should we be honored by their presence, we have no doubt the settlers will do their best to extend to them a hearty welcome, and to assure them that whatever interest motives may have been said to the contrary, the loyalty of our community is second to none. Of course anything in the shape of a royal visit would expense too much the people would under present circumstances be in the worst possible taste, as well as convey a very false impression. Anything of that sort which could be attempted here, would not all appear to be in accordance with the necessity for far more ambitious efforts of the people of more wealthy localities, and we are certain that both the Governor General who has the sentiment of the country behind him, and Mr. White, who in his absence from the town, has known what it is to have it in very close connection with the exercise of state economy, will think better to know that it has been shifted from them to the Government from any attempt at a display which we and its readers will not admit the most will allow that we can see force of our objection to their show afforded. We trust that these good intentions, in our district on the strength of the utterances of correspondents who on the face of things are prepared to go any lengths in order to make out a good case for the rebels. The impression left upon the minds of the settlers here affords a strong indication that they have been treated with far too great liberality, and no one spoke with greater contempt of the enemy as judged by the amount of news he has furnished on the subject of Lord Perth and Mr. White, the result of which was nothing that might be called boasting; they must have swallowed what they took, for they did not either bring it into the settlement or carry it away with them. The impression made on the Metis themselves is it impossible to conceive what could have become of it. The Metis, however, do not seem to possess it. We wrote on behalf of the women and children who were suffering under great want and distress. Since then we have pointed out that the reports upon which we wrote proved to have been greatly exaggerated, and furthermore that the Government had given assistance to the really needy. As the matter stands now, we wish the people of Canada to understand that, making all possible excuse for the Metis, they have been treated as a foe to the Government and the volunteers that they are as they are, whatever any one may say to the contrary. The truth is that so far from having suffered too severely, they have not had the insolence taken out of them yet.\n\nPERE ANDRES LETTER\n\nWe find from papers to hand by last mail that Pere Andre has been creating, or trying to create, a very strong impression of sympathy on behalf of the Metis, and rose in election at Riel's. This conduct on the part of Pere Andre by no means surprises us, who know the reverend gentleman pretty well. We have always had the impression that this gentleman was actually in sympathy with the rebellion, simply because we credited him with enough of common sense and common honesty to know how it all ended. Nevertheless, we must protest to everyone who witnessed the excellent Father's not very successful attempts to conceal his character, by supposing that his lack of knowledge and experience of the fighting at Duck Lake and at Fish Creek, that his active sympathies were with the individuals although perhaps not with the movement. It is unfortunate that here again the good Father attempts to throw the whole blame of the conduct of the Metis on the Government with the eloquent division of the blame himself assured us he had addressed to the Metis previously before they had actually broken out, in order to convince them of their folly in talking of their grievances and rights. The contempt which upon these occasions he by his and others' speeches showed toward the whites is vastly before us. The worthy Father has evidently seen reason to change his position pretty frequently. At one time when Riel and his followers repudiated the authority of the crown they were very emphatically wrong, with regard to everything. Since then, according to him, the whole fault lay with Riel individually, and a little later it was transferred to man and Mr. White, who in his absence from the town, has known what it is to have it in very close connection with the exercise of state economy, will think better to know that it has been shifted from them to the Government.\n\nSPAIN.\n\nMadrid, Oct. 17\u2014The epidemics from all the infected districts of Spain show that on Saturday there were reported 2,167 new cases of cholera and 770 deaths.\n\nGeneral Martorell Compares Foreign War, in an interview with the Associated Press, to the delay in delaying his return to Madrid. He thought the King should have returned at the conclusion of the war with Germany and that the time lost afforded the revolutionists an opportunity to invite the French to send an army, he said, most good war at all hazards.\n\nThe universal opinion here is that the bat will fall shortly to the discontented Count Julian. Meanwhile, the German Minister, justifies the hope of a speedy amicable settlement of the Carlist dispute.\n\nST. PAUL.\n\nSt. Paul, Oct. 17\u2014The nearest food of the season fell in Southern Minnesota, Iowa and Western Wisconsin Saturday morning, in some places ice forming.

Irvine to the citizens of Macleod, on Tuesday evening, was a brilliant gathering. It was very well attended, and I believe there have been before it, and the spirit of enthusiasm which prevailed throughout must have been very great in view of the grandeur of the evening. In the course of his speech the Colonel said: \"At the time we were looking for Major Middleton, I received a message from the Indians coming with 350 men, and that 1,000 were following them who would attack Batoche and that I could combine with him, and attack at the same time. I thought, if he went to Batoche with that number, he would be able to hold out so I sent him a message telling him what I thought. I also told him that I would like to see him come down this day from and combine with him in attacking the rebels. In the meantime, Batoche and another band came to combine with me. They told me that they had some 1,300 men, four pounds and a gathering. They then told me that General Government had ordered me to remain at Prince Albert and look out for enemy bands. I told them to use a warlike expression, saying that they would not fly worth a cent. I said that I would like very much to join them, but the reply was that they could not. General Middleton's place was to be at Batoche the following Sunday. I went out with the party, and when we got there the scouts went up to the river, but we could get no word, so we returned to Prince Albert. Then they say to-day he could not get any news. Finally, he heard that General Middleton had been attacked and had lost so many that he could not report. He then went across by the Hudson Bay ferry. He remained where he was for a week. It has since been learned that he was killed. I did not hear of that fight until six days after it had taken place, and the first full account of it appeared in the Winnipeg papers at Prince Albert. After General Middleton received the news at Fish Creek, I noticed a great change in certain bands, and half broke away from Prince Albert. One tribe went out and joined Lord Strathcona. The others, too, were very anxious to get back to their own people. There were Indians on every side of us, and in the town itself were many who had been captured by the host Prince Albert, but the key of the whole situation. When we heard that the troops were coming, we thought we think we would have time to get there, and subsequently found we were correct. In fact, our only fear was that if we should be obliged to fight, we should be unable to help the town, and consequently, ambushed would not be justified in doing otherwise. I am very sorry to have been able to do nothing to prevent the disaster. Among them were some of the finest men in the country. When the troops came, they were very anxious to have that we should send out against the Indians, and I went to the General and asked him if he would allow me to take a few men to assist. He said that it was impossible that we should remain at Prince Albert, to be used as hostages. I made another appeal, an important point that he would send another regiment there. The General answered that Prince Albert was a field hospital, and that he could not send more troops equipped and mounted. However, he promised to send a few men. I have never personally, however, seen so well fitted Prince Albert, and the troops were very well fitted. The result was the opportunity we had of seeing the best equipment of any military force ever assembled. At least, even more than the Indians. Middleton, however, was very anxious to get the men back, and he sent out a few men, and they were very well equipped and mounted. That was probably the reason why the Indians were so badly handled. That was probably the reason why the Indians were so badly handled.\n\nNORTH-WEST NOTES.\n\nWINNIPEG.\n\nWinnipeg, Sept. 8.\u2014Factor McLean, of the H. R. C., left here yesterday on a visit to Fort Alexander. He has been placed in charge of that post, and will remain there until the end of October. He leaves for Regina this morning, where he will be called upon in the trial of Big Bear and other Indians.\n\nThe Dominion lands board have recently made a new order in reference to land claims. Under this order, land held under a second homestead right if they are within a distance of two miles of the first settlement. The effect of this order is to prevent persons having more than one claim paid for the first homestead claim taken up within the immediate vicinity.\n\nMr. J. H. Killen a wealthy farmer from Indiana, made a tour through Manitou last week, to spy out the land with a view to starting a cattle range. This cattle industry was so prosperous in the prairie states at one time that the quota sold in Canada was $2,000,000 worth at $400 per head. They are an exceedingly pretty little animal, with long silky wool, an average fleece weighing six pounds.\n\nRATTLEFORD.\n\nFrom the Remit.\n\nRattleford, Aug. 21.\u2014A few days ago a party of police arrested the Cree chief, Mr. John Hill, and charged him with killing a man on the road. Only half a dozen women were at home, and they were not able to tell where the man was.\n\nMail before last the closure for supplies was received at Rattleford, in connection with the North-West Field Force came to hand, and last week Major Cremer paid out large sums of money to the various contractors engaged in the steamer department. The steamer arrived on Wednesday last at the mouth of the Saskatchewan River, and Battery to Swift Current. The troops, however, have not been paid another month's wages, the troops from the north west people would be putting the money they would do most good.\n\nDuring the discussion regarding about the rate of pay to be allowed, the Battle River force have not yet been paid off. Major Cremer refused to make the adjustment, and so the matter stands.\n\nGENERAL NEWS.\n\nGREAT BRITAIN.\n\nLondon, Sept. 4.\u2014There were fully 15,000 spectators at the first race in the meeting at the Lilley Bridge Athletic Grounds. It is stated that 16,000 spectators turned out, having forced their way past the ticket-takers at the various gates, particularly at the main entrance on the Bromham road, where the crowd from 3 o'clock p.m. was tremendous. The enthusiasm of the large crowds, and the jubilation of the gentle- men from the city knew no bounds when the first race was over, and the excitement was kept up all through the track, of 8 minutes 17.5 seconds. By this achievement he beat his own record by two tenths of a second, and only failed by one and two-tenths seconds of breaking the record.\n\nBUFFALO.\n\nBuffalo, N. Y., Sept. 6.\u2014A committee from the Chamber of Commerce has been appointed to examine the condition of passengers and baggage along the Great Western Trail. The local boards of trade of the cities visited will grant that no action can be taken without it is authorized by a full state board.\n\nNEW YORK.\n\nNew York, Sept. 7.\u2014The local races at the Saratoga Race Course, near Saratoga Springs, New York, were attended by a large number of spectators. The races were run over the course, and the horses were very well matched. Both Lee and Hardin claimed fourths, but the referee did not change the positions.\n\nJAMES SINCLAIR\n\nMerchan Tailor,\n\nAND DEALER IN\n\nGENTS' FURNISHINGS.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW.\n\n$2 50 PER ANNUM.\n\nThe Times is the best medium in the Territory to advertise your business in.\n\nSubscribe for The Times and get the latest news and happenings around town.\n\nJOB PRINTING\n\nOf all descriptions done neatly, quickly and cheaply.\n\nJ. D. MAVEETY, PUBLISHER AND PROPRIETOR\n\n3RD ST., PRINCE ALBERT, SASK\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nTHAT LETTER\n\nTo the Editor of the Times.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. MacKenzie's unsolicited denial in your last issue of my statement in reference to the letter which he wrote to me for father for him induces me to give you a few words in regard to the affair than I should otherwise have done.\n\nThe letter in question was brought to my notice by Mr. Monger, who desired me to publish it in the Prince Albert Times. On his appearance at my residence, I refused to have anything to do with the dirty job, giving my reasons; I thought it seemed to me to be a very improper thing which I could not prove had I desired to do so, against a man who was absent from the country and thus unable to defend himself.\n\nHe also took it to Mr. J. L. Johnson, and after reading the whole or parts of it to him, asked me if I would consent to have it published for him. This attempt like all others was unsuccessful, hence the reason for my refusal.\n\nIn conclusion, I would say that though I regret the necessity of connecting Mr. Johnson's name with the affair, Mr. Monger's conduct was most unbecoming a man to whom he had intrusted such a document. I am sure that those who are happy are unacquainted with Monger's character. Thanking you for the space afforded.\n\nI am yours truly,\n\nJ. C. MACKENZIE.\n\nTHE OTHER SIDE.\n\nHalf-breed Land Claimants to Have had Nothing to Do with the Rebellion\u2014Statement that Dumont was \"well Fixed\" Denied.\n\nMr. MacKenzie's statement, which appeared in the Globe, from a source which he has identified as \"Confederate,\" that the Government was about to arrest the half-breeds, and that the half-breeds were the prime movers in the rebellion, was promptly denied by Mr. Piercy, who officially known as superintendent of mines, but who is really in charge of the half-breeds generally, arrived here on Wednesday, and in the course of conversation gave us the following facts which will publish.\n\nReferring to the statement which places that Fisher could not get his entry, Mr. Piercy says that this is not so. That all the half-breeds who came here were notified previous to the rebellion that they could gain land entries, and that there was plenty of land available for settlement purposes for their homesteads. Anyone who had settled before July 1, 1879, was entitled to an entry, and the land was available at $2 an acre, subsequent to that date at $3 an acre. But the way in which the half-breeds settled was such as to prevent them from doing so in many cases.\n\nAnother grievance of the half-breeds was that they were told that Mr. Piercy would not give them entries. Mr. Piercy says that this is not so. That all the half-breeds who came here were notified previous to the rebellion that they could gain land entries, and that there was plenty of land available for settlement purposes for their homesteads. Anyone who had settled before July 1, 1879, was entitled to an entry, and the land was available at $2 an acre, subsequent to that date at $3 an acre.\n\nBut the way in which the half-breeds settled was such as to prevent them from doing so in many cases.\n\nMr. Piercy denies the statement of our correspondent that Gabriel Dumont was well fixed at the time of the rebellion. At this juncture Mr. Piercy said he could not get cash for $1 worth.\n\nThe statement that forty-two squires, led by Lieutenant at Battle River, is also contradicted. Mr. Piercy does not know of any settlement at Battle River which forty-two, even twenty, owing\n\nHARDWARE!\n\nNails, Tar Paper,\nGlass (all sizes), Putty,\nWhite Lead, Paint Oil,\nMachine Oil, Turpentine,\nPlastering Hair, steam refined,\nPowder, Shot, Caps,\nShells, Etc., Etc.\n\nWe keep none but first-class goods.
