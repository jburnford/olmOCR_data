He has suggested however that he would prefer to have an extra pony panel installed on main switch board in bakery, this panel not to have separate switches on circuits. He suggests that basement circuits #9 - 10 - 22 - and 24 and ground floor circuits #6 - 7 and 8 be fed from this panel. These circuits are all controlled from wall switches in various rooms and some confusion may arise should someone switch off these circuits in error if they are fed from panels as shown on plan. He also points out that if these circuits are fed from a panel mounted at service panel the runs would be shorter and therefore less possibility of drop in voltage due to line loss.\n\nShould the suggestions of Inspector as outlined above meet with your approval we would be prepared to make this change at no extra charge.\n\nWe would appreciate an early reply in this matter as work is progressing rapidly on building and we would like to get cabinets for panels on order so that we may have them on hand to build in walls as walls go up.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nO.

I hope, however, we not have any more expense with them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith, please find account from Flockhart Bros. for the amount of $145.73 representing expenses for repairs of furnace of chapel. I may say that this chapel has always been used by our pupils, and is not maintained by any other congregation. A few weeks ago, I had to inspect the furnace, and found that unless immediate repairs were made there would be great danger of the chapel being destroyed by fire. I therefore got in a man, who said the furnace was useless, and that a new fire box etc., would be required. There was nothing for it but to have it done. The cost is more than I reckoned on, but the work has been well done.\n\nI am forwarding the account to you with the hope that you will pay it. Or if the department cannot pay it all, would they kindly consider paying part, and I will see if I can get the balance from my staff.\n\nAs I have said above, the chapel has always been used entirely by the pupils of Shingwauk Home, and I don't think the department has ever before been asked to stand the expenses of repairs. I managed, soon after I came to Shingwauk to collect about $500.00 for a new roof, but I doubt if I could collect the amount required to meet the enclosed bill.\n\nWill you kindly give this matter your best consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Orr,\n\nThe actual size of cold storage room as per plans is 3'3\" by 10'6\", the width 3'3\" seems to be very narrow and I am of the opinion that it will not be of very much practical value for an institution of this size.\n\nThis matter was taken up by the contractor myself and the Rev. Mr Hives, and would suggest that the width be increased at least 18 or 20 inches, so as to give them a little more working space.\n\nNo provision has been made in the electrical contract for an outlet to run motor of unit.\n\nKindly let me know if this suggestion for the change meets with your approval and what capacity of electrical outlet will be required for motor and where best located.\n\nThe contractor is sending in his regular monthly estimate today, and the Rev.

My wife, in particular, seems to get quite a kick out of it. She has tried to draw it, and has got it pretty well furnished. It is surprising how cheaply one can richly furnish a house by drawing on the Bank of Imagination. The only thing she seems to see wrong is that it appears to be just a little cramped. I really think if the length was given two feet and two feet on to the width, it would be very much better. What do you think of this? I don't want to leave it until it is finished before speaking, and I don't want to spoil anything by being selfish. But we have other people to think of beside ourselves, and it seems to me we find it that way more than we did in the north.\n\nThings are progressing very well in the building. It is greatly admired by all who see it, and quite a lot of people come down to look it over.\n\nKindest regards, and don't think we are ungrateful. We are extremely conscious of having received a lot.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fitzpatrick, for the terrazzo work of the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., we desire the following information. What color or colors of marble aggregates with the percentage of each color to be used in the terrazzo floors.\n\nYour specification calls for a mix of one to four of Silica Sand and 40% crushed marble. The standard specifications demand that 80% to 90% marble shall show in the surface of the finished floor and this result could not be obtained with the above specification.\n\nWe take the liberty of submitting the specification generally used on high class work, for your approval, which we propose to use.\n\nOn the concrete slab or under floor lay and tamp one to four cement and sand concrete bed within 3/4\" of the finished surface. In this bed insert the brass stops as specified. When this concrete underbed has sufficiently set to permit rolling, cover the floor with a wet mix consisting of two bags marble chips to one bag Portland Cement, approximately 3/4\" thick; roll in two directions with a heavy roller forcing the surplus cement grout to the surface and remove with a broom; when the surplus cement is all extracted trowel off. When the floor has hardened sufficiently to permit grinding, grind with floor machines using #40 grit carborundum stones until 80% or 90% of the marble aggregate shows in the finished surface. Grout well with neat cement rubbing same into any voids and let the grout set thoroughly then finish grinding with #60, or finer stones if necessary, to the required fine finish.\nJanuary 24th, 1935.\n\nPlease be kind enough to advise us if you approve of this method which, as we said before, is the recognized specification for the terrazzo work.\n\nIf possible, we would like to have you provide us with a blueprints of the floors where our work exists.\n\nNot having a specification, we note from our estimate that there is no terrazzo cove base at the walls for any of the floors. This could be provided about 6\" high at Forty-five Cents per lineal foot if required, giving an easily cleaned sanitary job at the junction of the floor and walls.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE ITALIAN MOSAIC & MARBLE CO.

The contractor claims that this work is only a wainscoting job, 4 feet high throughout.\n\nKindly let me know if this is the intention of the specifications, or if it means that the corridor walls only have to be painted up to a height of 4 feet, and the other rooms, the entire surface of walls from floor to ceiling.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSupervising Architect,\nOttawa, April 29, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Hives,\n\nYou may arrange for the employment of three labourers to do the necessary cleaning up and grading around the new building.

The cost of the fuel for the season will amount to approximately $1,200, depending of course on weather conditions.\n\nSeveral minor changes in the interior of the building were asked for by the Reverend Principal during the course of construction. The cost of these changes together with the connecting up to the City water supply system and the existing sewage disposal system, the installing of a new power line from the City main to the school and other incidental expenses will cost approximately $2,800.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nAs you know, the 21st of June was the date, more or less set for the opening of the new school. I have been wondering if this date will be convenient, or if you would rather it were postponed until the Fall, say September. I can't see that it will make any difference to us, and it might be more convenient for you. Will you please let me know, if possible, by return of mail.\n\nA member of the Commission is coming tomorrow, and I would like to let him know while he is here.\n\nThere is quite a lot to be done in the way of fixtures, and getting in the furniture, and it all takes time. For my part, I would rather see it completed before the opening, and I would like to see us occupying it at the opening.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nR.

If we can do the work I would like, it will certainly be a beautiful front. In front of the building, and in line with the second flight of steps, we have made a terrace. This I am sowing with lawn grass seed, and it should be looking green in a month's time. Then there are to be a few beds of flowers on the top of the terrace.\n\nWill you kindly send me an accountable cheque for the amount of $300.00 dollars. This should take care of everything, excepting the fencing. If we could have fifty dollars to buy fencing, I think we can make a very nice looking job.\n\nThe sewer discharge will have to taken care of, and should be done before we fix up the ground in front. If you would like me to attend to this, I could do so. I have had experience in the construction of septic tank, and could look after it if you think it would save money.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. C. F. Hives\nPrincipal\n\nR.

Where this residence joins on the school building it will leave two exposed walls, which should have suitable capping to properly protect the walls. There is also a stairway from the residence that will be left exposed, when the roof of the main building is taken off and this should be enclosed and covered.\n\nI propose to make these alterations satisfactory to the principal for the sum of $145.00.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nJ.

MARIE, Ont.,  \nDecember 20, 1935.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI hereby propose to demolish the old Shingwauk Indian Residential School at Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., in accordance with your specifications. I am prepared to start work immediately on acceptance of my proposal and completing the work by May 15th, 1936. Due to uncertain weather conditions it is not practical to take the roof off or to start tearing down the walls until our heavy snow storms are over, approximately March 15th, but would have all the interior of the building stripped except joists and rough floors by March 15th, so that the work could be completed as specified.\n\nI have been in the contracting business for the past twenty-five years and have had considerable experience in wrecking of large buildings, in fact I have wrecked practically all of the larger buildings in this district, for such companies as the Algoma Steel Corporation, Union Carbide Company and the Spanish River Paper Mills.\n\nI will complete the job in a workmanship manner, retaining all the salvage from the building for myself and you to pay me $125.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. Bernardi\n\nP.S.\n\nIn case the contract should be awarded to me, will you let me know if there is any insurance on the building.\nJan 6, 1936.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Allen.\n\nAttached hereto is a cheque for $500 which has been submitted as deposit security by J.

Chas. F. Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Indian Residential School,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nPlease wire me if I am correct that pipe from Pine Street is three inch and from road to school two inch also advise where water meter is located.\n\nR. Gurney Orr.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 5)\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nYou asked me to let you know how the water is working since the change was made. The enclosed chart will speak for itself. It is not very satisfactory, and I am afraid we shall have trouble with it until a larger main pipe is laid. I have had one of the city water men down, and he also is convinced that we have not the volume in the three inch main that we should have to maintain a steady pressure.\n\nI went to see the Superintendent of the City Water Commission, and he is very anxious to see a six inch water main laid down to us. This would cost quite a sum of money. The pipe itself would cost one dollar per foot, and the distance is nearly five thousand feet. Then there would be the digging and the back filling. I am quite sure the city would not stand all the expense, but do you suppose the Department would help them. Mr Gormell is anxious to do something in the matter, and would like to know if they could co-operate with us over the matter.\n\nAnother thing, the present pipe has been in for over thirty years, and it is not a galvanized iron pipe, and so I think there is great danger of it bursting, and giving us trouble that way. I have spoken to men who are more or less expert in that matter, and they feel there is great danger of this.\n\nI am enclosing accounts we went through while you were here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr R.

If the laundry room was warmer there would not be the amount of condensation as it present. I will take the matter up with the Canadian Laundry Machine Company and see what they advise.\n\nWith reference to the steam pipes connecting the radiators in the sun room, you may arrange to have these changed and placed above the floor to prevent further trouble.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th I would say that an amount not exceeding $75.00 can be found for the moving of the greenhouse, but as funds are nearly exhausted this amount should not be exceeded.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

MARIE, ONT.\n\nFeb. 12, 1936.\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nI am looking forward to making something worth while of the front of Shingwauk this Spring, and have a good showing of flowers. I am anxious to have my greenhouse supply the necessary flower plants, but it will have to be moved from where it now stands. To do this, I shall have to take it to pieces, and the frame is quite rotten, and will have to be renewed. I can do the work of building it if I have the material. The material will cost $75.00, and I am wondering if you could do anything for me in paying for the material. I have tried to show to you how it really is part of the building programme. But in order to get it working in time, I should get at rebuilding right away.\n\nWill you please see if you can crowd it in. I know you must think I am a pig, but I am really thinking about the work, and quite a lot about your work.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R. Gurney Orr,\narchitect,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa.\nSHINGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nFeb. II, 1936\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nThere are two things I would like to bring to your notice. One is the laundry business. The fan has been installed, but it is of little or no value, and the steam continues to be terrible. I really believe if a galvanized hood was made to fit over above the washer, and to discharge outside with the fan on the end of it, it would answer the purpose, and do what we require in ridding the place of the steam. I am afraid of it at the present time. The girls get very wet, and then go out into the cold, and it is not good for them.\n\nThe other thing concerns the sunroom. The steam pipes connected with the radiators there, as well as the returns are in between the ceiling and the floor, and as you know, the entrance is open. These pipes got frozen up during the last cold weather, and the radiators were burst. I have had them disconnected, and plugged, so they are not now in commission. If it is your wish that they should be put into order again, and I think they should, the pipes should be changed from between the ceiling and the floor, and brought above the floor. In that way, I do not think they will give any trouble.\n\nWill you please let me know what you wish in these matters.\n\nOur weather has been very cold. The longest cold snap I have experienced here, but the building has been wonderful.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. C. F. Hives\nPrincipal.\n\nR. Gurney Orr Esq.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nThe plumber is tracing out the water pipe lines in the plans you sent to me, but I am enclosing the information you asked for in connection with the proposed water cushion tank. You will note that the shower room is on the other side of the wall. I suppose you would not consider putting the tank in there.\n\nI have just mailed a picture of Shingwauk ancient and modern to you. I think it is a very interesting picture, and shows fairly clearly what the place can be developed into, after the old building is removed. It really is too bad we could not pull down that old barn right away, and yet we cannot until a new one is built. You will try and get us a new barn in your supplementary, also a root cellar and garage?\n\nI called at the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co., and they said they thought the only way to do away with the steam trouble is to increase the radiation. This can be done quite simply. The two radiators will allow for quite an increase without changing the pipes, and another one of the same size can be put under the middle window. Will you please let me know if I am to have this work done.\n\nOur sickness seems to be disappearing, and I sincerely hope we shall soon be clear.\n\nThe Bank of Montreal manager called me up this morning asking if the Imperial Radio Co. had been paid. I guess they are owing them money.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nR. Gurney Orr Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The first item is for 390 feet of Clear Cypress rafters at nine cents per foot.\n\nThe pressure reducing valves have come, and now I am wondering if they are to be installed right away, or if there is a tank coming also, and also, where are they supposed to be installed. I notice they are one inch valves. Are they to be installed in the main, which is a two inch pipe. (I have just been down to see what size the pipe is between the main and the water jacket heater, and I find this is a one inch pipe, so I expect that is the place where one valve is to be installed.\n\nThey are getting along nicely with the wrecking.

F. Hives\nPrincipal\n\nR. Gurney Orr Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nI am enclosing several accounts to you for payment. I am afraid you will think there is no end to them, though I hope they are tailing off, and just as soon as we get the high pressure water problem adjusted, I think things will be alright. As it is, I am afraid of getting high blood pressure, for it is kind of nerve racking not knowing just when something is going to break loose. Today, I have been putting in a new gasket in the steam cooling coil. I thought I would rather do it myself than get the plumber, for I really don't think he knows much. Anyway I got it done, and it is tight, and that's more than he has done.\n\nThere are two accounts pinned together, one for $53.84 from Soo Lumber, and one for $20.69 from Gochrane Hardware. These are for greenhouse material. Dunseath & McClary $20.60 for thawing out and uncoupling radiators in Sunroom, and several other things in connection with water. O.C. Carney $66.20 for exhaust fan for laundry.\n\nWe are finished with the Scarlet bug I hope, and we have been busy fumigating from top to bottom, so you don't need to fear coming around when you can find time to come. I shall look forward to seeing some house plans before long, but I also hope to get in a little holiday this year.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr R.

You will be interested to know how it works out. I am glad to say we think it is a success. There is a fairly steady pressure of 50 pounds, and it never goes beyond that. It drops back to 30 lbs when water is drawn, but I don't think there is much if any injury being done to the plumbing now. The plumber has done very good work, and I think he has been honest in his charges.\n\nI am also enclosing Bernardi's account. He has now finished his job, and it remains for us to make a decent looking front of it.\n\nCould you manage to get us $160.00 for an iron flag pole. I have been getting a price on one complete with cement base. Pole made of iron pipe five inches at base and three inches at top. We should have one in front on the bottom level, so if you possibly can allow me to spend that amount, I will see that a good job is done.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr R.

MARIE, ONT.\n\nMay 7, 1936\n\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the end of last fiscal year I wrote you re. fencing required around the new school. A certain amount of new fencing is required, and much of the old fencing needs to be renewed. I was to bring this matter up again after the beginning of the present year.\n\nI have made a careful estimate of the cost of new fencing and repairing, and find it will cost in the neighbourhood of $250.00.\n\nWill you kindly refer this matter to the Department, asking them to consider it as soon as possible so that I may get the work done while we have time for that kind of work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Gordon Sims,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing letter received from the principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School which is self-explanatory.\n\nI might say that a request was made for this fencing last January, when the Department advised me to bring this matter to their attention in the early spring.\n\nI would recommend that this request be granted. If possible, I shall purchase the 300 fence posts required from the Indians on the Garden River Indian Reserve.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 11th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home, requesting an expenditure of, approximately, $250 for a new fence.\n\nPlease inform Reverend Mr. Hives that no provision has been made in the current year's appropriation for this expenditure and, therefore, it is not possible to authorize the erection of the fence. While this is, no doubt, needed, it will have to wait until next year.\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has endeavoured to treat this school very generously during the past year and, as our funds are limited, the Shingwauk Home will have to wait for further improvements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Please do not misunderstand that we are asking you or the department to pay this, but are merely sending it for your inspection. They claim they had several calls to your institution to take care of this defect, which after investigation was found to be no fault of the Lyons Hardware, nor Dunseath & McClary, nor the manufacturer of the goods. This being the case, if the department should pay for this, please look over the situation, and at your convenience, when up-town, we would be glad to discuss this matter with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLYONS FUEL, HARDWARE & SUPPLIES\n\nA.B.

MARIE, ONT.\n\nJune 23, 1936.\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a bill attached to a letter received from Lyons Fuel and Hardware. This explains quite a bit, but my own opinion is that the plumbers, Dunneath and McClary, are the responsible people. For although they did good plumbing in the ordinary, yet they failed to cope with the difficulty that was causing the trouble. They failed on account of technical knowledge, and it was left to us to work our the difficulty. Therefore, I am of the opinion that the responsibility belongs to the plumbers.\n\nI would be obliged if you would pass your decision on it. If you are willing to take care of it, please return the bill, and I will have it made out properly.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.

You went forget about the sleeping porch above the veranda, and let me have a plan to get his price. I wonder if you would let us have a cement wall around the coal bin instead of the shiplap walls. The cost would be $35.00, and I think it would pay. Coal dust gets through the lumber walls so badly, and gives so much work in the way of cleaning up. If you could kindly let me know about this as soon as possible, they could run the cement while the basement walls are being run.\n\nI hope you are able to get us a barn this fall. I'll sure work hard at it.\n\nI am sending you a list of what paint we require for the school building.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.

Kindly have this done and return the contracts.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nJohn McLeod, Esq.,\nGeneral Contractor,\nSault Ste Marie, Ontario.\nSept. 15, 1936.\n\nHonourable the Superintendent General,\n\nIn accordance with your instructions plans are being prepared for a new combined cow and horse barn required for the Shingwauk Indian Residential School at Sault Ste Marie, Ont.,\n\nFunds were not specifically provided for this project, but if you approve the cost of same can be charged to the item in the Special Supplementary Estimates which provides for assistance to building projects relating to Indian administration, Vote 317.\n\nIf this is done it may be necessary to transfer a portion of the funds provided for the agency buildings at Fort Norman to this general item.\n\nThe cost of the proposed new barn will be approximately $6,000.00.\n\nThe Principal of the School has offered to assist with his equipment and staff in the erection of this building, and under these circumstances the most economical way of erecting the building would be by day labour. If the building is to be erected this fall it will be necessary to commence work within the next couple of weeks, and if you approve of its erection as above outlined I would ask if it would be satisfactory for the Architect of the Department to consult Mr. E. B. Hamilton, R.P., of Sault Ste Marie for all labour and materials required.\n\nR. G. G.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJOHN McLEOD\nGENERAL CONTRACTOR\nSAULT STE.

I have figured it as shown on plan, with hardwood floors same as in house, a glazed door between it and bed room. Inside to be your choice of fir 2x4's oiled and varnished, or pine 6 ft painted. Shingles on outside walls to be stained and other trim painted.\n\nIf built open as on plan, price $155.00\nIf glassed in with double hung sash, front divided in four windows, add. $25.00\n\nYour truly,\nJohn McLeod\nSHINGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nSept. 14, 1936\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nI enclose herewith a price from the contractor for the building of the sleeping porch over the veranda. I hope you will be able to sanction the building of it, with the windows. It would certainly add a great deal to the house, and it seems to me that it would be of very little use without the windows.\n\nWe had a visit from Mr McNicol, member in Ottawa for a Toronto division. He looked over the school, and was very pleased with it. He looked over the plans of the house, and was very upset because it had warm air heating. He wanted to know who was the architect, and thinks you don't know much to allow warm air heating in a modern house.\n\nThe work is going very nicely in spite of the wet weather, and we sure are having a daze of it now.\n\nPlease let me know about the sleeping porch, and I know you will do your best to give us a favourable reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nChas.

Gurney Orr.\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. C. F. Rives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Indian Res School,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nSHINGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nSept. 23, 1936.\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nThere are one or two I would like to place before you. The first is in regard to the laundry tubs, which are located at the front of the basement on the plans. That location places them right under the warm air pipes, and one would have to stop under the smoke pipe to get to them. May they be changed to the rear of the basement. This would involve an extra expense of $17.00.\n\nThe attached cut of kitchen sink is the one specified for the kitchen. Don't you think the Department could afford one with a draining board, at least. I have pinned two others under, with their prices. Would you kindly try and get us one of these instead. Preferably the one underneath. The one that is specified does not look like your choosing at all.\n\nI expect they will have the roof on this week. They are doing pretty well, but he is not in the same class as Fitz. He has to be watched too much.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr R.

I would not want to start this work in the spring because I have another contract that I will have to finish up as soon as the weather permits, and would like to do this work now, while I have the time. There is not much to be salvaged from this building, but I am willing to do it at this time in order to help out some of the unemployed here.\n\nPlease let me know at once if this proposition meets with favourable consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

MARIE, ONT.\n\nJan. 21, 1937.\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nI had a look-see at these wonderful plans of the new school at Moosonee, and really must say, I don't like them. Whoever heard of a girl's playroom in the attic, alongside of the sewingroom. It will be a terrible business supervising girls way up there, and then, all the clothing has to be carried from the laundry up to the sewingroom in the attic. I understand also that there is a low partition between the little girl's and little boys' dormitory. I think they are looking for trouble. I may be wrong, but the plans don't attract me at all.\n\nCanen Gould informs me that they are deciding to go ahead with them.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Don't you think you could get the plans and have them looked over, and if necessary criticise them and if proper, condemn them. The Department has it in its power to do so.\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th inst., I am sorry that the Ochranes Dunlop Co., account is not satisfactory, but I tried to get a boiler at the West End Hardware, and they had not anything of that nature in. I was anxious to get into the house, and perhaps hurried a little more than I should have done, and got it from a firm that had it in stock. In regard to the automatic control, which was $25 extra, an ordinary switch control was specified, but this should have been installed before the plastering was done so that it could have been operated in the kitchen, as you knew, although it is the Principal's residence, it has always been my policy to try and work in as many of the girls as possible in the way of giving them a training as domestics. I have heard that switch controls have been left on by different people here in the city, and that ruined tanks have been the results. By having the automatic control, I felt that this danger would be eliminated, even though one of the girls did happen to be left in charge. I am enclosing a statement from the Ochranes Dunlop Co., with the charge for automatic control taken off. If it is your wish that the enclosed should replace the one formerly sent, I shall be glad to look after the automatic, for I feel very much safer with it.\n\nI have made several inquiries regarding the electric range, and find that the oven control is standard equipment in ranges with even one side.\n\nI hope this explains matters sufficiently.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr R.

The playrooms, bathrooms, washrooms, toilets, and hall way in the basement have all received a three coat job, and look exceedingly improved. They are so much lighter and more cheerful, but better still, they are so much more sanitary.\n\nThis is a good time of the year to paint, as it is more or less a slack time. I would like very much to have the same job done on the dormitory walls, as well as the dining room. We have had quite a lot of sickness during the last year. We started with Scarlet Fever, Tuberculosis meningitis, Measles, Chicken pox, and just recently the Flu. I feel it would be the best way of putting the building into a sanitary condition by painting the walls of the dormitories, so that they can be washed down after these epidemics, which are liable to come to us at any time.\n\nI estimate that $150.00 would be required to buy paint for this work, and we would do the work of painting ourselves. Will you kindly consider this matter, and if possible, allow us to continue this work of painting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. F.

Pratt\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 5)\nThe Honourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Crerar,-\n\nSome thirty years ago or more, the Department of Indian Affairs constructed a water-main from the easterly limits of the City, to the Shingwauk Home, a distance of approximately one mile. The main is a 3\" wrought-iron pipe line and the City delivers water to the Shingwauk Home at the commencement of the line and charges on a meter basis for the water used. For the last year or so, complaints have been made as to the condition of the main and breaks and leaks which have occurred, with the result that both the Public Utilities Commission, who supplies the water service, and the Superintendent of the Home, the Rev. Mr. Hives, are of the opinion that it will be necessary to replace the present main with a new one. The Public Utilities Commission, which I will refer to hereafter as the City, at the present time are servicing no customers east of the Shingwauk Home and only three along the mile 3\" line laid by the Department as stated. The City can serve a number of cottagers east of the Home and over a period of years, no doubt, other customers would be secured and give some revenue to the City. The suggestion has been made that for the necessary water service to the Home and especially better fire protection, having in mind the modern building and home that has been built, the Government and the Public Utilities Commission might co-operate in sharing the expense of a new line, making it of 6\" cast-iron pipe which would give a hydrant with two 3\" connections for fire service at the Home and the said water supply available at the usual consumers rates for the home requirements. Mr. Cornell, of the Public Utilities Commission, suggests sharing the expense of purchasing materials and laying the main, which at $2.00 per foot for about a mile of line, would cost in the neighbourhood of $10,500.00.\n\nI am writing this letter to you in advance of some day, in the near future, discussing this proposal with you. I think, undoubtedly, within the next year or so, the Home will be compelled to make some arrangement to take care of its water supply service and that any such proposals should be canvassed to see the best method of working this matter out.\n\nAs the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 5)\nAs the Home takes the water on a meter basis, with meter at the City end of the Shingwauk pipe line, the leaks that have been occurring involve water loss being paid for by the Home.\n\nOn January 31st, 1933, the Minister of Marine entered into an Agreement with the Public Utilities Commission for the supply of water to the Wireless Station here. The nature of the Agreement was that the Government was to contribute $4,000.00 towards the construction of a water-main to the wireless and if and when the City was reimbursed by way of local improvement tax for the cost connected with the construction, the Government should be reimbursed in the ratio that the $4,000.00 bore to the total costs. As a matter of fact, to date, this City does not levy a local improvement tax for water-mains although it does with reference to sewers and sidewalks. Some such arrangement might be worked out with reference to the proposed construction to the Shingwauk Home.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) H. S. Hamilton.\n\nHSH/MB\nOttawa, May 6th, 1937.\n\nDear Colonel Hamilton:\n\nIn the absence of my Minister, Mr. Crerar, I am directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 28th, with reference to the construction of a new water main from the easterly limits of Sault Ste. Marie to the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nThe information contained in your letter has been noted and will be further considered when funds are available to make new arrangements for the water supply at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nColonel H.

This item was for addition of a sleeping porch to residence and was a contract. In your reply of April 24th, you said you had no record of me having submitted an account for this work.\n\nIf you will look up my final statement dated about Jan 11th, you will see that an account for this work is included but I did not send an itemized bill for it as it was a straight contract.\n\nYou said in your letter if I would send a statement certified by me then the bill would be paid.

Marie, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are trying to clean up around the grounds surrounding the school building, and we are finding it an almost hopeless job with the boys we have in school. Our boys are small, and quite unable to do the heavy work required, and yet we are expected to make the grounds looking in keeping with the beautiful building the Department have given us. There are a tremendous lot of very heavy rocks to contend with, and very much grading to be done. The old building is away, but the place where it stood, which is directly in front of the new building, has to be leveled, and this can only be done by man power and horse or tractor. We have worked hard, and I assure you I would not bother you with this matter if we could handle it ourselves.\n\nWill you kindly place this situation before the Department and ask them if they would kindly help us. I can look after the work, but I am afraid to let the boys do the heavy lifting that must be done. I estimate that three hundred dollars would pay for what should be done, and put the grounds in keeping with the building.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr Gordon H.

However, the account of $120.00, in favour of John McLeod, for the erection of the sleeping porch at the Principal's residence, arrived too late to be paid out of our appropriation for the last fiscal year. It, therefore, had to be paid from our current year's appropriation. This reduced the amount that can be allowed to the Shingwauk School to $120.00.\n\nYou may, therefore, inform Reverend Mr. Hives that the Department will allow the sum of $120.00 to assist him in cleaning up the school grounds. A pay list, in triplicate, should be kept. If you desire it, the Department will forward you an accountable cheque for $120.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H.

II, 1937\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere is very much need of paint on various parts of the interior of our school. After it was built, the architect said it should be painted in two years. The walls of the two dining rooms and the walls of the dormitories and laundry should all have a three coat paint job. The walls of the playrooms were painted last Winter, and they should be coated again.\n\nI estimate that the necessary paint would cost about two hundred dollars, and we could do the work ourselves.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Department, and ask them if a grant can be made this Fall toward doing this important work.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing for your consideration a request from Rev. C.F. Ives Principal of the Shingwauk Home for a grant of $200.00 for paint for the dining rooms, dormitories and laundry at the school.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes, Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\nSeptember 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of September 15th enclosing a request from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home for a grant of $200.00 for the purchase of paint.\n\nThe amount provided in the current year's appropriations for Shingwauk Home has already been expended and, as our funds are so limited, it is not possible to find $200.00 in any of the other items in the appropriation. Under these circumstances I regret that the Principal's request cannot receive favourable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG.H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 5)\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nWhen I visited the Shingwauk Home at the first of this month, the Principal directed my attention to the water situation at the school.\n\nThe water used at Shingwauk Home is obtained from the City of Sault Ste. Marie. The city water main is approximately one mile from the school and from this point to the school a three inch pipe was installed by the school at the expense of the school authorities some thirty years ago. Since that time two or three other people living between the town limits and the school have been allowed to tap this pipe and use water. There is a meter at the point where the water pipe to the school connects with the city main and there are also meters at the points where the school water pipe has been tapped by residents. Strict account is therefore kept of the water used by each party. In many years past, it has cost the school between $200 and $300 a year for their water.\n\nAs a result of grading, etc., along the road where the school's water pipe runs, considerable earth has been removed from above the pipe line and it is not at the same depth as it was when originally installed. There is, therefore, some danger from frost.\n\nAbout one-half mile behind the Shingwauk Home a new development has recently opened and several homes are being built. These people are requesting the city authorities to supply them with water. The City of Sault Ste. Marie has expressed a desire to replace the present 3\" pipe with a 6\" pipe and carry this latter pipe to the new development. This would permit them to supply water en-route both to the Shingwauk Home and any other \"white\" residents who may be living either between the school and the town limits, or behind the school.\n\nThe estimated cost of this new pipe line would be $11,000 and the City of Sault Ste. Marie has suggested to Reverend Mr. Hives that the Indian Affairs Branch should pay...\nthe cost of this pipe line. Mr. Hives does not consider that the City is justified in requesting us to pay for this pipe line, as the present one is suitable for our purposes and the primary object in installing a new pipe line is to provide water for \"white\" residents along the road.\n\nMr. Hives states that we could easily dig a well and obtain our own water supply for approximately $3,000.\n\nThis report is therefore placed on file for information of the Branch, in the event of a formal application being made for us to pay for the new pipe line.\nEXD.\n\nNov. 4, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. Hives,\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, blue prints of a barn in accordance with your request made to Mr. Dudley, which may be of use to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Secretary.\n\nRev. C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Indian Residential School,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nWhile you were here a few weeks ago, we were talking about our need of a work shop where the boys could do a little in the way of manual training. As you know, we have absolutely no place where the boys can do any such work. Now that the winter is coming on, they like to make their little sleds and tinker around at their handy work, and it really is a very good thing for them. I knew you have no money for the purpose of building such a work shop as we really require, but we have a building which was used as a summer cottage in the old days. It is a lumber, or frame building, and is quite well constructed, and is 24 ft by 16 ft. At present, it stands down by the side of the river. If we could have it moved up to near the building, and sided, reshingled and fixed up, it would make an excellent workshop for the boys.\n\nNow, I estimate that $150.00 would do the whole thing. That is, to move it, place it on a good foundation, and make it look in keeping with the main school building.\n\nWill you please let me know if you can do anything at all for us this fall. I would very much like to get it moved right away if financial help can be given. I feel it is such an important matter, and would not write you about it now if it were not.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 18, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter dated November 16th from the Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, in which he states that there is a building on the school property which could be converted into a workshop for the boys. He estimates the cost of this work at $150.00, and I presume that most or it will be labour, as the building will have to be moved from its present site to a new one.\n\nPlease inform Reverend Mr. Hives the Department will allow this amount.\n\nYou should arrange for any labour necessary. Such labour should be chosen from those on the approved list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heyy,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nKrug Bros.

Revision of our Recent quotation.\nDear Sir:\n\nOver two years ago, when furniture was being bought for our new school, some school desks etc were purchased through the Department from Krug Bros., through Thompson Bros., of Sault Ste. Marie. Thompson Bros. asked me at that time if the furniture was being bought and paid for by a department of the Government, and I told them it was. They then asked me to sign a statement to that effect. They gave me a statement and I signed it. Evidently I should not have done so, for it would appear the Department purchases are not exempt from taxation.\n\nKrug Bros. have sent me the enclosed statement, and are asking for payment of same.\n\nI suppose it is a legitimate expense against the furnishing of our school, and I would be very much obliged if you would attend to it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nKrug Bros.

Thompson Bros. (signed J.G. Thompson) the quotation on desks and chairs for Shingwauk Home.

Our records also show that the above amounts were paid to Messrs. Thompson Bros.\n\nIn view of the above, you will note that in quoting a price on the desks and chairs, the firm included Sales Tax and that their quotation as submitted was accepted and paid. Under these circumstances, we do not consider that any further amount is due from us at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C.F.

We have, as you knew, children here, who are more or less susceptible to T.B. infection, and then to find that we are feeding them milk that may be infected also. I may say, for your information, the milk from the cow mentioned in the enclosed letter has not been used since she calved; but it might easily have been, had not care been exercised by the Farm Instructor. Doctor Gallivan, the V.S., is inclined to blame bad housing conditions for the trouble, and in any case, we have a very poor chance of fighting it under the conditions now prevailing.\n\nI know you have a great many things to care for and to worry over, without my bringing this matter up again, but it seemed to me to be acute enough to write you about the matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr R.

Marie, Ont.\n\nIn accordance with instructions received, an inspection was made on January 24th, of the water supply pipes in the basement of the above school.\n\nThis system, installed about two and one-half years ago was installed in the backfill below the six inch concrete basement floor slab. The samples of corroded pipe forwarded to this office by the Indian Affairs branch were removed from beneath the floor slab in the dining room adjacent to the Valve and Catch Pit as shown and marked \"A\" on the attached plan. The pipes at this point are embedded in about six inches of cinders, used for backfill, and at this point are badly corroded. A sample of this fill, taken from immediately around a piece of corroded pipe has been examined by the Testing Laboratories of the Department of Public Works and as shown in the attached report dated January 31st, 1938, the corrosion is due to electrolytic action set up between the carbon in the cinders and the iron pipe. It is noted that the only remedy is to remove all cinders from the vicinity of the pipes.\n\nIn view of the lack of definite information available as to the use and location of cinders, and also as the pipes are located beneath a monolithic concrete slab, test openings were made in the concrete flooring at the points marked \"B\" and \"C\" on the attached plan. These points were selected as being at junctions of runs and under plain concrete flooring. The pipe line under floors of the recreation, kitchen, toilet and wash rooms, were not investigated at this time as these floor slabs are surfaced with either terrazzo or special mastic floor finish.\n\nIn each of these test holes, with the exception of \"A\", the pipes were found to be embedded in dry gravel and sand, free from cinders, and in perfectly sound condition. It would appear therefore, that the cinders had not been used throughout the building, and are only placed in contact with the piping in occasional places. Due to some repair work required last year.....\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 16, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 6)\nIn considering the erection of the building, it is possible that cinders which were used only for extra backfill, were used to a greater extent under the portion of the building occupied by the main recreation room and accompanying services, as the natural grade at this point was considerably lower than under the remaining portion of the building. Consequently it is probable, considering this information and the evidence of the test holes, that the greater portion of the pipe lines are not in contact with cinders and would still be in a satisfactory and serviceable condition.\n\nBefore undertaking to repair the system, it would be considered advisable to make tests in order to determine the condition of the piping. A pressure test of the various sections of the system, i.e., \"B\" to \"C\", \"C to K\", \"G to D\", etc., could be made to determine whether or not there are holes in the pipe due to corrosion. However this test would not determine the condition of the pipe other than for complete corrosion and leakage. A galvanometric test might be made of the sections to determine whether the pipe was being subject to corrosive action provided the action was occurring at the time of the test and not merely suspended due to lack of moisture. These two tests should determine the amount of piping that would have to be repaired immediately, and in all probability would disclose all existing defects. If these tests disclose leaks or corrosive action, the defective sections can be excavated and replaced, or discarded and new sections installed below grade, providing the cost would not be out of proportion or excessive to the estimated cost of $1,100.00 for replacement of the entire system above grade. If no leaks or corrosive action are disclosed the corroded section from \"A\" to \"B\" can be removed and replaced with new pipe properly protected from the cinders.\n\nIn view of the thorough corrosion of the pipe at \"A\" it is felt that if the piping does not show leaks or active signs of electrolysis at present, the pipe, in all probability, is not laid in cinders, and therefore would remain in a serviceable condition.\n\nIn investigating this trouble it is noted in the specifications that under the concrete sections, paragraph 11, namely, \"concrete floors\" states that \"the basement floors shall be laid on a 6\" base of concrete mixed as specified for walls, under this base shall be laid four inches of broken stone or gravel\". Also under the Plumbing and Drainage section, paragraph 8, namely \"hangers\" states that \"all piping throughout the building shall be exposed\".\n\nConsidering these two points of the specifications embodied in the contract agreement for the erection of the building, the installation of the water supply piping below the concrete floor and the use of cinders as backfill are a direct deviation from the specifications. Mr. Thomas R. Wilks, the Supervising Architect employed on the construction was questioned as to these two changes or deviations, but could not state why the cinders were used or why the piping was laid underground. Mr. C. Fitzpatrick, the Contractor, was then called upon and only stated that the work was carried out to the approval of the Supervising Architect and the Architect of the Indian Affairs Branch; As the plumbing had been sublet, Mr. McClary, of\n\nDunseath & McClary...........\nDunseath & McClary, the Plumbing Contractors, was consulted, and whereas he identified the piping diagram on the enclosed plan as prepared by him and the notes thereon as his comments, he could not say whether the work had been approved by the Architect, but stated that the work had been carried out to the satisfaction of the Contractor and the Supervising Architect. When questioned about the cinder fill Mr. McClary further stated that he had required the cinders to be kept away from the pipes, and in several instances had had cinders removed and replaced with gravel or earth backfill. The contractor's foreman was also questioned as to the use of cinders but as in all other cases, could not state definitely how or where the cinders were used in relationship to the piping.\n\n(Note - As a result of the above consultations the five test holes were excavated in an attempt to ascertain where cinders had been used and also as to the probable condition of the piping. The Plumber's statement regarding the cinder fill further substantiates the previous statement that the greater portion of the pipe lines are not in contact with cinders)\n\nIn considering the responsibility for the corrosion of the pipes, which is a direct result of their location and the use of the cinders it should be noted that the general conditions, paragraph C, namely \"Additions and Deductions\" states that \"No deviation from the plans and specifications will be permitted without the direct consent of the Department in writing...\" and further \"Should the architect at any time during the progress of the work desire any alterations, additions or omissions from the work as provided for in the plans and specifications, the architect shall have the right to issue orders and directions in the matter and the same shall in no way affect or make void the contract. No such alterations, additions or omissions shall be instituted, however, without authority in writing.\"\n\nIn addition, paragraph 15, namely \"Guarantees\" states that \"The occupation of the whole or any part of the building will not be considered as an acceptance of the work, and furthermore the final inspection and acceptance of the work shall not be conclusive or binding upon the Department, if it should subsequently be found that inferior workmanship or materials have been incorporated into the building or that the contract had been departed from in any way. Any and all costs for making good such discrepancies shall be chargeable to the Contractor together with any and all damages that may have resulted because of defective workmanship and materials or either\".\n\nThe installation of the water supply piping below the floor level, and the use of cinders as backfill for the basement floor slabs, constitute a direct deviation from the specifications, and whereas these changes were instituted without authority in writing, can be considered as defective workmanship, and therefore, under paragraph 1b, of the General Conditions, any and all costs for making good such discrepancies might be chargeable to the Contractor, together with any and all damages that may have resulted because of defective workmanship.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC IC, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 6)\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Shingwauk Home\nSault Ste. Marie.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of January 19th, an inspection of the water pipe system located in the basement of the above school was made by Mr. Dudley on January 24th. You will note from the attached report of February 5th that the present trouble is due to electrolytic corrosive action set up between the cinders of the cinder backfill and the iron pipe, and that the only remedy is to remove all cinders from the vicinity of the pipes.\n\nHowever, from the information obtained by the investigation, it is not considered necessary to replace the entire system as it appears from the test holes excavated at various points of the building, that the cinders were not used throughout and that where the pipe is laid in sand or gravel it is in satisfactory condition.\n\nIn order to put the system in working order a pressure test should be applied to the various sections of the system and any leaking sections replaced. The extent of the replacements would depend upon the location of the leakages, such as under an extensive floor area, such as section \"B\" - \"H\" or \"B\"-\"G\" as shown on the floor plan; it would be more economical to replace the entire section with new supply lines above floor level. However, if leaks are discovered in sections such as \"A\"-\"H\" or \"B\"-\"C\" it would be advisable to excavate these sections and replace the defective pipe with new lengths properly protected. This latter procedure should be followed for the corroded section \"A\"-\"B\" in the event that no other leakages are disclosed.\n\nThe cost of this work can only be determined by the results of the pressure test, but should be in proportion to the estimated cost of $1,100.00 for the replacement of the entire system at the floor level. On this basis it is estimated that the section \"A\"-\"H\" could be replaced for about $50.00 or $60.00, and the maximum cost of the repairs required..........\n\nJ. M. Wardle,\nDirector,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nrequired (based on the pressure test) would not exceed $300.00 to $400.00.\n\nIt is noted that under the contract for this building, which was built in 1934-35, that the location of the water pipes below the floor slab and the use of cinders as backfill are a direct deviation from the Specifications. From consultations with the Supervising Architect, appointed from Sault Ste. Marie to represent the Department of Indian Affairs, the contractor and the plumbing sub-contractor, it appears that these changes, which were directly responsible for the present trouble, were carried out without authority in writing. In view of the terms of paragraphs 8 and 15 of the General Conditions, excerpts from which are quoted in the attached report of February 9th, I would be pleased to receive Departmental advice as to the extent of the responsibility which may be applied to this situation.\n\nIn the event of the repairs being carried out by the Indian Affairs Branch, it is recommended that instructions for the pressure test and repair work be forwarded to Mr. Hives, the school principal, and that the work be carried out under his supervision.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie.\n\nI am forwarding you herewith a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, with which he forwards a copy of Architect Dudley's report on the water supply pipes in the basement of the above school.\n\nThe main points brought up in Mr. Dudley's report are that the location of the water pipes and the use of cinders as backfill was apparently an unauthorized deviation from the specifications covering the construction of the building in 1934-35, and that the maximum cost of repairs would be between $300.00 and $400.00.\n\nWe will be very glad to forward instructions for the reference of Mr. Hives, the School Principal, if you decide to make the necessary repairs.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir:\n\nIt is now over three weeks since Mr. Dalley came to our school to investigate the water pipe trouble.

(RC 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sorry to have to report an outbreak of fire, which occurred on Thursday morning last, and while I was away escorting three children to the Sanatorium at Nixi, Hull, P.Q. As far as I can make out, a boy of fourteen years of age, threw some gasoline on the furnace to kindle it, and which resulted in an explosion. Had it not been for the prompt action of members of the staff, and the City Fire Brigade, the Principal's residence would have been destroyed very quickly. As it was, considerable damage was done to the floor and walls of the building. The firemen had to break into the walls in order to extinguish the fire. The electric wiring in the basement is also out of commission, and the walls of the house are very badly blackened up, and will require painting.\n\nI have made an estimate of the cost of restoration, and have also asked the advice of two reliable contractors, and estimate it will cost two hundred and fifty dollars to buy the material and do most of the work ourselves. The plastering and electrical work will have to be done by experts.\n\nI am very sorry indeed that this has happened, and beg to assure you it was not on account of any negligence on the part of Mrs Hives or the staff. I have repeatedly warned pupils never on any account to interfere with gasoline, and there was absolutely no need for the boy to have put anything on the fire to urge it to burn. The trouble is, we are dealing with children who are, sometimes, very difficult to deal with, and to instruct.\n\nWill you kindly let me know at the very earliest your wishes regarding the work of restoring. Until I receive them, the wiring is useless, and things around the house are very much disorganized.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nCopy sent to Indian Agent Sims\n\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the fire in the Principal's residence at the Shingwauk Home. It is difficult to understand why gasoline was apparently left in such a convenient place that the person starting the fire was able to obtain it. I note that most of the work will be done by the school staff but in connection with the purchase of material I would point out that present regulations do not permit our authorizing principals to make these purchases.

The plans are a little more elaborate than is necessary and could be modified considerably in order to cut down the cost, but, in the main, they are what we need, and I would very strongly recommend their adoption.\n\nI understand the estimate for the construction of the barn would be around $10,000.00, if given a contractor, but I have also made a very careful estimate, after getting prices, etc., and find it could be built at a cost not exceeding $6,000.00, if done by day labour and under the supervision of a competent master builder. A $2,500.00 barn would not accommodate our stock, (I understand from you that is the amount of money at present available) and would build only a horse stable or a small cow barn, either of which would not be convenient for size or supervision and both of which we urgently require; and for the sake of proper supervision of the boys, if at all possible, under one roof.\n\nI would therefore recommend that the plans now in hand be adopted in the main and that the building be started immediately, while we are enjoying good building weather; that it should be done by day labour and that Mr. Luke Langdon, of Sault Ste. Marie, be master builder. The local member, Mr. H. Hamilton, is quite in favour of this man. I recommend that the gravel and cement be purchased from I. J. Downey & Son, of Sault Ste.

Marie, Ont.\n\nOct. 29, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am writing you in connection with the water main between Shingwauk and the city of Sault Ste. Marie. Yesterday the city Water Commissioner and I met in the office of the Indian Agent, and after talking matters over, we decided to have holes dug in various parts of the pipe line in order to have the pipe properly inspected by someone competent. Five holes were dug, and we brought a good plumber down to test the pipes, and he reported them in very bad condition from corrosion. These pipes have been laid for about forty years, and under their present state would not bear any tampering with.\n\nWhen the pipes were laid, the road, which at that time was a one wagon trail, has been widened, so that now, the pipe line is well on to the road, and I was quite shocked to find it had only thirty inches of earth over it. During this week, the city have been taking down a hill in the road, and the pipe at that point is from nine to twelve inches under the surface, and for a distance of about two hundred and fifty feet. Until looking into matters, I did not realize how serious is the situation.\n\nI am convinced something must be done, and done immediately, or our water and heating system is almost bound to collapse during the Winter, and we would be quite helpless to do anything.\n\nThe City Water Commission are very anxious to cooperate with us in the matter, though how far they can be made to go is the question. It is a ten thousand dollar job, no matter who does it, or when it is done, and it will have to be done by someone, and unless we are to suffer during the winter -\nthe winter, it must be done immediately, for the situation is quite serious.\n\nHad I known things were so serious when I was in Ottawa, I would have discussed the matter with you more thoroughly. As it is, I feel we should get together on it, for I am convinced it is of such importance as to warrant our doing so, and I am sure the Commission of our Church Society would want me to do so.\n\nWill you kindly let me know as soon as possible your wishes in the matter, and in the meantime, I will obtain as much information as possible from the City Commissioner as to how far they would go in the matter of financing it. I have the feeling they will go a long way if they are properly approached. On Monday next, I shall seek all the information I can, after which I would like to get into touch with you, and would be prepared to meet with you in your office at any time should you think it worth while my doing so.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Chas. F. Hives,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nAttached please find letter from Lieut-Col. H.S. Hamilton, M.P., in reference to the water supply at the Shingwauk Home. Mr. Hamilton discussed the matter briefly with the Minister a few days ago. As soon as you have received Mr. Hives' report you will no doubt wish to have the matter investigated. When the investigation has been completed will you please furnish report for the information of the Minister.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nOttawa, November 1, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI was greatly disturbed to learn from your letter of the 29th ultimo that the water main connecting Shingwauk Indian Residential School with the water supply of Sault Ste. Marie was urgently in need of repair.\n\nNo provision has been made, either in this year's or next year's estimates, for repairs or alterations at your school, other than a grant of $2,500.00 for the completion of the barn.\n\nIt is my intention to ask the Surveys and Engineering Branch to send up a man with the object of having a thorough investigation made of the water supply at your school. In the meantime, you might secure if you can figures indicating the extent to which the city of Sault Ste. Marie are prepared to cooperate with us, should we decide to proceed with the project. The cost of securing water by the construction of a well on the school grounds should also be carefully investigated. It is exceedingly difficult, if not impossible, to justify an expenditure of $10,000. for the water supply at your school, in view of the hundreds of demands that are reaching us daily from other sections of the Dominion. I do not consider that it will be at all necessary for you to visit Ottawa until you hear from us again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Indian Residential School,\nSault Saint Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, November 1, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch.\n\nRe: Water supply, Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nI am attaching hereto letter received by the Department from the Reverend C. F. Hives, Principal, Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nI am anxious to have a thorough investigation made of the water supply at the Shingwauk Residential School by one of your engineers. The condition of the water line should be carefully investigated. The engineer should submit figures, also, indicating the cost of replacement. The suggestion has been made that it might be possible to secure the water supply necessary for this school by the construction of a well on the school grounds. The practical worth of this suggestion might be investigated by your engineer.\n\nNo provision has been made for an expenditure of this kind, either in the estimates for 1938-39 or 1939-40. If the matter is as serious and as urgent as Mr. Hives suggests, however, it is just possible some provision will have to be made either for the replacement of the present pipeline or for the construction of a well.\n\nMr. Hives has been asked by this Branch to supply additional information with respect to the contribution that the city of Sault Ste. Marie might be prepared to make, should we decide to proceed with the project.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nNovember 4, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant requesting a further advance of $600.00 for wages in connection with the barn at the Shingwauk Home.\n\nA cheque for $600.00 was forwarded to you about the middle of October and a second cheque for $600.00 was mailed on October 25, making a total of $1200.00 already forwarded to you. Am I to understand that you desire another cheque for $600.00 or was your letter of November 1 written before the last cheque reached you?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Dept.,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr Hoey:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Returns of Labour on the new barn up to Nov. 12. I was hoping to have sent all returns of Labour in to you on Thursday next, but a bad storm hit us, and has delayed work. However, I hope to have all returns and accounts ready for next week, and will let you have report and statement of all expense next week.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 23rd., 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nShingwauk School Barn.\n\nThe credit voucher which you submitted in connection with labour on the above project has been examined and an error of $9.00 appears in the labour return for the week ending November 12th. The total amount should be $447.20.\n\nYour credit voucher has therefore been reduced to $1,759.30, and you should take this into consideration when accounting for the balance of the funds advanced in connection with this building. The principal of the school should also be advised of this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.W. McCutcheon,\nChief Treasury Officer.\n\nG.H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

HIVES,\nPRINCIPAL\n\nNov. 22, 1938\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find bill from McClary, Plumber for work and material in connection with water pipes.\n\nThis expense is in connection with the corroding of the water pipes under the cement floor, and, I believe is the finish of the trouble we have had from that cause. Last Spring water broke out in various places, and repairs were done, and at that time a test was made under the floor of the girls' playroom. The pipes stood the test, and so I did not think it wise to recommence the floors, but they have now perforated and the flooding of the washroom and playroom floors necessitated work being done immediately. The pipes have now been disconnected under the floor, and carried over head, so I do not anticipate any more trouble from that direction.\n\nWill you kindly forward the enclosed to the Department for payment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr G.H.Sims,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nAccording to instructions I made a trip to Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, to investigate the present water supply of the Shingwauk Indian School at that place.\n\nI found that the above school is supplied by a 5 inch pipe which connects with the city main near the corner of Queen and Pine streets. As this pipe has been in place for 40 years it has suffered considerable corrosion and will have to be replaced sooner or later. During grading operations on the road only a foot of covering was left over the pipe at one place, and in addition due to widening of the roadway, a considerable length of pipe is now in the roadbed, with only 30 inches of covering over it. This depth has been sufficient up to the present since the pipe was to one side and clear of the roadway, as this allowed the snow to remain over it all winter, and in addition it received further protection from the ridge which the snow plough left. When the attention of the city officials was drawn to this matter they had the earth covering replaced over the pipe to its former depth where necessary, and they also agreed to have the road ploughed in such a manner as to leave a ridge of snow over the pipe at other places.\n\nAt present the only fire protection at the Shingwauk School is in the main school building where there is a fire riser with 1\u00bd inch hose outlets at each floor. There is no outside hydrant to protect the other buildings, and as the main building is of modern fireproof construction, it would seem that the greater need is for the outside hydrant. However, it will be seen that even with an outside fire hydrant the 3 inch supply pipe would be inadequate, especially as it is 40 years old and over a mile long.\n\nT. S. MILLS, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Service,\nSurveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 1C, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 6)\nThe Public Utilities Commission of Sault Ste. Marie does not receive any share of the general taxes but has to finance its different projects through bank loans; these loans, with interest, being a charge against the actual work and paid by the users benefitting. Where the improvement is carried past vacant properties these do not have to share in the cost unless they have service connections and are actually using the water. In the case of the Shingwauk School, in the first half mile, there are two or three private residences and a public park using the water and the owners will contribute half the cost if the Utilities Commission lays a 6 inch main, and the school will contribute the other half. The payment for the work would be spread over a period of twenty years with interest at 5% unless some other arrangements were made with the Utilities Commission.\n\nThe fire underwriters insist on a 6 inch main as minimum where the municipality is responsible for the work, although a smaller main might be laid here if the school assumed the cost of the whole work. A smaller main of 4 inch bore would not be adequate for outside fire protection, although it would provide considerably more water than is now obtained through the old 3 inch main and at a much better pressure. The cost of a 4 inch main would be about $3,000.00 more than half the cost of a 6 inch main and consequently the school would be much better off if a 6 inch main were laid. In addition the 6 inch main would be maintained by the Commission.\n\nThe cost of laying a 6 inch main would be in the neighborhood of $10,000.00, the school being responsible for half of this amount. As stated before the payments would be spread over a period of twenty years and would include yearly interest on the money. In addition to the above the school buildings are mostly located about 400 feet from the highway and it would be necessary to lay this amount of pipe in the school grounds if fire hydrants were desired close to the buildings. This would add from $600.00 to $800.00 to the total cost, depending upon the location of the hydrant. It is understood that the Commission would supply a hydrant but this is not absolutely certain. The cost of a 4 inch main would be about $8,000.00 plus about $600.00 for the pipe between the highway and the school buildings and, as stated before, the school would have to bear the entire cost of this plus any maintenance that was required.\n\nThe possibility of a deep well supply was also investigated but it would appear that this would cost practically as much as the city water supply with the added maintenance costs and supervision. There are several successful wells in the district but it was stated that although good results were obtained in some cases, in others in close proximity the results were negative. It was not possible to obtain figures for drilling wells but at the Provincial House of Refuge a well is in use for which the installation cost...\ninstallation cost $2,500.00 and the Pump House $500.00. The pressure tank of 1600 gallons capacity was already in place when the pump was installed and the well had been in use for some time. It is estimated that the tank would cost $1,000.00 and the cost of drilling the well would be $1,500.00 altogether, so that the total cost would be around $5,000.00. Dr. Shepherd, the Medical Supervisor of the institution, was of the opinion that if city water could be secured it would be infinitely preferable to a well and pump installation. The above installation uses a 10 H.P. single phase motor, the pump having a capacity of 100 American gallons per minute.\n\nIt would appear that the most economical and satisfactory arrangement for the Shingwauk School would be for it to secure its water supply from the city through a 4 inch main as proposed, as it would probably be possible for the Department to pay its share as the work progressed and thus save interest charges on the cost. Apparently the existing 3 inch pipe has passed through several winters without damage from frost and it may do so again, and although the present lack of snow is not a very favourable condition in this regard, the mild winter climate seems to be conducive to it. However, the condition of the pipe is such that any sudden increase in pressure or water hammer might cause damage to it, and consequently it would seem advisable to replace it as soon as funds are available.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nDecember 13, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Water Supply Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 5th ultimo enclosing copy of a memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs in regard to the above matter, I attach hereto a copy of Mr. Byrne's report, in duplicate, covering his investigation of the matter.\n\nIt would appear that owing to the present condition and size of the existing 3-inch supply main to the Shingwauk school, the main should be replaced when funds are available. Three alternative proposals are considered:\n\n1. Laying a new 6-inch main between the City main and the school, the cost of same to be equally divided between the Water Commission and the school.\n\n2. Laying a new 4-inch main between the City main and school, the whole cost to be borne by the Department as well as the cost of maintenance and upkeep.\n\n3. By a deep well installation on the school grounds, the entire cost of which, plus maintenance and supervision, would have to be borne by the Department.\n\nThe estimated cost of a 6-inch pipe line would be $10,000.00, of which the Department would pay $5,000.00 plus interest at 5 per cent, unless some arrangement were made to pay as the work progressed. In addition to the above, the whole cost of the lateral from the highway into the school grounds would have to be met by the Department.\n\nThe estimated cost of a 4-inch pipe line would be $8,000.00 plus the cost of the lateral between the highway and school, all of which would have to be paid by the Department as well as the upkeep and maintenance of same. The estimated first cost of a complete deep well installation would be $5,300.00 and in addition there would be the yearly maintenance, upkeep, and operating costs to consider.\n\nEncl.\n\nFrom the ............\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nFrom the above it would seem that a 6-inch main on a 50-50 cost basis would be the most satisfactory and economical installation in the present case and it is considered advisable that this work be carried out as soon as funds can be secured for this purpose.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. Mills\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 460-5, part 6)\n15th December, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water supply, Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of the 1st ultimo, Mr. Byrne, of our Engineering and Construction Service, inspected the above water supply and a copy of his report is forwarded herewith together with a covering letter from the Chief Engineer.\n\nSeveral alterations were considered for the supply of water to this school including Mr. Hives' suggestion of a well. Briefly Mr. Byrne's recommendation is that a fifty-fifty cost arrangement be entered into with the Public Utilities Commission of Sault Ste. Marie for the installation of a 6\" main to the school at an estimated cost of $10,000, half of which would be paid by the Department. In addition to this there would, of course, be the lateral running from the highway to the school at a cost of approximately $600 or $800.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, December 19, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIn a memorandum dated November 1, 1938, the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch was requested to undertake an investigation of the water supply at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nI am now in receipt of a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch which reads in part as follows:\n\n\"Several alterations were considered for the supply of water to this school, including Mr. Hives' suggestion of a well.

In addition to this there would, of course, be the lateral running from the highway to the school at a cost of approximately $600 or $800.\"\n\nThe Shingwauk Residential School has at this date a pupil enrolment of 130. The school is being supplied with water from a 3 inch pipe which connects with the Sault Ste. Marie city main near the corner of Queen and Pine streets. This 3 inch main has been in place for over 40 years. It has suffered considerably from corrosion and should be replaced just as soon as funds for its replacement can be secured.\n\nNo provision was made in the estimates of this fiscal year for the installation of a new water supply at the -\nat the Shingwauk School nor has any provision been made for such a project in the estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40. You are probably aware that provision was made in the estimates of this year for the construction of a new barn at this school, the cost of which will be met by the payment of $2,500 out of this year's estimates and $2,500 out of the 1939-40 estimates.\n\nThe suggestion has been made that the new water main might be laid by day labour and thus give employment to a large number of unskilled workers and that the cost be borne by the city of Sault Ste. Marie, the Provincial Government and the Dominion Government; in other words, that this work be recognized as a worthwhile unemployment relief project. If it cannot be recognized as a relief project, provision should be made in the supplementary estimates for an amount necessary to undertake and complete this work.\n\nI shall await your instructions before making a definite recommendation.\n\nDirector.\n\nRAH.\n| Date   | DESCRIPTION          | Folio | Material | Labor | Total  |\n|--------|----------------------|-------|----------|-------|--------|\n| Oct. 25| To 8 Gals.

I must say that you are to be complimented on the fine structure which you have erected.

Mr. Walker has given you the best cement job I have ever seen in my ten years of experience, and I know that you can rest assured of having a permanent job which will last for many years, and which in the end will pay well for the original investment.\n\nTrusting I may on some future occasion be of service to you, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDistrict Representative,\nBeatty Bros.

(RC 1C, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 6)\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to bring to your attention a matter regarding the communication doors in our school buildings. These doors are of metal and are located at strategic positions leading on to the stairway to protect the stairs in case of fire. These doors, which are heavier than the ordinary door were hung on just ordinary door jamb, with the result they have pulled the screws out many times, and where we have changed for bolts instead of screws, have torn away the wood work of the jamb.\n\nI would recommend that the door jambs be changed, and instead of the present fir, birch wood should be used. This is a very important matter from the standpoint of fire protection.\n\nThe approximate cost would be $65.00. This would take in the cost of the wood, and the skilled labour.\n\nWill you kindly take up this matter with your Department as soon as possible, so that we may get it readjusted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Hives, principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School is self explanatory.\n\nI have personally examined these doors and find that their original jambs are all together too light to bear the strain of the heavy doors, with the result that the screws have been repeatedly giving way. There are eight pairs of jambs required. It is proposed to use birch wood in place of fir as at present.\n\nThe approximate cost would be Sixty-Five Dollars ($65.00) for material and labour. Some of the labour will be supplied by the School.\n\nIf this expenditure is authorized, please advise me if I am to hire the carpenter, giving his name, or if the Rev. Mr. Hives may be authorized to go ahead and have the work done under the agents' supervision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. McCookin,\nActing Indian Agent,\nSault Ste.

The upper floor is loft.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wonder if we could have a supply of paint for our floors. The floors are cement, and were painted when the school was built, but wherever there has been much traffic, it has worn bare, and looks bad, and is very difficult to clean, and holds the dust and dirt very much. I am not asking for any specific amount, but just whatever the Department can afford now. We would do the work ourselves, and at this time of the year, when there is not so much work outside, we could use up quite a lot of paint on the floors, as there is a surface of 28,928 square feet that requires painting, and I would be very glad to get as much paint as possible for covering as much as possible.\n\nI understand the Governor General is to pay a visit to Sault Ste. Marie during the month of April, and if so, he will in all probabilities visit our school. The floors really are in very bad need of paint, and are very conspicuous to anyone coming in to see or inspect the building.\n\nAt present we are near the end of the paint you kindly bought for us for the walls. This has covered the children's dining room walls, staff dining-room, staff sitting room, reception room, Junior girls' dormitory, Junior boys' dormitory, Kitchen ceiling and one of the other dormitories, and I assure you this painting has made a wonderful improvement both in the appearance as well as from a sanitary aspect.\n\nWill you kindly present this matter to your Department as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

It would, of course, add to the appearance of the rooms and halls and they could more easily be kept clean if painted again, but unless the money is easily available, I recommend putting off the work until a later date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Marie. This main is in very poor and even precarious position and at any time the water service may be tied up. You were agreeable to proceeding with the work this winter if it could have been taken care of out of some of the grants made for relief work in Northern Ontario. Mr. Rogers was agreeable to doing this but the Provincial Government could not see their way clear to do so.\n\nI think now provision should be made in the estimates for the coming year to take care of this work. I have spoken to the manager of the Public Utilities Commission here today and he advised me that he feels satisfied that $6,000.00 would take care of one-half the total cost for material, supervision and labour and suggests the Federal Government either agreeing to split fifty-fifty on the total cost or to make a definite contribution of $6,000.00 and the Public Utilities Commission will do the job and take care of any additional cost which he thinks will be approximately a similar amount, namely $6,000.00.\n\nI hope that this will be taken care of this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(sgd.)

There is no great hurry for the payment thereof if it is not convenient to handle it right now.\n\nThe enclosed is for paint for the interior of the barn, which you told me to buy when you visited us last. We have bought, and applied it to the interior, and it really looks very well.\n\nI wonder if you could let me know if there would be any chance of a root cellar this year. We could do practically all the work ourselves if we had the material. I would like to build a proper cement root house, entirely of cement and steel. I made inquiries about steel yesterday, and find I can buy this from the second hand man for two cents a pound, so that our steel would not cost more than fifty dollars for a root house 24 X 16 ft. The total cost, that is the amount we would require for meeting all expenses would be $500.00, and this would include pulling down the old barn, and building a decent place over the root cellars which would accommodate implements and garage. There would be sufficient material in the old barn to build this superstructure. I would be very much obliged if you could help us out in this project, or I don't know how we shall keep our roots next winter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 6)\nOttawa, June 9, 1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 7th instant, in which you intimate that the accounts for material used in the construction of the new barn at your school have not yet been settled.\n\nI may state that the delay is due wholly to the fact that the supply bill was not passed by Parliament until a few days ago. I have today signed these particular vouchers, however, and sent them forward to the Treasury Branch for payment. The cheques will no doubt be sent out in the course of a day or two.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Residential School,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, June 9, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Branch has received vouchers for $206.47 in favour of Baldwin Builders' Supplies. It is noted on examination of this voucher that you are shown as having paid $187.97 by cheque on November 28, 1938. If you have not already accounted for this advance, you should be careful to obtain copies of Messrs. Baldwin's vouchers so that you may be able to attach them to your credit vouchers accounting for the advance when you do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Principal Hives of our Shingwauk School has reported to our Commission the need of some playground equipment for the school children. He points out that as most of the children are unable to go home for their holidays the need becomes all the greater during that period of the year. He can secure a set of three swings and one \"merry-go-round swing\" which has long ropes with a ring on the end and have the same installed at the total cost of $114.00. The boys of the school have already made a splendid effort to raise this amount but so far they have only managed to be able to secure $60.00, and our Commission would like to know if your Department of Government could provide the remaining $54.00. It will surely be an encouragement to these boys if you can secure for them this amount, or as generous a contribution as your funds will admit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTBRW/WH\nSecretary of the Commission.\nOttawa,\nAugust 3, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to playground equipment at the Shingwauk residential school.\n\nDuring the latter part of the last fiscal year and the first part of this fiscal year an amount of approximately $5000.00 has been expended at the Shingwauk Home for the erection of a new barn.\n\nIn our appropriation for next year we will have to provide another $5000.00 for installing a new water main from the city of Sault Ste. Marie to the school.\n\nYou will note from the above that we are endeavouring to deal fairly with the Shingwauk Home and I regret that as no funds were specifically provided for the type of playground equipment mentioned in your letter the expenditure requested cannot be authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

This lumber would be first grade lumber, and I would deliver it to your school quite soon after receiving your order.\n\nYours truly\n\nEd Buchanan\nSHINGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nSept. II, 1939.\n\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI have been making enquiries about lumber required for finishing off root house, and am enclosing a letter from Ed. Buchanan of Echo Bay. I made other enquiries from lumber companies, and the Baldwin Lumber Co., who are on the approved list quote a price of $48.00 per thousand feet for the same class of lumber. You may readily see, therefore, that it will be greatly to our advantage to buy from Buchanan. Furthermore, Ed. Buchanan buys his logs for sawing from the Indians of Garden River, and practically all his saw mill labour is Indian labour. In fact, it was on this consideration that permission was given me to buy lumber from him for the building of our new barn. I would therefore recommend that the lumber we require now, should be purchased from Mr Buchanan.\n\nWill you kindly let me have your reply as soon as possible so that the work may be finished in time for storing our potatoes etc.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 14, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 11th instant regarding the lumber required for the root house at the Shingwauk Home I believe it would be advisable to make purchase from Mr. Ed. Buchanan. However, before doing so I consider that you should consult Col. Hamilton, M. P.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C. F.

Marie with the request that I forward same on to the proper authorities. I, therefore, enclose same herewith.\n\nThe Government's share is $4,176.79, which I am glad to note is appreciably less than the $5,000.00 maximum the Government agreed to be responsible for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHSH/GG\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I received from your Department an accountable cheque for the amount of $300.00. The receipted account from I.J. Downey & Sons for the amount of $25.95\nReturns of labour 86.00\n** ** ** Totaling 103.95 shows that I have paid out $2.15 more than the accountable cheque.\n\nThere are two accounts not paid, but which I have O.K.'d. Cochrane Hardware to the amount of $45.00. And Ed. Buchanan for lumber for the amount of $103.35. The sanctioned amount for this work was $450.00\n\nThe lumber was bought from Ed. Buchanan, first on account of this man paying Indian labour in his saw mill, and secondly because his price was very much lower than any other.\n\nWill you kindly look into this matter and have cheques forwarded to these two firms.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas.

Buchanan ................. 103.35\n\nThese accounts cover the cost of material purchased for the erection of a root house at the Shingwauk Home. The firms mentioned are the same as those from whom materials were purchased for the erection of the barn at this school last spring.\n\nThe old root house at this school had become unfit for use and as the school had a heavy crop it was necessary to build a new root house immediately. The Rev. Principal stated that the materials could be purchased most economically from the firms from whom we purchased the materials for the barn. Consequently he was authorized to proceed with the work in order that the root house could be completed before the cold weather set in. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the accounts may be paid. You will note that the account of $112.95 covering the cost of materials purchased from I.J. Downey & Sons has already been paid by the Principal and consequently purchase order in this case should be issued in favour of Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal, Shingwauk Home.

Downey & Sons .......... $112.95\nJ.E. Buchanan ............... 103.35\n\nThese accounts cover the cost of material purchased for the erection of a root house at the Shingwauk Home. The firms mentioned are the same as those from whom materials were purchased for the erection of the barn at this school last spring.\n\nThe old root house at this school had become unfit for use and as the school had a heavy crop it was necessary to build a new root house immediately. The Rev. Principal stated that the materials could be purchased most economically from the firms from whom we purchased the materials for the barn. Consequently he was authorized to proceed with the work in order that the root house could be completed before the cold weather set in. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the accounts may be paid. You will note that the account of $112.95 covering the cost of materials purchased from I.J. Downey & Sons has already been paid by the Principal and consequently purchase order in this case should be issued in favour of Rev. C. F. Hives, Principal, Shingwauk Home. The coding on these accounts will be 469-76-13-491.\n\nR. A.

Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk School,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you know, we are resident and own property just west of the Shingwauk School.\n\nThe subject of the stench which arises, apparently from the sewage from the School, has been a matter of discussion between us and others affected by it. We feel that this is detrimental to our health, comfort and property, and the cause should be removed, or other remedy applied, by the School.\n\nWe would be glad if you would have this condition looked into and the proper remedy applied.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received, and there is not much I can add to what is there, beyond endorsing the facts stated. It was in the plans to build a properly constructed septic tank for the disposal of the sewage when the school was completed, but owing to the death of the architect and financial limitations, this matter has been side-tracked. Many verbal complaints have come in prior to the enclosed, and we have tried to smooth the matter over by applying some deodorant etc., and saying we do no worse than the city. But, the matter will have to be remedied sometime, not only on account of their complaints, but for our own sakes, because it is really more of a nuisance to us than it is to them. And there is more than the possibility of disease arising from such a condition.\n\nIn my opinion there is only one remedy, and that is to build a septic tank capable of handling the sewage. This, I estimate, would cost in the neighbourhood of $800.00 if we do most of the work ourselves.\n\nIn the meantime, will you kindly think the matter over, and if it cannot possibly be attended to during the next fiscal year, I will tell these gentlemen it will be attended to as soon as the war is over, if you think this would be best.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr H.A.

There are no funds available in our appropriation for the expenditure that you state would be necessary to completely remedy the condition about which complaints have been received. Owing to the recent dissolution of Parliament I am not in a position to state at the present time what amount of funds will be available for repairs and improvements at the Shingwauk Home during the fiscal year 1940-41.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI enclose herewith final returns of labour on Root House. This accounts for the balance of funds advanced to me for the building of the root house, or rather for the converting of the old barn into a root house. I would like to say the project has been a decided success, and we have been able to take care of our roots all through the winter.\n\nI think the enclosed winds up everything in connection with the root house.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n| Name          | Mon | Tues | Wed | Thurs | Fri | Sat | Total | Amount of Wages | Received Payment |\n|---------------|-----|------|-----|-------|-----|-----|-------|-----------------|------------------|\n| Robert Smith  |     |      |     |       |     |     |       |                 |                  |\n| John Doe      |     |      |     |       |     |     |       |                 |                  |\n| Jane Smith    |     |      |     |       |     |     |       |                 |                  |\n\n**Certified Correct**\n\n**Recommended for payment**\n\n**Balance**\n\n---\n\n**PUBLIC ARCHIVES**\n\n**ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES**\n\n**CANADA**\nOttawa, July 11, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School visited the Department yesterday and stated that repairs were required to the Kelvinator system at the school.

HIVES,\nPRINCIPAL\n\nAugust 28, 1940\n\nMr R. Lawrence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Lawrence:\n\nThe roof of our school main building is requiring some urgent repairs. Quite a bit of the roofing is composed of sheet metal, the seams of which were covered with a tar cement. This cement has decayed, and the water leaks through every time it rains, and is causing much damage to the interior plaster on the walls. This roofing requires recementing.\n\nAlso the asphalt roofing has been damaged by wind and weather, and in many places these shingles have been broken off, causing the roof to leak and doing damage to the interior plaster.\n\nI estimate the cost to be approximately fifty dollars. Ten dollars of which would have to be paid for a competent roof man, as I would not want the boys attempting such a work.\n\nWill you kindly take this matter up with your Department as soon as possible, so that we may remedy this condition before the Fall rains start.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSault Ste.

I enclose herewith list of paint, amounting to approximately $200.00. I am also enclosing two quotations of prices for same. I would recommend that the Cochrane Dunlop receive the order, for they are not only low in their prices, but they are always reliable, and my experience is they give good value for money.\n\nThe spire and tower on the main building will require painting and some repairs. I would not want to have the boys doing this work, though they can do much of the other safe painting. I would therefore have to hire an experienced man to help me put up the scaffold and do the painting. This work, along with necessary expenses which may come up in connection with the tower and spire painting would cost $100.00.\n\nWe have no garage in connection with the school. I would like, if possible, to use the remaining $200.00 for the building of a garage for the school car and truck. I would use up the lumber required for the scaffolding of the tower on this job, and would recommend that I be allowed to purchase what other lumber we require from Ed. Buchanan, Echo Bay. This man has a saw mill, and employs Indian labour at his mill. I can get good lumber from him at a greatly reduced price, and for this reason, would recommend that all lumber be purchased from him.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr. R.A.

The asphalt shingles break off with the constant bending caused by the wind, and it is not until we get a bad rain, like we are having just at the present moment, that the leakage reveals itself. This should be done immediately, and I estimate the cost to be about fifty dollars.\n\nThe house, which is being used by the engineer, also requires repairs. The walls require lining, and some painting is needed. The walls would cost under fifty dollars, and the painting would cost thirty dollars. I would very much like to get this work done immediately.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.P.G. Lawrence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSault Ste.

Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant and also copy of a communication received by you from the Reverend Charles F. Hives, Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, attached thereto.\n\nIt would appear that the repairs referred to by the Principal in his letter are urgently needed. This is particularly true in respect to the repairs that appear to be needed to the roof of the school. You are authorized, therefore, to proceed with these repairs. It is noted that the cost of this repair work will be approximately $130.\n\nThe records here indicate that certain repairs to the Shingwauk Residential School were authorized in a letter to you, dated Ottawa July 17, 1941, signed by the Chief of the Training Division. I find it difficult to understand why the repairs now mentioned by the Principal were not requested at that time. I am personally of the opinion that all repairs to Indian residential schools should be undertaken during the holiday period - July and August, and only urgent repairs, the need for which arises unexpectedly, should be made during the academic year. In addition to this, endless correspondence would be saved if the principals co-operated with us in undertaking repairs during the vacation period. Mr. Hives is, as you know, leaving the Shingwauk Home in the course of a few weeks, but this is a matter that you should take up with his successor, just as soon as his successor is appointed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSHINGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nREV. C. P. HIVES,\nPRINCIPAL\n\nSeptember 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th inst., relative to the matter of demolition of old buildings connection with the old Shingwauk Home. In the first place, I would like to say, the building in question is already demolished. When the old school was demolished, I was given orders, by your Department, through the late Mr Orr, Architect, to get rid of the old hospital building as soon as possible. I promised to do this, but have not had the chance to carry out that promise until the last two months. The reason for this was that our school Engineer and his wife and family lived in part of the building, which consisted of a frame structure of three rooms and a pantry, and he had to live there until another house was available. This other house became available during this Summer, and with certain improvements, for which I have asked your sanction, can be made comfortable for the Engineer.\n\nThe late Mr Orr, gave his orders for the demolition of the building from a landscape point of view. But there are two very specific reasons why it was advisable to have it demolished. First, because it was unsafe. The building was a stone veneer, built on a wood foundation. The foundation was decayed, and the walls were falling down. Ours is a school for boys and girls, and in spite of all supervision, boys will prospect an old house, and this house was unsafe.\n\nSecondly, the house in question was the old hospital. Goodness knows what disease, of an infectious nature had been isolated in it. From the standpoint of sanitation it was advisable to have it demolished. I was not able to put the boys to work on the house, partly because it was not safe for them to do such a work, and partly because it was not sanitary. I therefore made arrangements with a man to demolish it for the bit of lumber he could salvage.\n\nI assure you, sir, the demolition of the old\nHospital is a good job done, and the land in front of the main building will be improved thereby.\n\nIt seems funny that there are these sentimental people around, who would interfere with progress such as has been going on during the last six or seven years at Shingwauk. They tried in every way to stop the demolition of the old main building, which would have been a menace in every way, had it remained. And yet those same people, who claim to take such an interest in historical sites etc., would pass by an old cemetery where the old timers of the Soo are buried, and never give a hand to care for it.\n\nI would be very glad indeed to give you further explanation if such is necessary.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. R.A.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nDear Reverend Minchin:\n\nFollowing our visit to the Shingwauk Home and our conversation in converting it into an emergency hospital in case of an air raid here, I now make formal request for its use.\n\nA close survey of the city discloses the fact that no other place is near as suitable, and any other place would entail very great expense and not result in anything nearly so suitable.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. E. Gimby,\nMedical Controller, C D C (ARP)\nMay 2, 1942\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed letter was received yesterday following a visit last week of a committee of local doctors. As you can understand the C.D.C. is very anxious to be prepared for all emergencies. I explained to the doctors that I had no power to allow the use of this building for any purpose whatever, but that I should be pleased to pass on their request to you if they would send me a letter which could be forwarded to the Indian Department.\n\nIn an emergency we could manage to hand over one of the dormitories on the second floor for use as a hospital ward, and also a room in the infirmary which might be used for emergency operations. This could be kept quite apart from the rest of the school while in use for this purpose and need not seriously interfere with the regular routine.\n\nI feel that if possible we should assist the committee in their efforts to be prepared for all emergencies.\n\nI shall be glad to hear your wishes in regard to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, May 5, 1942.\n\nDear Mr. Minchin:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 2nd instant and also a communication received by you from the Civilian Defence Committee of Sault Ste. Marie, sent forward therewith.\n\nThis is the first request of its kind that has reached us since the outbreak of the war. It is noted with interest that in an emergency you could place at the disposal of the committee one of the dormitories on the second floor, for use as a hospital, and a room in the infirmary which might be used for emergency operations, and that this concession would not seriously interfere with the regular routine of the school.\n\nIt is our earnest hope that no emergency will arise, that would render necessary the use of this accommodation by the Civilian Defence Committee. Should the need develop, however, I feel sure that it would be the desire of the Government to do everything humanly possible to assist the committee in alleviating human suffering. You are authorized, therefore, to cooperate with the committee in working out the best ways and means of safeguarding the interests of the population of Sault Ste. Marie and the immediate district.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend A. E. Minchin, B.A., L. Th.,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nSault Ste.

Marie and can follow through on this matter. It would of course be better to make the inspection during the heating season so that the cool or hot spots of the building could be checked up and the System balanced as necessary.\n\nWe are passing a copy of your letter to our Mr. Gray at Ottawa who still has jurisdiction over the selling and servicing of Dunham Products in the vicinity of Sault Ste. Marie, and he will no doubt communicate with you and advise you just when he plans to be in your part of the country.\n\nThe Heat Balancer tube can be readily installed by your Engineer but we would of course send necessary instructions for its installation at the time of shipment of material.\n\nThe old tube of course cannot be repaired as the tube having once broken it would release the gas within the capsule and there would be nothing left to create the expansion force for the operation of the Heat Balancer.\n\nAssuring you that upon receipt of your order we will give this matter our most prompt attention, we are\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nC.

I wrote C.A. Dunham Co., the firm responsible for the installation of the heating system, explaining the matter. I suggested that it would be a good thing if their representative could check the whole system when visiting the city. (I may say that I wrote them in August asking for a check up but they replied that it would have no value unless the heating system were in operation.) Now I am informed that they have no other work in the city calling for a visit from their representative and that it would of course be a big expense to send him along. They suggest however that the local plumber who assisted with the installation could probably do the work, and that a new Discharge valve should be secured at a cost of $20.00 F.O.B. Toronto, 8% Gov. tax extra. Check valves if required could be secured locally. There would also be charges made by the plumber for doing the work. Will you please instruct me what action should be taken.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There was considerable delay in getting this work done but we managed to keep the boiler going. In the interval the number of tubes leaking mounted to three all of which have now been replaced. I am enclosing the account which of course exceeds the original estimate but there was nothing that we could do. I suggest that a boiler Inspector should examine this boiler which has been in use since the school was built with a view to finding out the condition of the other tubes.\n\nI should also suggest that an Inspector should also examine the two large boilers used for heating the school but this would be better done when the fires are out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find voucher No. 1139, for repairs to boiler at the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, and letter from the Principal of the school regarding same which is self-explanatory.\n\nKindly advise me if it will be in order to have an Inspector examine the boiler this summer as requested by the Principal.\n\nR.

The account should show the number of hours the men were employed and the rate per hour. There is also a charge of $4.75 for material. This should be itemized.

Where the vertical part joins to the tapered portion, daylight can be seen in numerous places and there is no doubt that this is where the steeple leaks. In order to reach this, a scaffold would have to be built straddling the roof, in order to get up to do the work, as nothing can be done with this from the inside. It is difficult to estimate the amount of time required to repair the steeple, until a scaffold has been built, but it would cost at least $100.00 to build and remove scaffolding and repair the metal work.\n\nAs plastering in the laundry, it is our opinion that the cause of the plaster peeling off above the end of the washing machine, is that the steam is the cause of the trouble and the only remedy is to have the ceiling plastered with cement plaster and then painted. The ceiling at the present time is plastered with gypsum and this will not stand moisture.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

One tube gave out suddenly on April 17th, and I had to get the Foundry to replace it immediately as our supply of hot water depends entirely upon this boiler. Less than a week later another tube went and the process had to be repeated.\n\nYou will remember that we have had several of these tubes replaced last year. From the condition of the two just replaced I should judge that we may expect that the others will soon need replacement. That is to say those of the original tubes still remaining.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nDated May 10/44\n| Description                          | Quantity | Rate  | Total |\n|-------------------------------------|----------|-------|-------|\n| Install Tube in Boiler 2\u00bd\" x 22\"   |          |       | 9.55  |\n| Truck 3 Hours @                     | 1.50     | 4.50  |       |\n|                                      |          | 14.05 |       |\n| Sales Tax 8% on 9.55                 |          |       | 76    |\n|                                      |          |       | 14.81 |\n\nIndian Affairs.

We also have to use one classroom every evening for the\nchildren to do their homework:- Those attending Collegiate and\nTechnical School as well as our own grades VII and VIII. I have\nhad the lighting tested and find it altogether inadequate. The\nelectrician I have consulted, who has been installing lighting\ninto a number of schools, recommends the following:-\n\nApproved Schoolroom fixtures should be installed in all\nclassrooms with 200 watt capacity, also blackboard\nreflectors.\n\nThis would require:-\n\n22 Schoolroom fixtures @ $8.00- $176.00\n9 Blackboard reflectors @ $5.00- $45.00\n\nWould you be kind enough to bring this matter to the attention\nof the Department as I consider the change to be very necessary\nespecially as quite a number of the children appear to be suffering\nfrom eyestrain.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nArthur E. Minchin,\nprincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will please find attached letter received from the Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School regarding schoolroom lighting which is self-explanatory.\n\nKindly advise me regarding this matter at your convenience.\n\nR.

Last week we had to get them up again to repair another leak. This is the same boiler for which we have had to replace a number of tubes. When the boiler Inspector was here we told him about this but at that time there was no visible trouble. If there had been he said he would have condemned the boiler. I foresee constant trouble and expense and suggest that the boiler be replaced.\n\nMr. Lills, Boiler Inspector, suggested that a combination Garbage-consumer and water heater would be the best replacement to make. This would help in the disposal of garbage and use less fuel. One of these is installed at the Tara Hall Apartments on Pim St. and I believe proving very satisfactory.

Mills, made the annual inspection of H. V. Boiler No. 2 and H. W. Tank Nos. O.A.11692 and O.A.11693, and reports as follows:\n\nMr. Mills recommends the installation of a larger reducing valve on the cold water inlet to the building, also the maintenance of a continuous cushion of air even above the outlet pipe of the cushion tank at the entrance to the building. At the present time a 2\" water line enters the building and the cushion tank, but only 2\" x 1\" lines at reduced pressure leave the cushion tank to supply the whole school. The result is the pulsating pressure throughout the buildings varying from 0 to 80 or 90 lbs. This sudden change in pressure going on all the time is very hard on the hot water boiler and tanks. It has been necessary to have the Pendell boiler welded at the seams and stays on several occasions due to the above.\n\nThe fees chargeable for the above inspections amount to $3.00, which is included in our invoice for $7.50 enclosed herewith. The other equipment listed on the invoice is in satisfactory condition. Certificates will be issued upon receipt of your cheque.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. N.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nAn inspection of the mechanical services at the above was carried out by an officer from this Service on February 24th to 26th inclusive, and the results are summarized as follows:\n\nThe boiler plant and piping distribution system is of relatively good design and with several exceptions was installed according to the original plans. Most of the equipment appeared to be in good condition, but several items are in need of repair and some additional equipment is necessary if the plant is to function with normal efficiency.\n\nComplaints received indicated a lack of heat in the Class Rooms, Auditorium and Sewing Room. Complaints were also received concerning the lack of domestic hot water.\n\nMuch of the heating difficulty can be overcome by releasing the thermostat which controls the entire building, along with several additional radiators located where required.\n\nThe original design of the domestic hot water heating equipment was not followed out in its entirety, and while the storage tank is large enough, the heater capacity is definitely inadequate. An undersized coal fired domestic hot water heater is now in use and this unit is too small as well as being in poor condition. The present low pressure heating boilers have ample capacity to heat the building as well as to heat the domestic hot water, if one other was installed.\n\nThe domestic hot and cold water piping is all undersized, and most of it is buried under the basement slab in cinder fill which has been the cause of failures due to rapid corrosion. (Incidentally, the main building return from the heating system is also buried under the slab.) All domestic hot and cold risers are undersized and none of this piping is insulated.\n\nWhile no immediate emergency exists, this buried piping should be replaced and the building return housed in a trench, to prevent further interruptions to these services. A careful analysis of the requirements indicate that the following improvements are necessary to bring this plant up to a reasonably efficient service.\n\nJ.M. Hardie, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 8)\n1. Install one stoker to serve one of the present low pressure heating boilers.\n\n2. Provide an indirect steam fed heater of sufficient capacity to adequately handle the domestic hot water requirements.\n\n3. Replace all domestic hot and cold water mains and most of the risers, and properly insulate same.\n\n4. Replace that portion of main building return now buried under basement slab and house new line in concrete trench.\n\n5. Move building thermostat to more favorable location.\n\n6. Add several new radiators in rooms which are now under heated.\n\n7. Provide new jacket heater for summer service only and arrange piping to this end.\n\n8. Arrange with manufacturer to service existing vacuum pump and controls.\n\nIt is estimated that the above operations will cost in the neighborhood of $5000.00\n\nThis Service now has data from which plans and specifications could be prepared, but we are in no position at present to advise when such work could be undertaken.\n\nThe matter of ice formation on the roof was discussed with the Principal. It was pointed out that no satisfactory method of preventing such conditions could be suggested, and the school authorities should arrange with the Indian Agent to have men remove accumulations of snow before ice had a chance to form. The Principal accepted the idea that it was part of the normal maintenance which should be carried out under his direction.\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, April 17th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste.

Marie, Ont.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 17th, 1947, and your notations of the 19th instant thereon, you are advised as follows:\n\nWhile it can be fairly stated that no immediate emergency exists at the above, it is also true that the domestic hot and cold water piping now buried under the basement slab, is in a state of progressive deterioration, and the need for continual repairs can be expected. The same situation on other residential schools has resulted in disorganization of the school routine. Should an emergency arise, the repairs would involve cutting the concrete slab and patching worn piping, which in the past has been carried out by the School staff, resulting in considerable neglect to boiler room duties.\n\nIf requested by Indian Affairs to prepare plans and specifications for the necessary revisions as outlined in our memorandum of April 10th, 1947, we consider they could be issued for tendering about May 30th next, which would enable the work to be carried out before the beginning of the fall term.\n\nIt is felt that this work should be carried out during the current fiscal year if funds can be made available.\n\nJ.M.

Marie, Ont.\n\nMay 1st, 1947\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 26th, 1947, and your notation of the 25th instant thereon, regarding the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWhen the mechanical services were inspected (February 24th-26th) the condition of the vacuum pump was noted. It was felt at that time following a close check, that the pump would function reasonably well enough for the balance of the heating season. Included in our memorandum of April 10th, 1947, is a clause recommending that the pump be serviced by the manufacturer at the same time as the proposed revisions to the mechanical services are carried out.\n\nThis pump has not had shop service since it was installed, and as already stated, no immediate concern was felt when our inspection was made. This is a condition that applies to most of the residential schools and there is no doubt that some elements such as plumbing, etc., are in need of attention. Since the Principal's letter indicates some concern, we feel that Indian Affairs should authorize the manufacturer to examine the pump and make what replacements are necessary as soon as possible. This would avoid the risk of a breakdown.\n\nThe pump was manufactured by the C.A. Dunham Co. Ltd. It was supplied by their local agent who is located at 45 Rideau Street, Ottawa. Under the circumstances this firm might be contacted with the view of carrying out the work.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

Marie, Ontario, there is a vacuum pump which was supplied by your firm. One of our engineers has recently visited the school and states that this pump has not had shop service since it was installed and that there is no doubt that some elements, such as packing, joints, etc., are in need of attention.\n\nWould it be possible for your firm to have some qualified man examine the pump and make the replacements necessary as soon as possible, or could you suggest the name of some firm in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, whom we could engage to do the necessary work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC.A.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nThe Principal of our Shingwauk School reports as follows on the major services which are needed at that School:\n\nIMPROVEMENTS TO HEATING SYSTEM\n\nA Mr. Hargraves, an Engineer sent by the Department, examined the heating system in March, 1947, and recommended the installation of a stoker and other improvements. So far the only work carried out has been the overhaul and repair of the vacuum pump by the Dunham people.\n\nHOUSE FOR FARM INSTRUCTOR\n\nThere is constant need for a house for the Farm Instructor. No accommodation outside of the main building is provided for any of the staff and the house at present occupied by the Farm Instructor is an old building, owned by the Diocese, which is very difficult to heat. This building has been carefully examined by a committee appointed by the Diocesan Executive, who have reported that it would practically need rebuilding in order to make it habitable in the cold season; this would involve a very heavy expenditure which the Diocese is not prepared to incur as the building is not used for Diocesan purposes.\n\nPROVISION OF A MANUAL TRAINING SHOP\n\nIf Manual Training is to be carried on fully, there should be an extension to provide a Manual Training Shop.\nIt will be appreciated if you will give consideration to the inclusion of the three items mentioned above in your Departmental Estimates, 1948-49.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG. R. Turner\nfor Superintendent\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTo: Shingwauk Home,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of May 1st, 1947, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nWe were notified by telephone by the Ottawa Representative of the O.J. Dunham Company, that one of their engineers from Toronto was to be sent to the school at the request of Indian Affairs, to carry out the necessary revisions to the vacuum pump and to examine the automatic controls on the heating system.\n\nThe Dunham representative verbally informed us on October 14th, that the pump had been repaired and put back ready for service. Also that the automatic controls on the heating system have been examined and adjusted for normal operation, as it was felt by their engineer that the boiler room staff at the school would get better results by operating the system in this manner for the time being at least.\n\nFollowing an inspection of the mechanical services by our Mr. Hargreaves last February, it was recommended that at least one stove be installed and that additional radiation be provided for certain rooms which at present are under heated, along with a number of other items. Since there is no night fire in the dormitories at the school, one stove at least is essential. This would enable the school to be kept at a reasonable temperature during the night and it would be easier to bring the rooms up to normal temperature the following day.\n\nSince Indian Affairs has no funds voted for these operations in the present fiscal year, they decided to defer action till next year. When the mechanicals are eventually carried out, the automatic controls on the differential floor heating system should be made to function as they were originally installed to provide economical operation with a minimum of attention.\n\nWe will prepare plans and specifications covering the necessary revisions when authorized to do so by Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.M.

It is evident that the Principal and the staff are actually interested in their pupils and anxious to have them progress as rapidly as possible.\n\nThe building is clean and well maintained. Toilets and baths are in good condition. Dormitories are clean and satisfactory. The kitchen and dining-room are well organized. Family style service is used. The sick bay is unusually well appointed.\n\nA good program of extra-curricular activities is carried on. There are teams entered in leagues with Sault Ste. Marie schools and other juvenile teams. There are twenty graduates now living in the school and attending Sault High School and Technical Schools. Several of these girls are interested in normal school and Nurses' Training. There are Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and a Student Council has been started. The Manual Training Instructor seems very capable and is anxious to carry out Departmental policy with regard to vocational training.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. That the necessary repairs to the heating system be carried out during the 1948-49 fiscal year.\n2. That consideration be given to the construction of a farm house during the 1949-50 fiscal year.\n3. That the purchase of more land be investigated.\n4. That a gym and Manual Training shop be included.\nin our 1950-51 building program.\n\n5. That paint be provided for the dormitories.\n6.

It is felt that these items should be completed before taking on additional work.\n\nWithin several weeks time, work on the plans and specifications for the Shingwauk Home can be resumed and tenders can be called for, in time to have the job carried out during the coming summer. It should be pointed out that our estimate of $5,000.00 was made in April of last year, and it would occasion no surprise if tenders show a 15% to 20% increase over our 1947 estimate, when received.\n\nR.A.

Mr. Sundin is a very good roofing man and I have asked him to give me some idea of the cost. He tells me that the cost of nails would be around $20.00 and that he estimates labour would cost about $140.00. There are also some shingles to be replaced on the main building and Plastic Cement to stop leaks. This would probably cost another $10.00.

We have since made an inspection of the wiring and would advise you that we find the same to be in a most hazardous condition. The concealed wiring in the main building is installed in sub standard installation with the exception of the added outlet in the hay mow, and separate fusing should be installed on each circuit by the installation of a standard panel. The wiring in the chicken coops and root house is in a very dangerous condition and requires to be entirely rewired. The entire yard overhead wiring is in a very bad condition and should be entirely replaced.\n\nThe separate pole type service which supplies current to the out buildings also supplies the Bishop Faquier Chapel and also the engineer's house on Queen St. We find the original wood moulding type of wiring in the chapel with sub standard wiring added and the branch circuit cutouts in a defective condition and fuses plugged with copper pennies.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nDepartmental Estimates 1948-49\nShingwauk Indian School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nEarly in April, 1948, you advised me that the following funds are provided in your 1948-49 Departmental Estimates for services at Shingwauk School:\n\nPlumbing repairs $5,000.00\nRefrigeration 800.00\n\nOn checking our submission of 18th October, 1947, of services for inclusion in your 1948-49 Estimates, I cannot find any reference to refrigeration, the services requested being\n\n(a) Improvements to Heating System including installation of a stoker\n\n(b) House for Farm Instructor\n\n(c) Provision of Mammal Training Shop\n\nPerhaps the refrigeration was included on the recommendation of your local Agent but the new Principal reports that the existing electric refrigerator seems to be functioning satisfactorily.\n\nThe Principal advises me that your local Agent has informed him that three bids for plumbing have gone forward to you but no contract as yet been awarded. As these repairs on which bids were submitted include installation of radiators in classrooms and necessitate excavation of a considerable length of floor or basement passages, it will be appreciated if the contract can be awarded soon so that as much of the work as possible will be done before the children return and so that it will be completed before cold weather sets in.\n\np.t.o.\nIn our submission of 18th October, 1947, we mentioned in regard to the heating system that \"so far the only work carried out has been the overhaul and repair of the vacuum pump by the Dunham people\". This had been reported to us on 3rd October, 1947, by the then Principal. However, the present Principal reports as follows under date of 24th August, 1948:\n\n\"Last fall our Dunham vacuum pump was sent away to the C. A. Dunham Co., Toronto, for repairs and, later, a representative of the firm came here to re-install it and to check the Dunham Vacuum Heating System, which was installed when the school was built to facilitate the flow of steam by drawing off condensed steam. This representative said that the system could not be put into proper working order as the manufacturers no longer carried the essential repair parts. He also stated that he was going to report adversely upon the system direct to the Indian Affairs Branch in Ottawa. Since that time the whole differential vacuum heating system has become useless. Mr. Hayes reports that he can run the pump motor all day without creating an inch of vacuum. If the manufacturer's representative could give no assurance of restoring the apparatus to working order then, obviously, the school must be provided with a satisfactory replacement. Otherwise there will be constant complaints of cold classrooms, etc. this winter. This matter is urgent and I have requested the Department through their local Agent to give the problem due attention with a view to renovation this fall.\"\n\nMay this matter be given attention at an early date, please, as it is obvious that this heating system cannot function properly unless the vacuum return system is in good working order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRevision of Heating & Domestic Hot and Cold Water System - Shingwauk Indian Residential School\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 26th file 13-0-5 (E), this is to advise you that I am endeavouring to obtain another tender for these repairs and will submit same as soon as possible.\n\nAs most of the plumbing contractors here are busy at present, it may be some time before I receive this tender.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR.

Marie, Ont.\n\nIt will be appreciated if you will make provision in your 1949-50 Departmental Estimates for the following services required at the above-named school. These services are listed in order of urgency:\n\n(a) Coal Cellar\n\nThree different varieties of fuel are needed at this school - lump coal, stoker coal and coke. The capacity of the existing coal cellar is only about 20 tons with the result that fuel can be procured and stored in relatively small quantities which is an expensive method. Besides, the existing cellar is not subdivided into bins for the different varieties of fuel.\n\nA second coal cellar, with capacity of at least 1 earload (40 to 50 tons) adjacent to the present cellar and having a similar cover of reinforced concrete, is urgently required.\n\n(b) Floor coverings in dormitories\n\nThe concrete floors of the dormitories on the top storey are badly worn in places and require covering with either mastic tiling or battleship linoleum. The larger dormitory has an area of approximately 1,650 square feet and the smaller dormitory on the boys' side (which needs attention the more urgently of the two) approximately 1,175 square feet.\n\nEstimates obtained from the Northern Tile & Flooring Company, Sault Ste. Marie, show the cost of covering these floors with mastic tiles (combination of A, B and C colours) as\n\n| Larger Dormitory | $672.00 |\n| Smaller         | 468.00 |\n\np.t.o.\nThe price quoted locally for battleship linoleum and cement (materials alone) is $27.50 per 100 square feet or about $450 for the larger and $323 for the smaller, plus labour for laying.\n\n(c) Manual Training Workshop\n\nA new manual training workshop, or combined workshop and gymnasium, is urgently needed as the present quarters will barely accommodate 6 pupils. The Principal reports that Mr. Doucet had in mind procuring a section of a hangar, 30' x 40' for this purpose.\n\n(d) Surfacing of Yard\n\nThe gravel-covered yard lying in the north-west angle of the school building, with an area of about 3,000 square feet, requires hard-surfacing with asphalt or concrete. Snow accumulates in this area and thaws only gradually in the spring because of the northern exposure; in consequence, the approaches to the boys' playroom and basement passage remain dirty for weeks making it impossible to keep the interior in a suitably clean condition.\n\n(e) Painting of Dormitories\n\nThe dormitories require painting. The estimated value of the paint needed is $100.00.\n\n(f) Bread-slicing machine\n\nThe provision of a bread-slicing machine (115 volt A.C.) has been recommended by the Nutrition Branch, Department of Health and Welfare, as a necessary labour-saving device in a school of this size.\n\nIn submitting the foregoing, the Principal has emphasized the urgent need of repairs to the water supply and heating systems, including the vacuum system, before winter sets in this year. I note from your letter 13-0-5[2.1] of 3rd September, 1948, that you are giving attention to these matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nSeptember 13, 1948.\n\nRev. Canon H.G.

Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Dunham Vacuum Heating System\n\nI should be obliged if you would direct the attention of The Department to the unsatisfactory condition of our Dunham vacuum pump and heating system in general in order that necessary repairs or replacement may be effected before the steam heating system is put into operation again.\n\nI understand that when the representative of The C. A. Dunham Co., Toronto was here about October last year to re-install the pump and check the vacuum heating system he reported to our engineer and the principal that it was impossible nowadays to get repair parts necessary to make the system operate satisfactorily and was by no means optimistic about the success of the partial repairs which had been made by the manufacturers. He also stated that he was going to submit an unsatisfactory report upon the condition of the system to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nOur engineer says that it is possible now to run the pump motor all day without getting any appreciable reading on the vacuum gauge, whereas, formerly, it would soon register nine inches and retain a vacuum and the necessary pressure for a number of hours. In other words, the vacuum pump and system is no longer doing the work for which it was installed, namely, to drain the return pipes of condensed steam and, thus, to assist the circulation of live steam throughout the heating system.\n\nMr. Taylor, representative of The C. A. Dunham Co., is reported to have said that his firm no longer manufactures the type of vacuum system we have installed and that repairs cannot be effected to it.\n\nNow that we are expecting repairs to our domestic hot and cold water supply installations I should be much obliged if you would recommend to The Department that our vacuum pump and heating system be renovated. The need is urgent.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wickenden, Principal, you are advised as follows:\n\nMr. Wickenden states in his letter, that the Dunham Heating System originally installed in the building, is not functioning satisfactorily, particularly since the recent repairs to the vacuum pump.\n\nOur Heating Engineer called at Sault Ste.

Gallagher, Plumbing and Heating Contractor, of 347 Albert Street East, Sault Ste. Marie, submitted a firm tender in the sum of Nine Thousand, Eight Hundred and Sixty Eight Dollars and Seventy Cents ($9,868.70).\n\nMr. J. McLeod, Plumbing and Heating Contractor, of 251 North Street, Sault Ste. Marie, submitted a firm tender in the sum of Ten Thousand, Three Hundred and Forty Dollars ($10,340.00).\n\nWe have analyzed Mr. Gallagher's tender, and while the amount is considerably in excess of our original estimate made early in 1947, it is felt that the price is not exorbitant in consideration of the sharp increase in cost of labour and materials which has taken place in the past year.\n\nSince this work is considered to be urgent and since any further delay could result in even higher costs, it is recommended that the contract be awarded to Mr. T.J. Gallagher. It is pointed out, that Mr. Gallagher's price is based on materials and labour as of August 13, 1948, and that any further increases in such costs shall be absorbed by the Department.\n\nIt is also pointed out that in a memorandum of September 7th, Mr. Heey states that this Contractor is fully qualified to carry out the work outlined in our plans and specifications.\n\nR.A.

Pratt, General Executive Assistant of this Branch, I enclose, for your information, copy of telegram sent yesterday to Indian Superintendent Laurence, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of Sept. 13th, 1948, file 13-0-5 (E.1), attaching a list of requests from the Superintendent of the M.S.C.C. for inclusion in the 1949-50 estimates for the Shingwauk Residential School.\n\n1. Coal Cellar\n\nThe present coal cellar is too small and when a stoker is installed there will be no room for the stoker coal. I recommend that the present cellar either be enlarged or an additional cellar be built as soon as possible.\n\n2. Floor Coverings in Dormitories\n\nThe concrete floors of the dormitories in this school are worn and cracked, presenting a very poor appearance. The floors are not up to the standard of the rest of the school and to have them covered with either mastic tiling or battleship linoleum would improve the appearance of the dormitories immensely, as well as making it easier to keep them clean. There are six dormitories and I would recommend that this work be done progressively, two dormitories covered a year until the six are completed.\n\n3. Manual Training Workshop\n\nA manual training workshop is needed as the present room used for this purpose is too small. Mr. Doucet has reported on this matter and suggested that perhaps an army hut could be obtained for this purpose.\n\nThere is a large barn at this school in good condition. Only about half of it is now in use. I would suggest that consideration be given to turning the other half into a manual training workshop.\n\nCont'd...........\n4. Surfacing of Yard\n\nSurfacing a portion of the yard would improve conditions in this area for reasons stated by the Principal of the school. However, it is something that does not have to be done right away, but would be an improvement if money were available for this purpose.\n\n5. Painting\n\nThe walls of the dormitories require painting and this should be done next year as well as re-plastering broken parts of the wall. The estimated value of paint needed is $100.00 and I would also allow $75.00 for patching the plaster.\n\n6. Bread-slicing Machine\n\nA labour-saving device which should be supplied if money is available.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 12 OCTOBER 1948.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council having before them a report, dated 30th September, 1948, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, reporting:\n\nThat under Vote 218 of the 1948-49 estimates of the Department of Mines and Resources, funds have been provided for revisions and additions to the existing boiler room equipment, and the domestic hot and cold water system and the heating system in the Shingwauk Indian Residential School in the Province of Ontario;\n\nThat tenders were invited, on the basis of drawings and specifications prepared by the Department, from reliable firms in the area who were in a position to bid, through the medium of the Indian Superintendent in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario;\n\nThat two bona-fide lump sum tenders for the work were received for total amounts as follows:\n\n| Name of Contractor | Total Amount |\n|-------------------|--------------|\n| T.J. Gallagher     | $9,865.70    |\n| J. McLeod         | $16,340.00   |\n\nThat the lower bona fide tender was analysed and found to be in accordance with the drawings, specifications and tendering documents prepared by the Department, and was accompanied by the required security deposit;\n\nThat the work is considered to be of an urgent character;\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted to accept the tender furnished by Mr. T.J. Gallagher of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, and to enter into a contract with him for the revisions and additions to the existing boiler room equipment, domestic hot and cold water system and the heating system in the building hereinbefore named, in accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by the Department, and the Contractor's estimate of Nine Thousand Eight Hundred and Sixty-Eight Dollars and Seventy-Cents ($9,865.70) which with provision for contingencies and supervision will entail a total expenditure of funds not exceeding Ten Thousand Eight Hundred and Seventy-Five Dollars and No Cents ($10,875.00) the said expenditure to be met from the appropriate vote of the Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nThe Honourable\nMinister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie agency the condition of the above pump was drawn to my attention; it is part of the low pressure steam heating system and was inspected about a month ago by Mr. Hargraves of the Engineering Branch.\n\nThe pump is not working; consequently the steam does not circulate, one part of the building is terribly hot and in the class rooms the temperature is around 55 degrees; with colder weather this will drop much lower, both the teachers and the pupils are complaining of getting colds at the present time.\n\nA new stoker is being installed at the present time, but it will not help unless the pump is working, and a lot of fuel is being wasted trying to get heat into the class rooms.\n\nI would recommend that after immediate consultation with Mr. Hargraves, that the company that installed the pump be asked to send someone familiar with their installation to the school to have it put in shape, apparently the last man they sent did not know enough about them and left it in the present condition.\n\nF.

There is difficulty in getting material - certain copper pipe fittings, radiators, etc. The automatic stoker is overdue.\n\nAfter Mr. F. Matters paid a visit to the school about two weeks ago our local Indian Superintendent, Mr. R. G. F. Laurence, informed me that the former had been in communication (per 'phone) with Indian Affairs, Ottawa, who stated that certain negotiations with the Dunham Co., Toronto, had been completed whereby repairs to our school vacuum heating system would be undertaken. Here, absolutely nothing has been done and in cold spells, there are the old complaints of cold classrooms and uneven heating. Miss Waterman, who is well acquainted with regulations concerning temperature in Ontario schools, complained just before the visit of the Regional Supervisor above-named, of suffering much from stiffness through teaching in a cold room (55 degrees) and indicated that she would not be able to stand such conditions. Mr. Hayes was doing his best, pending alterations, but, if Dunham's don't get into action, we can look forward to burning a good deal of coal without getting efficient heating.\"\n\nIt is suggested that, in the interest of the health of the pupils and staff, the importance of early action be impressed on the Dunham Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHenry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am now in receipt of a letter dated November 25th, from Mr. Laurence, advising that as at that date nothing had been done, consequently it is not possible to heat the classrooms even when the furnace is kept going full blast.\n\nAt this time of the year this is serious, and immediate action is required, pushing the fires as they are doing is going to result in damage to the furnace if allowed to continue very long.\n\nF. Matters\nRegional Supervisor.\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Shingwauk Indian Residential School,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of today's date regarding instructions for operating the heating plant at the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOriginally, controls were installed on the above heating system to provide for what is known as a differential system of steam heating. Due to depreciation through normal wear and tear, replacement parts required for certain control items are not necessary if the system is to function as originally intended. It has been established that such replacement parts can no longer be obtained for these controls, and that new items of a more up-to-date design would have to be provided.\n\nSince the school is not in the class of a commercial institution, it is highly questionable whether or not controls of this nature should be installed, having in mind that care and maintenance of a high degree of efficiency can not be expected.\n\nIt is recommended therefore, that the system be run under pressure. The motorized valve and the manual selector switch still function and the following directions for operating this system should be followed:\n\n1. Open motorized valve to \"Full Open\" position using manual control knob at control panel;\n2. Run pump on \"Vacuum Setting\" during the daytime;\n3. Run pump on \"Float Setting\" at night time;\n4. Carry steam pressure of 2 lbs. per square inch at the boilers;\n5. Set pressuretrol to operate new stoker so as to maintain 2 lbs. per square inch steam pressure.\n\nUpon completion of the work now being carried out, and particularly when the existing main return under the corridor floor in the basement has been replaced, it will likely be found that the vacuum pump, previously serviced, will operate satisfactorily. Operating the system under the above conditions will obviate the use of the room thermostat.\n\nT. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nColonel B.F.

Laurence,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSault Ste.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Major MacKay's memorandum of November 18th, which bears your notation of the 22nd instant, together with a copy of Mr. Cook's letter of November 9th, in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nAs a result of discussions and correspondence with the C.A. Dunham Co., relative to the original controls on the heating system, we are satisfied that through no fault of the Dunham Co., replacement parts can no longer be procured. To replace the old control system with new equipment would entail an amount not considered warrantable in view of the results which could be expected.\n\nUsing the main control valve which still may be operated by a manual selector switch in conjunction with the vacuum pump, satisfactory heating results may be realized in a building of this type. The original controls were installed to provide for a complete system of differential steam heating with the object of effecting the ultimate in fuel saving. To obtain the best results from a system of this kind presupposes first class operating staff and efficient maintenance.\n\nWe are preparing a letter of instruction in accordance with a verbal telephone discussion with Colonel Neary, outlining the best method of operating the heating system in this school. These instructions are to be forwarded to the Principal by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nWith reference to the progress being made in connection with the revisions to the domestic hot and cold water system and some alterations to the heating system now being carried out under contract, it is considered that the Contractor is doing all that can be expected of him to complete this work as soon as possible. Most materials are in short supply, and it is on this account that progress is being somewhat retarded.\n\nThere is no reason however, why the school should suffer from lack of heat during the time that these operations are being carried out as most of the work now under way is in connection with the domestic hot and cold water system.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nR.

Marie, Ontario.\n\nIn connection with Major Mackay's memorandum of December 18th bearing your notation of the 21st instant, together with copies of letters from Principal D.C. Wickenden, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nIn his letter to the Superintendent of Indian School Administration, Principal Wickenden outlines a progress report of the work now being carried out at the above. The amount of work executed to date and the results, are in our opinion, satisfactory. The system cannot be expected to function efficiently in all its phases until the installation has been completed. The shortage of materials is holding up the work and the contractor cannot be held responsible for this condition, as it is in his own interests to proceed with all the means at his command, and we are satisfied that he is doing so.\n\nCommenting on the Principal's letter to Indian Superintendent Laurence, it can be stated that additional covering on the boilers would increase their efficiency. It is pointed out that as a result of inspections carried out at various residential schools, operations necessary to bring the plants up to the highest degree of operating efficiency would result in much larger sums of money being made necessary that it is reasonable to ask for.\n\nOur studied recommendations have been made on the basis of providing the essential and fundamental repairs and revisions needed to provide comfort and overall efficiency in the various schools at a cost considered justified.\n\nWith this in mind, we felt that additional covering for these boilers was not warranted. The contract price for the work outlined on our plans and specifications was considerably in excess of our original estimate, due to sharp rises in materials and labour which had taken place since the time our original request for action was submitted in April, 1947, and the letting of the contract recently. However, should the Indian Affairs Branch wish to have this extra covering added, provided funds are available, we would have no objection.\n\nWith reference to the economical heating of domestic hot water for summer service, you are advised that our original intention was to run one of the heating boilers to provide steam for this purpose through the new indirect automatically controlled water heater now being installed as part of the contract. The present jacket heater in addition to being greatly undersized, is now reported to be in poor condition.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nFor your information.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWe do not consider it advisable to repair or replace this jacket heater as its use in connection with the large domestic hot water storage tank would not be as satisfactory or as efficient as using one of the heating boilers.\n\nSince the hot water demand decreases in the summertime on account of the pupils being away on leave, and since there is but one domestic hot water storage tank, it is considered that with the type of plant in the above school, the use of one of the heating boilers for providing domestic hot water in the summertime can be justified. It is felt that the Principal should be advised to this effect.\n\nChief Engineer.\nJanuary 12, 1949.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence,\nSupt. of Indian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nOn December 16th last Reverend Cook of the M.S.C.C., forwarded to us copies of letters dated December 13th and 14th which he had received from Canon Wickenden with reference to the heating system at the Shingwauk Residential School.\n\nWe submitted copies of these letters to the Lands and Development Services Branch and for your information, I enclose a copy of their reply.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosure:\nPP/HH.\nJanuary 12, 1949.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nRe: Heating System Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of December 16th, we forwarded to the Lands and Development Services Branch a copy of Canon Wickenden's letters of December 13th and 14th.\n\nFor your information, I enclose a copy of their reply.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\n\nRev.

Marie, Ont.\n\nThe building occupied by the Engineer at Shingwauk School is in need of repairs to some of the walls.\n\nThis building is the property of the Anglican Diocese of Algoma who have made it available to the School for a considerable period without the payment of any rent. In these circumstances it is unreasonable to expect the Diocese to bear the cost of necessary repairs.\n\nAs this building is the only one in the School area available as accommodation for the School Engineer and has not cost the Department of Mines and Resources anything, it does not appear unreasonable to ask if you would be good enough to have the necessary repairs carried out at Departmental expense. If you agree, it will be appreciated if you will arrange to have the work done as early as possible.\n\nWill you please advise us what you are prepared to do in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nCanon Cook visited Shingwauk School a few days ago and a memo on his visit received today contains the following:\n\n\"Barns in need of paint - ought to be done no later than next summer.\"\n\nMay this service be given consideration, please, and if funds can be made available the barns painted during the present season.\n\nWe shall appreciate being advised as to what you are able to do in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

Cook, Superintendent of the M.S.C.C., suggests that the barns should be painted. We are not certain if we will have the money available to do this work, but you might let us know the approximate cost.\n\nWe are also advised that while the residence occupied by the engineer of the school belongs to the Anglican Diocese of Algoma, no rent is charged for it, and under these circumstances the M.S.C.C. consider that we should keep the building in reasonable repair.\n\nPlease let us know what will be the approximate cost of repairing the building.

We therefore advised Mr. Laurence that no action would be taken until the other requests were received.\n\nRegarding the repairs to the engineer's cottage, Mr. Laurence was authorized on June 27th, to accept the tender of McLarty Bros. and Brodie, Salt St., Marie, Ont., in an amount of $500.00 to effect the essential repairs.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nYou will please find attached, letter received from the Reverend D.C. Wickenden, B.A., Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, requesting that one of the small dormitory floors be covered with mastic tiles this year, and that repairs to the steam heating system be completed.\n\nThe covering of the dormitory floors was included in Mr. Wickenden's estimates for this year.\n\nI recommend that if possible, these requests be granted.\n\nR.F.G. Laurence\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-5, part 8)\nJuly 9, 1949\n\nThe Superintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Departmental Services to Shingwauk School\n\nAs you are aware, the Department has just authorised repairs to the engineer's residence up to a cost of $500.00, and the superintendent of our Administration has secured through me an estimate from a local contractor of the cost of building a 24' by 30' workshop for manual training, which estimate will presently be discussed by officials in Ottawa.\n\nOther services have been considered for the current year and approved both by yourself and the Regional Supervisor of Agencies, Mr. F. Matters:\n\n(1) covering of concrete dormitory floors with mastic tiles, for which an estimate was obtained from Northern Tile & Flooring last August - small dormitory, $468.00; large dormitory, $672. Perhaps the Department would authorise the tiling of a small dormitory for the current year?\n\n(2) to complete repairs to the steam-heating system, viz:\n- to cover boiler with 2\" magnesia block and 1\" coating\n- to repair and paint\n- to pre-cover completely steam mains in boys' and girls' playrooms and washrooms, to spiral wire with copper\n- to wrap with cotton and finish with two coats of enamel paint; also, to check and replace covering on elbows.\n\nEstimated cost - $295.62 (T. Gallagher)\n\nIt was hoped that this work would be sanctioned earlier in the year while Mr. Gallagher was still engaged on major repairs to the heating and domestic hot water system, such completion of a good job being desirable both from the point of view of efficiency and appearance.\n\nI should be obliged if you would set your approval to these requests and submit them to Ottawa for decision.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are prepared to consider the mastic tiles for the small dormitory floors provided the cost does not exceed the amount mentioned in Rev. Mr. Wickenden's letter of July 9th. Please obtain a quotation from Northern Tile & Flooring Company or any other company that is capable of doing the work and submit these tenders for our consideration.\n\nYou should also forward the tender which Rev.

Neary:\n\nLast month the Department approved an expenditure of $500.00 for the purpose of clearing bushland for cultivation on the northern limits of the school property. This work was undertaken by L.R. Brown & Co. of Sault Ste. Marie, who began bulldozing operations early this month. Unfortunately the land proved to be too wet for the clearing to be completed and it is not likely that a tractor will be able to operate successfully until the summer of next year, when the land should be comparatively dry. It is estimated that an area of approximately 41 acres has been cleared with the brush piled in windrows at a cost of $35.00 per acre. This means that the sum authorized for expenditure will not be appropriated in toto during the current fiscal year, and I am writing now to enquire whether you would favorably consider the diversion of the balance of the $600.00 authorized, i.e., $325.00 more or less, for expenditure upon a service which was requested last August for inclusion in the Departmental Estimates for the year 1950-51.\n\nThere is a full sized attic in the principal's residence which, a floor area of 32 ft. by 12 ft. This was left unfinished with unlined rafters and studding, and second floor and window trimmings etc. lacking. With such a large space uninsulated a good deal of heat is dissipated in the winter and the whole house is colder than it might be. For an expenditure of roughly $200.00 on flooring, insulating material and ten-test (or similar wallboard) etc. I estimate that this work could be done properly with corresponding saving in fuel and gain in comfort. The labour I will gladly attend myself.\n\nI trust that this request will receive your kind consideration and that you will advise me at your earliest convenience.\n\nIn the services desired for the year 1950-51 the completion of land-reclamation will, of course, be requested by substitution.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present residential school accommodates 135 Indian children, approximately 70% of whom are either orphans or children who have no homes. It is the intention to erect a modern residential school and to demolish the old school, part of which was constructed in 1874.\n\nAuthority has been granted to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs under Sections 5 and 7 of the Public Works Construction Act of 1934 to proceed with the above mentioned building forthwith by inviting tenders. This action is now being taken. I enclose requisition, herewith, and would ask for your immediate consideration of the request for the appointment of an Inspector of Construction. In view of the fact that it is the policy of the Government to limit the employment of all labour required on such works to the localities in which the works are being carried out, the Inspector of Construction appointed should be a permanent resident of Sault Ste Marie.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

Marie, Ontario. This institution has been in operation since 1874. It is the intention to erect a modern residential school which will accommodate at least 155 Indian children, and an amount of $150,000.00 is available to meet the expenditure.\n\nUnder Order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council of August 6, 1934, authority has been granted under Sections 6 and 7 of the Public Works Construction Act, 1934, to proceed with the above work by inviting tenders. Tenders have, therefore, been invited and the services of an Inspector of Construction will be required as soon as the contract is awarded. It is expected that the period of construction will be from nine to twelve months. A requisition for this employment at the rate of $7.00 per day has been submitted to the Civil Service Commission.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to request the authorization of the above mentioned employment.\n\n(Sgd.) T.G. Murphy\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nIndian Affairs\n\nTemporary appointment of an Inspector of Construction, Sault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nAugust 22, 1934\n\nThe Department is building a school within the city limits of Sault Ste Marie at a cost of $350,000.\n\nThe Commission is requested to arrange for the appointment of an Inspector of Construction at $7 per day for a period of between nine and twelve months.\n\nIt has been determined that the Department of Public Works has recently been able to obtain a satisfactory representation in this class at this point for $6 per day in connection with wharf construction. Their standard rate for building construction is 2\u00bd of the cost of the bare buildings.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs has been interviewed for the purpose of ascertaining their reasons for suggesting the minimum rate provided under Classification. The reasons given are that the recruiting field at Sault Ste Marie is limited, being confined to possibly three or four who might apply, and that in their opinion the rate proposed was the minimum equitable rate and the very least which will assure proper supervision.\n\nAs a result of the above findings a telephone enquiry was directed to the Department of Labour which Department advised that as the Department of Public Works had this Spring been furnished with a list of the ratings for this class, enquiry should be directed to them. The Commission was later advised by the Department of Labour that no available figures existed but an effort would be made to obtain the information desired.\n\nAs but little inspection work can be done by the regular departmental staff except at prohibitive cost and at the maximum cost under\nthe rate proposed by the Department will be well within the percentage costs standard in the profession, and the Department of Public Works, the appointment at $7 per day is recommended.\n\nChief, Organization Branch\n\nAugust 25, 1934\nJGR/PP\n\nExaminer's report.\n\nIn the absence of eligibles the Examination Branch would recommend that this position be immediately advertised for local competition.\n\nJGR/DH Examiner.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This position was advertised by the Commission, applications receivable up to September 28th last.

Our Architect, Mr. Orr, is visiting the work this week and if the present temporary incumbent of the position is not to be retained it would be advisable to have any new appointee instructed by our Architect when in the Sault, as it will not be possible for us to arrange for him to pay another visit in the near future, owing to the pressure of office work and expense entailed.\n\nI should, therefore, be glad to have definite word by Wednesday of this week, if possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOne of the most urgent needs of this school, and it was referred to your Department some time ago, is the need of additional land. The school has at present only 49 acres set apart for its use. In addition to this, 90 acres are rented every year and for which our Society pays an annual rental of $250.00. The rented land is situated about two miles from the school, and can only be worked at considerable inconvenience to the school management.\n\nSide by side with the school property there is a piece of approximately 49 acres belonging to one, Mr. W. H. of 261 - 5th Ave., New York. This land is now available I understand at the rate of $100.00 an acre. As it is never likely to be cheaper, I beg to strongly recommend that this land be purchased by your Department and set apart for the use of this school.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nTORONTO, ONT. 19th July, 1927.\n\n35-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Rental charges for Shingwauk Home.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring my interview with the Superintendent of Indian Education on the last inst. I directed his attention to the fact that our Society has been obliged to pay yearly since we undertook the administration of the Shingwauk Home the sum of $250 for land rented for the use of this institution, and requested that we be relieved from this expenditure. The Superintendent of Indian Education informed me that as the buildings and land at this institution belong to the Church your Department were unable to purchase the land for School purposes and advised that the rental charges of $250 be included in the list of requirements submitted to your Department towards the close of each calendar year. This advice will, of course, be followed, but it seems to our Commission that our Society should not only receive a grant to cover this amount this year, but also a similar grant to cover the amount which has been expended for this purpose in past years. As our Society assumes responsibility for the administration of this School from Jan. 1st 1922 the total rental charge paid for the use of land will amount, at the end of the current calendar year to $1500 and it seems but reasonable to our Commission that the funds of our Society should be reimbursed to this extent. As the total cost of requisitions submitted in our last for the School for this year is $1800 I trust that your Department may give favourable consideration to this request, and furnish a Departmental cheque for the sum mentioned.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn August last year, 1927, Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, wrote me and said that the Department of Indian Affairs were willing to pay the amount for rent of the land we use for farming, for the year 1927. Then Dr. Westgate asked if the Department would be willing to pay the M.S.C.C. for the years that the School had paid the rent during the three years that the M.S.C.C. had been in control of the school. But when the matter was referred to me, I asked the Department rather than pay back the past rentals already paid, if the Dept. would consider buying a piece of land adjoining the School. And the Dept. answered that they would consider this in April 1928.\n\nI am writing now to ask if the Dept. are willing to pay the rent for 1927, as according to the arrangement at the time of writing. The rent is past due, and I must requisition from the M.S.C.C. if the Dept. were not willing to do so.\n\nPlease accept our sincere gratitude for all your kind consideration.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 17, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to rental for the past year on land that is used by the Shingwauk Home. The Department has agreed to an expenditure of approximately $250 in this connection, and, if you will forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, in favour of the owner, I shall be glad to see that cheque issues.\n\nI note that you state the Department promised to consider buying a piece of land which adjoins the school. If you will examine my letter of August 18th, last in this connection, you will note that I asked you to secure a definite proposal. As you made no reply, a note was not taken for estimates for the coming fiscal year, and I regret that there will be no funds available for the purpose in the immediate future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Then after some time there came out the fact that the property had been sold for taxes, and that it was in the hands of a man by the name of Irwin, but the Agent thought the original owner would regain it, so we are sorry that nothing can be done this year. We will try to watch the proceeding in this case, and if possible, the Department may be in a position to take the matter up next year.\n\nWe would like you to know that we feel that we are receiving some very great favors, and we are appreciating them, and also enjoying very much some of them.

I have just received from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home, the original of a letter addressed to him with regard to a piece of land which would be suitable for this purpose, and enclose for your information, a copy of this letter. You will note that it comprises thirty-seven acres, and is for sale at the rate of $100.00 an acre. With regard to this land, the Principal states that it is very desirable as it would enable the School Management to do all the farm and garden work required, without going away from the School. For some years, land has been rented by our Society and paid for at the rate of $250.00 a year. That land known as the Rankin Holding is situated approximately three miles from the Shingwauk Home, and much time was lost by the School Management in going backwards and forwards over so great a distance. As it does not seem probable that additional land will be procurable at the price quoted in the letter and in such close proximity to the land already compris...\nthe School property, I commend to your sympathetic consideration the Principal's suggestion, that this land should be purchased and handed over to the Shingwauk Home for the benefit of that institution.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nDICTATED BUT NOT PERSONALLY SIGNED\nBECAUSE OF ABSENCE FROM THE OFFICE\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6213)\n\nFile 469-5, part 5\nCaradoc Agency - Shingwauk Residential School\n- Church of England - Building Maintenance -\nAccounts - Supplies - Principal's Res. 1935 -\n1937.\n\nFile 469-5, part 6\nCaradoc Agency - Shingwauk Residential School\n- Church of England - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1935 - 1937.\n\nFile 469-5, part 7\nCaradoc Agency - Shingwauk Residential School\n- Church of England - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts. 1939 - 1944.\n\nFile 469-5, part 8\nCaradoc Agency - Shingwauk Residential School\n- Church of England - Building Maintenance -\nSupplies - Accounts - General Administration.\n1945 - 1949.\n\nFile 469-5X, part 1\nCaradoc Agency - Shingwauk Residential School\n- Church of England - Appointment of Inspector\nof Construction. 1906 - 1936.\n\nFile 469-9, part 1\nCaradoc Agency - Shingwauk Residential School\n- Church of England - School Land (Plan, Map)\n- General Administration. 1927 - 1942.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV. DR. WESTGATE,\nDATED JANUARY 18, 1927.\n\nOne of the most urgent needs of this school, and\nit was referred to your Department some time ago, is the\nneed of additional land. The school has at present only\n49 acres set apart for its use. In addition to this,\n90 acres are rented every year and for which our Society\npays an annual rental of $50.00. The rented land is situated\nabout two miles from the school, and can only be worked at\nconsiderable inconvenience to the school management.\n\nSide by side with the school property there is a piece\nof approximately 49 acres belonging to one, Mr. W. H.\nof 261 - 5th Ave., New York. This land is now\navailable I understand at the rate of $100.00 an acre,\nas it is never likely to be cheaper, I beg to strongly\nrecommend that this land be purchased by your Department\nand set apart for the use of this school.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Rental charges for land, Shingwank Home.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring my interview with the Superintendent of Indian Education on the 1st inst. I directed his attention to the fact that our Society has been obliged to pay yearly since we undertook the administration of the Shingwank Home the sum of $250 for land rented for the use of this institution, and requested that we be relieved from this expenditure. The Superintendent of Indian Education informed me that as the buildings and land at this institution belonged to the Church your Department were unable to purchase more land for School purposes and advised that the rental charges of $250 be included in the list of requirements submitted to your Department towards the close of each calendar year. This advice will, of course, be followed, but it seems to our Commission that our Society should not only receive a grant to cover this amount this year, but a similar grant to cover the amount which has been expended for this purpose in past years. As our Society assumed responsibility for the administration of this School from Jan. 1st 1922 the total rental charges paid for the use of land will amount, at the end of the current calendar year to $1500 and it seems but reasonable to our Commission that the funds of our Society should be reimbursed to this extent. As the total cost of requirements submitted in our last for the School for this year is $1800 I trust that your Department may give favourable consideration to this request, and furnish a Departmental cheque for the sum mentioned.\n\nBelieve me Sir, Yours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

If this land can be obtained at a reasonable price, the Department might consider the purchase some time during the next fiscal year.

Then Dr Westgate asked if the Department would be willing to pay the M.S.C.C. for the years that the School had paid the rent during the three years that the M.S.C.C. had been in control of the school. But when the matter was referred to me, I asked the Department rather than pay back the past rentals already paid, if the Dept. would consider buying a piece of land adjoining the School. And the Dept. answered that they would consider this in April 1928.\n\nI am writing now to ask if the Dept. are willing to pay the rent for 1927, as according to the arrangement at the time of writing. The rent is past due, and I must requisition from the M.S.C.C. if the Dept. were not willing to do so.\n\nPlease accept our sincere gratitude for all your kind consideration.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 17, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to rental for the past year on land that is used by the Shingwauk Home. The Department has agreed to an expenditure of approximately $250 in this connection, and, if you will forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, in favour of the owner, I shall be glad to see what cheque issues.\n\nI note that you state the Department promised to consider buying a piece of land which adjoins the school. If you will examine my letter of August 16th, last, in this connection, you will note that I asked you to secure a definite proposal.

Then after some time there came out the fact that the property had been sold for taxes, and that it was in the hands of a man by the name of Irwin.

The property owned by our client is the west half of Lot 2, Con. 1, Township of St. Mary, now situated in the City of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nWe understand that the matter of the purchase of this property, as an addition to the Shingwauk farm lands, has already been brought to your attention, and, in fact, that the matter has been taken up by you with the Indian Department which is prepared to purchase the property. The property consists of 49 acres, and the owner is prepared to sell it at $100.00 an acre. This price is put on the property because the owner gets it by reason of his mortgage, and does not desire to hold the property but simply to realize his money out of it. The figure at which it is offered is a very low figure.\n\nThe property itself is comprised of good arable land, and would be a decided addition to the Shingwauk farm lands. For some years past, as you are aware, the Home has been renting part of the property known as the Rankin location, and situated probably two miles east of the Home, paying an annual rental therefor of $250.00. We understand from Mr. Fuller that if our client's property was purchased, it would be more convenient for the purposes of the Home, and it would save the annual outlay in the way of rentals, to which we have referred, the land itself being probably better land than that rented in the Rankin Location. If this purchase is to be made it will be necessary, of course, that the purchase price should be in the Departmental estimates, if the same is not in the estimates of last Session. Will you please let us hear from you if the Society is prepared to recommend this purchase, and if so, that it will take it up with the Department.\n\nIf the purchase is to be made we suggest that the acreage, which we believe to be 49 acres, be surveyed prior to completion of the purchase, and that the sale be carried through at the rate of $100.00 per acre.\nSecretary, M.S.O.C.\n\nNovember 21st., 1928\n\nOur client is prepared, of course, to make a formal offer on the above terms, good until some time next Spring, to enable the Department to act, and the sale to be carried through, if that is desired.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nROWLAND & ATKIN\n\nBy: P.

It is the earnest wish of our Society, however, that the School management should be saved the inconvenience and expense of having to travel as they do at present to the rented land from two to three miles away and I am enclosing herewith for your careful and sympathetic consideration, an offer of very suitable land for the School's purpose, and at what appears to me to be a reasonable valuation. This land lies in contact with the School land on the side nearest the city of St. Marie, and as it is never again likely to be offered for sale at the rate quoted in the enclosed letter, I greatly hope that the offer may receive the prompt and careful consideration which it deserves.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The farm at the school consists of forty-nine (49) acres, of which only about twenty (20) can be cultivated. The Department has been allowing $250 a year to pay rent for a farm situated about two miles from the school.\n\nMr. Fuller pointed out that this latter farm is very inconvenient for many reasons that will readily suggest themselves.\n\nThe property that has been offered to them has an area of forty-nine (49) acres and immediately adjoins the present school property on the side nearest to Sault Ste. Marie. Approximately thirty-seven (37) acres of this is situated north of the road running in front of the school while the balance is between the road and the river. In the event of this land being purchased, it would be necessary to have it brushed and stumped. It has been offered to the school at a cost of $100 an acre and Mr. Fuller considers that, in view of its close proximity to Sault Ste. Marie, this is a fair figure.\nREV. B. P. FULLER\nBAULT STE. MARIE.\nONTARIO\n\nDecember 28th, 1928.\n\nMr. J. D. McLean,\nDeputy Assistant,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAgain we have to come to you for assistance. When our Commission came to you to purchase additional land for the School your Department asked that we continue to farm the rented land, known as \"The Rankin Location.\" And that the Department would pay the rent for same until such time as the Department would decide regarding the purchase of the proposed additional land. This rent is due now for the present year 1928. Would you kindly consider this matter, and send the amount $250.00 to cover the rent.\n\nRe: Transfer of School property to Government.\n\nFor many years we the Staff of the School have been fully convinced that it would be to the very best interest of the School, and a solution of many problems if the school property could be transferred to the Government, and owned by them.\n\nThis matter has been often suggested to the Executive of our Church, and the principal of the school, but the Bishop wishing to retain the ownership has never been willing to consider this proposal. Now our Commission, the M.S.C.O., are willing that this should be, believing it to be by far the best for the interest of the School.\n\nWe have hope now that this matter could be considered from the Church point of view, from the fact that we have a new Bishop, and as changes must naturally take place from time to time, the present Bishop may see with us that it would be advisable to ask the Government to receive this proposal and consider the matter, which if approved by them would be a solution to the purchase of the additional land which lies next to the school land on the city side.\n\nI will write our Bishop on this matter at once and ascertain His Lordship's opinion regarding this.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal of the Shingwauk Home and the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada have been in touch with us for a year past in reference to the Laird property being acquired for farming purposes in connection with the Shingwauk Home. The Shingwauk Home badly needs additional land. We are informed that the matter has been taken up with your Department and the correspondence of a year ago indicated that the Department was prepared to acquire the land for use at the Shingwauk Home. We are now requested by the M.S.O.C. to write you in the matter before disposing of the land elsewhere. Accordingly we do so, and beg to state that, by reason of the fact that Mortgages only desires to obtain his own money out of the property and is not looking for a profit on the transaction, he is prepared to sell the property, comprising approximately 49 acres, at $100.00 an acre.

Will you kindly consider this matter.\n\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank you for all that has been done for our school during the past year; we appreciate very much the help that has been given by the Department. We have done the best we could with the grant we received, doing the work ourselves and the rooms look bright and clean. I wish especially to thank you for the account paid to Dunsmuir and McClary for repairs to the heating system, because the damage was done when I was down with the flu, and I felt rather guilty over the affair.

In our list of requirements for the next fiscal year, an item has been enclosed in this connection and I trust that provision may be made to secure the land which is so much required. The Rankin Holding for which your Department now pays rent is too far away from the Home to be conveniently used by the school management.\n\nIn a letter just received from Messrs. Rowland & Atkin, Barristers, S. S. Marie, they state that the 49 acres known as the Laird property, and which they have for sale, can now be sold at a substantial reduction under the assessment value of $6,000.00. I have asked this firm to take the matter up with the local Indian Agent and the new Principal and ask your representative to lay the situation before you.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-9, part 1)\nJanuary 3, 1930.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nCanon Gould visited the Department this morning and discussed the site of the proposed new Shingwauk Home. He represented that we might have to go somewhat distant from the Soo to find suitable farm land on the reserve. He stressed the advantages of remaining on or near the present site, which has power and water from the town.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nWith further reference to the matters discussed between us in our interview held on Friday, the 3rd inst., I beg permission to place in writing the following considerations:\n\nI. The proposal for the erection of new buildings for the Shingwauk Home Indian Residential School. My understanding is that, all matters relating to the site of the new buildings, as between the existing general location, or a new location to be chosen on the Garden River Reserve, are left completely open for reconsideration and examination before a final decision is made. In this connection I would suggest that, as in other similar cases, an examination of alternative sites be made by representatives, acting jointly, of the Department and of the Missionary Society. If this suggestion meets with your approval, we should be prepared, at such time as you may desire, to appoint our representatives.\n\nThe Bishop of Algoma, in his letter to me, dated December 11th, 1929, states in part, as follows:\n\n\"Such members of the Executive (that is the Executive Committee of the Diocese of Algoma) as were available made personally a very thorough examination of the Home, and agree unreservedly with the Deputy Superintendent General that the Shingwauk Home is 'no longer suitable for purposes of an Indian Residential School.'\n\n\"The Diocese holds both land and School under a trust dated as long ago as 1875.\" The terms of this trust, however allow of the disposal of the properties in question.\nproviding that the sums accruing be invested and the profits used \"for the purposes of Indian education in the Shingwauk Home.\"\n\nThe Bishop states further the following reasons in favor of the retention of the present general site:\n\n\"The Committee feels strongly that the present site, or the high land at the back of the present school, which forms part of the Shingwauk land, should be retained, and sincerely hopes that the Department will be strongly pressed to abandon the idea of a site on the Garden River Reserve. In support of this opinion, we would advance the following reasons:-\n\n(A) From the present school it is quite easy to take the children who attend Sault Ste Marie Collegiate Institute to and from their school, in a car in summer and in a sleigh in winter, a distance of less than three miles. The children of members of the Staff are able, too, to attend school in the City. If the School were moved to Garden River, it would be almost impossible to do this, as the distance would be at least nine miles and perhaps considerably more. In this connection it should be stated that if the school were removed to the Reserve, which is outside the City limits, the Home would have to pay tuition fees at the Collegiate Institute for the children who attend.\n\n(B) The Bishop Fauquier Memorial Chapel would not be able to be used as a school church. This is a beautiful church, conveniently situated, and both present and past members of the school have a deep affection for it.\n\n(C) The present cemetery would be neglected. In this cemetery lie several great friends and benefactors of the school, such as its first trustee, Bishop Fauquier, the late Archdeacon Gillmor, Mrs Fuller, and Miss McNeill a faithful worker in the school, besides a large number of Indian pupils. It would be a great grief to the old pupils and friends of the school if the cemetery, which is so sacred a place to them, were to be cut off entirely from the care of the school authorities and neglected.\n\n(D) The Garden River Reserve is absolutely cut off from the City in winter. There is only one train a day in each direction which stops at the station, and it is impossible for members of the staff and their friends to go down by one train and up by the other, as the times of arrival and departure are too close together.\"\nThere are many people in the City who take a personal interest in the school and go to visit it from time to time, including many who are not members of our Church. This is a very valuable humanizing influence for the pupils and a source of pleasure and inspiration to the staff. To maintain this contact and keep up this interest would be much more difficult, even in summer, if the school were moved to the Reserve.\n\nThe Principal feels that it is better for the Indian children not to be too near to the Reserve. His experience has shown him that they are easier to manage when away from the influence of their own people.\n\nThe land of the Reserve is not very good for the purposes of the School Farm. The only parts available for the school are of too sandy a character to be useful for agricultural work.\n\nThe present site of the Home is almost an ideal one. It is just within the City limits, guaranteeing all City conveniences, such as water, light, etc., and yet it is away from the crowded traffic of the City. It is only a mile from the street cars, and there is a good road, so that the problem of transportation is an easy one. It faces the river, and therefore buildings can never be erected opposite it; and it overlooks Bellevue Park, which will keep it for all time from being crowded out by city buildings.\n\nThese reasons appear to us to constitute a well-nigh unanswerable argument in favor of retaining the present site, or at least one upon some part of the land at present belonging to the school, say \"the higher ground behind the present site\", as suggested in Dr. Westgate's letter to me of January 14th, 1929.\n\nI cannot add much in support of the above strong presentation of consideration in favor of a site for the new buildings on the existing general location, except to say that, from the scenic and publicity standpoint, buildings erected on the rising ground a short distance behind the existing buildings, would occupy a site superior, probably, to any other in the Dominion; in that they would hold a very prominent place, in the view of the Canadian shore, to every passenger on every steamer passing up or down the River.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-9, part 1)\nJanuary 14, 1930.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to a site for the proposed new Shingwauk Home. Very careful consideration will be given before a decision is made. I note that there are many advantages if the present property is used. You might arrange with the diocesan authorities for an early proposal concerning the transfer of the property to the Department. I note that the terms of the trust allow disposal if the proceeds are used for Indian education. Does not this suggest that the purchase price should be minimal? As an early decision concerning the site is desirable, perhaps you would be good enough to immediately communicate with the Bishop of Algoma.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould, D.D., D.C.L., M.D.,\nGeneral Secretary, M. S. C. G.,\n604 Jarvis St.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-9, part 1)\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nYour letter, dated the 16th inst., serial number 13-0-9, \"with reference to a site for the proposed new Shingwauk H\u00e9me\", received.\n\nI interpret your letter to mean that, if satisfactory terms can be arranged for the transfer, to the Department, of the properties, including land, now held under a Trust Deed by the Diocese of Algoma, you would be prepared to accept it as the location for the new Shingwauk Home, as against a suggested alternative location on the Garden River Reserve.\n\nViewed from this general standpoint I feel confident of the co-operation of the diocesan authorities. The terms of the proposed transfer, viewed from the financial standpoint - whether a nominal sum, or a moderately substantial amount - would, in my judgment, be strongly influenced, and perhaps determined, by specific provisions being made in the terms of transfer safeguarding the terms in the Trust under which the property is held by the Diocese of Algoma, for the purposes of Indian Education in connection with the Church of England in Canada.\n\nA decision on this important aspect of the matter would be facilitated if it does not require, a visit by me to Sault Ste Marie for personal conference with the diocesan authorities. In this connection I regret to find that my existing list of engagements, which cannot be changed, prohibit such a visit to Sault Ste Marie, before the first week in March. I trust that this unavoidable delay will not retard, in any way, the development...\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,...........\n\nof your plans for the provision of the proposed new buildings. In the meanwhile I will correspond further with the diocesan authorities.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nSG-G\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nDear Sir:\n\nRecently I received a letter from Messrs Rowland & Atkin, Barristers, Sault Ste. Marie relative to rental of land on the Rankin Estate and which the Department of Indian Affairs have paid rental annually of $250.00.\n\nAs the rent due for year 1929 is still unpaid, will the Department kindly attend to this matter, and make cheque payable to Rankin Realty, Sault Ste.

Certain of the conditions mentioned in Canon Gould's letter were under discussion. Mr. Boyce was informed it would cost the Department several thousand dollars to place the materials of the wrecked buildings at the disposal of the Diocese and that a very much better price could be secured if the wreckers were allowed to dispose of the materials. Mr. Orr believes that the old material would be of very little value to the Diocese and none to the Department in connection with the reconstruction.\n\nThe other question under discussion was the provision that a farm of not less than 150 acres of good arable land in a suitable position should be attached to the new school. Mr. Boyce was informed that the M.S.C.O. could leave this question quite safely with the Department without making reference to it in the transfer.\n\nRussell F. Ferrier\n\nIndian Affairs.

Principal of the Shingwauk Home, with reference to farming equipment. The Department doubts the advisability of supplying a tractor for this school, as the farming operations are not on a large scale. With regard to milk cows, Mr. Hives should prepare a statement, showing what animals they now have and indicating how much milk is being produced. The young stock should also be mentioned. This should be the subject of a separate communication from your office. Could the fencing requested stand for the time being? As you are aware, the Department has to include in its Estimates items for future expenditure, and no provision has been made for the fencing requested. You might let me have a communication concerning the urgency of this improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nG. H.

(RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the list of requirements for the Shingwauk Home submitted to your Department this autumn, and to be provided during the fiscal year 1931, (see page 4 h. of the list) additional land was included, and your attention directed to my letter of Oct. 17th, 1929, with regard to a parcel of 49 acres located alongside the present school property.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of a letter received by the Principal of the Shingwauk Home dealing further with this question and making reference to the terms on which a further parcel of 57 acres could also be purchased for the use of the school.\n\nWhen forwarding the enclosed letter to me, the Principal wrote, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I may say that owing to the dry season, our grain crop was almost a failure, and therefore the harvest was very poor. I may also say that owing to the fact that our farm land is located two miles away from the Shingwauk Home, it is almost impossible to do any successful farming of grain. The land does not get the attention it should, and consequently it is in a very dirty and impoverished state.\n\nA great deal of time and labour was spent on the land during last Spring and Summer, but so much time is wasted on the road, and it is impossible to do much hauling on account of the bad road, that most of the work done and time spent was of very little avail.\n\nI would urgently recommend that the properties adjoining the...\"\nschool lands, and belonging to Laird, and Rowland, comprising nearly one hundred acres of very good land, be purchased for the Shingwauk Home. This matter has been under consideration now for a number of years. The need is just as urgent as it ever was. In fact, now that our pupilage is increased, and future prospects of a further increase appear, the need seems to me to be the more urgent.\n\nFor your information, I enclose herewith a letter received sometime ago in this connection, giving the details regarding the price of the land. I am of the opinion that the Rowland land could be bought for considerably less than is quoted in the enclosed letter.\n\nThe potato crop generally was rather a failure this year, and generally speaking there was a third of a crop. Garden produce was fairly good considering the land we had to use. I may say that next year our farming activities should be very much more encouraging, as we have practically all our land prepared. The garden land in particular has had a lot of time and labour spent on it this Fall.\"\n\nAs your Department has agreed to supersede the present Shingwauk Home with a new school building, it seems to me that steps should be taken at the same time to provide this school with the additional land required for its successful operation, and as the parcels mentioned in the enclosed letter are available for purchase at the present time, and appear to be suitable in every way in addition to being conveniently located to the present school property, I would strongly recommend that some definite action be taken in the matter without any further delay.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nEncl.\n\nTBRW/JF\n\nIndian Affairs.

The amount being $250.00 per annum, and which the Department have heretofore paid. Will you kindly forward a cheque for that amount to their agents, Rowland & Atkin, Barristers, Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. C. F. Hives\nPrincipal\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to place before you a matter of importance, relative to farm lands which we have recently had to give up. This land, known as the Rankin Estate, has been rented for us by the Department for some years, at a cost of $250.00 per annum. We have had to depend entirely on this land for our hay and much of our pasture. It has now changed hands, and the present owner is dividing it into small plots and selling it. We, therefore, have to look for other land.\n\nIn regard to the Shingwauk Property, of which there are some 90 acres, I may say that not more than half is fit for cultivation, and the balance makes extremely poor pasture land, on account of its rocky nature. It is therefore very necessary that we have more land in order to supply the necessary hay, grain and roots for our own consumption.\n\nDuring the last few days, since the snow has disappeared, I have been looking around for a farm, and the only land, so far available, is a farm of 75 acres lying to the west of the city, belonging to Doctor McGeig. I may say this land is very good, and is all under cultivation, and would suit our purpose, except that it is six miles away, which, of course, cannot be helped.\n\nIn regard to the rent, I may say the owner is asking $300.00 per annum, which, considering the quality of the land, is a fair price.\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience, kindly asking them if we may rent this land at the price mentioned.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGorden Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose a communication from Rev. G.F. Hives Principal of Shingwauk Home asking that the Department lease certain lands for farming purposes.\n\nI might say that as the Rankin Location has been sold it is very necessary that other lands be secured for the School. Therefore, I would recommend that Mr. Hives request be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

It is noted that the rent will be $300 a year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\nDear Sir:\n\nAgain I have to place before you a matter regarding land to supplement what we have at the Shingwauk Home. The Department has recently very kindly consented to rent for us a farm, and we have done the necessary Spring work on it, and will, I feel sure, harvest sufficient hay and grain from it for our own use. But, unfortunately, it is seven miles away, and too far to be of any use to us as a pasture. (I may say the reason for our getting this piece of land, which is so far away, is because it was the only farm available.) We have only sufficient cows to provide milk for ourselves, but even at that, we lack pasture for them, and we must have more, or I am afraid our milk production will decrease.\n\nThere is a piece of land nearby, which would afford a good pasture, and which can be rented for $100.00 per year. Will you kindly place this matter before the Department, at your earliest convenience, asking them if they would rent this land for us.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Major,\nSeconded by Rev. John Tate,\n\n\"That this Executive Committee of the Diocese of Algoma, having considered the proposal to transfer the land in connection with the Shingwauk Home (with the exception of the site of the Chapel and the Cemetery) to the Department of Indian Affairs, lays down the following as the principle to which they feel committed by the terms of the trust under which the property is now held by the Synod of Algoma.\n\n\"The essential element in such transfer is the preservation and continuance of the terms of the present trust held by the Diocese of Algoma; which provide that the properties, or their proceeds if sold, must be applied for all time to the purposes of Indian Residential School education, with complete liberty regarding religious instruction under the administration and control of the Church of England in Canada.\n\n\"The Executive Committee approves of the transfer to the Department of the said land, with the exceptions noted, for the erection thereon by the Department of an Indian Residential School to replace the present Shingwauk Home, upon conditions which will embody in the terms of transfer the requirements of the trust; it being specified that should the Department cease to use the property in accordance with these terms, then the land shall, at that time, be purchased by the Department at a current valuation to be agreed upon by the Department and the Executive Committee of the Diocese of Algoma.\"\n\"The Department shall purchase any building or buildings which may continue in use in connection with the new school. All other buildings taken over, including the main building of the existing school, shall be wrecked and removed by the Department, which shall also fill in the excavation.\n\n\"The Department shall further supplement the land transferred by the purchase or rental of such additional land as may be necessary to provide a farm sufficient in size to meet the requirements of the new school in the way of farm produce, milk, eggs, etc.\" Carried.\n\nI assume that the above resolution represents still the mind of the Authorities of the diocese of Algoma, owner of the property. I am therefore forwarding a copy of your letter, together with copy of this reply, to the Right Reverend Rockborough R. Smith, Lord Bishop of Algoma, \"Bishophurst\", Sault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nI am leaving in a few days for a month's absence in Western Canada, and suggest that you conduct any further correspondence required, directly with the Bishop of Algoma.\n\nWe are all very pleased that the Shingwauk Home is now to be provided with the new buildings so urgently needed for so long a time.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Secretary\n1st October, 1934.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nOn the 18th ultimo we wrote Reverend Canon Gould with respect to the proposed transfer of the Shingwauk Home property to the Department and have received his reply dated the 21st ultimo in which he states that a copy of these letters has been sent to you. It is presumed that the Church is still prepared to carry out the proposition which was made sometime ago, and I should be glad accordingly if you would forward your deed or deeds containing a description of the property to be conveyed and the terms of the trust which are referred to in the Resolution of the 11th March and 8th April, 1930, so that we may prepare the transfer.

You will remember that in that resolution we desired to retain possession of the site of the Chapel and the cemetery. There is also another small building that we would like to retain, namely, a small house on the opposite side of the road from the Shingwauk Home, and not immediately opposite it but opposite the Chapel. We have spent quite an amount of money on this recently fitting it up as a residence for a retired clergyman. I do not think it is in the least likely that the Department will wish to have possession of this house or the land on which it stands, but it will be extremely useful to us, and its retention by the Diocese will in no way interfere with the Home. Our Diocesan Registrar, Mr. Redmond Thomas, a solicitor practising in Bracebridge, usually draws up any transfers of property for us, and as he is familiar with our trusts regarding church education, I would like him to prepare this transfer which I will submit to you for your approval before signing it. If you will let me know if this proposition is agreeable to you, I will have the matter taken in hand at an early date.\n\nMay I be allowed to add that we are very much pleased that the Department is proceeding to give the Shingwauk Home so satisfactory and worthy a building in which to carry on the important work which the Home has done for so many years.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n+Rocksborough R.

I may say that the transfer should be made to His Majesty King George the Fifth, as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Reverend Rockborough R.

Marie for the Shingwauk Home, and Mr. H. S. Hamilton, barrister, was instructed in the matter. In August, 1930, you advised that the matter was to stand pending certain instructions. Mr. Hamilton now asks if any further services are required to be performed by him, as he would like to render his account. Will you please let me know what the situation is?\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister of Justice.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 13th October, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour File B-5684\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the proposed acquisition of what is known as the Shingwauk Home property at Sault Ste Marie, and note that in 1930 Mr. H.S. Hamilton, Barrister, had been instructed in the matter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the property in question belongs to the Church of England. Just prior to 1930 the Department proposed to build a new Indian residential school in consideration of which the Church authorities proposed conveying the property to the Department. The proposal at that time was abandoned. Now, however, under the Public Works Construction Act 1934, the sum of $500,000 was allowed to the Department of Indian Affairs out of which the Department now proposes to erect the said building. The Church authorities are having their solicitor prepare a conveyance for our approval. When this is received we shall ask you to have your Agent search the title to see that everything is in order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,\n\nOttawa. Deputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose herewith account of our agent, Mr. H. S.

Please issue a cheque in favour of Mr. Hamilton for this amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Minister.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA\nNovember 12th, 1934.\n\nMEMO.\n\nDr. MacMillan,\n\nI submit herewith an account of $51.00 of Messrs. O'Flynn, Hamilton and Carmichael, Barristers, Solicitors, etc., Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. This account has been taxed by the Justice Department at $31.00. I should be pleased to have your approval of same so that payment may be made.\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI thought perhaps you might like to have some information regarding the land we would like to get for a farm. I am therefore enclosing a letter from the owner, which will give you an idea what they are willing to do. Before doing anything definite in the way of purchasing it, I would like to go over the land thoroughly, and I could then make a report to you if you wished it.\n\nI am enclosing an old plan which shows how it is situated, and I have marked the proposed farm in pencil, and also the Shingwauk property.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nDoctor Harold McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 6th, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the land which you would like to obtain for farming purposes.\n\nIt is noted from the letter from Mr. M. J. Dacey that he refers to two hundred and fifty-five (255) acres. Last fall, Dr. Westgate informed the Department that there were two hundred (200) acres which could be secured at a cost of $4,000, and, in view of Dr. Westgate's report, the Department was under the impression that it would not require more than $4,000 to acquire all the land required for farm purposes.\n\nA definite decision regarding whether or not funds will be available for the purchase of more land will have to be deferred until after the first of April, when our appropriation for the fiscal year 1935-36 is available. In the meantime, I would appreciate having a report from you regarding Mr. Dacey's land. You should state how much of this is under cultivation and how many acres it would be necessary to clear, also the approximate cost of clearing.\n\nIn the event of Mr. Dacey's land being secured, would it be sufficient for the purposes of the school or would it still be necessary to continue renting the same land as has been rented in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

H. Gisborne that he has had an interview with you, as Solicitor to the Department, and has gone over the draft agreement regarding the above school which I sent to him from the Solicitor who is Registrar to this Diocese. I understand that you approved of the document but that he urged that it should be specifically mentioned that the Crown should not only erect the buildings but also maintain them. This, of course, has always been a part of the agreement. If you agree, I should be very glad if you will kindly alter the draft to that effect.\n\nHe says that it was arranged that the Department should send me correct copies in duplicate for execution. I suppose that this means three copies, namely, one for the Department, one for the Diocese and the third for registration.\n\nI enclose a blueprint of the survey which will illustrate the description given in the document. In order to make the matter quite clear, I may mention that the four pieces of land which it is not proposed to hand over to the Department are as follows:\n\n1.

The part surrounded by the heavy red line contains 200 acres, more or less. This land is just three quarters of a mile from our school property and borders on the city limits. It is fairly good land, which has been a very heavy forest before timber was taken off. It is now, more or less, covered with small bush. The price per acre is eighteen dollars, which is two dollars less than they originally asked for it. I am informed that the land is free of any mortgage etc., and that a clear title can be had. I do not know of any more desirable land to be bought within reasonable distance, and would recommend that the site described by the enclosed plan be bought to supplement our present farm.\n\nOf course, such a piece of land will require a great deal of hard work in order to make a farm of it. It will have to be fenced first of all, then gradually cleared of bush, and broken up. I think if we reckon on clearing and breaking up fifty acres each year, and reckon on spending one thousand dollars each year for this purpose, we should have a good productive farm at the end of three or four years.\n\nIf the Department decides to buy this land for us, I would like to get at the fencing as soon as possible, and would recommend that the fencing be done this fall in the event of your purchasing the land.\n\nI would also recommend that the Department appoint a surveyor to traverse the proposed location so that the lines may be clearly defined.\nOctober 16, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe sum of $4,000.00 is provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, to purchase 200 acres of land for use of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.

The Principal recommends that a surveyor traverse the proposed location, so that the lines of the property may be clearly defined. It would be advisable to have the boundaries of the property clearly defined, in order to prevent any question in future.\n\nThe Principal has requested that the unexpended portion of the appropriation - approximately $400 - be used to purchase fencing material, as he states if the Department proceeds with the purchase of the land, he would like to have some of the fencing carried out this fall.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marie (Electoral District of Algoma West), Ont., I have to say that this land is located three quarters of a mile from the east boundary of the 90 acres owned by the Government, on which the school buildings are erected. The west boundary of the property which it is proposed to acquire adjoins the east boundary of the city of Sault Ste. Marie. I attach hereto a plan, showing, outlined in green, the 90 acres on which the school buildings are located and showing the 200 acres which it is proposed to purchase, outlined in red.

The land was to be purchased from M.J.Dacey and his associates at $18.00 per acre.\n\nMr. Dacey has seen me and pointed out that other lands have been sold by him in the vicinity for farm purposes and they have been paid $20. an acre for the land. The appraiser apparently places the land in question at about $3.00 an acre. He also states that his inspection was made while the ground was frozen and with six inches of snow on it.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to secure land for the purpose contemplated, I am anxious that the Department be assured that the Field Supervisor's appraisal is a fair one.

July 8.\nJuly 15, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have Mr. Pratt's memorandum of the 11th instant, with attached letter from Mr. R. S. Hamilton, Barrister, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., regarding the purchase of farm lands for the use of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School.\n\nThe land in question comprises Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, River Range, Twp. of Parantous, District of Algoma, and situated about one-half mile east of the city limits, comprising approximately 200 acres.\n\nFunds to purchase this land were provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the fiscal year ending March 31st, last. A field supervisor of the Soldier Settlement Board made an appraisal of this land in December, 1935, and reported that, in his estimation it is not suitable for agricultural purposes. No further action was taken.\n\nThere is no doubt the school needs more land for farming purposes, and the Principal of the school stated, as the land was appraised when the ground was frozen and covered with snow, that the appraiser was unable to give a fair judgment as to\n\n- the value\nthe value of the land. The Principal obtained a price of $15.00 per acre from the Dacey-Best Realty Company, Sault Ste. Marie, the owners of the land. The appraiser stated that, with no improvements, such as fences, water supply, or buildings, the land was not worth more than $3.00 per acre. At the present time, the Department is renting a farm for pastureage at a rental of $100.00 per annum and, also, land for farm purposes at a rental of $300.00 per annum.\n\nThere are no funds in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year to purchase the land in question; but, if you approve, an item could be included in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, to provide the amount required. In the meantime, if you direct, another appraisal could be made of the land.\n\nAs requested, I return attached hereto,\n\nMr. Hamilton's letter.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nHouse of Commons\nCanada\n\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario,\nAugust 11th, 1936.\n\nT. McGookin, Esq.,\nInspector, Department of\nIndian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. McGookin:\n\nYou will recall that when you were here, I discussed with you an offer made by Dacey-Best Realty Company for the sale of a certain acreage for use by the Shingwauk Indian Home for farm purposes. Mr. Hives was favourable to the purchase of this acreage but an inspection was made by an appraiser from the Soldiers' Settlement Board, I think, and his report was adverse. As a result, the matter was dropped for the time being. I felt that the inspection had not been made under favourable circumstances so as to be fair to those offering the property or to the land itself, and you will recall we discussed having a couple of qualified practical men look the land over under favourable conditions existing during the Summer months.\n\nHas anything been done to proceed with this inspection and valuation? If not, I would appreciate your putting the matter in line for attention at the earliest date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nM. P. FOR ALGOMA WEST\n\nHSH/MB\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Sutherland,\n\nRe. Col. Hamilton's letter hereunder. In discussing the matter of land purchase with Col. Hamilton and Agent Sims the suggestion was made to have a party of three disinterested local farmers make a survey of the land mentioned and put a valuation on it. I concur in this.\n\nI think the matter of the purchase of these lots should be given further consideration in view of the fact that the survey by the Field Supervisor was made in mid-winter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nINSPECTOR.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, August 15th, 1936.\n\nMr. A.S. Williams,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 15th ultimo, file 13-0-8, in connection with the letter the Minister received from Mr. H.S. Hamilton, barrister of Sault Ste. Marie, the point that Mr. Hamilton has emphasized in his correspondence with the Minister is that the valuation of the Supervisor of the Soldier Settlement Board was made at a time when he could not properly examine the land. I think it would be the wish of the Minister if he were here that you would arrange to have the Soldier Settlement Board make another valuation before the snow is on the ground when it can be determined what the real value of the property is.\n\nG.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\nAugust 18, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Magladery:\n\nIn December, last, a field supervisor of the Soldier Settlement Board made an appraisal of Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, River Range, Twp. of Tarentoros, District of Algoma, situated about one-half mile east of the city limits of the city of Sault Ste. Marie. The Department has in view the purchase of this land - approximately 200 acres - for farm purposes in connection with the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. At the time your officer visited the property, the ground was frozen and there was about 6 inches of snow, so that no definite classification of soils could be made.\n\nA request has been received for another appraisal of this property, and I should be pleased if you will arrange to have an officer of the Soldier Settlement Board visit the property and submit his appraisal of the land. The officer, in his report, should state what he considers a fair price for the land and also if, when cleared of small bush, it would be suitable for farm purposes. Your officer should consult Mr. G. H. Sims, the Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, who would accompany him to the property and give him any information he requires. Any expense in the matter will be paid upon receipt of a certified account, in triplicate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThomas Magladery, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Immigration & Colonization,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When the appraisal was made last fall, there was snow on the ground, so that no definite classification of soils could be made. The officer who will make the re-appraisal of the property, viz.: Lots, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, River Range, has been requested to consult you, and I would request that you accompany him to the property and give him any information he requires.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

McGill, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nYour letter regarding another valuation being made of approximately two hundred acres of land for school purposes at the Shingwauk Home here, received.\n\nI note that an officer of the Soldiers Settlement Board is being asked to visit the property and submit his appraisal. In view of the fact that the previous valuation was made by one of their officers, I think it only fair that some other officer or person make the new appraisal. The natural tendency of the official who has already made it would be to come somewhat near his previous one and that, I am informed by those interested, is exceptionally low. I suggest, therefore, that somebody other than the official who made the previous appraisal, make the new one. When Mr. McCookin was here a short time ago, we discussed it and thought that probably two good practical farmers from this section would be a good idea. My only interest is to avoid a feeling that a fair valuation, under proper conditions, has not been given to the land. I concurred in the view that the previous appraisal, under the circumstances, was hardly a fair one to justify condemning the land by an extremely low valuation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHSH/MB\n\nIndian Affairs.

Calculations made at that time were found to be correct and there is approx. 75 acres of muck from 4\" to 15\" deep lying on a white sand. The remainder of the property is practically a pure white sand with a small amount of humus on top.\n\nPractically the whole acreage is covered with a growth of alder and scrubby poplar and there is no definite lines cut showing the exact location of the particular lots in question.\n\nThe whole tract might well be called waste land and is certainly not suitable for agricultural purposes for which it is desired by the Department.\n\nMy former value of $3.00 per acre was very liberal and in fact I would not consider it worth anything for agricultural purposes such as is needed by the Home.\n\nI am of the opinion Mr. Sims and Mr. Hives feel very similar to myself about this property now that the opportunity has arisen to give it a thorough inspection.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(SGD) C.F. Shaw,\nField Supervisor,\nSoldier Settlement of Canada\nDr. Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn August 18th you requested a further appraisal of Lots 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, River Range, Township of Tarentorus, District of Algoma, as the first appraisal made by our Mr. Shaw was carried out in December when the ground was covered with snow.\n\nThe attached is a copy of Mr. Shaw's report. He values the property at $3.00 an acre which agrees with his former report of $600.00 for the 200 acres.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nEnc.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General:-\n\nReferring to Mr. Jackson's memorandum dated August 15th, last, regarding the obtaining of a valuation by a field supervisor of the Soldier Settlement Board, of a property situated about one-half mile east of the city limits of the city of Sault Ste. Marie, which the Department had in view to purchase for farm purposes in connection with the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., I attach copy of the field supervisor's report regarding the value, etc., of the land in question.\n\nYou will see, from the field supervisor's report, that he does not consider this land suitable for agricultural purposes and that the former valuation, made by him last December, of $3.00 per acre, was a very liberal one.\n\nMr. H. S. Hamilton, M.P., Sault Ste. Marie, requested that, should the field supervisor's valuation not be higher than that of the first appraisal, three disinterested local farmers make a survey and value the land. I am of the opinion that it would be unnecessary to have any further valuation made of this land and that, in view of the field supervisor's report, no further steps be taken to purchase same for school purposes.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-9, part 1)\nSHINGWAUK INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSAULT STE. MARIE, ONT.\n\nOct. 1, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMay I again place before you our need of fencing, and ask you to take this matter up with the Department, with the hope that they may sanction the expenditure necessary. Since we have had to rearrange the school surroundings, we have very little fencing, and consequently the cattle get into the garden, and other places, and do considerable damage. The fence in front of the property, and along the continuation of Queen Street is decayed, and needs renewing very badly, both for the sake of looks and also protection.\n\nI estimate that the cost would be $225.00 for necessary fencing and cedar posts. We would do the work.\n\nWill you please place this matter before the Department at your earliest convenience, as we would like to get the work done this Fall.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nOctober 3, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a letter received from the Principal of the Shingwauk Home which is self-explanatory.\n\nI recommend that this request be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 6, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Shingwauk Indian Residential School, in which he requests that the necessary fencing and cedar posts be supplied to erect a fence in front of the school property, to prevent the cattle from getting into the garden and other places.\n\nIn reply I have to say the Department will approve of an expenditure, which must not exceed the sum of $25.00, in the purchase of the necessary fencing and posts. You should arrange for the purchase from firms on the approved list, obtaining accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. It is understood that the school authorities will do the work of erecting the fence, without cost to the Department. This fence should be erected before the extremely cold weather sets in.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am very anxious, this Spring to get it looking decent. We did quite a lot to it, last year, in getting out stones and leveling, through the help the Department gave us, but there remains a lot of heavy work to be done, and we have not the boys to do this heavy work. We do a lot of work with them, but I am quite sure the Department would not want them over worked, as I feel sure they would be if we depend on them alone.\n\nThe Synod of the Dioceses of Algoma meets in the Soo during the month of June, and they are all invited here to lunch. I would like to have the grounds in good order for that time.\n\nWill you kindly place this matter before the Department, as a very urgent one. I estimate that $300.00 would complete the work of clearing, cleaning, leveling, and seeding. I would also like to see a good flag pole in front, and this would cost another $50.00\n\nWe are working at it now, but we cannot make a great deal of headway under the circumstances, and I would be very glad if you would take this matter up as soon as possible.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

This letter speaks for itself, and there is little I can add to it, beyond saying I have been down to inspect the work, and would recommend that Mr. Hives request be granted if at all possible. I may say that they have done wonderfully well with the improving of the front of the building, but it is very heavy work and requires a lot of fill where the old building stood in order to give it a proper appearance.\n\nIf possible, I would recommend that Mr. Hives request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nT.R.L.

Hives, Acting Principal of the Shingwauk Residential School, has advised that the invoice should read \"Lot 3, Concession 1\". This property joins Shingwauk on the West and is used entirely as pasture land for the sixteen (16) cows and four (4) horses. Owing to a clerical error, the above land was described as Part of Lot 2, Concession 1. I am enclosing herewith a revised invoice which has been rendered, giving the proper description of the land in question, and am also returning Voucher No. 721 which has been changed accordingly.\n\nWith regard to the land covered by Voucher No. 722, consisting of 48 acres on Lot 6, Concession 3, Mr. Hives advises me that he has taken this matter up direct with the Department and is holding the invoice for this land until he receives a reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1941.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nIndian Agent Laurence recently submitted a voucher in favour of Mrs. E.S. Wilson covering rental of 48 acres of Lot 6, Concession 5, which apparently has been used during the past summer by the Shingwauk Home.\n\nOn reviewing our files I cannot find any authority for leasing this property and on writing to the school the Acting Principal states that he was under the impression that you had made all the arrangements.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you in regard to this lease. Possibly it was your intention to pay the rent from school funds in view of the fact that the Department has already authorized the leasing of land from Mrs. Anne W. Rowland at a yearly cost of $175.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nReply to your letter of the 1st inst. (Letter No. 13-0-9) I beg to say that the circumstances which necessitated our renting Mrs Wilcox' land for hay meadow were as follows:\n\nThe Shingwank Home has no hay land, and very little pasture for the cows. After the completion of the new building, any appropriation was made by the Department for the purpose of buying land for the school. At that time, no land suitable was available, and the appropriation lapsed. In the meantime the Rankin Estate, which the school had rented for a number of years was subdivided and sold to small owners. We had to look for pasture and hay meadow elsewhere. The late Dr. McCaig had a piece of suitable land about ten miles away from the school, and although distance made it very inconvenient in many ways, yet it was the only hay meadow available, and we procured our hay from there for a number of years. Last year, the land was found to be so impoverished from the constant harvesting, that Dr. McCaig decided to have half of it broken up, and charge us with half the rental, heretofore paid. This matter was not definitely settled with the late Doctor, for illness and death intervened.\n\nIt was very necessary that the school should have sufficient hay, and the only available meadow was that of Mrs Wilcox. I thought it best to rent this land, and was certainly under the impression that the combined rental of lands would not exceed very much if any what I paid other years. I am sorry this matter was not settled before I left, for I think it should have been in quite a satisfactory way.

Scott and Company, Suite 22, Elizabeth Wilcox Bldg., Sault Ste. Marie, stating that at December 31, 1941, we were in arrears in taxes to the City of Sault Ste. Marie to the amount of $115.88. I presume that this account refers to oiling the roadway in front of the Shingwauk Home. In this regard I might refer you to official letter of February 22, 1941, addressed to the former Principal, Rev. G.F. Hiver, in which we pointed out to him that it is not our practice to make such payment. We were not consulted in regard to the oiling of the road in front of the school and, as a matter of fact, I cannot see any necessity for its being oiled as far as we are concerned. There is not much likelihood of our Department making any change in its previous practice and consequently there is no advantage in the City of Sault Ste. Marie assessing us for this service. I believe it would be advisable for you to speak to the City Clerk, or whatever official is concerned in the matter, and point out to him our position in the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. A.B. Minchin,\nPrincipal,\nShingwauk Home,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6213, file 469-9, part 1)\nThe records of this Municipality indicate that at the last revised assessment the above mentioned property was assessed to you.\n\nAn audit of the above records shows that as at December 31st, 1941, there were arrears of taxes amounting to $11,373 outstanding against this property. This amount is inclusive of interest to December 31st, 1941.\n\nThis notice is sent to you for the purpose of verifying the amount shown. If this amount is incorrect, please indicate this fact, entering your remarks in the space provided with respect to any difference. Then, for your own protection, kindly sign and return this letter in the enclosed envelope by return mail.\n\nIf no reply is received within ten days, it will be assumed that the balance shown is correct.\n\nYours very truly,\nW.

Hoey Esq.,\nSupt.of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThank you for your letter of February 28th re Arrears in taxes. As requested I interviewed the City Clerk and the Senior Tax Collector. They informed me that a notice was sent to the Department on February 18th 1941 showing assessment and that no protest was made to the Revision Board in this connection. I took the liberty of showing them your letter so that they could see the stand which you are making in this matter. They asked me to write to you explaining the necessity for oiling the roadway which passes in front of the Shingwauk School and to explain that they naturally thought the Department would be willing to pay the tax as no formal protest was entered.\n\nIt appears that the amount of the tax was $109.50 and interest amounting to $4.38 has been added to this. I also understand that there will be a further tax this year for the same purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 27, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant in connection with the account submitted by the Municipality of the City of Sault Ste. Marie. I have always had the impression that the school is situated outside of the town limits of Sault Ste. Marie and, if my information is correct, the reason for cilling the roadway in front of the school is because that road leads to a summer resort site which is used mainly by residents of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nI should appreciate an early reply to this letter in order that we may give the matter further consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. A.E.

They would make them special for our purpose. 25 Bed springs @ $3.85 = $95.25\n\nThe best possible price for Window Sash - Glazed and Primed ready to fit is $4.50\n16 Pair Window Sash @ $4.50 = $72.00\nSashes for Window Sashes 3.00\n\nTotal $170.25\n\nReferring to the seating required, we would very much like to remove from the Senior Class Room the number of seats required by the pupils in the Junior Class Room, and in this case to ask the Department to allow us to have individual seating in the Senior Class Room. Our present seating is the double folding seats but we believe much better results can be obtained from the single seats especially in the Senior Room.\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to this, it would appear to the writer that there must be some misunderstanding, that if you got a lower price on our Globe Tubular Steel Desk, we would like very much to know it as we are the only people marketing such a desk and we think that we have the price as low as it is possible to make it. As a matter of fact, we only charge 30\u00a2 more for steel than we do for the Cast Iron or Semi-steel desk.\n\nWould we be in order in asking you to tell us the desk that you purchased in competition with our steel desk. Our whole purpose in seeking this information is to get a clear understanding so that we can take care of your requirements intelligently and quote you on just what you are likely to use.\n\nWe are very grateful for the share of your business we receive, but we do not want you to feel that we are charging you other than the proper price.\n\nAny information that you can give us that you think will be in our mutual interest, the favor will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE CO.

Marie\n\nThe Minister has authorized the engagement of three labourers to level and otherwise improve the grounds surrounding the building.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary\nDear Mr. Hives,\n\nWith reference to the curtains for the new Shingwauk Indian Residential School Miss Walton has advised that it is your intention to have some of the curtains made with a frill across the top and the curtains hanging down the sides. I am of the opinion, owing to the construction of the windows, that this would not be a suitable arrangement. I believe it would much improve the appearance of the rooms if the curtains were made on rods fastened to the window sash in such a manner that they would not project beyond the window openings, and I would ask you to have them made in this way.\n\nFor the Reception Room, Office and Staff Sitting Rooms you may purchase suitable side curtains. These will have to be hung from a rod placed over the top of the window opening, in order to allow the side curtains to project past the window. Special rods are made for this purpose. You may place the order for the side curtains with either Astin's or the Soo Jobbing Co.\n\nMiss Walton has drawn my attention to the fact that you did not include in your list of requirements the rods for the window curtains. You may order these from either the hardware firms who were asked to tender on the hardware or from Astin's or Soo Jobbing Co.\n\nWith regard to the Sewing Machines the Purchasing Branch are today placing an order for one electric and two treadle Singer Sewing Machines.\n\nWith reference to the gymnasium mattresses you may place an order with the Soo Outfitting Co., who I understand quoted you a price of 90 cents per square foot, for two mattresses 8 x 6 feet.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

At that time we were asked to quote on heavy duty electric ranges. We take pleasure in enclosing our quotation herewith.\n\nWe hope that we may be favored with your orders.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCOCHRANE DUNLOP HARDWARE LIMITED\n\n[Signature]\n\nMANAGER.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6214, file 469-12, part 1)\nTHE Findlay C150E Console electric range with the Instant Oven Control is peerless among modern electric ranges.\n\nTo a range already noted for its ultimate in utility and luxury has been added a wonderful new automatic oven heat control that sets this range in a class by itself.\n\nSo compact in design that it requires only 41\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" of kitchen space it is hard to realize how so much cooking capacity can be condensed into such a small space. Every worthwhile feature, every proved convenience is found in the Findlay C150E. Let us examine it in detail.\n\n**INSTANT OVEN CONTROL.** This remarkable new automatic oven control (inset above) is found only on Findlay ranges. Set in the switch panel and taking up as little space as a switch this control operates with instant precision, quickly and accurately bringing the oven up to the desired baking temperature. No more watching or guessing\u2014just lining up the control to \"click\" and then set the control dial, turn on the oven switch and forget it. A tiny red pilot lamp just below the dial is the only indication that the oven is at work.\n\nThe OVEN itself is made of Armco Iron finished in mottled porcelain and electrically welded into a one-piece unit free from leaks and distortion. It is a joy to bake in this wonderful oven\u2014so simple to regulate and so easy to clean its rounded corners.\n\nThe WARMING OVEN DRAWER slides in and out on silent guides. No more lifting awkward loads through a narrow opening\u2014simply put the plates and platter in the drawer and close it like a bureau drawer. The heat is applied from below and plates come out piping hot.\n\nA UTILITY DRAWER for utensils is conveniently placed under the switches at the left side. This silent drawer is rubber-lined to deaden the noise of hastily dropped utensils.\n\nDays of thought and effort have been put into this range to make it easy to clean. Every bolt, hinge and dirt-collecting nicknack has been eliminated or concealed and the surfaces are smooth almost to the point of severity. The result is a handsome range as easy to wipe off as a china plate.\n\nThe regular finish is all Ivory with Black Trim as shown above. However it is also made in Grey and White porcelain, Ivory and Green porcelain, or Ivory Porcelain shaded Green.\n\n| SPECIFICATIONS |\n|----------------|\n| **Range (overall)** | Width: 41\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" | Depth: 28\" | Height: 46\" |\n| **Oven** | Width: 16\" | Depth: 19\" | Height: 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" |\n| **Warming Oven** | Width: 16\" | Depth: 19\" | Height: 8\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" |\n| **Oven burners,** two of 1400 watts each | | | |\n| **Warming oven burner,** one of 300 watts | | | |\n| **Cooking top burners,** two 9\" of 1700 watts each | | | |\n| **Shipping weight**\u2014390 lbs.

Unless otherwise ordered, open elements are always supplied because they are cheaper, faster and, with reasonable care, more efficient than any other type. On the other hand, if the range is used by inexperienced cooks, the radiant or stovetop ironclad elements are recommended. They are spill-proof, durable and easily replaced without scrapping the whole element.\n\nSWITCHES: Three-heat reciprocating switches are standard equipment, but load-balancing switches can be supplied where the Public Utility requires them.\n\nOVENS: All ovens are constructed of rust-resisting Armco Iron, electrically welded into a one-piece unit, inside and out. The interior finish is mottled. The ovens on all Findlay ranges are large enough to accommodate the largest sizes of domestic covered roasting pans. Radiant and stovetop elements are movable to facilitate cleaning.\n\nAUTOMATIC OVEN HEAT CONTROLS: All ranges shown in this folder are supplied with the latest automatic oven heat control described on this page. They can, however, be supplied without this attractive feature at lower prices.\n\nAPPLIANCE OUTLET: An appliance outlet for ironing boards is conveniently placed on the front of these ranges.\nTHE two styles shown alongside are modern ranges of the best quality and workmanship. They are compact and inexpensive because every extra inch and unnecessary \"gadget\" has been eliminated. The operating controls are simple, economical and thoroughly reliable.\n\nBoth the 3 and 4-element ranges are supplied in the following choice of finishes: Grey and White Porcelain (shown alongside), All Ivory with Black Trim (shown on page C135 on the inside page), Ivory with Green Trim and Ivory Shaded with Green (the two latter finishes are also shown alongside).\n\nTHESE RANGES CAN BE SUPPLIED WITH THE REVOLUTIONARY, NEW INSTANT OVEN HEAT CONTROL DESCRIBED IN THIS FOLDER.\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n| C1AE | C1IE |\n|------|------|\n| Capacity | 76 cubic inches |\n| Floor Space | 26\u00bd\" x 30\u00bd\" |\n| Cooking Height | 29\u00be\" |\n| Height of Cooking Top | 32\" |\n| | 32\" |\n\nThese ranges are made with either right or left hand ovens.\n\nNOTE: This folder shows only the Console Ranges.

There should be no delay in any of the equipment, with the exception of the cupboards, tables, etc., and I would suggest that you communicate with the Benson Lumber Co., and ask when they expect to make delivery. In placing the order with them I am stipulating that the equipment must be in place not later than September 1.\n\nThe order for the beds is being placed with Simmons Limited of Montreal.\n\nWith regard to your request for additional funds for the grounds, I am sending you a further advance of $200 for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nRev. Chas. E. Hives,\nPrincipal, Shingwauk Indian Residential School,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nThere are several things I would like to ask you. First, is it safe for me to recommend that the official opening take place on Sept. 4th. I would like if possible, not to leave it any later than we can help, on account of the weather.\n\nWe have made a very nice looking front to the grounds, but there is much to be done yet. If you have the funds to spare, I would like two hundred dollars more to spend on it. This would, I believe finish the job, and I feel sure you would be satisfied with it.\n\nThen we need some fencing around for playground boundaries. This, I estimate, would cost eighty dollars. We could do the work ourselves.\n\nIn regard to the lumber mills here, I may say that both firms, who have tendered, are good reliable firms. The Bee Lumber have better equipment in the way of drying kilns and machinery, and on that account would do probably a neater and quicker job.\n\nI think Miss Waltam has spoken to you about kitchen ranges. It certainly would be a great thing if we could have the electric range for the kitchen, but don't worry about it if you think it too extravagant.\n\nThanks for your letter regarding curtain material etc. I will take care of it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr R.

The plumber recognises the trouble as his own, and so no blame is attached to the engineer.\n\nThe beautiful blankets arrived last week, and we are very grateful for them. The bell has not yet arrived, nor my typewriter. We are doing very nicely, and we are certainly enjoying the comforts of the new building.\n\nDo you suppose you would have $160.00 to spare for a kitchen range, and hot water heating unit for our apartments. It could be taken into the new residence when it is built.\n\nThe old building is still standing, though I thought it was coming down last night during the earthquake.

She has however, some cervical glands which require some further treatment before we could feel sure that she could return home with advantage.

He is the last of a family. Father, Mother, three brothers, and a sister have also died. This boy, about 12 years old, has strong symptoms of the same trouble. We do all our best, but can make no improvement in him. It is our desire to do all possible for the pupils and trouble the Department as little as can be. But it is serious to see them get down ill and die. We would like to see them getting if possible a better chance. It is hard to say what the result will be, but we would be doing it for the boy's good.\n\nThirdly, let me know your wishes in the matter, and we shall ever be grateful.\n\nP.S. The boy has never been down sick, only he does not thrive.\n\nYours obediently,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

His whole family, including his father and mother, three brothers and a sister, have died from this disease.\n\nI think this boy would be too young to send to a sanitarium and the expense of keeping him there would be about $10.00 a week. I can vouch for it that he will receive every care and attention at the school and I think he would probably be better there than anywhere else, as he would be most unhappy if he were sent to a sanitarium. I think if the boy were relieved of school work and allowed to be in the open air as much as possible with more nourishing food than the ordinary school bill of fare calls for he might benefit by it and I would suggest that Mr. Fuller be allowed something additional for his maintenance, if he is willing to keep the boy.

In the meantime it is probable that if this boy were relieved of school work and allowed to be in the open air as much as possible and given more nourishing food than the ordinary school bill of fare calls for he might be benefitted.

I stayed here overnight.\n\nI saw the teachers there dressing infected sores on some of the children, and they did not have any surgical material.

McNabb,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAccording to circular letter received today, we must not ask the Per Cap Grant for any pupil for the time they are in hospital. And as we had one pupil Fred Sheulan in the Memorial Hospital for a total of thirty-two days, we must deduct the Per Cap for that length of time. Will you ask the Indian Department if they will pay the enclosed accounts?\n\nYou may not remember the circumstances under which Fred Sheulan had to go to the hospital. He had found some dynamite caps, and in playing with them one exploded, and blew away a part of two fingers and a thumb; Fred is quite alright now.\n\nIn the enclosed requisition there are some articles intended for the pupils attending High School, and we have made a note of this on the quarterly report.\n\nJust while writing you, I would ask if you remember if anything was done by the Department regarding payment of a bill of drugs bought of C.B. Smith & Co. of the Soc. This account the Missionary Society refused to pay and referred it back to me to ask the Dept. to pay. No word came, and as I paid this account myself, I would like to know to whom I should apply to for it. $68.65 was the amount. I ask your pardon for mentioning this matter.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inclose letter with account from the Plummer Memorial Hospital for Fred Schuler a pupil from the Shingwauk Home.\n\nHaving doubts whether those accounts are payable by the Department of Indian Affairs, I am forwarding it in the shape he sent it to me to get your advice on the matter.

It would appear that this is a special case, as this boy was hurt in an accident and required immediate attention. The Department desires, before a pupil is placed in a hospital, that application, giving full particulars, be made and the approval of the Department granted for the admission of such child before accounts can be paid.\n\nRegarding drugs, the Department supplies a small quantity for the use of residential schools upon receipt of a requisition, in duplicate, from the Principal for supplies of this nature. If you forward an itemized account for the drugs referred to by the Principal as having been purchased by him from C. B. Smith & Co., which should be attached to proper voucher forms and certified by you, consideration will be given to the payment of same.

As you will remember, the Missionary Society under whose control we now work, refused to pay the bill. It was then referred to the Indian Dept., but as they had not been paying our drug bill, it was still unpaid. I then paid the account myself, thinking that as we had not proceeded according to the rules of the M.S.O.C., we would have to lose the amount.\n\nNow that you have again taken up the matter with the Indian Dept., I hope that you may get the matter settled.\n\nDo you think we could ascertain from the Dept., if they will allow our School to purchase the same line of drugs as we have in the past, and will the Dept. pay for them, when the same is requisitioned when we requisition our school supplies.\n\nIn returning the cement empty bags, for which we are allowed a rebate of twenty cents, on the price of the cement. We found that we had seventy-one extra bags, and these Mr. Downey will allow the same for which will still bring down the cost of the cement that we used at the Barn floor.\n\nWill you please convey our sincere thanks for what the Indian Dept. have done for us, and we regret very much if we have over run the amount they promised us.\n\nThanking you for your interest in these matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOffice of the...SAULT...STE...MARIE...Indian Agency,\n\nDecember 6th 1923\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Vouchers Nos#65 & #66, amounting to $58.65.\n\nin favour of Benjamin P.

This account is being paid.\n\nRegarding the request in your letter of the 6th instant to the agent, as to whether the Department would allow you to purchase the same line of drugs as in the past, I beg to say the Department supplies a small quantity for the use of residential schools, upon receipt of a requisition in duplicate. You should make requisition in duplicate for the drugs required and hand same to Mr. Agent McNabb, who will approve and send it to the Department. The quantity considered necessary will then be ordered from here.

The members of the staff who have charge of the medicines, have been careful to note what is usually needed, and we have made out the list according to that estimate.\n\nAs to what the Dept will consider just and right to allow us to use, and the amount in each item, will be for them to decide. This only we would say, that it has always been our practice to purchase and use all the articles mentioned in the requisition.

Paget\nAccountant and Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe National Drug & Chemical Co.,\nof Canada, Ltd.,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nOne of the pupils in our school who has been attending High School for the past term, and who, with others has had a bad cold for some time, still retains a very bad cough, and refuses to build up although we are doing for him all we can. We have been hoping that when his cold left him he would recover his normal condition, but we are becoming alarmed about him, and I am writing to you for your advice.\n\nIt would seem best to send him at once to some Hospital where he would be treated especially for his trouble, which we believe is tubercular. Should he be taken to a local hospital, he would only receive the same treatment that we are giving him here, and there would be the extra expense, and no advantage.\n\nThe boy's name is Roy Richards. He has no home, and no relations to care for him. He came from away north of Fort William, and his parents are dead. He has an Aunt living in Fort William, who at times has sent clothes for him, but she has always warned us not to write to her regarding Roy because her husband would not like to know that she had any thing to do with this boy. Roy's Uncle, Rev. Edward Richards, died two years ago. He was a missionary in the North, and we had hopes that we could lead Roy on so that some day he could take a place, and carry on the work his Uncle was so interested in.\n\nRoy is up, and out every day, and we will do all we can for him, but we would like to have your advice and permission to place him where he will get every chance there is for him.\n\nNearly all of the pupils in the Home contracted heavy colds during the past winter, even the staff did not escape, but all but Roy are well again, for which we are very thankful.\n\nObediently yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may request Dr. A. S. McCaig, Sault Ste. Marie, to examine the boy, and you should forward his report and recommendation to the Department. When this is received, consideration will be given to the question of arranging for this boy's treatment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. B. P.

And for the last few months has had to stay from school at times. Then last Friday she complained of the same trouble, and went to bed and remained in bed until yesterday. She said that the pain was not very bad unless she moved her body. So in the afternoon yesterday I called Dr. McGaig, and he came at once, and advised us to take Ella to the hospital at once, and he would operate this morning. We took her to the Plummer Memorial about eight in the evening. I will call at noon today and enquire about her, and will let you know how she is.\n\nI hope I have done the right thing, to follow the Dr.'s advice, there was no time to write for instruction, or anything of that kind. Will you at your convenience, arrange this matter for us, and do what is necessary that everything may be safe.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

This girl has at times been subject to pains, and would be confined to bed for a short time, and then the trouble would pass off. But on Sunday last she had much pain, and we call the Dr. at 9 A.M., and he ordered her taken to the Hospital at once, and he operated at 11:30 the same morning. We visited this girl today and she is doing as well as could be expected.\n\nThe first girl Ella Jackson is doing remarkably well, and will soon be well enough to be up.\n\nI feel certain that you will be quite satisfied that we did what we thought was the wise thing to do under the circumstances, for there was no time to wait for instruction from the Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt is very strange that we never before have a case of this nature, and now to have two cases come at the same time.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration in this matter,\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. A.D.

Dr. Hamilton told me that he had asked Dr. Duncan to charge us a cheap rate, as it was in his power to do so, but I think he has charged us as high as would be reasonable for any one to pay. You may know more about this than I do, but I think the charge is high.\n\nThe case was like this. I had just come from Town, and some one ran to meet me to tell me that Ada had just swallowed a pin, and that it was stuck in her throat, out of reach to allow of us getting it out, and we at once took her up to Dr. McCallum. He referred us to Dr. Hamilton, and he took us to the general Hospital for the X-Ray. Dr. Hamilton, nor Dr. Duncan could locate the pin, and we came to the conclusion that it had either come up while she was coughing at a wash bowl, or had passed down into her stomach. We watched her for a time and there was no bad effects.\n\nSorry to trouble you about this matter but thought it best to refer to you in this matter. Will you please let me know what your opinion is.\n\nI hope you are feeling well.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

She was ill and in bed for a short time this winter, but is up and down, some days feeling better, and then in bed not so well.\n\nWe have wondered if a change would do her good. We do not want to put the responsibility on to any one else, but as you know, such a case causes a lot of care and responsibility in a school where there are so many living together. If she is going to die, we would do all we could for her, but there is the question, what is best for concerned. Your advice will be much appreciated.\n\nWe have had a lot of sickness this winter. The first was a case of measles brought home from High School. Then the whole of our school had them, covering the space of nearly a month.

Dr. Scott directed Mr. Abraham to make an inspection and report. Mr. Abraham reported that the Indians claim to be Pottawatamie, of the same group as Chief Caldwell. The Deputy directed that some of the children be placed in a residential school.\n\nOne of these Indians, Olive Peters, was sent to the Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie. She is now 16 years of age, and is far from well. She has always had bad glands on her neck. The Principal reports that she has been ill for a short time this winter \"but is up and down, some days feeling better, and then in bed not so well\".\n\nShe should be discharged from the school, and, I believe, the only suitable place for her is a hospital.

The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable amount for this service, and the work should be offered to Dr. J. A. Shannon, 689 Queen St., Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThe Department's practice is to insist on only the necessary extractions and inexpensive fillings. In the case of temporary teeth, only extractions can be allowed. The fee set by this Department, where there are several children requiring attention, is $1.00 per amalgam filling and 25\u00a2 per extraction. When local anesthesia is necessary when extracting, $1.00 is allowed for the first tooth in the case of each patient and 25\u00a2 for each additional tooth. Please see Dr. Shannon at your convenience, and, if he accepts the Department's proposal, arrange to have performed the dental work that is really necessary for the health of the pupils. Accounts should be in duplicate and should show the name of each pupil and the number of fillings and extractions. They should be certified by yourself and forwarded to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. R. P.

You may arrange with Dr. Shannon to provide a plate for her, the price of which should not exceed the quotation which you submitted, viz.: $15. After this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the amount of Dr. Shannon's charge for this service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Shannon & Shannon, of Sault Ste. Marie, for dental work performed for the pupils of the Shingwauk Home. A cheque in payment of this account will be forwarded in due course.\n\nIn connection with future dental service for the pupils of your school, I have to inform you that the Department's practice is to insist on only the necessary extractions and inexpensive fillings. In the case of temporary teeth, only extractions can be allowed. The fee set by this department is $1.00 per amalgam filling and 25\u00a2 per extraction when local anesthesia is necessary in extraction. $1.00 is allowed for the first tooth in the case of each patient and 25\u00a2 for each additional tooth. It is considered that it should not be necessary to use local anesthesia as frequently as appears to have been done, as per charges for this service in the account above referred to.\n\nThe amounts for dental attention at this school have been quite large during the past year, and, in future, only the more urgent cases among the pupils should have this work done. The Department will rely on you to see that all cost for dental service is kept as low as possible and that all work carried out is absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that, in future, when dental attention is required by the pupils of the Shingwauk Home, the Department is prepared to pay a reasonable amount for this service, and the work should be offered to Dr. H. F. Goodfellow, of Sault Ste. Marie.\n\nThe Department's practice is to allow only necessary extractions and inexpensive fillings. In the case of temporary teeth, only extractions can be allowed. The fees set by this Department where there are several children requiring attention, $1.00 per amalgam filling and 25\u00a2 per extraction. When local anaesthesia is necessary when extracting, $1.00 is allowed for the first tooth in the case of each patient and 25\u00a2 for each additional tooth. Please see Dr. Goodfellow at your convenience, and, if he accepts the Department's proposal, you may arrange to have him perform the dental work recommended by the medical officer of the school as being really necessary for the health of the pupils. Accounts should be in duplicate and should show the name of each pupil and the number of fillings and extractions.

This boy was instantly killed this morning.\n\nEvery morning the boys are lined up, and I personally detail them to their work etc. This morning I lined them up as usual, and on account of the Christmas holidays coming on, after I had given the older boys their necessary chore duties, I told about twenty smaller boys, deceased being one, to go to the toboggan slide and have a good time. I may say that I have had good slides made for them. Instead of going, deceased thought he should help some bigger boys to pile wood in the wood shed.\n\nIn the wood shed is the end of a pulley shaft which operates the laundry machinery. Today being Monday, and laundry day, the shaft was turning. Nobody knows just what happened, as he was by himself. The shaft is about seven feet from the ground, but wood had been piled up so that he could reach it, and somehow his clothing caught on the shaft, and he was whirled around and death was instantaneous.\n\nI wired the boy's mother immediately after the accident, and received a wire from her asking that the body be sent to her. I therefore wired you asking for sanction to do so.\n\nComing as it does at this season, this terrible fatality has cast a cloud over our Christmas. I feel it is an accident that none of us could possibly have foreseen, but just a result of a very clumsy arrangement of machinery.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department has noted the circumstances in connection with the death of this boy. His death is regretted.\n\nYou should take every precaution to see that the end of the pulley shaft is fully protected, in order to prevent any accident of a like nature recurring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nRussell T.

This account takes in the two months of June and July.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWe require a disinfectant spray outfit for our school floors. The doctor is anxious that we should have this, both on account of the nature of our building and floors, and also as a preventative of some of the epidemics that are going around.\n\nThe outfit I have in mind, and which was demonstrated to Dr. Westgate and me a few days ago, to our entire satisfaction, is the Sanispray syringe and liquid. This costs $30.00. It is a germicide as well as a dust suppressor.\n\nWould you kindly ask the Department if they would allow the expenditure of $30.00 for this outfit.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nGordon Sims Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith a letter received from Rev. Principal Hives of the Shingwauk Home, asking for a disinfectant spray for the floors of the Home.\n\nIn view of the epidemics that are prevalent from time to time, I would strongly recommend that this preventative measure be taken, and that the spray be purchased.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSeptember 17th, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Sims,\n\nI have been asked to reply to your letter of September 9th enclosing the requisition of Mr. Hives for a sanitary spray. I have also been asked not to recommend anything that would cost too much money.\n\nWe know that the floors at the school are not very good and appreciate the reason for wanting an apparatus of this kind. I am allowed to authorize the purchase of a suitable spraying apparatus or gun, but I recommend one of the two following solutions for use in it, as they are both very cheap and quite suitable:\n\n1. Lysol, I.D., 1 tablespoon to 1 gallon of water.\n\n2. Chloride of Lime - 1 pound, Washing Soda - 1\u00bd pounds, water - 10 gallons.\n\nMake a smooth paste of the Chloride of Lime in a suitable quantity of water. Dissolve the Washing Soda and add the solution to the Chloride of Lime. Let stand over-night and strain through a cloth or other strainer. Add water to make 10 gallons. This solution is very effective and will help to bleach the floors white. It will also bleach everything else it touches and should be applied with a mop rather than with the bare hands. It will corrode metal and should not be used in a metal operating gun. I recommend this solution on the ground of efficiency and cheapness.\n\nThe Department will supply the materials in either case; but would like to be consulted before any large expenditure is made for apparatus.\n\nYours truly,\n\nG.H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nE.L. Stone, M.B.,\nDirector of Medical Services\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6214, file 469-13, part 1)\nSir:\n\nI beg to say that all pupils of our school have been vaccinated during the last year. On account of the epidemic of Smallpox in the city, it was thought best to have the whole school vaccinated, and this was done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Price |\n|----------------------------------|----------|-------|\n| Health Salts                     |          | $5.00 |\n| Formaldehyde                     | 16       | $2.50 |\n| Rx 43.019 (double)               |          | $2.00 |\n| Prescription Refill              | 18       | $1.25 |\n| Soluble                          | 8 oz     | $1.25 |\n| Mercury Ointment                 | 1 oz     | $1.50 |\n| Wincarnine                       | 21       | $1.50 |\n| Lysol Eye                        | 1        | $1.50 |\n| 6-1/2\" Certified Foam            | 24       | $1.50 |\n| Mace Gas                         | 30       | $6.50 |\n| Rx 43.019                        |          | $2.00 |\n\nTotal: $13.70\n| Item Description | Quantity | Price |\n|------------------|----------|-------|\n| Health Salts     |          | 50    |\n| Formaldehyde     | 16       | 25    |\n| R43.019 (double) |          | 200   |\n| Prescription Refill |        | 1.25  |\n| 83 Double       |          | 1.25  |\n| Mercury Ointment | 1        | 1.50  |\n| Wincarnine       | 21       | 1.50  |\n| Lysol Lye        | 1        | 1.50  |\n| 6-1/2 Certified Bone |      | 1.50  |\n| Mock Goo         | 30       | 65    |\n| R43.019          | 2.00     |       |\n\nTotal: $139.00\n\nHandwritten note: \"4354\"\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose herewith account from Lawrence Limited, certified correct by Doctor McCaig, for medical supplies I have had to buy by order of the doctor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**REQUISITION FOR DRUGS**\n\nAgency: Saulit-Stey-Marie\nResidential School or Band: Shingwauk Home\nNumber of Indians or pupils: 300 (If Indians of the Reserve are treated from the Residential School, the number so served should also be given.)\n\nDate: Dec. 1931\nDate of last Requisition: 1930\n\n---\n\n### SAMPLE REQUISITION\n\n| On Hand | Prescription No. | Name of Prescription | Required |\n|---------|-----------------|----------------------|----------|\n|         |                 | Castor oil           | \u00bd gal.   |\n|         |                 | Petroleum            | 5 lbs    |\n|         |                 | Tincture of iodine   | 2 lbs    |\n|         |                 | Absorbent cotton     | 6 lbs    |\n|         |                 | Gauze                | 6 rolls  |\n|         |                 | Cheese cloth         | 50 yds   |\n|         |                 | Safety pins          | 24 cards |\n|         |                 | Hot water bottles    | 6       |\n|         |                 | Oiled silk           | 2 pks    |\n|         |                 | Syringes rubber bulb | 1 dose   |\n|         |                 | Forceps (dressing)   | 2 only   |\n|         |                 | Scissors             | 2       |\n|         |                 | Thermometers         | 6       |\n|         |                 | Medicine glasses     | 6       |\n|         |                 | Kidney bowls (large, med., small) | 2 each |\n\n---\n\nTo be signed by the Dispenser and approved by the Medical Officer or Agent.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.
