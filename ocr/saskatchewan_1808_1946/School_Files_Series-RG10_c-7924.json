Manager.\nKenora, Ontario,\nApril 15th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our letter 108/13 of December 1st last, to you, inclosing copy of letter and plan of suggested laundry sump at the Chibougamau School, received from the Mining District Chief Engineer, of the Dominion Water Power Branch & Reclamation Bureau, Winnipeg.\n\nThe sump is now blocked again, and continuous pumping has to be undertaken every day, to take the waste away. This is pumped into a trough and drained over on to the land, and the smell is most offensive and dangerous to health, as well as causing a lot of work to the School authorities, which should be unnecessary.\n\nWe shall be glad, therefore, if you will give instructions, you may think advisable, to the Dominion Water Power Branch & Reclamation Bureau, Winnipeg, to remedy this situation.\n\nWe would not recommend this expenditure, but it is absolutely necessary for the health of the children at the School, and unless something is done, the Department of Public Health is liable to make us close down the School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nExtract from Mr. E. W. Dyers' letter dated March 27th, 1931, to Mrs. McKerroll.\n\n\"I would like to state that owing to the very mild winter we have been able to pass the winter without much freezing, but still with a lot of discomfort in the Residence. The Department had an Inspector make a report on the system last fall, and the Inspector made the same recommendations as I had been stating for, namely a proper lining up on the return pipes and the installation of a pump for the return to the furnaces of the condensed steam. His tender for the complete job was somewhere around $650.00 and after the tender was received nothing further was done. Owing to the residence being situated so far from the furnaces we never get heat throughout there is a heavy head of steam which means a great deal of unnecessary firing, and adds greatly to the fuel bill. It is impossible to ever expect the furnaces to work properly with the pipes lined up as they are. Several places in the system the return water must run up hill in order to clear the pipes, and this water will not do without force behind it. I am of the opinion that something should be offered if a small heating unit were installed in the Residence and that part cut off from the main furnaces. A small oil burner would take care of this heating, and would secure a more uniform heating of the Residence, and would require less pressure on the main boilers. If at all possible something should be done before another winter sets in, because if we have to face a severe winter such as we usually have, I doubt if we could keep the system from freezing up. Last night was very cold and one of the classrooms was too cold for holding School.\"\nDr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,-\n\nI am sorry to have to write again about the furnaces at Kenora. When Miss Cameron was in town on her way home, she told me that the school in which she had been teaching in the Ojibwa Jeffrey school, had to be closed several days just before she left, because they could not get it warm enough to have the children sit in it. I wrote at once to Mr. Byers, asking for another report, as I had hoped things were now better. I am enclosing you a copy of his reply. That can be done to get this into better shape.\n\nThanking you for your consideration,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary, Indian Department.\nOTTAWA,\nMay 6, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Gow,\n\nYou will remember our conversation with reference to the disposal field at the Emma B. C. School and also the laundry camp at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nI have today received a telegram from Captain Ricardo in which he states that the sewage disposal plant at the Emma B. C. School is not working properly and the sanitary Inspector is likely to close the Institute, and also that the sewage at the Cecilia Jeffrey School is not working properly and it is necessary for them to use a pump to empty and the discharge is allowed to run on the surface. From this information it would appear that things are rather serious at both the schools, and I would be glad to hear from you with your suggestions.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Sinclair for the painting and papering in connection with the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nThe matter of painting was taken up with the Department last year, and I was given to understand that it would be done this year.\n\nThe walls have never been painted since the School was built, and owing to the fact that the walls are just putty-coat finished, we cannot wash the stains from the plaster for this reason. But after a coat of sizing and paint they can be washed, and we will be able to keep the walls clean.\n\nThis tender is very reasonable, and would be much higher if times were brighter. I hope the Department will see fit to authorize having this done right away, as the Residence walls have been badly stained ever since it was completed, and the school walls are badly stained also, and as I said before the plaster will not stand washing.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this matter.\n\nI remain\n\nSir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYour obedient servant,\nKehora, Ontario,\nMay 26th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find a letter we have received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School and Tender from Mr. D.

Sinclair amounting to $615.00 for Painting and Papering the Principal's Residence and the School.\n\nWe have informed Mr. Byers the Department has not Papered any Principal's Residence in this Agency.\n\nThe Tender seems to be reasonable but we believe money could be saved, if we supplied the Paint and Size and make a small allowance for the labour, as it appears to us that the older Pupils at the School could do some of the Painting.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nOttawa, June 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, together with a tender for the papering of the Principal's residence and the painting of the classrooms, etc., in the school building.

I wish to state that for almost a year I have found it necessary to have the boys pumping from the above Sump almost every day. This was necessary through the Winter weather and on rainy days, and the boys are very much disgusted with the job. Furthermore all this water pumped runs over the surface of the ground close to the School building, and creates a very offensive smell, and is very unsanitary.\n\nI have made several requests through the Indian Agent to have something done to remedy this, but nothing of a permanent nature has been done. I feel satisfied that it would not be a very expensive job if a competent man were given the work. It is an Engineer's job, and one who is experienced in such work. The ordinary Contractor is not qualified to properly handle this situation.\n\nI scarcely know what to recommend, but am sure of this part, that the bottom of the present sump consists of sand of too fine a texture, and I know there is a vein of gravel underlying this strata of fine sand. It appears that if this were lowered to this coarse gravel, that the water would seep away.\n\nIn order to do this work I believe the cover will have to be removed, as men refuse to work in the sump as it is at present, owing to the heat and the foul gases. I sincerely hope that the Department will take immediate steps to have this very unsatisfactory condition remedied.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nTELEGRAM\n\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD\n\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nIMPERATIVE SOMETHING BE DONE IMMEDIATELY TO SUMP AT DECEITTA JEFFREY SCHOOL AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL PLANT AT KENORA SCHOOL SEE MY LETTERS OF 15TH AND 21ST APRIL\n\nFRANK EDWARDS\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nTELEGRAM\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD\n\nJune 28, 1931.\n\nCapt.

Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have from time to time been called upon to pump out existing cisterns at the Jessie Jeffrey school, the trouble with which seems to be that wooden walls are coated with soot and creosote from the laundry and only possible seepage is from bottom which appears to be coated in a similar manner. Last winter we bored with root auger to a gravel strata about four feet, which seemed to draw off liquids until it also choked up.\n\nThe trouble we think, is as follows:\n\n1. Present tank too small.\n2. No seepage field.\n3. Walls should be porous.\n\nTo rectify this trouble we recommend the following:\n\n1st. Construct a concrete tank 12'-0 X 12'-0 by 6'-0 foot in height with porous tile pipe in layers spaced one foot apart on horizontal and two feet on perpendicular. The cistern to be constructed about forty feet farther east of building.\n\n2nd. An open joint outlet pipe of six inch glazed tile with Y branches every four feet on to which are connected about four feet of wearing tile.

The ground to take care of the seepage, and if this is done Mr. Lyons does not consider there would be any further trouble, but if there should be, it could be easily remedied at practically no cost.\n\nMessrs. Kelly & Kimberley estimate the cost of this work at roughly $995.00.\n\nWe inclose their letter and suggestions made before Mr. Lyons visited the School, but they now agree that Mr. Lyons's suggestions are the best.\n\nThe School holidays commence on July 15th, and we would suggest the work be carried out while most of the Pupils will be away.\nJuly 4, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th instant, with further reference to the map of the Cecilia Jeffery School, the Department approves of the recommendation of Mr. Lyons, and you may arrange with Sally and Kimberley to have a new map constructed in accordance with Mr. Lyons' suggestions. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $75.00. This amount must not be exceeded and if possible the cost should be kept lower.\n\nWhen the work is completed vouchers should be forwarded to the Department in the regular way. These vouchers should show in detail all material and labour used on the work.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. P.

It is always cold and damp and Mrs. Byers and myself are contracting colds throughout the Winter season. The sewing-room is always cold and also one of the class-rooms.\n\nThe furnaces cannot heat the building with the present piping of the hot water pipes. There are water-pockets in several places and the steam will not go beyond these.\n\nI have had the advice of several steam engineers and they are all agreed that we cannot heat the building as it is installed at present.\n\nMr. Brown of Kenora recommended raising the returns and installing a pump. Mr. Campbell recommends raising the returns and installing a pump. Mr. Wood of Winnipeg recommends raising the returns and installing a pump.\n\nIn the school I had in Brandon there was continuous trouble in getting any heat. They changed the piping and the mains but without results and finally they installed a pump and the trouble was over.\n\nI just dread the cold weather coming on. All we can use the fireplaces for sleeping. We cannot go in there in the evening and enjoy a moment's rest and chance. If you were in the residence one day you would realize what it is like. The sewing-room is so cold we are obliged to keep an electric heater going all the time. Frequently we have to close one of our classrooms.

These repairs being made necessary owing to Chlorine escaping through a faulty container.\n\nThe Heater used in the Pump house so condensed that it is unsafe to use and likewise the pipes. The weather is getting cold and I would like authority to purchase one.\n\nI can secure one from the Williams Hardware at a price not to exceed $30.00 including taxes.\n\nI shall appreciate it if you will secure the necessary authority to purchase one.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEvans\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, November 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School requesting that a heater be supplied for use in the pump house.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may make the purchase, from indicated sources, of a heater that would be satisfactory for the purpose for which it is required. It is noted that a suitable heater can be obtained for approximately $30.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

At the request of the Minister at that time the contractor was authorized to install two Spencer boilers. Such boilers are not of the same type or construction as the one specified, but I understand that they have given good satisfaction in other buildings. The trouble experienced with the heating system at the Cecilia Jeffrey School was due, I think, to improper management on the part of the staff, also on account of the heavy bush to the rear of the building. An improvement was made by raising the chimney 10 feet. I understand that the heating system has worked satisfactorily during the last winter and I do not think it necessary to change the boilers.\n\nA.M.

They are getting an even distribution of heat now where they could not previous to installing the pump.\n\nI hope whatever is decided upon will be carried out with as little delay as possible as we are living in very trying times.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.W. Byers\nKenora, Ontario,\nJanuary 18th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffery Residential School, and also letter from Arthur Leitch Co., Toronto, to him, requesting one of their engineers to report on the heating at the School.\n\nDepartment letter 129-3-5 of 9th ultimo authorized us to install a receiving tank and pump, and we are awaiting advice before giving definite instructions. We do not wish to do anything that might not be what is required, and in this connection Mr. Brown who was to do the work is doubtful if the pump would cure all the trouble, without the piping being altered.\n\nIt is doubtful in our opinion as to whether the cost of doing any thing to house would be approved by the Department. The Co.'s letter is so vague that we cannot tell what their recommendations are liable to cost, so we are forwarding the letters to you for your instructions.\n\nKindly return the correspondence when replying, for our files.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nKemora, Ontario.\nJanuary 20th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find Vouchers #5601 & #5602 also letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, re cost of installing Fairbanks Ltd. Scales at the School.\n\nWe have informed the Principal we have no authority to pay these accounts, but are forwarding them to you at his request.\n\nWe have not installed any Scales at any of the Schools in this Agency, but have certified the accounts in case you are willing to pay this expenditure.\n\nIf not, kindly return the accounts to the Principal through this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing vouchers covering the cost of installing Fairbanks' scales at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, as the Principal incurred this expenditure without the authority of the Department, and as our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited, he should arrange for payment from per capita earnings or other receipts of the school. The vouchers, with accounts attached, are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L.

The principal reports that if the matter was reported to the Town Authorities it might lead to the dismissal of some of the employees.\n\nWe have certified to the Voucher, but are not satisfied as to whether this should be paid by the Department or not, but pass it on for your decision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th ultimo, enclosing a voucher in favour of the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company, Limited, Winnipeg, covering the cost of the pipe and belt, obtained for the water at the Cecilia Jefferies Indian Residential School. It is noted, from the Principal's letter, that this equipment was purchased owing to an accident when the men were engaged in working on the line to the school. The Department considers that this account should be paid either by the Power Company or by the school authorities, from their per capita earnings or other receipts, and it is being returned herewith.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

He thinks it would undoubtedly help, even if it was found that other alterations would have to be made later.\n\nThe Principal also wishes us to install a fan to get rid of the Steam in the Laundry, as he considers this injurious to the health of the Children, there being no other means of getting rid of the steam.\n\nThe estimated cost of this installation could be in the neighbourhood of $175.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nToronto, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Williams Hardware Co., Kenora, Ontario.\n\nDATE | DESCRIPTION | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1932 March 7 | To account rendered per Vouchers attached. | 21 91\n\nEXAMINED and found correct.\n\nGwelin Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nForm 52.

It is thought that the Inspector on the occasion of his next inspection would wish to refer to same. In future, only one copy of these reports will be required by the Department, and the duplicate should be kept at the school.\n\nRegarding the Inspector's recommendation that four new fire grates be installed in the boilers at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of same, or you can arrange with Mr. Jas. G. Brown, Kenora, to obtain the grates and have them installed. All expenses for the purpose should be kept as low as possible, and, when the work is completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This they agree to do without any cost to the Dept.\n\nI hope this will receive attention very soon as any alterations will have to be completed before starting our furnace.\n\nShould we get a severe Winter we could not keep the school warm under the present system.\n\n....I shall greatly appreciate your early attention to the above.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 17, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to your letter of the 15th ultimo, regarding adjustments to the heating plant at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School and enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal, concerning the matter.\n\nAs you were authorized by official letter dated December 9, 1931, you may arrange with Mr. J. G. Brown, 816 First Street South, Kenora, for the supplying and installing of a vacuum pump, to be used for the carrying out of the adjustments required to place the heating system in a satisfactory condition. Regarding the installation, he should be guided by the instructions he receives from the firm from which he makes the purchase and he should obtain a guarantee that the pump installed will perform satisfactory service. He should keep in touch with the Principal in carrying out all work. It is expected that all expenses will be kept as low as possible, having in view the carrying out of a satisfactory job.\n\nAfter this work has been completed, you should forward a detailed account, in triplicate, in favour of Mr. Brown, covering the cost of the work, including the pump. The Department will expect the Principal and you to see that the work is satisfactorily performed and at an early date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. H. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 129-3-5 of 17th inst., re heating of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. The Principal, Mr. Byers and Mr. J.O. Brown are now in the Office and as you did not return the correspondence from the Arthur Leitch Co., we do not quite know what the guarantee covers. Would you please return this correspondence or send us a copy of that firm's letter.\n\nMr. Brown is writing today to Arthur Leitch Co. for full particulars so as to enable him to give a guarantee, that the heating will be satisfactory on completion of the work. In addition to the installing the tank and vacuum pump and making the necessary adjustments, we presume it may be necessary to change any pipes that may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of the work. As there is no price mentioned, we expect we can accept the tender sent in, if it appears reasonable.\n\nAn early reply will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, with reference to the heating of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It is noted that action has been started to have this work carried out. As requested, I am returning herewith the letter which Mr. Byers received from the Arthur Leitch Company, Toronto. It will be in order to change any piping that may be necessary for the satisfactory completion of the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nCapt Edwards\nIndian Agent\nKenora\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to our interviews in regard to Heating System at Cecilia Jeffery Residential School I am quite prepared to guarantee that the equipment now in operation when connected up as I recommend with a Vacuum Pump of the proper capacity will satisfactory heat the building; The system now in operation would have to be converted from a Vapor to a Vacuum System; This would mean that the air lines on top of Radiators would have to be plugged and the two Returns connected into one together with the correction of one or two water pockets in the return piping would in my opinion put the System in a satisfactory working condition.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ/G2\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of 28th inst., re Heating of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, Kenora.\n\nEnclosed please find a letter we have received from James G.

MacKenzie.\nKenora, Ontario,\nOctober 13th, 1932.\n\nCapt. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Heating System at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nReferring to the Engineer's inspection of the Heating System of the above job, I wish to advise that the Radiators and Steam and Return Mains have been carefully checked, and the following changes would be necessary in order to put the system in shape, so that it would satisfactorily heat the entire building and residence to a temperature of 70 degrees, even an outside temperature of 30 or 40 below zero. All the return mains in the Basement should be raised to provide free drainage of condensation. Steam Mains in Basement should be dripped at various points to drain condensation from the mains, providing dry steam for radiators. All Steam Risers running from Basement mains to 1st. and 2nd. floors should be dripped more frequently, traps being installed any possibility of these risers being choked with condensation. All basement radiators should be provided with thermostatic radiation traps on return ends connected with return mains. All the branches from steam mains in basement connecting these mains to the basement radiators, should be altered as shown on details, eliminating possibility of water collecting in radiators. An automatic vacuum and backwater\u9632\u6b62\u5668 should be installed in boiler room which should be capable of removing all condensation and air in the heating system and return condensation automatically to the boiler.\n\nRegarding the residences it would be necessary to install two small radiators in the basement space, and add radiator in the vestibule on the ground floor. The radiator in the dining room, living room and kitchen should also be slightly increased in size, by addition of extra sections.\n\nDetails of necessary changes of piping and connections will be clearly shown on drawing which we will provide\nWhen the above alterations are completed, we will guarantee that the building will be satisfactorily heated under the temperature conditions previously stated. We would like to point out, however, that in the cold winter weather it will be necessary that all windows in the building be kept closed, as far as possible. You will understand that it is not possible to satisfactorily heat the building, if windows are left open for any length of time and the building becomes chilled.\n\nWe would also like to point out that the above alterations will not produce an even temperature throughout the entire building, as there will be a natural tendency to overheat certain sections. This overheating would have to be overcome by the proper adjustment by hand of the various valves placed throughout the system, and we believe that this failure can be easily overcome by slight experience in operation when the changes are made.\n\nI estimate that the above work would cost $2000.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames G. Brown\nKenora Ontario,\nOctober 13th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. J. G. Brown, Plumber, of Kenora, has been in to see us with Mr. Leitch, Heating Engineer, from Toronto. We inclose letter that Mr. Brown has handed to us re the heating of the Nicola Jeffery Residential School, and wish you that Mr. Brown estimated it would cost \u00a32000.00 to put the furnace piping etc., and install a vacuum pump in good shape to satisfactorily heat the building and also asking you if the minimum rate of wages should be paid, as the usual custom is to pay considerable more for plumbers in this district.\n\nWe had authority to do this work, but did not expect the cost to be so high, therefore wired you for further instructions.\n\nPlease let us hear from you as soon as possible, if you have not already wired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOct. 14, 1928.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 13th instant, with further reference to the alterations in the heating system at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, I beg to say that the Department approves of the changes being made by Mr. Brown, as outlined in his letter. It is noted that the estimated cost of the work is $5,000.00, and unless no circumstances meet the cost exceed this amount, so this is all the money that is available. Then the work to completed proper vouchers should be forwarded for the labour and materials.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Howard, A.C.,\nActing Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L.

This price is taking into consideration that part of the labor will be performed by school help.\n\nI hope the Dept. will authorize this expenditure as we have about 400 bu. of potatoes and about the same of turnips in pits in the field and must be moved soon to escape the frost.\n\nThanking you to give your attention to the above,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 2, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in which he requests that the Department provide the sum of $25 for material and extra wages to carry out the repairs required to the root house.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department has recently authorised considerable expenditure at this school in connection with the purchase of farm machinery and in alterations to the heating equipment, the latter largely exceeding the amount that was at first anticipated. We have no funds for any further expenditure at this school this year, and the repairs required to the root house, including material and labour, will have to be provided by the school authorities from their per capita earnings or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKinnon,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Morris, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKemora, Ont.\nKENORA, Ont., November 4th \u2014 1932\n\nCaptain F. Edwards, Esq\nIndian Agent,\n\nDear Captain:\n\nThere are several items of vital importance that I discovered while on an inspection tour during Fire Prevention Week in the two residential schools for Indian children that I wish you would bring to the attention of the proper authorities because if anything occurs it may reflect on some of these features that should have been attended to. There were several fireplaces in the Cecilia Jeffery School which are landing places for fire escape doors that are not properly installed and would interfere with the proper escape of children if an emergency occurred at the foot of the stairs and March wide which is the inside side of the bottom of the escape ladder right up against the chapel wall and at the North end of the landing which is the boys' landing there is no landing the boys end up on the furnaces or boiler room roof which is certainly a very dangerous place to have to pass over in case they would be needed all if that happened to happen when the escape doors were closed they should be able to run straight down off the landing and not have to climb the rear wall right off that those defects are not only against the rules of fire escape but they are against the principles of safety which is what the escape was put up for in the first place. Having had several experiences of handling patients from the hospital wards of that school we found that it is impossible to take a person out of the wards in a stretcher to be taken in our ambulance and had trouble to make even a small child in that situation in the hall, there should be doors direct out of the wards instead of the present ones, more harm can be done than is necessary in serious cases and so the Officer in charge of the Municipal Ambulance I wish to state that it is dangerous business to move patients out of those wards as they are today and I certainly do not wish to be the one responsible for any further injuries that might occur. To offset these doors should be strengthened quickly as possible, there should also be a fire hydrant on the house reel and this house reel should be in proper order and the water hydrant should be put in proper shape where it would be ready for instant use, if it had not been for this house at the last fire at the school there would have been a great deal more damage caused, therefore I strongly recommend that this house reel and hydrant be given immediate attention, the fire drills are excellent and the fire protection equipment is in good condition but I would recommend that proper action be taken in the above mentioned items because you never can tell when a serious mishap may occur.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChief Fire Dept.\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Grand Jury in their report to the Judge at the last session of the Court at Kenora made the following remarks regarding the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School:\n\n\"We would respectfully recommend that the Fire Escape System in this School be thoroughly examined by a Government Official, as we consider the present Fire Escape system inadequate. Cupboards and Clothes Closets are an absolute necessity for the comfort of the students in this building. The Plastering requires to be attended to, and if brought to the attention of the proper authority, will undoubtedly be taken care of.\"\n\nWe include a letter received from the Fire Chief, which we asked him to write us after our inspection of the school.\n\nThe School is of the standard plan as used by the Department, but the Fire Chief claims that doors should be made for the children to escape to the fire escape instead of the main windows. The stairways on the girls' side should run out from the building instead of along the side of the wall. Short iron ladders should be put up on the boy's side, from the ground to the top of the boiler room so that they would not have to travel along the boiler house roof to get down. A sliding door should be made between the Hospital and the passage, as it is difficult to get beds or stretchers out of the wards, into the main building. A new fire hose should be purchased for use from the main building to the outbuildings, as the present hose has perished through exposure, and a small house should be built, which can be heated, to house this hose reel, and the water hydrant should also be placed in this house.\"\n\nIn going over the Fire Chief's recommendation with the Principal, we are of the opinion, that the expenditure would be in the neighbourhood of $300.00 for this work, with the exception of the hose, which would cost $225.00.\n\nWe shall be glad to receive your instructions, but will refer you to your letter 129-3-5 of 2nd inst., in which you inform us that there are no further funds for expenditures at this school this year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: James A.

As you know funds are very limited and the expenditure should, therefore, be kept as low as possible. If you think it is absolutely necessary you may purchase new outside fire hose, but arrangements for having this done will have to be postponed until next year.\n\nWhen you are arranging to have this work done kindly be guided by your list of firms who are to be given work.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Morinie, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLondon, Ont.\nAs Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have had some more trouble at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nOne of the water pumps at the pump house at the Lake has broken (the block, piston, and piston rods are broken). The Principal went to the Campbell Heating Company and Mr. Campbell has been in to see me and informs me the cost of repairing the pump would be in the neighbourhood of $460.00. (Parts $275.00 labour $185.00) A new pump, less the cost of new parts which is not required would be $320.00 and cost of labour installing.\n\nMr. Cheyne, Electrician, informed me he had been to the school and requested the Principal, and found all the fittings in the pump house in a terrible state. He claims the following repairs and replacements are required: The main switchboard to be scrapped and replaced with a new one or larger, new switch for #2 pump, switch for #1 pump, screws and cables, new hand control switch, all electrical wiring renewed, new automatic starter. The cost of the above would be in the neighbourhood of $100.00 not counting the cost of the automatic starter ($25.00) and he does not a price, but estimates the cost of all the electrical repairs would be in the neighbourhood of $200.00.\n\nOn making enquiries as to the cause of these troubles, it appeared that the two motors were not used by the action of the storm from the generator mixer, one of the containers had a leak and was empty and the blame was placed on Messrs. Wallace and Tiernan who supplied it, for the past correspondence and vouchers for repairs. The Principal informs me Wallace and Tiernan Inspector occasionally inspects the machines and has not informed him there was anything wrong, but it seems to me that this should have been noticed before and amounts put in the estimates to take care of any trouble that might be expected to arise.\n\nI am also informed the motors for the pumps are getting affected and should be looked into and relubricated to prevent further trouble.\n\nThese matters are all most imperative, as the water supply for the school will be stopped if anything goes wrong with the one pump that is operating, and the consequent danger should a fire occur with inadequate water supply.\n\nMr. Byers also requests that a check valve be placed in the water pipe at the school to prevent water returning down the pipe to the lake when the pump is not working.\n\nI would refer you to my letter of the 16th instant re expenditure incurred as recommended by the Grand Jury and Fire Chief, and to your letter 129-3-5 of 2nd instant calling my attention to the fact that no further funds are available for this school.\n\nThere is no question there is more money spent at this\nschool, than at any other of the four in my agency; I hesitate to lay the blame on the Principal, but it appears that he should be at least able to prepare for the expenditure by putting an amount in his estimates to take care of this instead of having things until they go wrong; and then informing us that the expenditure must be made, when no provision has been made.\n\nWallace and Tiermans man should be instructed to visit the school, and report on the damage done and to give advice so that more damage will not be done by the action of the chlorine.\n\nI shall be glad to receive instructions as soon as possible, as you can understand the urgency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\nCANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY'S TELEGRAPH\n\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCABLE CONNECTIONS TO ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD\n\n[Signature]\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nIomora, Ont.\n\nReference letter nineteenth re Cecilia Jeffrey School may arrange to have new pump installed also repairs to electric wiring.

It is noted that one of the pumps has completely broken down and that the cost of repairing same would be excessive, in comparison with the supplying of a new one. It is noted, further, that it would be necessary, also, to have all fittings in the pumphouse repaired and the electrical wiring renewed. You were authorized, by telegram of the 26th instant, as follows:\n\n\"Reference letter nineteenth, re Cecilia Jeffrey School, may arrange to have new pump installed, also repairs to electric wiring. In performance of work, be guided by lists of firms already supplied you.\"\n\nIt is noted that the cost of a new pump, less a new pulley, which is not required, would be $520, which includes the cost of the labour in installing same. It is noted, further, that the cost of all the electrical repairs, new equipment in the pumphouse and the supplying of a new main switch board, of the larger type, would be $575. As stated in the telegram, you should take immediate steps to have the new pump supplied, installed and the repairs made to the electric wiring, etc. The Department notes that the electrician who examined the fittings in the pumphouse found them in a \"terrible state\", and it would appear that there has been a certain amount of carelessness in the operation of this pump. Has the school a competent man in charge, who is able to operate the pumping equipment?\n\nThe Department has no funds provided for the above equipment and repairs, and it was necessary to obtain same by diverting needed expenditure at other schools. Should occasion arise for other expenses at this school during the present fiscal year, it will be necessary for the school authorities to provide the cost of same from per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nAfter the new pump has been installed and the electrical equipment repaired, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

In addition to this there will be freight on the pump from Winnipeg.\n\nWe thought it advisable to let you know this, as your letter authorized the expenditure, which you presumed to include cost of installing.\n\nWe have notified the Principal that should there be any further expenditure for his school during the present fiscal year, it must be borne by the school authorities, out of the per capita allowances or other receipts.\n\nWe will write you re the man in charge of the pumps and machinery, when we have heard from the Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, December 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the purchase of the pump to be installed in the pumphouse in connection with the water system at the Cecilia Jeffries Indian Residential School and the cost of labour for the installation.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is noted that the cost of labour and the freight on the pump from Winnipeg will be in addition to the price of the pump, viz.: $350. It has been that the labour costs for installing this pump will be kept as low as possible. You should forward a voucher in triplicate, properly certified, covering this expenditure. Further, when forwarding the account in payment for the pump and the freight, please attach a receipt for the freight charges prepaid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario.\nDecember 9th, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter 129-3-5 of 26th ultimo and our reply of 30th ult. All the work is proceeding at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, and will soon be completed.\n\nThe Principal writes us under yesterday's date claiming that the breakdown of the pumps was not caused by neglect of the engineer. He is anticipating a visit from an engineer of the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. who originally supplied the pump, and will get his opinion. The Principal's idea is that the chemical reaction from the storage of the Chlorine two years ago is causing all the trouble in the pumphouse. He claims \"Our engineer is conscientious and reliable, and understands fully the operation of both pumps and chlorine plant. The chlorine expert commented on the knowledge our engineer had of the operation of the plant\". He also claims that as soon as the firing commences in the fall, his duties are confined to the heating plant, pumps, filters etc. He considers him as competent anyone could secure, and couldn't see how the break could have been averted.\n\nWe are instructing the Principal to see that all the electric fittings and equipment in the pumphouse, are gone over and cleaned at least once a month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo H.

There is no question but that the school needs painting inside very badly. Mr. MacAllen saw this school when he was here and commented on its dirty condition.\n\nWe shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OF CANADA\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School\nPresbyterian\n\nKenora, Ont., August 2nd, 1935.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Painting the School.\n\nI wish to inform you that the school is in very bad need of paint. The plaster has never been painted and it is almost impossible to keep it clean.\n\nWe are prepared to do most of the work ourselves. There may be some special jobs which would require an experienced painter, but we will manage all the rest.\n\nI estimate it will require approximately $100 of paint, oil etc. I had a painter tender on the job and he asked $150. The plaster has been washed so often it is deteriorating on account of not having a paint coat.\n\nI would like the work done while the children are on holidays so that it can dry properly.\n\nI shall be much obliged to have charity extended to me.\n\nThanking you in anticipation of your attention to the above I remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE W BYERS\nOttawa, August 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It is noted he requests that a quantity of paint, oils, etc., to a cost of approximately $600, be supplied to paint the interior of the school.\n\nIn reply I have to say that no funds were provided in our Estimates for the current fiscal year to cover the cost of painting or redecorating at Indian schools. Therefore, it will not be possible to authorize any expenditure for this purpose at the Cecilia Jeffrey School this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nBoiler Inspector J.M. Kelly of Fort Arthur has inspected the boilers in the several schools in this agency and made the following comments:\n\nCecilia Jeffreys were previously advised that different parts of the laundry machinery be guarded. This has been well taken care of.\n\nSioux Lookout School - Advises that some gears on a mangle should be guarded and this will only cost a few dollars and we have requested the Principal to have this attended to immediately for the safety of the children and Staff.\n\nLo. Intosh School - The conditions here are generally good but advises the use of more soda, and this has been attended to.\n\nKemora R.C. School (Antoine) Belt on wheel of extractor and Dough Lixer to be guarded. This has been attended to.\n\nThe only charge in connection with the above will be at Sioux Lookout, and we shall be glad to receive the necessary authority.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the inspection of the boilers at the Indian Residential Schools in your agency. It is noted that the suggestions made by the Inspector at each of the Cecilia Jeffrey, McIntosh and Kenora Schools are being carried out and that all dangerously exposed parts of equipment will be guarded.\n\nWith reference to the Sioux Lookout Residential School, the Principal should arrange to have the gears on the mangle guarded. As the cost will be small, it is considered the school authorities should carry out this work without expense to the Department. I would request that you advise the Principal to arrange for having proper guards placed on the gears of the mangle as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, K.C.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario,\nAugust, 10th, 1933.\n\nInclosed please find account we have received from the Campbell Heating Co. for repairing the hot water at the Joshua Jeffrey Residential School. The Principal gave instructions for this work to Mr. Campbell while we were on annuity payments and received no authority from this Office, but the Principal informs us that he considered it was imperative that the machine was repaired immediately.\n\nIf the Department is prepared to meet this expenditure, kindly return the accounts with the necessary authority so we can take out the necessary warrant or order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing the account of the Campbell Heating Company, Kenora, covering the cost of repairs to the Kelvinator at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that no authority was given the Principal to incur this expenditure. It is considered that he could have forwarded a request and obtained the necessary authority before having the work carried out. The Principal should understand that, before incurring expenses in a case where he will request the Department to make payment, he should obtain the necessary authority from the Department, through your office.\n\nOwing to the circumstances, that you were absent on Annuity payments and that the Principal considered it imperative that the machine receive immediate repair, the Department will pay the amount of the account covering the cost of the work. I enclose encumbrance certificate authorizing funds for the purpose to the amount of $87.90. The account which you forwarded is returned herewith, in order that you can attach it to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. You should state on each copy of the voucher that the expenditure was incurred under authority of R. R. No. 861.\n\nRegarding the item \"Labour for removing and installing Kelvinator, $18.75\", it will be necessary to furnish details as to the hours and the price charged per hour. Further, with reference to the item for freight and cartage, the paid freight receipt should accompany the account.

September 7th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI visited the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School on the 1st instant. I found this school in a rather unsatisfactory state, especially regarding the condition of the floors. They were dirty, and the wainscoting in the corridors and stairways was torn in a number of places. The Principal said he would have things cleaned up. He made request for a grant to put a new roof on the root house. I told him the Department had no funds this year. He stated that the school would provide the cost if later the Department would re-imburse them. I made no promise in this regard. He, however, will keep the necessary accounts covering cost of material and submit them later to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland\nActg.

The\nChief suggests that the Hallways and Fire Escapes should\nbe kept completely clear, too much material is left piled\nin the Hallways and on the Fire Escapes at the present time.\nHand extinguishers should be charged every year and Hose\nreels used for fire purposes only should not be used for anything\nelse, except occasional practices.

This item\nshould be checked and if found unsatisfactory reported to\n\nsee that these instructions are carried\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nCaptain F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nTown.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nIn connection with our inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school I wish to present you with the following report as requested by you.\n\nThe conditions in the school could be improved upon as regards to cleanliness and order especially in the hallways; too much material is allowed to be left piled in there hallways and obstructions are being left on the fire escapes; these appliances should be kept absolutely free from obstacles. The hand extinguishers should be charged every year and none intended for fire purposes should not be used for any other purpose except for occasional practices; some of this hose was found lying outside and is generally subject to damage from the weather. I would suggest that the Principal appoint one of the staff an special caretaker of all fire protection appliances whose duties could be to see that all the hand extinguishers are recharged properly at least once a year and that the fire hose on the reels be not interfered with and the hose on the hose reel intended for the outside sections be kept on the reel always ready for use and hose to be tested and properly dried out at least twice a year.\n\nThe fire drills held by the pupils showed that they keep themselves very efficiently trained in this respect and the fire alarms are always in good order but they should be tested frequently.\n\nThe firehose for outside fire protection should be long enough to reach any of the outside premises; this item should be checked up and if found unsatisfactory should be remedied at once.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. Dubois.\nChief Fire Dept.\nOttawa, November 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing the report of the Kenora Fire Chief on his inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that he is to keep the corridors in a cleanly condition and that no material is to be left piled in them. Further, it is absolutely necessary that no obstruction be left on the fire escape. You should inform the Principal that it is expected he will comply with the Department's requirements, as mentioned above. He should also take proper care of the fire hose. It is noted the Fire Chief found some of the hose lying outside, exposed to the weather. The fire hose should not be interfered with, and whether intended for inside use or for the outside sections, it should be kept on the reels, always ready for use. It should be tested and dried out at least twice a year. The suggestion of the Fire Chief, that the Principal appoint a member of the staff as special caretaker of all fire protection appliances, should be carried out.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the chemicals required to refill the fire extinguishers; and, when these are delivered at the school, the Principal should see that the refills are installed, that the extinguishers are overhauled and placed in good condition, ready for immediate use. After the refills have been purchased, please obtain an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the cost.\n\nThese extinguishers should be thoroughly overhauled once each year; and, if refills are required, application should be made for the necessary authority to purchase same.\n\nYou should impress upon the Principal the necessity for having all fire equipment at his school in good condition, ready for use in case of fire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

W. Ryerson, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, who visited the Department yesterday, requested that the title of ownership of the motor boat, which was supplied a number of years ago for the use of the school, be transferred from the Indian Department to the Presbyterian Church authorities and that, if remuneration is required, it be a nominal sum only.\n\nAt the present time, this boat is in need of extensive repairs. A new engine was installed by the school authorities last summer.\n\nThe reason for requesting the transfer of the title to the boat is that it can be used for commercial purposes and in connection with church work. The Presbyterian Church authorities are opening a summer school at Shell Lake this coming summer, for the benefit of underprivileged children of that denomination and they would need the boat in transferring the children and supplies. Besides, a certain revenue could be obtained by the rental of the boat for excursion purposes and for handling freight. The boat would also be used for all school purposes - trekking, recruiting and for transporting the children to and from their homes. One of the main reasons for requesting the transfer is that, if the boat was owned by the church authorities, there would be no criticism of its use for commercial purposes.\n\nI informed Mr. Ryerson that the Department will have no funds to\nhave no funds to repair and overhaul the boat or to pay for the engine. Personally, I can see no objection to the transfer of the title on this boat to the Presbyterian Church authorities, on condition that it be available at all times for school purposes.\n\nThis boat was formerly used by the Indian Agent, but, when a new boat was supplied for the use of the school, in 1923, it was arranged between the Agent and the Principal of the School, that the old boat be handed over to the Agent and the boat used for agency purposes transferred for school purposes. The Department approved of this arrangement, and this old agency boat is the one now referred to, for which transfer of title is requested.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your directions regarding the transfer of title to the Presbyterian Church authorities.\n\n[Signature]\nDecember 8, 1933.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. E. W. Byers, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, who visited the Department yesterday, requested that the title of ownership of the motor boat, which was supplied a number of years ago for the use of the school, be transferred from the Indian Department to the Presbyterian Church authorities and that, if remuneration is required, it be a minimal sum only.\n\nAt the present time, this boat is in need of extensive repairs. A new engine was installed by the school authorities last summer.\n\nThe reason for requesting the transfer of the title to the boat is that it can be used for commercial purposes and in connection with church work. The Presbyterian Church authorities are opening a summer school at Shoal Lake this coming summer, for the benefit of underprivileged children of that denomination, and they would use the boat in transferring the children and supplies. Besides, a certain revenue could be obtained by the rental of the boat for excursion purposes and for handling freight. The boat would also be used for all school purposes - freighting, recruiting and for transporting the children back and forth from their homes. One of the main reasons for requesting the transfer is that, if the boat were owned by the church authorities, there would be no criticism of its use for commercial purposes.\n\nI informed Mr. Byers that the Department will have no funds to\nhave no funds to repair and overhaul the boat or to pay for the engine. Personally, I can see no objection to the transfer of the title of this boat to the Presbyterian Church authorities, on condition that it be available at all times for school purposes.\n\nThis boat was formerly used by the Indian Agent, but, when a new boat was supplied for the use of the school, in 1923, it was arranged between the Agent and the Principal of the School that this new boat be handed over to the Agent and the boat used for agency purposes transferred for school purposes. The Department approved of this arrangement, and this old agency boat is the one now referred to, for which transfer of title is requested.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your directions regarding the transfer of title to the Presbyterian Church authorities.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

This building, you know, is situated so that it has no protection on south and east sides at all, and the fact that school buildings have large window areas, the consequent draft through windows and doors cause the fuel cost per annum on this building to be much higher than it should be.\n\nI feel confident that at least 10% could be saved in fuel each year, which would soon pay for job and add to comfort of both teachers and pupils.\n\nPeace Metal Weatherstrip, is manufactured in Winnipeg and manufacture and installation runs around $6.\n\nWeatherstripping is a recognized part of all public buildings of recent construction. Its worth being recognized to extent that it is specified by all architects designing buildings for rigorous climate, and, while having fuel saving qualities, it adds stability and length of life to window sash and frames; all windows operate easily and smoothly and do not need to be wired up or hammered down.

His report is inclosed herewith.\n\nApparently the equipment shows signs of rough usage but the Chief, with the good parts, has been able to put them all in order with the exception of one he suggests should be replaced by a 5 gal. \"Tank Thrister\" as sold by the Canadian Fireworks Hose Co. and also suggests that all the equipment be replaced with this pump type, as soon as they show signs of wear and tear, that will necessitate them being replaced.\n\nWe shall be glad therefore if you will purchase, or give us authority to purchase the 5 gal. \"Tank Thrister\" as recommended.\n\nWe are writing the Principal that more care has to be used in looking after all fire fighting equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\nChief Fire Department.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nKENORA, ONT.

This report reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"Three of the hand chemicals were found empty and one was used to see if it would work. It emptied out properly and operated as it should. The others, after being examined carefully, show signs of rough usage and to such an extent that they are not fit for use until they receive some special attention. One of them had been buried; as it seems that the acid bottle was broken and was used for some time and the fumes from it destroyed the inner section of chemical, especially the strainer part, which is completely burnt off; some had the screw top on it split; another had the acid cartridge container burst open at the bottom.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\n\"The children will have to leave them alone and they must be operated only by someone who knows how to use them in the right way.\"\n\nIn connection with the above, I would point out that the members of the staff and the older boys should be instructed regarding the proper manner in which to handle the fire extinguishers in case of fire. Definite instructions should be given to the younger children not to handle the fire extinguishers. You should give this matter your personal attention, as the fire extinguishers are useless if not kept in good condition and, besides, the Department does not wish to incur the expense of replacing fire extinguishers that have been damaged owing to the lack of proper supervision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F.

Anything stored in it will spoil as the roof is full of holes and the rain runs through all over it. The floor is also rotting because of the dampness.\n\nWe have commenced haying now and will require to use it right away.\n\nMr. W.R.

Two Hundred Dollars was included in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year towards the cost of the root-house. Through oversight, you were informed in official letter of July 19th that this amount was intended for necessary repairs during the current year.\n\nIt has been decided to pay the account of the Williams Hardware Company, for $268.77, and I am returning the other accounts, in order that they may be paid by the Principal, from school funds. However, if you have not expended the amount mentioned in official letter of the 19th ultimo, you may return the accounts which I am enclosing in this letter, and they will be paid.

Several of these accounts were returned to you with the request that, if the amount authorized for repairs at this school during the current fiscal year had not been expended, you return the accounts for payment, in which event the Department would be unable to provide any funds for repairs during the current fiscal year. I may add that the Department has received an account from the Keewatin Lumber Company, Limited, accounting to $110.07, for flooring; shipboards, etc., supplied to the school during the current fiscal year. Please inform the Department if there is any unexpended balance of the amount authorized this year. If not, these accounts should be returned to be paid by the Principal.\n\nWe are holding the account of the Keewatin Lumber Company, Limited, until we hear further from you.

The school was to provide all labor.\n\nWe have constructed a building which will last for a great many years and by doing our own labor have saved the Dept. approximately $700.\n\nIf the school had the funds to pay the above account I would pay it and thus avoid any further trouble with the same but we have been cut down so low with financial assistance that I cannot possibly retire the account out of school funds.\n\nIt seems to me that there must be some misunderstanding re the above account as Mr. Sutherland gave me definite instructions to purchase the material and to forward the accounts to the Dept.\nI hope I have made this matter clear to the Department and that the Dept. will see its way clear to pay the account.\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, relative to the accounts covering the cost of the erection of a root-house at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

You should also prepare and forward proper voucher forms for the other accounts mentioned above. If you have not these accounts in your office, no doubt, they can be obtained from the Principal of the School. The Department is anxious to settle this matter, and I would request that you forward the accounts in proper order for payment at an early date.\n\nRegarding payment of the amount that was authorized for repairs to the roof of the barn, by E.

Sutherland,\nDept. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nQuite a long time ago I received a communication from your Dept. re the advisability of employing a night watchman. My reply to you was that I was of the opinion that with the arrangements I had in the school that I could manage without one.\n\nWe have a very different situation now because of a number of things which have transpired during the past few months. I am fully convinced now that a night watchman is very necessary.\n\nFor one thing there is considerable unrest and agitation amongst the local unemployed and many of these are demanding food and lodging and will take shelter wherever they find a warm building.\n\nThen there has been a lot of thieving of poultry, feed and tools. On one occasion some one entered our hen-house and thinking he was turning on the electric light, turned the switch for the heater and this was left on all night and almost caused a fire. We have disconnected this switch entirely.\n\nNow we have a man in our employ who has been with us each summer during the busy work and he has proven to be very reliable and I would like to engage him for the Winter season as night watchman. Our school funds are not sufficient to provide for this and I shall very much appreciate it if the Department will allow me a grant of $100 towards the paying of a night watchman.\n\nI shall appreciate an early reply as I am allowing him to leave unless arrangements are made for further engagement.\n\nThanking you for your attention to the above,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, November 25th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a letter, dated the 25th instant, from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department considers that, as the Cecilia Jeffrey School is a comparatively new building, there is no great necessity for the employment of a night watchman in order to guard against fire hazard. Reasonable care and supervision on the part of all members of the staff should be sufficient.\n\nHowever, the Principal's letter suggests a situation that might cause considerable damage and the Department is inclined to allow him $50 a month for the period December 1st, 1934, to March 31st, 1935, in order to enable him to engage a night watchman. Please let me know, at once, if you consider this expenditure necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nA. F.

We find that there is no accommodation or kitchen utensils\nand dishes in the Kitchen and would strongly recommend a cupboard or a\nkitchen cabinet be installed. We would also recommend that the windows\nof the Jail be caulked and weather stripped, there being no steam\nwindows this would be a great saving in the fuel problem.\n\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School.- We found the School to be well\nmanaged but the fire hose in bad condition and suggest that they\nbe inspected by an expert. The boilers we maintain are obsolete\nand the furnace room exceedingly hot owing to the fact the boilers\nwere not properly insulated and would suggest the windows of this\nbuilding be also caulked.\n\nKenora General and St. Joseph's Hospitals.- We inspected both\nof these buildings and found them to be in perfect condition in\nevery respect. We took up the matter of changing the date of the\nGeneral Sessions and the majority of the jurors were of the opinion\nit should not be changed.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nW.A. Whittle,\nChairman of the Jury.\nKENORA, ONT., November 29th, 1934.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI herewith enclose a copy of the presentment of the Grand Jury at the recent sittings of the District Court of Kenora, this District\u2014so it contains references some of which may appertain to matters under your jurisdiction or may otherwise interest you.\n\nJudge of the District Court,\nDistrict of Kenora.\n\nA.F.

The boilers we maintain are obsolete and the furnace room exceedingly hot owing to the fact the boilers were not properly insulated and would suggest the windows of this building be also sealed.\"\n\nAs the Cecilia Jeffrey School is comparatively new, the Department cannot understand why the Jury has reported that the boilers are obsolete.

The Department will allow $25 per month for this period. You may prepare a voucher in favour of the Principal at the end of each month and forward same to the Department for payment. I enclose sample voucher.\n\nAs you suggest, the Principal is being written and informed that all requests in connection with the Cecilia Jeffrey School should be forwarded to the Department through your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department is not prepared to supply such equipment to the Cecilia Jeffrey School at the present time.\n\nPlease note that all requests for equipment or repairs for which you wish the Department to pay should be forwarded through the office of Mr. Agent Edwards.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nTown.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter our recent inspection of the Cecilia Jeffery Indian residential School I wish to present to you my report on the conditions found as follows:\n\nSeveral Thermex hand extinguishers used sometime ago on a bush fire require recharging; none of these machines is not fit for further use and should be replaced, besides recharging these machines there should be at least two spare ready charged at hand.\n\nThe fire hose on hose reels in the building are all in good order except two, one of these hose sections is full of holes and is therefore unfit for use, another one that showed signs of wear was taken to our firehall and put through a test, it had several holes in it and leaked so badly that it also is not fit for use, therefore two new sections of linen hose should be procured to replace the two found in the above mentioned condition. I might also state that one of these hose sections appeared to have three or four joints and when it is laid on the ground it seems that all these hose be rolled up instead of laid in layers the same reels can be still used and this will allow less bends and kinks and also much quicker obtained when needed for use. I would recommend that this hose be not used except for fire purposes.\n\nThe hose on the reel in the reel shed appears to be in good order but it should be long enough to be able to reach the furthest buildings, i.e., from the hydrant at least two more sections are required to make it long enough to reach these buildings and this hose should be tested and dried out properly at least twice a year, this could be done in connection with practices by the employees.\n\nThe main valve that controls the water for the fire hose standards of hose reels should be kept always free from obstructions as it may be hard to be handled very quickly sometimes just at the present a few objects are in the way and they should be removed.\n\nThe fire escapes all appear to be in proper order I would suggest that they be kept free from snow or ice in the Winter time.\n\nRespectfully submitted by\n\nF. Dubois.\nChief Fire Dept.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nWINNIPEG, MAN., December 12th, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have received a request from Mr. Byers, principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, for permission to purchase a No. 50 Duncan leaf slicer from the Grantford Scale Co., Winnipeg, at $65.00, the original price being $320.00. The slicer has apparently been taken in on a trade. A bread slicer at $60.00 is also requested, making a total of $125.00.\n\nBefore placing this before the Department, I wrote Mr. F. Edwards, Indian Agent, Kenora, asking for his recommendation in connection with this matter. Mr. Edwards, in his reply, stated that he is writing the Department with reference to Mr. Byers taking up matters of this nature direct or through the office. I do not think Mr. Edwards has much to say about this case as I referred the matter to him before taking any action.\n\nI do not know the Department's policy in connection with supplying the items asked for, but I find that in most of our schools a bread slicer is provided and I doubt the same could be used to advantage at the Cecilia Jeffrey School. I am not prepared to make a recommendation in connection with the meat slicer.\n\nKindly advise me as to the Department's wish in connection with the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nH.

These will be shipped, addressed to the Principal, Kenora, Ont., and the account covering the cost, with receipt for prepaid charges, will be sent you. When the equipment arrives, you should certify this account in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the fire hose which has been worn and is in poor condition, it is noted you request that two - 50 feet lengths 1\u00bd\" fire hose be supplied and also two - 50 feet lengths of the same size as previously supplied. We are unable to place the order until you inform the Department of the dimensions of all the hose required, as it is not understood whether this should be 1\u00bd\" diameter for the full quantity. Please state, also, whether any couplings or nozzles are needed. When this information is received, an order will be placed here to have the hose forwarded to the Principal.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that he should carry out the suggestions of the Fire Chief, that all hose be rolled up instead of laid in layers. The same reels can be used and this will allow less bends and kinks and also much quicker obtained when needed for use. The hose should not be used except for fire purposes. The Fire Chief has drawn attention to the main valve that controls the water for the fire hoses. This should be kept free from obstruction, as at present a few objects are in the way and they should be removed. The fire escapes should be kept free from snow or ice during the winter months.\n\nWhen the refills are received, they should be placed in the extinguishers, and the Principal should see that all extinguishers are in good condition and ready for instant use.\n\nThe Department has no desire in the matter of having the Grand Jury visit the school, but their visit will be appreciated if the Court requests that they do so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nA.

This school was abandoned, and a new one built near Kenora.\n\nThe Duport Mining Co., Ltd., are operating a property near the old Indian school, which apparently has been abandoned for some years. In the school there is considerable equipment that we could use. We would like to purchase the stove, sinks, and some articles of similar equipment. The school is rapidly falling into a state of disrepair, and is wide open, and I expect anything of value will in time disappear, as I imagine much of it already has. I wrote to Mr. Byram in regard to this matter, but heard nothing from him.\n\nI would be glad to hear if any of this equipment is for sale, and at what price.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nDuport Mining Co., Ltd.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.B. Groves\nOttawa, January 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of communication received from the Dupont Mining Company, Limited, Indian Bay P. O., Man., offering to purchase certain equipment which was left at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School building at Shoal Lake after that school was abandoned and the pupils and staff moved into the new school at Kenora.\n\nThe Department was not aware that any equipment of value was left at the old site, as we understood that, at the time the school authorities moved into the new building, all equipment of any value was taken to the new school.\n\nWhile the old building was the property of the Presbyterian Church, this Department, from time to time, supplied certain equipment. During the period in 1924-25, an electric light plant was installed and paid for by the Department. The 5 kw generator, no doubt, formed part of the electric light equipment and would therefore be the property of the Department. The other material mentioned in the letter from the Mining Company, no doubt, is the property of the Church authorities. I would request that you inform the Department how much of the equipment on hand you consider is departmental property. You should state the price which you believe would be fair value for the sale of same.\n\nThe Department is communicating with the authorities of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, requesting them to make any arrangements they desire in the disposal of the equipment which is their property. The Mining Company mentioned will be informed that they should talk up with you and the Church authorities the matter of the purchase of the equipment.\n\nI shall be pleased to have your early reply, stating how much of the equipment in the old building belongs to the Department and what value you would place on same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEncl.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa, January 23, 1935.\n\nMadam:\n\nI enclose copy of a communication received from the Duport Mining Company, Limited, Indian Bay P. O., Man., in which they desire to purchase certain equipment which was left at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School building, at Shoal Lake, when the pupils and staff moved to the present new school near Kenora.\n\nThe Department understands that the old school building was the property of the Presbyterian Church. While the Department, from time to time, supplied certain equipment, we are not definitely aware which of the articles mentioned in the letter referred to are the property of the Department. During the fiscal year 1924-25, the Department supplied an electric light system, of which the 3 kw. generator was part. We understand, further, that at the time the pupils and staff moved to the new building, near Kenora, all equipment of any value was taken to the new school. The Department is requesting Mr. Frank Edwards, Indian Agent, Kenora, to report regarding the value of any equipment considered government property.\n\nThe above mentioned Mining Company are being asked to forward to you their request regarding the purchase of any equipment which is church-owned at the old school. It should be pleased to be advised, also, if it is intended to remove or otherwise dispose of the old building. In any event, it is considered that any equipment of value should be removed for use at the present Cecilia Jeffrey School, near Kenora. Mr. Byers would, no doubt, arrange for the transfer or sale of the church-owned equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Macdonald,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. D. T. L. McKerrell,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church,\n19 Lansdowne St.,\nToronto 9, Ont.\nOttawa, January 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, offering to purchase certain equipment which remains on hand at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Shoal Lake, Man.\n\nIn reply I have to say that this building is the property of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. During the time the school was in operation, this Department provided certain equipment. The 3 kw. generator is departmental property, but it is considered that the other equipment mentioned in your letter belongs to the Church authorities.\n\nThe Department is communicating with Mr. Frank Edwards, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont., and also with Mrs. D. F. L. McKerrell, Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church, 19 Lown Street, Toronto 9, Ont. They are being forwarded copies of your letter, with the request that they give early attention to the disposal of the equipment on hand. I would suggest that you communicate with the above named, in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. G. Cross, Esq.,\nDupert Mining Co., Ltd.,\nIndian Bay P. O.,\nWengh, Man.\nKenora, Ontario,\nJanuary, 29th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter 129-3-5 dated 23rd inst., including copy of a letter from J. G. Cross, of the Dupont Mining Co. Ltd., wishing to purchase Departmental Equipment left at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School at Shoal Lake.\n\nAt the time we built the new School at Kenora all Departmental equipment of any value that could be used was taken to the new school. The electric lighting plant was left and is of no use at the new school, and as at that time we were informed the Church Authorities were making a Summer Camp of the old school for the members from Winnipeg. Owing to the depression this has never been carried out, but we understand from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, it is still under consideration, and that for the small amount we would get for the Generator it would not be worth selling, as the rest of the plant would then be of no use.\n\nWe would therefore suggest that the Departmental Equipment should not be sold as the Church Authorities are not in favour of selling their equipment.\n\nWe cannot place a value on the Departmental Equipment but think it would be of little value unless used in the present building.\n\nMr. Cross writes that the school is in bad repair and is wide open, but the Principal informs us that the building is not in bad repair unless for the usual depreciation and should not be wide open, as the Church has been paying the two Chiefs at Shoal Lake to look after it.\n\nWe have not received any communication from Mr. Cross as yet, but will reply to him if we do hear from him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.

Feb. 5th, 1935.\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Operation of Pumps.\n\nI wish to inform you that something is wrong with the valve or pipes out in the lake.\n\nThe pumps are loosing their priming and will not start pumping without allowing some water to return through the main valve. This loss of priming is caused by either the foot-valve not closing properly or a leak somewhere in the pipe-line.\n\nI am afraid the pumps may stop working entirely. It will necessitate sending down a diver to locate the trouble. If I had authority to secure a diver I would try flushing back through the main to try to dislodge any obstruction that might be in the foot-valve. There is a risk in doing this as it might blow off the screen on the end of the line. I would not attempt this unless I could secure a diver in case it did not work. This back flushing might remedy the trouble and so not require a diver. However I want to play safe and have the authority to engage a diver providing anything happened.\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 9, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, regarding the trouble that has developed in the operation of the pumps in connection with the water supply system, and requesting that the services of a diver be obtained, in order to locate the trouble. In this connection I have to confirm day letter to you of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"May employ services diver, repairing intake, water supply system, Cecilia Jeffrey School. Have water supply system repaired, keeping all costs low as possible.\"\n\nIt is hoped that the trouble will be located, the repairs carried out and the pumping system placed in good condition without any large expense. Should any new parts or equipment be required, you may purchase same, from a firm on the approved list. The Department expects that all costs will be kept as low as possible and that the school authorities will supply the greater part of the labour.\n\nWhen the repairs to the pumping system have been completed, please forward accounts, in triplicate properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred. The account covering the services of the diver should show in detail the hours employed and the rate charged per hour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nA.

I believe that you are in charge of this matter, and consequently I should like to draw to your attention the findings of our engineer.\n\nIt would appear from the information obtained at the time of the inspection, that the septic tank is badly in need of some supervision. The liquid is not filtering through the soil and tiles as one would expect, but is reaching the surface and is flowing down a surface ditch leading to the lake. This causes objectionable odours and also tends to pollute the water.\n\nWe are very much concerned with the pollution of the water and would ask that you look into the question of either cleaning out or enlarging this installation. It would appear to be necessary to dig up some of the tiles to see whether they are choked or whether the bed had an insufficient number of these for satisfactory disposal of the liquid. Our representative points out that the plant is built so close to the lake that the ground waters over the distribution bed, is somewhat high. He believes that by underdraining the area it might be possible of more effective functioning of the system.\n\nWe shall appreciate a reply from you with reference to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDirector\nDivision of Sanitary Engineering.\nSept. 26, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of the 5th instant regarding the sewage disposal system at the Cecilia Jeffrey School has been referred to the Department by our Indian Agent.\n\nI am today asking the Dominion Water Power Branch to have their District Engineer investigate and report as to what is required to remedy the existing condition.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

This is a shunt wound machine, and has to have a battery connected with it to excite the field coils. The feature is important when there are storage batteries in connection with the lighting plant such as you had there. However the storage batteries are of no more use, and if they were they would be of no use to us. On this account the generator is not worth the price of a direct wound field coil unit. I would not want the engine, but the switch board should go with the generator.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, October 29, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThere is surplus to requirements, a generator and switch board, at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Shoal Lake, Man. The school at this point has been closed and a new school has been established, to replace it, near Kenora, Ont. The local Indian Agent, Kenora, forwards an offer he has received for the generator and switch board, to the amount of $75.00, which he considers a fair price.\n\nI would request your approval for the sale of the above mentioned equipment and that you will forward to this Department the necessary minute authorising same.

When the minute, authorising the sale, is received, you will be advised.\n\nRegarding the desks at the old school building, you should arrange to have them brought to Kenora, and, if any further quantity is required at the Whitesand Bay Day School, you should have them sent there; the remaining desks could be stored in the agency, to be used as required.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nFrank Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOctober 25, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School:\n\nIn accordance with the instructions contained in your letter of September 26th, the writer visited Kenora on October 22nd and 23rd in connection with the above mentioned investigation. The sanitary conditions at this school were discussed with Dr. Ferguson, Medical Health Officer for the Town of Kenora, with Captain Edwards, Indian Agent, and also with Mr. Byers, Principal of the School.\n\nI was informed by Dr. Ferguson, Medical Health Officer of the Town of Kenora, that the Town of Kenora had made no complaints whatsoever to the Director of the Division of Sanitary Engineering of the Department of Health at Toronto concerning the conditions at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School or as to the pollution of Round Lake. Accordingly, any criticism of conditions at the school as regards the pollution of Round Lake does not come from the local authorities but comes as a result of an inspection made by an official of the Department of Health from Toronto.\n\nAs a result of the examination made of conditions at the school, the writer wishes to report that the water from the disposal bed comes to the surface at two or three places throughout the disposal bed and trickles over to a small depression near by and seeps into the sand. Also there is a discharge from the laundry drain in the vicinity of the disposal bed - this being due to the fact that the laundry drain was extended to this vicinity some two or three years ago. There was a slight odor from the discharge through the disposal bed but it was not particularly offensive. The writer is of the opinion that at no time has any leakage from the disposal bed reached the waters of Round Lake, although it is possible that upon one occasion some discharge from the laundry drain might have reached the lake. This discharge would not cause pollution. The fact that the Medical Health Officer of the Town of Kenora takes samples of the water from Round Lake and has made no complaint as to pollution, is very good evidence that no pollution of the waters has taken place as a result of the installation at this Indian School.\n\nI would draw to your attention the fact that this disposal bed was constructed in 1929 at a total cost of $864.17, to which of course must be added the Contractor's profit. At that time the water supply and sewage disposal systems were designed for a total population at the school\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nof One Hundred. Today I am informed by the Principal of the School that the population of the school is 170. It will thus be seen that both the septic tank and the sewage disposal bed are greatly overloaded and it is only to be expected that leakage from the disposal bed will come to the surface in order to find an outlet from the overcrowded conditions. It is probable that some displacement has now taken place in the distributor line or the disposal bed and that some of the tile is out of alignment and possibly blocked, inasmuch as a disposal bed after six or eight years will always require attention, unless particular pains are taken at the time of construction to prevent settlement.\n\nI would also point out that no maintenance work has been done upon the disposal bed at this school and in fact the site has been allowed to deteriorate and to become very uneven.\n\nThe writer is of the opinion that no possible contamination of Round Lake can possibly take place as a result of the condition of the septic tank and disposal bed and the writer is also of the opinion that the conditions at the disposal bed are not such as to be even slightly offensive to the operators of the school. Nevertheless, it is a fact that the population of the school is now such that overloading of the disposal bed has taken place and it is not operating efficiently. I would, therefore, recommend that examination of the distributor line and some of the feeder lines take place in order to determine whether or not any blockage of the system has occurred and furthermore that the disposal bed be enlarged from its present capacity. At present there are approximately 1600 linear feet of tile in place and this should be increased to approximately 2400 linear feet. This work cannot be carried out after July 15th next - at which time the school closes for a six-weeks period, insofar as the children are concerned. It is recommended, however, that this work be carried out immediately following July 15th next and that provision be made in the Estimates for the\n\nThe writer need not point out that the condition existing is not due to any faulty design upon the part of this office but is due entirely to greatly increased numbers of inmates in the Institution and also due to the lapse of six or seven years since the disposal bed was installed. At the time of installation the disposal bed was put in very cheaply and it was to be anticipated that maintenance work would be entailed after a period of five or more years.\n\nThe Principal of the School complained to the writer about the offensive odors in the Boys' playroom and washroom in the basement and intimated that this was caused by the condition of the disposal bed. However, the condition complained of within the school has no relation whatsoever to the condition of the disposal bed.\n\nAt a later date this office will draw up plans providing for the extension of the existing disposal bed and will also furnish estimates of the anticipated cost. These will be forwarded when prepared and in ample time to be included in the Estimates of the Department of Indian Affairs for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of September 26th regarding a complaint received from the Director of the Division of Sanitary Engineering of the Department of Health of Ontario as to the condition of the sewage system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school at Kenora, I now enclose a report dated the 25th instant from Mr. Gow, our Acting District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, based upon a recent inspection of the system.\n\nBriefly, Mr. Gow finds that there has been no contamination of the adjoining Round Lake, but the system is seriously overloaded and it will be necessary to extend the area of the disposal bed. Plans and estimates of this proposed extension will be prepared in ample time for the amount to be included in the estimates of the Department of Indian Affairs for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

The Department has received the report of the acting District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau at Timmins based upon his recent inspection of the system.\n\nBriefly, he finds that there has been no contamination of the adjoining Round Lake but states the system is seriously overloaded and that it will be necessary to extend the area of the disposal bed, and he will submit plans and estimates of this proposed extension. Consideration will be given to providing the funds required for the purpose in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, and the work could be carried out early next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department will await the receipt of the plans and estimates of the proposed extension, which, you state, are being prepared, together with an estimate of the cost, for inclusion in our Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 14, 1935.\n\nThe Department understands that there is surplus to requirements at the old Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School at Shoal Lake, certain equipment such as electric light plant, desks, etc. Recently, an offer was made to purchase the generator and switchboard of the electric light plant. The Department is informed that Mr. Ryerson received a wire from you, as follows:\n\n\"Property entirely ours. No authority given to enter and no negotiations in progress. Sell equipment only with property.\"\n\nIn this connection, might I point out that the above mentioned equipment was supplied and paid for by the Department. The Department could utilize a number of the desks at one of our Indian day schools. It would appear that any equipment remaining in the school is only deteriorating and we would like to dispose of any that is the property of the Department.\n\nThe Department further turned over to this school the old agency launch, at no cost, and we understand that it has not been used for school purposes since that time but is being rented to a contractor who is using it in carrying supplies and men in connection with the building of part of the Kenora-Fort Frances highway.\n\nI should like to have your opinion regarding the disposal of the lighting equipment and the desks. Do you not consider this equipment is the property of the Department?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. D. T. L.

However, we are communicating with Mrs. D. V. L.

As agreed upon at that time, all the equipment on hand at this school is considered the property of the Presbyterian Church. Mr. Agent Edwards, Kenora, is being informed accordingly. For your information, I enclose copy of official letter to Agent Edwards, instructing him to the above effect. It is considered that the old school desks on hand would be unsatisfactory for use in the Indian Day School to which Agent Edwards requested they be sent. The Department will not require these desks for future use.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMrs. D. T. L.

Therefore, this Department cannot authorize the sale of the electric light plant. If, in the future, you receive any request for the disposal of any of the equipment remaining at this school, you should refer such request to the authorities of the Presbyterian Church. The church authorities stated, however, that, should the old school desks be of use, this Department could reserve same. You requested that a number of these desks be transferred to the Whitefish Bay Indian Day School. It is considered that, owing to the condition and type of the desks and the cost involved in shipping, no action should be taken to have them sent to the Whitefish Bay school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The number required could be sent to the Whiteshell Bay Day School. It is hoped that there will be no large expense incurred in transporting the desks.\n\nAs you were informed, the Church authorities agreed to the removal of any desks that would be of use, but all other equipment is to remain in the school - being the property of the Church authorities.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The work appeared well done and the girls were quietly carrying out instructions.\n\nThe dormitories were all well aired and tidy. The beds were neatly made and the bedding clean. There are 158 pupils in residence and there is a shortage of beds. Three pupils are sleeping on the floor and one on a broken bed. Four beds are urgently needed; in fact, I think six should be supplied as two others in use are in poor condition, having been taken from the old school. The other beds are the hospital type and supplied by the Globe Bedding Co. I would recommend that the new ones be the same.\n\nThe playrooms were tidy and the plumbing all in good condition.

The stock should be limited as it is difficult to grow sufficient feed.\n\nThe school is nicely located and I believe fairly well managed. Mrs. Byers is Matron, an arrangement never very satisfactory. I am of the opinion the school, like the Agency, has been left altogether too much alone. They have come to feel that theirs is a small world, all their own, and that even Department officials are more or less interfering.

I understand Mr. Byers has carried out certain suggestions, entailing considerable expense, all to no avail. No one should be expected to carry on under present conditions and, if necessary, a new oven should be installed. A wood burner would no doubt be more suitable.\n\nThe laundry is supervised by Miss Franklin. Clothes are washed Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the ironing carried out on other days of the week. The work appeared well done and the girls were quietly carrying out instructions.\n\nThe dormitories were all well aired and tidy. The beds were neatly made and the bedding clean. There are 150 pupils in residence and there is a shortage of beds. Three pupils are sleeping on the floor and one on a broken bed. Four beds are urgently needed; in fact, I think six should be supplied as two others in use are in poor condition, having been taken from the old school. The other beds are the hospital type and supplied by the Globe Bedding Co. I would recommend that the new ones be the same.\n\nThe playrooms were tidy and the plumbing all in good condition.

He states as follows:\n\n\"When the bread is baking a gas is given off, which makes it impossible to stay in the room. This gas strikes one when 20 ft. from the door and before entering the room one is blinded by tears. It also affects the throat, making it almost impossible to speak. The children are unable to do any of this work and Miss Reichart is practically overcome at the close of each baking day. The oven is an electric one but most unsuitable.\"\n\nThe Department is surprised to learn that there is an escape of gas from this oven and would like to be informed as to what occasions this condition. The oven supplied in September, 1925, was a Model \"C\" Economy Electric Bake Oven and was obtained from A. T. Fife & Company, Kenora. As far as we are aware, there is no gas used in the operation of the oven. A full report is requested regarding the condition of this oven. You should state if it would not be possible, by making some alterations, to overcome the present difficulty. An oven of the type installed should give service for a considerably more lengthy period than the one now in use at your school. Any suggestions or recommendations you care to make, regarding the oven, will be appreciated.\n\nThe Inspector states, further that, while the dormitories are all well aired and tidy, there is a shortage of beds and that three pupils were sleeping on the floor and one on a broken bed. He states that 4 to 6 beds should be supplied. There may be funds available at the beginning of the new fiscal year for the purchase of beds, and I shall be pleased if you will state the size - length and breadth - and the type of new beds required. They should be similar in type to those at present in the dormitories.\n\nThe Inspector reports, also, that the shower baths are not used. These rooms are located, one next to the children's dining room and one next to the staff dining room. The shower floors are not properly laid and water seeps through into the two dining rooms. You might report regarding the floors, stating what you would recommend be done to improve conditions. If possible, please give an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

It is noted, also, that the interior of the school is kept in a satisfactory, cleanly condition.\n\nRegarding the condition of the bake oven, need of more beds and the condition of the cement floor of the shower baths, I have to say that the Principal is being written and requested to furnish a report. The was supplied in September, 1929, and, as far as we are aware, there is no gas used for its operation. We are therefore unable to ascertain the source of the gas which you report as escaping from this oven. Consideration will be given to authorizing the supplying of a few extra beds and also repairing the cement floor.\n\nIt is noted that you will endeavour, in the future, to visit this school twice each year. It is considered that this would be advantageous to both the school and the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G.

It is hoped to have the beds delivered at an early date.\n\nReplying to your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the bake oven, it is considered that the difficulty in its operation through escaping gas is owing to want of proper circulation to exhaust the gas that builds up inside the oven during its operation. It is noted that you are obtaining further information in the matter and that, in the meantime, owing to the cost of power in operating the oven, you find it impracticable to use same and you are buying the bread required for use at the school.

It is not therefore to proceed with the reconstruction and extension of the existing disposal bed on a permanent basis but rather to carry out the fact that the total cost is thus greatly increased and the carrying out of the work itself is made more difficult.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nEX'D.\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your 25782-7 of the 16th instant, enclosing copy of letter received from Mr. D. E. Gow, with reference to the proposed extension of the sewage disposal system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that Mr. Gow does not consider it advisable to proceed with this work until more funds are available. As you have previously been informed, the amount of $500.00 is all that the Department can provide this year. In view of Mr. Gow's report, no further action should be taken regarding this sewage disposal system at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nAugust 27, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to refer to past correspondence with regard to the enlargement of the disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, and to advise you that funds to the amount of approximately $1,400 are now available for this work.\n\nBefore authorising the work, however, it is desired that a check-up be made on the water supply system for this building, to make reasonably sure that the supply is safe for the school purposes.\n\nIn the event of an expenditure being necessary on the water supply system the work on the disposal bed would have to be postponed until some future date.\n\nI would request therefore that you ask Mr. Gow for his views and recommendations before definitely deciding with regard to the water supply system.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. Gurney Orr.\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nThe Dominion Water Power Branch,\nO.S.S.A.\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\nDOMINION WATER POWER AND HYDROMETRIC BUREAU\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nEX'D.\nAugust 18th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nYour file No. 129-3-5.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of August 17th with regard to the enlargement of the disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, copy of which has been sent to Mr. Gow and he has been asked to make a report as requested by you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nR. Gurney Orr, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 24, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI have for attention your letter of August 19th with enclosed letter from the Department of Indian Affairs stating that funds to the amount of approximately $1400.00 are now available for the enlargement of the disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora. It is noted, however, that before this work is authorized it is desired that a check up be made on the water supply system for that Institution to make reasonably sure that the supply is safe for the school's purposes.\n\nWe have had no adverse reports with respect to the water supply at this school for some years past. It is possible that the reference in the letter of the Department of Indian Affairs relates to possible contamination of the source of the water supply from the sewage disposal and laundry disposal systems at the school. However, we reported on this matter under date of October 25, 1935, at that time we pointed out that the Ontario Medical Health Officer of the Town of Kenora had no complaint to make regarding the possible contamination of the water supply for this school. However, should there be any possible contamination from the Institution itself, this contamination is insignificant as compared with contamination from the surrounding area. To overcome this contamination a chlorinator was installed at the school and I understand that periodic inspections are made by the Medical Health Officer at Kenora to see that the chlorinator is kept in efficient operation.\n\nAs regards the water supply installation itself, I believe it is operating efficiently and has done so since the time the trouble in connection with intake was eliminated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Dow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nAugust 27, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Mr. Orr's letter of August 17 regarding the proposed enlargement of the disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith, letter from Mr. Gow, dated August 24 in which he states that so far as he is aware the water supply system is operating satisfactorily and appears to be reasonably safe for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nEnc.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.M.

This building would cost approximately $750 for materials and if the Dept. will supply the material we will do the labor and with school help we would probably require a foreman.\n\nWe dread the fall term coming on as tales of clothing etc. are shipped in from the missionary society from all parts of Eastern Canada and we have no place to store them. It's hope the Dept. will grant this request.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.W. Byers\nPrincipal\nOttawa, September 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, in which he requests that lumber and other building materials, to a cost of approximately $750.00, be supplied to erect a store-room for clothing, etc., with space for a shoe repair shop.\n\nIn reply I have to say that no funds were provided in our Appropriation to cover the expenditure in supplying the material. It will therefore not be possible to authorize this work at the present time.\n\nWhen the Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared, consideration will be given to including an item covering the amount required for materials in erecting a store-room.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA.

Chlorinator, and allowing you to trade in your old equipment.\n\nBefore quoting, however, we would like to mention that we agree with you regarding the condition of the equipment, and that it has not received the kind of care it requires. You will also recall in 1930 that there was an accident of chlorine which developed a very serious leak at the main pipe, which caused considerable damage to the equipment and the pumphouse. We must also consider the wear and tear the equipment has received during the past eight years.\n\nThe reason we strongly recommend that you replace your present machine with a new one is that it would cost just as much to have this old chlorinator rebuilt as a new one, considering the trade-in allowance on your old machine, and we believe this procedure would be the wisest plan.\n\nWe are pleased to quote you on one only S.A.S.P.M. Chlorinator for the sum of $1,054 f.o.b. Kenora, Express charges included, and subject to the terms noted below. We are prepared to give you $275.00 on your old equipment, which would bring the price down to $779.00 f.o.b., Kenora.\n\nIf the Department of Indian Affairs would prefer to have this equipment sent by freight our quotation on one S.A.S.

G. Hamilton, as to what you wish done, as I am now on Treaty payments and not in the office very much until after the 26th June.\n\nThis is a very important matter that should be attended to at once as the Medical Health Officer, Dr. Ferguson, our own Doctor, has had the water tested and it is dangerous without boiling or chlorination, and owing to the number of pupils at the school, it is difficult to boil enough water for their needs, without considerable inconvenience.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H.W.

Applied in minute amounts, it will absolutely destroy any disease germs that may be in a water supply. Its use will completely eliminate drinking water as an agent in the transmission of typhoid fever, dysentery or similar diseases.\n\nEvery water supply should be sterilized. A supply continuously subject to pollution is often less dangerous than one subject to only occasional pollution, because with the first the city or provincial health authorities insist on proper purification. Many of the most severe typhoid fever epidemics of the present day are the result of the chance pollution of water supplies ordinarily considered excellent. The effluent of filter plants should be sterilized as an additional safeguard.\n\nChlorination sterilizes 100,000 gallons of water for three cents or less. Liquid chlorine is safeguarding the supplies of over 8,500 municipalities aggregating six billion gallons of water a day. It furnishes the cheapest health insurance in the world. The only safe water is a sterilized water.\nW & T Apparatus for Small Communities\n\nThe majority of water supplies are those of less than one million gallons per day, and therefore can usually be sterilized with less than five pounds of liquid chlorine. To efficiently apply chlorine in such small amounts, a specially designed Chlorinator Type MSP or MSPM chlorinator has been developed.\n\nWhere water pressure is available for operation, automatic control is possible by far superior methods than direct application of chlorine gas. It gives better diffusion of the sterilizing solution in the water being treated. It results in greater efficiency, substantial saving in chlorine costs, and better conditions of water in winter months. The primary aim has been to produce a machine which will not only accurately control the very minute amounts of chlorine needed but will also be of such simple construction as to be readily understood by the practical water works man. The operation of this equipment is explained by the drawing.\n\nThe capacity of Type MSP or MSPM apparatus varies from a minimum of six lbs. per 24 hours (comprising the first second) up to maximum of 15 lbs. of chlorine per 24 hours. The amount of chlorine required to sterilize water depends on the bacterial, physical and chemical condition of the water to be treated. This apparatus is applicable to water supplies as small as ten thousand gallons per twenty-four hours and up to one million gallons per twenty-four hours and may be used on supplies as large as one million gallons if the chlorine requirements of the water supply total less than ten pounds in twenty-four hours.\n\nOver 16,000 installations of \"W&T\" chlorination controlled equipment have been made throughout the world. Approximately 8,000 Canadian and American municipalities chlorinate their drinking water supplies with our equipment. Over 75% of the population of North America drink chlorinated water. It is estimated that this is equivalent to over 6,000,000 gallons of water per 24 hours or the flow would be equivalent to 300,000 gallons a half hour.\n\nOver half of these installations are water supplies of cities of less than 10,000 population.\n\nPractically every city of importance in Canada and the United States, and many cities in foreign countries use \"W&T\" chlorination equipment. Toronto, Hamilton, London, Windsor, Ottawa, Brantville, Kingston, Guelph, Chatham and Niagara Falls, Ontario; Quebec, Trois-Rivieres, Lachine, Murray Bay, New Brunswick, Halifax, Saint John, Fredericton N.B.; Regina, Moose Jaw and Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, London, England, Dublin, South Africa, Melbourne, Australia, Lima, Peru, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Havana, Cuba, Shanghai, China, and Kyoto City, Japan, use \"W&T\" apparatus in their water purification plants.\n\nOur large staff of experienced, trained field representatives, specialize in the purification of water and sewage. We are prepared to study any problems connected with the purification of water and sewage. A data sheet will be provided on request, enabling you to conveniently forward us the information we require in making specific recommendations on problems covering the sterilization of drinking water supplies, the sanitation of swimming pools, or the disinfection of sewage or we will be glad to have one of our representatives call upon you.\n\nWe are prepared to study your problems and supply you with chlorination sterilizing equipment will meet with prompt and efficient response.\n\nThe Operation of the Chlorinator\n\nThe MSP and MSPM Chlorinator is designed to meet the varied requirements of the average small water works. With the Type MSP Chlorinator the chlorine solution is applied under pressure to the suction side of the gate clamp. With the Type MSPM the point of application will be in the suction main or pipe line. Pressure application as well as gravity feed of the chlorine solution is possible, it being only necessary that a water supply under sufficient pressure be available for operation.\n\nThe minimum water pressure required for a gravity feed installation is ten pounds. Where electric or other means of applying pressure to the water supply for operating the chlorinator must be under at least three times the pressure existing at the point of application. The quantity of water required will usually range from two to four thousand gallons per minute. In those cases where a water supply under the pressure necessary to operate the chlorinator is not available, a pumping unit operated either by electric or hydraulic power is used.\n\nThe chlorine gas after passing through the pressure compensator where the pressure is reduced, is measured by a volumetric meter chart visible and adjustable. After leaving the meter the chlorine passes through the suction chamber to the injector where the solution of chlorine and water is formed. It then flows directly to the point of application.\n\nReliefs are provided on the machine which prevent moisture being drawn back into the chlorine gas control parts of the equipment, and also prevent the escape of chlorine gas into the room in the event of accidental failure of the water supply to the equipment.\n\nThis equipment is ideally suited for swimming pool sanitation where the point of chlorination is generally near the filter effluent tank or is also adaptable to the small sewage disposal plant. The attention of engineers and architects is drawn to the stability of the equipment and the accessibility of all parts. The equipment can be erected at any convenient point in...\nDETAILED SPECIFICATIONS\n\nWALLACE & TIERNAN VACUUM CONTROL CHLORINATOR\nNOVELTIES FIELD TYPE MNP AND MPPM\n\nThe Type MNP and MPPM Chlorinators are vacuum operated and are practically automatic in their operation. They are constructed of materials which are resistant to the action of most chlorine solutions.\n\nOPERATING AND ARRANGEMENT\nThe Chlorinator is arranged as a complete unit mounted on a suitable base and connected by piping with the control equipment assembled on a cast iron cabinet. It is so arranged that the Chlorinator is easily installed, connected to the water main, heated and ready for use in the same manner as any other type of apparatus of the installation.\n\nCAPACITY\nThe Chlorinator can be equipped with two types of gas pressure meters, one type capable of delivering a maximum rate of chlorinating per hour and a minimum rate of 1/2 lb per hour, while the other type is capable of delivering a maximum rate of 3 lbs per hour and a minimum rate of 1/2 lb per hour.\n\nMOUNTED CHLORINE FLOW METER\nThe chlorine flow meter on the apparatus will not show a greater error than 5% from the true delivery of chlorine at all flows within the range of the meter.\n\nCONTROL PANEL\nAll control parts of the apparatus are located on the control panel.\n\nWALLACE & TIERNAN LIMITED\nManufacturers of Chlorine and Ammonia Control Apparatus\nToronto, Ontario\nBELL'S\nGAS CHLORINATION\nPLANT\n\nREPRESENTATIVES\nFOR WESTERN CANADA\nPOWER & MINE SUPPLY CO., LTD.\nWINNIPEG\n\nBELL BROTHERS (Manchester 1927) LTD.\nCALDER IRONWORKS\nDENTON, Nr.

For industrial purposes it will do good work in the Paper Mill, Textile Work and in fact anywhere where a bacterially free water is required, particularly is it useful for the sterilisation of condenser cooling water.\nCHLORINATION OF WATER FOR INDUSTRIAL & PUBLIC SUPPLY\n\nThe provision of an adequate supply of sufficiently pure water is essential to the maintenance of life and the conduct of industry. It is, therefore, obviously impossible to exaggerate the importance of finding a solution to the difficulties with which the problem of such provision is beset.\n\nImpurity in water may be organic or inorganic and, whether organic or inorganic, may occur either in suspension or solution.\n\nThough many substances and various types of bacteria may be present without constituting any danger to health, the presence of pathogenic (i.e., disease bearing) germs may render any water affected dangerous in the highest degree.\n\nWhen present in water in such quantity as to be dangerous, inorganic impurity is often distinctly perceptible to the senses. For example, various salts render water \"hard\" and nauseating, and many of the iron compounds result in both obvious taste and colour.\n\nIn general, ground water taken from certain depths is sufficiently free from bacteria as a result of the natural filtration effected by its percolation through the ground, but surface water must always be looked upon with a degree of suspicion.\n\nMost of the bacteriological contamination of water may be traced to human or other organic pollution, and it is obvious that water supply chiefly becomes a serious problem when numbers of human beings are congregated into a community.\n\nMore especially with industrial communities is the provision of an adequate supply of sufficiently pure water a complicated matter, although the nature of the problem may vary a little for wide ranges of populations.\n\nAs the water for purposes of domestic consumption has to conform to standards and fulfill requirements rather different from the standards and requirements which obtain in the case of the supply of water for technical and industrial purposes, it is obvious that the respective processes of water purification for these two purposes are best considered separately.\nChlorine in sufficient quantity is an absolute sterilizing agent but owing to the fact that raw water may vary materially and rapidly in quantity of matter in suspension and organic content a varying proportion of free chlorine is consumed in the oxidation of these substances. It therefore becomes necessary, in order to ensure the continuous destruction of all bacteria, to treat the water with an excess of chlorine and this excess may become apparent in taste and smell. It follows therefore that so far as concerns the supply of water for domestic purposes, the use of chlorine is best employed after preliminary treatment of the water in filters since the rate of dosing should be restricted to a maximum which does not make the water at all objectionable to taste or smell.\n\nThe small quantity of chlorine necessary to effect the requisite degree of final purification necessitates very careful proportioning to obtain the best results; and the difficulties attendant upon the efficient use of chloride of lime, the comparatively large storage accommodation required, its deterioration during storage, its smell and lack of uniformity in constitution, and the disposal of its residual sludge, have resulted in the introduction of free chlorine compressed in cylinders to liquid form.\n\nChlorine in this form is more easily and accurately controlled and of lower cost, and the advantages attending its use are perhaps best illustrated by the fact that in many instances, under practical working conditions, as many as from 3 to 4 pounds of chloride of lime have to be provided to effect a reduction of bacterial content similar to that effected by one pound of chlorine in the same water.\n\nOther methods, electrolytic and so on, have from time to time been evolved, but at the present time we can claim that the method we advocate\u2014of using cylinders of compressed chlorine gas\u2014is generally superior from every point of view to any of them.\n\nThese features gradually became very apparent during the Great War, and were turned to such advantage that lorry and barge outfits were enabled to filter and sterilize 1,200 and 6,000 gallons per hour, respectively, of badly polluted water.\n\nFree chlorine compressed to liquid form is undoubtedly the best of all sterilizing agents for practical use in connection with water supplies.\nDIRECT INJECTOR TYPE\n\nThe above illustration depicts the Direct Injector Type Chlorinator, with manual control. This is the most generally used type as the only addition required to the plant itself is a supply of water to the injector at a sufficient pressure. The pressure will of course be dependent upon the pressure against which the Chlorine solution is to be injected.\nPURIFICATION OF WATER FOR INDUSTRIAL PURPOSES\n\nOne of the essential differences between the treatment of water for human consumption, and the treatment of water for industrial purposes is that a slight overdose of chlorine, which is usually consequent upon such dosing, will absolutely ensure sterilization of water varying slightly in constitution from time to time, in the one case is open to objection, but in the other is usually quite unimportant. It follows therefore that complete sterilization of most industrial waters may, without resultant nuisance, be ensured by treatment with chlorine.\n\nFor many industrial purposes river or canal water is used in large quantities. In many cases the water before use is subjected to sedimentation in tanks, but this process is only partially successful in its operation as it cannot eliminate bacteria nor can it, without an undue period of storage, eliminate all the other very fine organic or inorganic matter in suspension.\n\nSuch water is unsatisfactory and often gives rise to trouble and avoidable expense. For example, if it be used for cooling surface condenser tubes a slight film of matter will generally be deposited upon the tubes and in time will be found to adhere so tightly as to necessitate the employment of stiff brushes for its removal. This film will prevent the maintenance of a good vacuum which is a matter of considerable importance as it has been found that a variation of one inch affects the steam consumption (and consequently the fuel consumption) in steam turbine work as much as nearly six per cent.\n\nExamination has shown that the adhesive properties of the slimy deposited matter are due not so much to matter in suspension as to micro-organisms and that if these microorganisms are sterilized the remaining mineral matter to a large extent ceases to be a cause of trouble.\n\nIn such cases as these chlorine has proved to be a clean, cheap, simply-admixed sterilizing agent and to have effected relatively enormous reductions in cleaning charges.\n\nThe elimination of risks of septic poisoning, the bleaching of materials used in textile and paper manufacture, the deodorizing of fats and oils, the treatment of water for public swimming baths are but a few of the increasing number of uses to which chlorination may with advantage be applied.\n\nUsed in connection with the sanitary services of Hospitals, Institutions, and on board ship, it has proved a reliable and convenient sterilizing agent. Its cheapness renders it an economical proposition for use in the sterilizing of farm buildings, and any place where disease producing matter is liable to collect.\n\nChlorination should be seriously considered by all users of water which is contaminated by organic pollution.\nGRAVITY FEED TYPE\n\nIn this instrument the Chlorine solution is made inside the porcelain tower, and is fed by gravity into the water to be treated. This instrument is generally used where the tower can be placed at a suitable height to provide sufficient head on the Chlorine solution to overcome a low pressure in the pipe line. The solution can also be fed into an open channel or into a pump suction well.\nCHLORINATING PLANT\n\nIt is apparent that the chlorination of water for industrial purposes differs from the chlorination of water for domestic supply in little except the amount of chlorine used, and that a type of Plant which successfully admixes the chlorine for the treatment of the one is equally suitable for the treatment of the other.\n\nA careful investigation of the problem of correct admixing has resulted in the production by us of a Plant which is designed to be completely self-contained and to occupy the minimum possible space.\n\nThe principle upon which the Plant functions is usually that of the solution feed, as it has been found that chlorine is most easily and efficiently admixed in the required proportion if first dissolved in water and added as a solution.\n\nThe chlorine is delivered to the users of the Plant in steel cylinders containing, when fully charged, 70 lbs. of chlorine at 120 lbs. pressure per square inch. These cylinders are easily and safely handled and are readily recharged as and when required. It may also be obtained in 10 cwt. and 15 cwt. drums.\n\nOn page II is illustrated a plant capable of discharging up to 1 lb. of gas per hour when working with one cylinder only in actual use. When the first cylinder is exhausted, the position of the second enables the change-over to be effected with only a momentary cessation of the supply of gas. The empty first cylinder is then replaced by a full cylinder and in due course is recharged ready for future use.\n\nWith both cylinders in use the Plant is capable of discharging up to 2 lbs. of gas per hour. There are cases, however, where the few minutes' delay in the discharge of the chlorine, consequent upon the removal of the two cylinders when empty, would not be permissible, and in such cases the Plant must be considered as capable of discharging up to 1 lb. only of gas per hour.\n\nThe cylinders AA stand together upon a platform-weighing machine, which may be supplied if required and which is provided with a suitable arrangement for holding the cylinders and with a visible scale by means of which the attendant is able to perceive when the cylinder in use at the time is about to become empty. The weighing also serves to check the consumption of chlorine as recorded by the meter J.\nThis Instrument embodies the Gravity Feed Type Chlorinator with the addition of a closed solution tank from which the solution may be fed direct to the suction side of one or more pumps. A float valve is incorporated to control the supply of the water to the tower and keep the solution in the tank at constant level and prevent overflowing in the event of the pump being shut down.\nThe chlorine is permitted to escape from the cylinder by the opening of the valve B, and the auxiliary valve BI, and, on issuing, passes through the pipe E to the combined junction-box and filter C, at the pressure indicated by the pressure gauge D, and thence to a pressure reducer F. The gas usually leaves the reducer at a pressure of 14 lbs. per square inch, a second pressure gauge, G, being provided to indicate the reduced pressure. Both pressure gauges are specially arranged in such a way that their working parts are effectually isolated from direct contact with the gas.\n\nFrom the pressure-reducer, F, the gas is admitted by the micrometer valve, H, to the meter, J, which upon a graduated scale gives a direct reading of the chlorine passing. The meter can be calibrated to give readings in terms of lbs. per 100,000 gallons of water treated or to indicate the quantity of gas passing per day or per hour. The amount of chlorine is adjusted, as and when necessary, by means of the micrometer valve, H. The details of the meters are shown on pages 12 and 13.\n\nIn the particular example illustrated the chlorine is passed from the meter through the outlet valve, B2, to an absorption-chamber, L, constructed in glazed acid-resisting stoneware. Water is introduced into the top of the absorption-chamber through a perforated plate designed to ensure effective distribution. The water flowing down through the chamber absorbs the chlorine and the resultant solution is finally passed from the bottom of the absorption-chamber through outlet pipe, R, into the main supply at the selected point.\n\nA drying apparatus is provided at K in order to inhibit the passage of any moisture from the absorption-chamber to the control apparatus when the flow of gas ceases.\nARRANGEMENT OF CHLORINATING PLANT\nGravity Feed Type\nCHLORINE METER\nMANOMETER TYPE\n\nThe Manometer type meter consists of two tubes, one inside the other.\n\nThe centre tube is connected to one side of an orifice plate through which the gas passes and the annular space between the two tubes is connected to the other side of the orifice.\n\nThe tubes are filled with manometer liquid to the zero level on the scale provided. When the gas is turned on the difference in pressure on the two sides of the orifice causes the liquid to rise in the inner tube and the scale is calibrated to give a direct reading of the amount of gas passing in lbs. per hour or day or any other unit desired. The zero on scale is only set to level of liquid when no gas is passing and does not require adjustment for each individual reading.\n\nThe usual range for an orifice and scale is 10 to 1. The capacity of any instrument can be further altered in a few moments by inserting a different orifice and scale to correspond. For very small quantities of gas the pulsating meter is used, as the size of orifice with the Manometer type would not be practicable in actual practice.\nCHLORINE METER\nPULSATING TYPE\n\nThe Pulsating Meter consists of two tubes placed one inside the other, the inner tube having a small syphon pipe fused inside it as shown in the illustration.\n\nThe gas passes down the outer tube and depresses the liquid therein until it reaches the bottom of the syphon when the gas rushes through to the centre tube the pressure is thus reduced in the outer tube and the liquid returns to its original level.\n\nThe pressure then again builds up in the outer tube forcing down the liquid and the cycle is repeated. The number of pulsations per minute are counted and the amount of gas used is given on a table according to the number of pulsations. The pulsating meter is capable of measuring very small volumes of gas and has a range of approximately 30 to 1. The volume of each pulsation is controlled by the syphon pipe and the capacity of the meter may be altered by inserting another centre tube with a longer or shorter syphon as may be desired. The illustrations show the meter at the commencement (Fig. 1) and at the end (Fig. 2) of the pulsation.\nPOINT OF APPLICATION\n\nThe point of application of the chlorine solution should be determined only after a careful examination of the conditions obtaining. In the very usual case of a water containing a large and varying amount of organic matter preliminary sedimentation and filtration is very desirable in order that the variation, which otherwise would make the correct apportionment of chlorine a difficult matter, may be reduced to a minimum, and also this pre-treatment reduces the dose of chlorine necessary.\n\nThe position of the sedimentation tank or tanks and filtration where provided for Preliminary treatment must of necessity influence the choice of a site for the Chlorination Plant.\n\nIn the case of supply for domestic purposes where it is found impracticable to provide a suitably long period of contact, or otherwise necessary continuously to overdose the water in order to ensure complete safety to the consumers, it may be desirable subsequently to dechlorinate the water by the addition of the requisite small quantity of sulphur-dioxide or other approved means.\n\nThe fact that an overdose of chlorine leaves an objectionable taste is generally of no importance when the water is treated for use in connection with an Industrial supply, but a continuous and unnecessary overdose is obviously to be avoided if only on the ground of cost.\n\nThe Plant should be enclosed in a dry warm room where the temperature should be maintained above 50\u00b0 Fahrenheit (10\u00b0 Centigrade) in order to prevent trouble resulting from the freezing of the chlorine in the cylinders through loss of heat by evaporation. This consideration also determines the maximum rate\u2014never more than one pound per hour\u2014at which the chlorine may be drawn from each cylinder.\n\nThe point where the chlorine solution is applied to the water under treatment should be as near as is practicable to the Chlorinating Plant. These general conditions will usually determine the selection of the best site for the Plant.\nESTIMATION OF CORRECT QUANTITY OF CHLORINE TO BE USED\n\nThe correct proportion of chlorine to be added to water for use in connection with supplies for human consumption may be, and generally is, a problem necessitating expert determination.\n\nThe method of bacteriological investigation usually adopted is directed to ascertain the smallest volume of the water in which are found traces of B. coli. and its congeners, and the results are usually expressed in terms of the minimum number of cubic centimetres of water in which these traces are discovered.\n\nWe can supply, if required, a simple laboratory apparatus and the necessary cultivation media to enable the determination to be made upon the site as and when necessary.\n\nTo enable us to consider the requirements of any particular case, it is desirable that we should be supplied with detailed information upon the following points:\n\n1.

This Valve, which is directly connected to the Pressure Reducing Valve on the Board, is operated by means of a Venturi Pipe or other suitable apparatus inserted in the pipe main carrying the water supply to be treated.\n\nSuitable connections are made from the valve itself to the throat and up-stream of the Venturi, and the differential pressure, which under the Venturi Law varies with the volume of water passing, is used to operate the Valve so as to control the flow of gas through the instrument.\n\nThe whole Apparatus is extremely simple and efficient, and has worked extremely successfully under various working conditions.\n\nThe Apparatus can be supplied complete with Venturi Tube to suit the size of the existing pipe main, or if a Venturi Tube is already in existence particulars of these should be given with any enquiry in order that a Valve suitable to meet the conditions may be supplied.\n\nThe automatic type is usually supplied to cover a range of flows of 5 to 1, and can be fitted with either the manometer or pulsating meter according to the quantity of gas required.\nAUTOMATIC INJECTOR FEED TYPE\n\nThe above illustration depicts the Automatic Type Chlorinator and also shows in diagrammatic form the necessary connections from the Automatic Valve to the Venturi and the points of application of the Chlorine solution.\n\nPage Seventeen\nDRY OR DIRECT GAS FEED TYPE\n\nWhere it is possible the solution feed type is preferable, but in certain cases owing to there being insufficient head available, or no auxiliary supply to feed the gas absorption tower or injector with water, the Dry Gas Feed Type can be supplied.\n\nThis type of control board is similar to the solution type, but instead of a tower or injector being used to make a solution of the gas, the gas is led direct by a pipe to a diffuser which is immersed in the water to be treated at a depth of about 4 feet, or the diffuser may be inserted in a pipe line conveying the water.\n\nThe diffuser when inserted in a pipe line usually requires a special cock so that it may be withdrawn for examination without interfering with the supply.\n\nCOST OF CHLORINATION\n\nThe cost of labour involved in operating the Chlorinating Plant is very low, as apart from the periodical examination and adjustment of the gas supply and the changing of the cylinders, the Plant requires practically no attention.\n\nThe actual amount of chlorine used in the treatment of any water is relatively very small. In comparatively few actual cases would the rate of dosing exceed one pound of chlorine to one million pounds of the water treated; and at this rate of dosing the cost of chlorine for treating one million gallons of water (with chlorine at 2\u00bd pence per lb.) would be approximately 25 pence.\n\nThe economic consideration of the advisability of installing a Chlorination Plant in connection with an industrial supply chiefly consists in a comparison of running charges. The small cost of the requisite chlorine is set against the saving to be effected in the reduction of labour costs, as for example in the cleaning of pipes, condenser surfaces and pumps, and in the reduction of material costs, as for example in coal consumption by the maintenance of efficient vacuum. The making of the comparison is usually an easy matter. In most cases, too, the result of the comparison will admit of no doubt as to the economy to be effected by the installation of the appropriate Plant.\nAUTOMATIC GRAVITY FED TYPE\n\nThe above Chlorinator Installed for the Cornwall Waterworks, Canada, shows an Automatic Type Chlorinator in action.\n\nPage Nineteen\nCHLORINATORS WITH SPECIAL CONTROLS\n\nThe Incorporation of special controls in connection with Chlorinators will naturally depend upon the individual requirements of each particular case, and reference has already been made to one type of control on Page 16, in which a description is given of the Automatic Regulating Valve which regulates the amount of gas being added according to the amount of water to be treated.\n\nIn other forms of control the action of the particular valve is in the nature of stop and start, and in a regulating action the controls may deal with either the supply of gas, or the supply of water to the tower or injector, and on Page 9 there is an illustration showing a Chlorinator incorporating an Automatic Shut-off Valve to the water supply which is operated by means of a float.\n\nAnother type of control dealing with the supply of gas is shown attached to the instrument on page 5, and consists of a valve placed between the cylinder of gas and the board to which a connection is brought from the pipe supplying water to the tower or the injector. The valve is so arranged that when the water supply is turned on sufficient pressure is created to keep the valve open, but immediately the water supply fails the valve shuts, and thus automatically cuts off the supply of gas. This device is primarily a safety device, and particularly useful where the instrument is housed in places which are difficult of access, and which would be dangerous in the event of anyone endeavouring to get close enough to the instrument to shut off the gas at the cylinder.\n\nThe Automatic Shut-off Valve may be adapted where the Chlorinator may suddenly be called upon to deal with large volumes of water as in the case of a fire. In this instance the Chlorinator may normally be working at a very low rate, and in the event of a fire when large volumes of water are introduced into the main the rising pressure operates the valve and thus increases immediately the amount of chlorine being added, and by this means prevents the possibility of pollution by the increased quantities of water which are often drawn from sources liable to pollution.\n\nAn Instrument of this type has been supplied for a mill in Canada, where the supply of water for the mill are liable to be drawn into the town's mains in the event of a fire.\n\nWhen the meter in normal use is not of a large enough capacity the Instrument can be fitted with two meters, the second one only coming into operation when the automatic valve operates.\n\nElectric control can also be supplied when necessary, e.g., to shut off the gas in the event of electrically driven pumps stopping, etc.\nThe above apparatus has been installed at Messrs. Findlays, Ltd., Canada, and incorporates a special valve which comes into action when the pressure in the main rises due to a sudden increase in the volume of water passing, the action of the valve immediately increasing the amount of Chlorine being added.\nNEWCASTLE AND GATESHEAD WATER COMPANY\n\nThe above illustration shows the Chlorination Plant Installed at Wylam Pumping Station.\n\nThe apparatus comprises Gravity Type Chlorinator, together with twelve cylinder connections and cylinder auxiliary valves, and two weighing machines on which the cylinders of chlorine stand.\n\nThis Plant is capable of adding up to two parts of chlorine per million to a supply of six million gallons of water per day.\n\"BELL\" CHLORINATOR FOR SWIMMING BATHS\n\nThis instrument which has been adapted from the larger type of Chlorinator has been designed so as to render the working of the Plant as simple as possible without impairing the efficiency.\n\nThe Instrument has been thoroughly tested in every possible way, and has proved extremely satisfactory.\n\nIt will usually be supplied as shown in the accompanying illustration complete with base and pedestal, but where clients desire, the panel alone can be supplied suitably drilled for wall mounting.\nTEST SETS\n\nIn connection with the treatment of water supplies by Chlorination it is essential that some simple form of test should be provided whereby the amount of free Chlorine left in the water may be easily and simply ascertained at any time. Two forms of Test Sets are put forward for this purpose as follows:\n\n1. A small Test Set consisting of two standard colour tubes and one test tube, this Set being particularly useful in connection with Swimming Bath Water where the free Chlorine content should be maintained between .2 and .5 parts per million. In this Set the two tubes provided are for the two limits given, that is, .2 and .5, and when testing, a sample of the water is placed in the test tube, and a pre-determined quantity of re-agent added, and if the resultant colour falls between the two standard colours then the free Chlorine content is between .2 and .5 parts per million. Other colour standards can be supplied if required.\n\n2. In the larger type of Test Set the number of standard colour tubes varies according to the particular requirements of each individual enquiry, and although the actual testing procedure is similar in each case yet in this instance as there is a greater range of colour it is, of course, possible to obtain more exactly the free Chlorine content of the treated water.\n\nWith the above sets once the correct dose has been decided the attendant can at any time test and see in a few moments if the correct dose has been maintained.\n**Chlorine\u2014Useful Data**\n\n| Temperature | Volumes of Gas per Volume of Water |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------|\n| 10\u00b0C        | 1.08                              |\n| 20\u00b0C        | 1.26                              |\n| 30\u00b0C        | 1.57                              |\n| 40\u00b0C        | 1.94                              |\n| 50\u00b0C        | 2.40                              |\n\nFor 100% saturation\n\n**Chlorine\u2014Conversion Table**\n\n| Pounds of Chlorine | Cubic Feet | Litres |\n|-------------------|------------|--------|\n| 1                 | 5.07       | 143.6  |\n| 2                 | 10.14      | 287.2  |\n| 3                 | 15.21      | 430.8  |\n| 4                 | 20.38      | 574.4  |\n| 5                 | 25.55      | 718.0  |\n| 6                 | 30.72      | 861.6  |\n| 7                 | 35.89      | 1005.2 |\n| 8                 | 40.96      | 1148.8 |\n| 9                 | 45.93      | 1292.4 |\n| 10                | 50.97      | 1436.0 |\n| 11                | 55.97      | 1579.6 |\n| 12                | 60.94      | 1723.2 |\n| 13                | 65.91      | 1866.8 |\n| 14                | 70.88      | 2010.4 |\n| 15                | 75.85      | 2154.0 |\n| 16                | 80.82      | 2297.6 |\n| 17                | 85.79      | 2441.2 |\n| 18                | 90.76      | 2584.8 |\n| 19                | 95.73      | 2728.4 |\n| 20                | 101.4      | 2872.0 |\n\n1 lb.

Some time ago they installed a Paterson Chloronome, and were so extremely well pleased with results that they did not hesitate in ordering a duplicate machine.\n\nThe results at Welland simply bear out the experience which our parent English Company has had during the past seventeen years with installations all over the world. In a side-by-side test, Paterson Chloronomes won the verdict.\n\nBecause the design is correct\u2014because the workmanship adheres strictly to the British ideal of 100% perfection\u2014Paterson Chloronomes have always been renowned for their simplicity and absolute freedom from operation difficulties.\n\nMade in Canada from parts of British and Canadian origin.

Limited\n\nMontreal, April 13th, 1932.\n\nThe Paterson Engineering Co. of Canada Limited,\n32 Front Street West,\nToronto, 2, Ontario.\n\nAttention - Mr. J. Van Benschoten.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nYour letter of the 24th ultimo duly received and has been handed to the writer for reply.\n\nWe have two Paterson chlorine machines at our Cardinal, Ontario Plant, which were installed during the year 1920. These two machines were sold to us by Messrs. Laurie & Lamb and have given entire satisfaction since the time that they were installed. I note your remark that this is the only installation in the Dominion. On this point, however, I believe you are in error, as I understand several of these machines were sold in the West.\n\nWe have no hesitation, however, in saying that the machines give satisfaction and that the upkeep thereon is practically negligible. The writer does not remember of having spent anything whatsoever in the way of repairs. We have no objection to your using our name and citing our experience with reference to the satisfactory operation of the equipment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADA STARCH CO., LIMITED.\n\nJHH/FO.\nDear Mr. Bailey:\n\nI was very pleased indeed to have had the pleasure of meeting you recently and discussing the subject job. As you will remember, I subsequently departed with Mr. Phelan but we were unfortunately unable to secure all information desired. We therefore dictated a letter to your local representative, Mr. Sturges, who has since replied direct to this office and we now have all desired facts.\n\nYour layout at this school is exactly as the writer anticipated it would be, namely, your two pumps are manifolded to one pump motion, which in turn extends out into the lake some two hundred yards distant. The pumps are so arranged that they can operate singly or collectively. They function in periods approximating three minute intervals and their total operation during the year amounts to approximately 1440 minutes. Each cylinder of chlorine lasts approximately one year and, of course, this is based on the past operation of your existing apparatus, which operated continuously, namely, 1440 minutes each day. It is of the type employed by the writer which introduces the chlorine solution into the pipe system when the pump is operating and by-passes to waste during periods of shut-down. Therefore, on the basis hereof if you were normally treating the water only during the period of pump operation, one same cylinder of chlorine would last roughly eight years. In other words, with the existing layout you are wasting chlorine twenty-one hours out of each twenty-four.\n\nWe have quoted alternative proposals EXHIBIT\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nstrongly recommend your favorable consideration of our first quotation covering the Hypo-Clarifierator. This is the machine the writer attempted to explain to you orally, and which has been designed primarily for solution of this type. It is this apparatus by far the only chlorine solution system where the pump or pumps are in series, for when they are shut down the flow is slowed off slightly. From the attached sheet you will appreciate the general appearance and method of operation of the apparatus. The operation is definitely synchronized with your pump and the control is obtained by means of the change in hydraulic conditions. In other words, when the pump is in service we take advantage of the suction or negative head existing on the suction side of the pump to pull the chlorine solution through at whatever rate has been pre-set. Conversely, when the pump stops down to take advantage of the pressure building up on the suction side, which in turn holds back any further flow of chlorine solution. This is in essence the cycle which takes place continuously.\n\nThe writer does not believe it is necessary to amplify the remarks made in the attached bulletin. The sight feeder in the operator's name of increasing or decreasing the rate of flow of solution and of checking the flow by observation. The solution storage containers are all lined to withstand any corrosive action of the solutions. There is a sight glass arrangement on the storage containers so that the operator knows at all times the level of chemical in storage, and of course can check the desired time to recharge the instrument.\n\nThe strength of the chlorine solution can be adjusted to suit and we generally recommend that the installation be so operated that it is only necessary to recharge the instrument every two or three weeks. This operation, by the way, is very simple and takes but a few moments, during which time the operation of the equipment is not disturbed.\n\nWe have included a slip-closed, earthenware crock to facilitate mixing the sterilizing chemical. The latter is highly corrosive and a somewhat rate of either glass or an offered is necessary. This crock enables him to mix up a sizeable quantity when fit. Take care of his requirements for months end it will be from this crock he will remove small quantities from time to time when charging the instrument proper.\n\nYou will also note that we have included in our proposal a 100 lb. drum of sterilizing chemical which will pre-\nS. M. Bailey, Esq.\n\nMay 5th, 1937\n\nI have taken care of your requirements, based on figures submitted covering previous operation, for the past two years. As pointed out above, we do not waste any chemicals, for the operation of the machine is synchronized with the pump and thus enables you to effectively sterilize your supply with a much smaller quantity of chemicals annually.\n\nIn the past you have been using one cylinder, or 150 lbs. of gaseous chlorine annually and in wasting the chlorine 24 hours out of each 24 you are only actually requiring around 60 lbs. per year to effectively sterilize your supply. This 60 lbs. probably costs your department from $8.00 to $8.50. It will be necessary to clean up 90 lbs. of the sterilizing chemicals to have offered to give you the same quantity of actual chlorine, and the cost of this commodity will approximate some $7.00. In other words, if you were able to operate a gaseous type sterilizer, as we have outlined in the case with the Hypo-Chlorinator offered, your annual cost for chlorinated sodium hypochlorite would be $8.00 as against around $16.00 or $17.00 for the purchased chemical. In your case, however, you are using nearly one cylinder of chlorine per year, losing the commodity all hours out of each day, so that your annual costs here probably be around $16.00 to $18.00 annually. You will therefore agree with me that the cost of the purchased chemical will be roughly half of the chemical costs you have been assuming in the past.\n\nIf you desire to obtain a simple, sturdy, and fool-proof instrument which can be satisfactorily operated by any person of average intelligence, we cannot too strongly recommend you to have this instrument installed. It has been primarily designed for the smaller supplies to work on pumps functioning automatically, and to be operated by people who would normally attend to the operation of pumping equipment along with a dozen or more other duties. We can give you an extensive recommendation covering the operation of this equipment with your Provincial Veterinary Engineer, Mr. A. H. Berry, located at Toronto Park, Toronto.\n\nFor comparative purposes we have submitted a quotation on a standard gaseous type sterilizer, designed to operate in a manner similar to your existing one but a machine from which you can expect less or service. It is an American made sterilizer constructed entirely by our own factory. The American Engineering Company of New Hampshire, U.S.A., is a firm which has been engaged in this type of work for many years and they have installations world-wide, for they have always enjoyed a very fine export trade. Their equipment, as a matter of fact, is standard throughout the rest of the world and it has only been since the advent of this...\nMay 31st, 1927\n\nMr. H. Bailey, Esq.\n\ncompany in 1926 that they have been offered for sale in the Dominion.\n\nIf by any chance you desire to requisition equipment for this job to handle gaseous chlorine, you will make no mistake in giving Potash equipment serious consideration, but as shown pointed out, the writer is definitely of the opinion that the simple Hypo-Chlorinator which we have endeavored to describe rather in detail will handle your problem to the satisfaction of all concerned.\n\nWe are in a position to make reasonably prompt shipment and sincerely hope to have the pleasure of receiving your valued order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

This type of feeder is used extensively in small tanks together with water supply as shown at \"A\". The re-agent is put in through the funnel-like mixing tube called \"Re-agent Fill\". When two different chemicals are to be used, such as chlorine and ammonia, which is often the case with swimming pools, two separate complete installations are essential as it is not usually possible to combine two chemicals and feed through one pipe. If the ammonia is used with chlorine the ammonia re-agent tank may be one-half as large as that selected for chlorine. Complete details of the standard sizes for which the various standard re-agent tanks are suitable will be found elsewhere in our literature. Feeders are made in one size only so they are capable of such a wide range of adjustment that they may be used on any job from the smallest to the largest.\n\nWILSON CHEMICAL FEEDERS, INC.\n\nBUFFALO, N.Y.\n\nTHE PATTERSON ENGINEERING COMPANY OF CANADA LIMITED\nTHE PATTERSON ENGINEERING COMPANY\nOF CANADA, LIMITED\nUNITED STATES CORPORATION, LTD.\n28 PELHAM AVE.\nTORONTO\n\nCHLORINATION\u2014FILTRATION\u2014SOFTENING\n\nJune Eighth, 1937\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nAttention: R.

Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nONTARIO,\nOnt.\nON PROPOSED EXTENSIONS TO SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM AT CECILIA JEFFREY INDIAN SCHOOL, KENORA, ONTARIO.\n\nINTRODUCTORY:\n\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School at Kenora, Ontario, was completed early in 1929. The installation of the water supply and sewage disposal systems was carried out under the direction and supervision of this district office.\n\nThe school is situated on a sandy hillside some 60 feet from and 60 feet above Round Lake, the source of the water supply. Back of the school the ground rises steeply and rock outcroppings occur. Consequently, the only possible drainage of the school site is into Round Lake. It was necessary, therefore, to treat the sewage from the school in order to prevent pollution of the water supply. The method of treating sewage by means of a septic tank and disposal bed was selected as best suited for continuous service with a minimum of attention. As washing compounds used in the laundry were considered harmful to septic action in the tank, a separate laundry sump was provided.\n\nEXISTING SEWAGE SYSTEM:\n\nThe existing sewage system consists of septic tank, disposal bed and separate laundry drainage system. The system was designed for a total school population of one hundred. The septic tank has a capacity of 4,000 gallons and the siphon chamber 525 gallons additional. The disposal bed contains 1,600 lineal feet of 4\" field tile laid in sand.\n\nAbout two years after the school was put into operation, trouble was experienced with the laundry sump failing to dispose of laundry drainage. The sand surrounding the sump had become almost impervious by the accumulation\nof grease etc. The sump was enlarged and measures were taken to convey the drainage to a gravel strata to permit more rapid seepage. This work was not carried under our supervision and at present we do not know to what extent if any, this work interfered with the disposal bed.\n\nThe present disposal bed has been in place nearly seven years. It has received no attention and the surface is now very uneven, overgrown with weeds and covered with some rubbish. Doubtless, the tar-paper covering on the tile joints has deteriorated, permitting the coarse sand to enter and clog the tile. The clogging of the tile and the 70% overloading of the bed have resulted in some of the seepage reaching the surface of the bed. The close proximity of the bed to the school makes it essential that the surface seepage be eliminated.\n\nThe present population of the school is about 170 or 70 in excess of the number for which the sewage disposal system was designed. While the usage of water at this Institution does not increase proportionately to the increase in population, yet it is fairly certain that clogging of the disposal bed has taken place. The septic tank is slightly undersized for a population of 170 and the syphon chamber in particular should be enlarged for efficient results.\n\nPROPOSED ENHANCEMENTS TO SEWAGE SYSTEM:\n\nIt is recommended that the capacity of the existing syphon chamber of the septic tank be increased from its present capacity of 525 gallons to 1,000 gallons; that the existing disposal bed containing 1,600 linear feet of 4\" tile be opened up and if necessary be reconditioned and that an addition be made to the disposal bed so as to increase the total length of field tile to 2,800 feet.\nThe accompanying plan shows the location of the proposed extension to the disposal bed and sections of either side of the extension. However, the location of the new disposal bed will depend upon additional ground surveys which it is intended to carry out in order to determine the most economical location and most favourable soil conditions. Uncertainty exists as to the drainage from the laundry sump and its effect upon the disposal bed and this must be cleared up by examination on the ground.\n\nThe enlargement of the syphon chamber of the septic tank will present no difficulties and the enlargement will reduce by half the daily number of discharges into the disposal bed and permit of greater efficiency in the working of the disposal bed.\n\nESTIMATES OF COSTS:\n\nThe following estimates of costs are based upon the costs of the original construction and revised to allow for additional costs arising from the fact that the original work was carried out in conjunction with the original school construction job.\n\n(a) Septic Tank:\n   Enlargement of Syphon Chamber ------------ $150.00\n\n(b) Old Disposal Bed:\n   Unlaying and Relaying ------------------ 275.00\n\n(c) New Disposal Bed:\n   Excavation ----------------------------- $300.00\n   Laying Tile and Surfacing -------------- 250.00\n   Glazed Pipe ---------------------------- 40.00\n   Field Tile ------------------------------ 130.00\n   Cartage --------------------------------- 20.00\n   Total ----------------------------------- $740.00\n\nSupervision, etc. ------------------------ $1165.00\n\nTotal Estimated Costs:--------------------- $1400.00\nREMARKS:\n\nThe work should be carried out during the brief summer period in which the school is not operating; viz: in July. There will always be some inmates at the school, but the extensions can be carried out without completely closing down the sewage disposal system.\n\nD. B.

B. Cow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nREPORT ON PROPOSED EXTENSIONS TO SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM AT CECILIA JEFFREY INDIAN SCHOOL, KENORA, ONTARIO.\n\nINTRODUCTORY:\n\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School at Kenora, Ontario, was completed early in 1923. The installation of the water supply and sewage disposal systems was carried out under the direction and supervision of this district office.\n\nThe school is situated on a sandy hillside some 600 feet from and 60 feet above Round Lake, the source of the water supply. Back of the school the ground rises steeply and rock outcroppings occur. Consequently, the only possible drainage of the school site is into Round Lake. It was necessary, therefore, to treat the sewage from the school in order to prevent pollution of the water supply. The method of treating sewage by means of a septic tank and disposal bed was selected as best suited for continuous service with a minimum of attention. As washing compounds used in the laundry were considered harmful to septic action in the tank, a separate laundry sump was provided.\n\nEXISTING SEWAGE SYSTEM:\n\nThe existing sewage system consists of septic tank, disposal bed and separate laundry drainage system. The system was designed for a total school population of one hundred. The septic tank has a capacity of 4,000 gallons and the syphon chamber 525 gallons additional. The disposal bed contains 1,500 lineal feet of 4\" field tile laid in sand.\n\nAbout two years after the school was put into operation, trouble was experienced with the laundry sump failing to dispose of laundry drainage. The sand surrounding the sump had become almost impervious by the accumulation...\nof grease etc. The sump was enlarged and measures were taken to convey the drainage to a gravel strata to permit more rapid seepage. This work was not carried out under our supervision and at present we do not know to what extent if any, this work interfered with the disposal bed.\n\nThe present disposal bed has been in place nearly seven years. It has received no attention and the surface is now very uneven, overgrown with weeds and covered with some rubbish. Doubtless, the tar-paper covering on the tile joints has deteriorated, permitting the coarse sand to enter and clog the tile. The clogging of the tile and the 70% overloading of the bed have resulted in some of the seepage reaching the surface of the bed. The close proximity of the bed to the school makes it essential that the surface seepage be eliminated.\n\nThe present population of the school is about 170 or 70 in excess of the number for which the sewage disposal system was designed. While the usage of water at this Institution does not increase proportionately to the increase in population, yet it is fairly certain that overloading of the disposal bed has taken place. The septic tank is slightly undersized for a population of 170 and the syphon chamber in particular should be enlarged for efficient results.\n\nPROPOSED EXTENSIONS TO SEWAGE SYSTEM:\n\nIt is recommended that the capacity of the existing syphon chamber of the septic tank be increased from its present capacity of 525 gallons to 1,000 gallons; that the existing disposal bed containing 1,600 lineal feet of 4\" tile be opened up and if necessary be reconditioned and that an addition be made to the disposal bed so as to increase the total length of field tile to 2,800 feet.\nThe accompanying plan shows the location of the proposed extension to the disposal bed and sections of either side of the extension. However, the location of the new disposal bed will depend upon additional ground surveys which it is intended to carry out in order to determine the most economical location and most favourable soil conditions. Uncertainty exists as to the drainage from the laundry sump and its effect upon the disposal bed and this must be cleared up by examination on the ground.\n\nThe enlargement of the syphon chamber of the septic tank will present no difficulties and the enlargement will reduce by half the daily number of discharges into the disposal bed and permit of greater efficiency in the working of the disposal bed.\n\n**ESTIMATES OF COST:**\n\nThe following estimates of costs are based upon the costs of the original construction and revised to allow for additional costs arising from the fact that the original work was carried out in conjunction with the original school construction job.\n\n(a) Septic Tank:\n\nEnlargement of Syphon Chamber ------------ $150.00\n\n(b) Old Disposal Bed:\n\nUncovering and Relaying ------------------ 275.00\n\n(c) New Disposal Bed:\n\nExcavation ----------------------------- $300.00\nLaying Tile and Surfacing -------------- 250.00\nGlazed Pipe ----------------------------- 40.00\nField Tile ------------------------------- 130.00\nCartage ------------------------------- 20.00\n\nSupervision, etc. ---------------------- $1165.00\n\nTotal Estimated Costs:----- $1400.00\nREMARKS:\n\nThe work should be carried out during the brief summer period in which the school is not operating; viz: in July. There will always be some inmates at the school, but the extensions can be carried out without completely closing down the sewage disposal system.\n\nD. B.

COLE. INDIAN LABOUR SHOULD BE USED AS FAR AS POSSIBLE. CONSULT MR. HUGH MCKINNON M. P. EMIGRA REGARDING OTHER LABOUR REQUIRED. IMMEDIATE THAT WORK BEGINS AT ONCE.\n\nR. A.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS & LAW\nCANADA OFFICE\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE\n655 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWINNIPEG, MAN., November 1st, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter L29-3-8 dated October 19th, 1937, I would submit the following report.\n\nThe teachers' convention was in progress. Consequently the children were not in class-room. There are three teachers - Mrs. Burgess (senior room), Miss Keith, M.A. (intermediate room) and Miss Lamb (primary). The teachers are all well qualified and I have always found the class-room work well above the average. The children number 131 and these seem were well dressed and neat in appearance.\n\nThe building throughout I found in fair condition. The dormitories were all clean and well aired. The beds were neatly made and provided with plenty of blankets. Some of the mattresses were past repairing and at least thirty new ones should be provided.\n\nThe sewing room is well managed and I believe the girls receive a good training in plain sewing, mending and patching. The school receives a large number of bales of clothing and there is no store room provided. Mr. Eyers stated he would arrange for the labour of building if the Department could supply the material. I think this is a reasonable request and if funds are available, I would recommend that a suitable building be provided.\n\nThe halls throughout the building are dark and gloomy and if re-decorated at any time, I would\nrecommend a lighter shade of paint.\n\nThe dining room and kitchen are well kept and I have no reason to doubt that the children are supplied with sufficient wholesome food.\n\nThe boys' play-room was dusty and showed some lack of care, as did also the washroom.\n\nIn reference to the toilets, I am not prepared to recommend any change. On the girls' side everything is in good condition and there is no reason why the boys' toilets should not be kept the same. I pointed this out to Mr. Myers and he remarked that boys were naturally more careless. I added that this should be a part of their training and I considered it a very necessary one.\n\nAn Indian boy graduate is boys' supervisor and I doubt if conditions will improve under this arrangement. The boys' toilets need a thorough cleaning and this work continued day after day and not forgotten days and weeks at a time. I would recommend a different supervisor - one not only to look after this side of the work but a man who could instruct the boys in clean, healthful sports.\n\nI think the toilets should be regulated to flush more often. This would reduce the odor and would not increase the water used because the quantity at each flushing could be greatly reduced. This is one place where I think a good practical plumber could offer some useful advice.\n\nThe outside of the school presents a good appearance. The front lawn is nicely kept and the lake adds to the beauty of the rocky surroundings.\n\nMr. Myers informed me he has at least 60 tons of hay and threshed 700 bushels of oats. I understand he rents some land adjacent to the school and it was from this he received his grain.\nThe cow barn has been whitewashed and cleaned but I found in them two head of cattle, a cow and heifer, which had been purchased to butcher. I objected to bringing in these cattle because this might just defeat the effort of having a clean gum-free stable for some tested cattle. I asked concerning the proposed herd and Mr. Myers stated he had partly arranged to get four Ayrshire heifers from a man near Teulon, Manitoba. The school needs milk cows not heifers and I would recommend that six or eight cows be purchased and these should be just fresh or about to freshen. If we are not going to get milk for this winter, I hardly see the use of buying cows before spring. If and when the cows are to be purchased, would it not be advisable to secure the services of a veterinary from the Health of Animals Branch here. I am informed they are willing to cooperate in any work of this nature. I would also point out that Mr. Myers has a good short horn bull which he purchased last spring at the Brandon Bull sale. I advised him at the time to wait for the results of the Bang's test in his herd; but he was determined to buy the bull, and did. I think it is a mistake to jump from one breed to another and we all must admit that the short horn cattle are hard to beat, for an all around general purpose breed. On the other hand, if he is only desirous of milk, then either Holstein or Ayrshire should be selected.\n\nAs stated in my report dated January 27th, 1929, I repeat that we should not attempt to go into extensive farming at this school as a matter of fact the country does not permit of farming as we think of it in Manitoba. I travelled all over the George's farm, which comprises 167 acres. There are perhaps 56 acres under cultivation. I would judge that another 35 or 40 acres might be obtained but this would\ncost at least $25.00 per acre to brush and break. The balance of the farm is swamp, rock and hills. In fact, the rocks are so high along one side that a fence is not necessary. The house is frame (about 18 x 34 with 16 ft. corners). It has never been painted and is finished inside with wall board. The other buildings are useless and of no value. In my other report I stated that \"it was doubtful if the farm was worth the mortgage against it.\" The mortgage is approximately $600.00 and after talking over the farm I definitely am of the opinion that it cannot be sold for nearly this amount. The farm is located approximately three miles by road from the school and this makes it undesirable as part of the school property. If Mr. Syers is determined to farm more I think it best to let him continue to rent as he has done in the past. However, a school in this locality should confine its outside work to gardening, poultry, and the keeping of a small herd of cows\u2014not at any time over ten head. The keeping of bees might be a sideline worthy of consideration.\n\nI hope the information desired will be found in this report.\n\nUnder separate cover I wrote the Department re the urgent work needed to repair and improve the disposal bed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nOttawa, November 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIt has been reported to me that the Cecil Jeffrey Indian Residential School was not kept as clean as it is expected they should be.

I immediately phoned Mr. Gow who gave me the information and requested that he secure men for the following morning. I found Mr. Gow and Mr. H. J. Smith, Engineer, Kenora and Mr. George Riddle of the Government Employment Office supplied the men. Indians were not available as they were working on their traps before the much ice formed on the water.\n\nThe men were working when we arrived and conditions made it impossible to proceed. We found the disposal bed filled with from four to four and a half feet of earth instead of being filled with material with water. Four openings were made and in each case the water rushed in like a well and came to within 1 ft. of the bottom. The water then ran out and the beds were filled to the top. Apparently the main lead and disposal bed tile are filled and broken and the water breaks through the ground or the disposal bed subsides and breaks.\n\nMr. Gow is still of the opinion, and I now agree, that the septic tank will need to be enlarged. We are also of the opinion that a new disposal bed should be made. The main from the septic tank should carry the water approximately 300 ft., where a proper disposal bed could be built.\n\nIn view of the cold weather and the excessive amount of water, the work could not be satisfactorily carried out now. In order to prevent the water backing into the school, I authorized making a drain two feet deep for a distance of 100 ft. and there dig a sump hole about 4 ft. deep and place tile pipe placed in the drain and covered and the sump hole will also be covered. This may prevent any water backing into\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nCpl.\nthe school land may also keep any of the overflow from reaching the lake.

The tiles will settle in the fall or next spring around the tile and in the spring they would settle or leave and immediately fill with dirt. The land is very good and I believe it will be necessary to have the tile carefully laid and in line.\n\nI do not think the total expense authorized for material and labor will exceed $150.00 which I asked be sent to Agent Hamilton.

The toilets are exposed and flush only as the tank is filled with a fresh supply of water.\n\nWe have no urinal in the school and the boys' toilets with their present seat is impossible to keep them clean.\n\nIt is not workable to have a supervisor present every time each boy uses the toilet and as there are 600 pupils a boy must be impossible to use the seat toilette and not get some wet on the seat.\n\nI am being criticised for a condition which I can see no way to overcome.\n\nThe toilets look unclean but if they are examined under a flashlight the appearance is caused by rust having corroded the seats.\n\nThe toilets are scrubbed daily and we have installed a hose to wash them which has been doing this job regularly.\n\nI really do not know what steps we can take to improve the situation with our present layout and if the situation were fully understood I doubt if anything could be improved.\n\nI shall appreciate any suggestions which you may offer to improve the condition of the toilets but I do not see that closer supervision will produce results.\n\nWe should have a proper urinal installed.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Principal]\n538 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nNovember 16th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to advise that, in company with one of the engineers from the Dominion Water Power Board, I visited the site on Friday, November 12th. In the afternoon we laid out the proposed disposal bed, and also located for the labour camp. Work started the following morning. I might just say that the weather has turned considerably colder.\n\nThe total cost of the work authorized last week was estimated at $18,444.65, being $1,000.00 being held back for material.

This might have been due to some obstruction failure of the disposal bed or account of the backing up of the old drainage system.

He has now completed his work as outlined in his report of the 9th ultimo.\n\nA report has been received indicating that work has been completed, the Engineer having returned to the job while operations were under way.\n\nAn examination of the sewage tank disclosed the fact that since its construction two years ago, the tank had not been used properly and that it was not operating as a sewage tank and furthermore the siphon chamber had not been working for some months. It was this maladjustment which caused the failure of the disposal bed on account of the backing up of the pipe drainage system. It was recommended that the tank should be cleaned out before the new disposal bed was connected to the system.

This resulted in the septic tank becoming full of sludge and the failure of the siphon chamber or the backing up of the tile drainage system. It was essential that the septic tank should be cleaned out before the new school building was completed and occupied. The cleaning out of the old tank, which at the time was about full of solid matter, was a difficult job, and required considerable amount of work. However, it was finally satisfactorily accomplished.\n\nYou will note from the above that the school staff has apparently failed to clean out the tank at regular intervals...\nregular intervals.

The question arises why the men should expect any more than their first pay and 2\u00bd days' back wages? If there was any expectation of not working to work, then men had better not start because they had no right to pay less than minimum wages which you informed me was 35\u00a2 an hour in October.

We can hire better at that rate because I had no authority to pay other than the minimum wage, which you informed me was $4.00 per day.

A telegram has been sent to the Indian Agent as follows:\n\n\"REFERENCE YOUR LETTER THIRD INDIAN YOU ARE AUTHORIZED AND INSTRUCTED TO PAY ADDITIONAL FIVE CENTS AN HOUR TO THOSE LABOURERS WHO WERE PREVIOUSLY ON THE LIST WITH OTHERS UNDER CONNECTION WITH BEAVER PLANT ORILLIA JEFFREY SCHOOL.\"\n\nI am enclosing for your information copies of correspondence received from the Indian Agent regarding this subject. It appears that the Indians were not paid by the Ontario Highway Department until they were paid by the Provincial Government. It was on this account that the men were asked to sign a statement to the effect that they had not been paid by the Ontario Highway Department pay only $25.\n\nI trust that it will be possible to locate all the men concerned and pay them their arrears. I shall advise you when the Agent reports that this has been done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa, Ontario.\nKemora, Ontario,\nDecember 28th, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDoi. Min. & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find vouchers in connection with material, etc., supplied for the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School sewage disposal bed.\n\nThe Principal, at the school, had a tank made to remove the solids and liquids, and this has been included in Messrs Borgman & Melanch's account, through the usual channels. We presume the Department will be willing to pay for this, as Mr. Hamilton says \"if Mr. Myers purchased it without authority, I do not think he should be paid for from this appropriation, but if you wish to prepare a voucher and recommend payment I have no objection.\"\n\nThe pay lists, for the labour performed, are also enclosed.\n\nThe amount received was $750.00, out of which has been expended the sum of $701.40 in wages, leaving a balance due the Department of $48.60, a cheque for which will go forward with the usual cash statement at the end of the month.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your overfit vouchers $65.15 for $75.00, covering wages paid in connection with special school plants at the Gordon Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nThe payments for labour are included on six payrolls and of these only one payroll is signed by those who received payment. In order to comply with the requirements of the Auditor General it is necessary that each payroll be personally signed by the person to whom the money is paid.\n\nI note from the last paragraph of your letter that it was your intention at the time you wrote to return the balance due you for the amount of $65.15. As this amount had not reached the Department by the 8th instant I thought that possibly you were holding it in order to be able to comply with the instructions contained in official letter of January 5th.\n\nTo allow you to pay 50\u00a2 an hour to these workers who had received less than this amount would require $25.25. If you have returned the $65.15 before receiving this letter, please let me know and a cheque for the amount of $65.15 will be sent you. If you have not returned the $65.15, a cheque for $13.15 will be forwarded. I believe the best way to account for the advances already...\nadvances already made would be to prepare new paylists at 40\u00a2 an hour and have these signed by those to whom the money is due.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Roy,\nDept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nSgd.\nFrank Bierds, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont., Canada.\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nFrank Edwards\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: your letter 129-3-5 of the 10th instant, returning Voucher #638, for $701.90, covering wages paid in connection with the sewage disposal plant for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nOn October 7th, in reviewing the statement of wages, I asked for a quantity of return of Labour forms #638, but was unable to obtain them. I have completed the returns for the Cecilia Jeffrey School work, and erasing logs for the houses on the Lac Seul Reserve. The order requisition was sent in yesterday, I applied for a further quantity.\n\nIn the past, in all cases where we have employed a large number of men, it has been the custom to have me sign the original Labour Sheet, and I have done so this time. I have enclosed the original form, and have signed it. I have also enclosed one copy for the file here and three for the Department. Up to date, there have been no complaints on this system.\n\nWe did not have a sufficient number of Labour Sheets to provide the necessary copies, to pay the extra .05\u00a2 per hour on the Cecilia Jeffrey School job, but have ruled out for this purpose which will be acceptable. We have enclosed the copies signed by the men, and also the typewritten copies, which have returned. We have notified the men to call at\nthis Office to collect the extra money due them, and it will be better to have the warrant copies signed, than to wait until the end of next month. It will mean the men would not receive their pay for a while, and it would necessitate their calling at the office several times. The men seem anxious to get paid, and the Indians who supplied teams would probably be the end of the month, or later, before no returns could be sent to Ottawa.\n\nI have on hand $48.10 and shall be glad to receive your cheque for $13.15 to enable me to make payments.\n\nRegarding the Labour Board, I have heard that Lac Seul work, in most cases, is obtained by only obtaining one meet, and, as these Indians are scattered all over the country, trapping, etc., it would be absolutely impossible to obtain suitable labourers from this district. I believe they will want it in the course of a few days, and I trust that, under the circumstances, they will be acceptable. In future I will see that the Regulations are complied with. I only wish I had known of this before these men were paid off.\n\nThe same condition also applies in connection with the work done at the Arrow. It will be done, I believe, in the spring, and quadruplicate, as some of the men have left for the winter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 26, 1937\n\nMessrs.

Will you please be good enough to mail this direct to Mr. Byers, Superintendent, of the Indian School.\n\nWhile some of the materials and labor was consumed throughout the installation of the circulating system, a good deal of it had to do with the renewal of old piping and fittings used in \"blasting\" the pressure off the pumps. This work was not charged against the ventilation department. Our proposal covered supervision of installation only, and did not cover small piping and fittings. These are always to be bought when needed.

Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI was hoping that we might be able to carry on until spring without disturbing the main pipe-line for several weeks. It seems to be evident that there is something escaping that the pumps will not shut off automatically owing to lack of pressure when pumping.\n\nI am very much afraid of its cutting off entirely.\n\nAs the break is located in a very inaccessible place it is impossible to decide from surface indications. The water is running out of the side of the hill near the pump-house but the water may be following the line. Last summer the ground was very dry and the soil was very small and thin so thought it was an account of the heavy rains we had had. Now I assume this cave-in may have some connection with the break in the pipe-line.\n\nI would like to suggest that two men be engaged to make test holes and if they are lucky they could locate the break within two or three days. They would not be very busy gathering wood and as they have to make long trips they are away all day.\n\nAs to the probable cost it is impossible to estimate. Under ordinary circumstances $500.00 would be sufficient. But it might mean replacing a large portion of the line. This would take probably $200.00 if it has to be done in the Winter while the ground is frozen.\n\nI would suggest that if the break can be located and can be stopped sufficiently to make it safe until spring it might be better to do nothing until spring and then repair it.\n\nI feel this is very urgent and that something should be done immediately as anything might happen at any time.\n\nThis is a very important matter and I am sure that help and will always serve a valuable purpose. It he meant a great saving on the pumps.\n\nI shall very much appreciate very early action on the matter.\n\nI remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nLondon, Ontario,\n14th February, 1934\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Residential School at Schon, regarding a leak in water main from Lake to School.\n\nI have installed a check valve at a cost of $64.75, which has been a considerable help and in any case was necessary. However, from the Band's point of view, the leak continues to exist and we require your authority to engage two men to make test holes and locate the break. I informed him if this way absolutely necessary, but he said that if we could locate the break, we would then have an idea how much it would cost to repair. I also informed him I would seek authority for this expenditure, but could not guarantee it, in view of the large expenditure we had already made to his school over the amount in the estimates.\n\nIf the repairs can be made for an amount not exceeding the sum of $60.00 may we have the work done. If the cost will be higher I will of course write you for further instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nToronto, Ontario,\n14th February, 1930.\n\nR. A. Hoey Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter (DIP-3-8) of 11th January re sewage disposal at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal informs me that the system appears to be working satisfactory now, with the exception that the discharges from the siphon chamber occur too frequently and the water becomes turbid. This is the contention of Mr. Ross of the Dominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau if the siphons are used too often.\n\nI do not know if the chamber will have to be enlarged or not during this year, but Inspector Hamilton of the Engineers will be able to give us his information.\n\nThe work was laid out, and all instructions given by Inspector Hamilton I had nothing to do with it except to pay the men, and see the work was carried out under the superintendence of Engineer J. Ross.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI recently wrote to Indian Agent Edwards to ascertain if the sewage disposal system at the Shollia Jeffrey Residential School was working satisfactorily. I also requested him to state if he considered any additional work necessary to improve the sewage disposal system during the coming summer. He has replied as follows:\n\n\"The Principal informs me that the system appears to be working satisfactorily now, with the exception that the discharge from the system chamber is too frequently noticeable. The chamber is too small. This is in contradiction to Mr. Ross of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau if the chamber appears too often.\n\nI do not know if the chamber will have to be enlarged or not during this year but I possess a report on the Enidmara which may give us some information.\n\nThe work was laid out, and all instructions given by Inspector Hamilton, I had nothing to do with it, except to pay the men, and see the work was carried out under the superintendence of Engineer J. Ross.\n\nI would appreciate receiving a report from you on this subject. Also, if you think it might let me know who decided what size the system chamber should be.

A separate report of this visit will go forward when received from the Fire Chief.\n\nReference the last paragraph of your letter, the Principal informs me that when the Grand Jury visited the school, they had just received boxes of clothing from the Church Authorities in the East and they had not had time to store them away. On my visit to the school there was no piled in the hallways, everything being ship shape.\n\nAs there was a shortage of storage space, the Principal has erected a small frame store room beside the school, and this no doubt will take care of their requirements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n528 Dominion Public Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nFebruary 23rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 129-3-5 dated February 18th, I understand from the Dominion Water & Power Bureau here that in 1929 they designed a sewage disposal system for the Cecilia Jeffrey School. The plan was designed for the accommodation of 100 people. I understand this plan was submitted to our Department for their approval.\n\nFor some years past, I am given to understand that with the pupils and staff the number at the school has totalled from 160 to 170. Consequently, you will see that the original design was altogether too small.\n\nLast fall a new disposal field was laid and this was enlarged to accommodate the increased number. I understand the syphon chamber should also be enlarged in proportion to the enlargement of the disposal bed. This will naturally reduce the number of discharges and each discharge will fill the disposal field. I understand this is what is desired.\n\nIt is estimated that the cost of enlarging the syphon chamber will be approximately $150.00. However, this will depend largely on the condition of the present syphon chamber when the work is undertaken and I think it would be well to provide at least another $100.00.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMr. Gow of the Dominion Water & Power Branch, has submitted information to his Department at Ottawa at different times in connection with the sewage disposal system at this school. In view of this, no doubt, any further information you desire could be obtained from that Department at Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. G.

Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\n\nKENORA, ONT., March 4th 1938\n\nDear Captain:\n\nI hereby wish to present you with my report after making a thorough inspection of all the fire protection appliances and other safety installations in both the Indian residential schools.\n\nI found the premises at the Cecilia Jeffrey School very clean and tidy and all appliances well kept and in their proper places, but after testing out all the linen fire hose on the hose standards I found that two fifty foot sections of it is of no more use and shall have to be replaced. The hose on the hose reel in the yard is about perished and about five hundred feet of the rubber lined hose should be procured for outside protection; this hose should not be used nor any of the linen hose for any purpose except for fire.\n\nThe chemical extinguishers are in good order and the fire alarm system is also in proper working order although it does not extend to the furnace room or the Superintendent quarters as it should.\n\nIt may be a good idea to have a large bell installed on the building for in case of a fire when the Boys and Girls are out playing or on other outside exercise they could be called in to assist in extinguishing any fire that may start from some inside source. I wish to recommend that an extension be added to the roof of the building on the North side to keep snow and ice from falling on the fire escape, as it is at present all the snow and water runs immediately on these escapes off of the main roof.\n\nI also believe that in having hourly tours made by the night watchman to all sections of the premises including outside buildings this should assist in not only detecting fire early but it should also assist in preventing the pupils or others from rambling around the dormitories or other rooms during the night hours and do away with having the doors kept under lock and key.\n\nOne employee should be appointed to keep all the fire protection appliances as well as the fire escapes always in proper condition and periodical inspections made should be reported upon to the Superintendent in writing; fire drills should be periodically held from the class rooms and dormitories; the fire pump should be tested out several times during the year and the rubber lined hose should be tried out at the same time then thoroughly drained and dried out and placed back on the reel for instant use.\n\nRespectfully submitted by\n\nChief Fire Dept.\nR. A. Hoey\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReference your letter #129-3-5 of 5th ultimo and my letter of the 16th ultimo re visit of the Grand Jury to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nEnclosed please find report of the Encore Fire Chief, who is kind enough to visit the two local schools with me annually.\n\nHe recommends we purchase two fifty foot lengths of linen fire hose, and 500 feet hose for outside.\n\nThe unlined linen hose will cost about $14.20 per 100 feet, and the treated hose for outside will cost 80 cents a foot for the better grade, but a suitable grade can be got for about 45 cents a foot, and 500 feet will be required. These prices were got from the Dunlop Rubber Company's traveller when he happened to drop in the office yesterday, in addition to this there will probably be freight from Winnipeg.\n\nThe Chief suggests the fire alarm system should extend to the furnace room and the Principal's quarters; he informs me this could be done for an additional cost of round $20.00.\n\nHe suggests a large bell on the building, but in discussing the matter with him later he said a triangle, and rope would be suitable at a cost of around $15.00.\n\nA roof over the fire escape on the North side is recommended, and he thinks this could be built by the staff if we supplied materials for about $25.00 or $30.00.\n\nThe Principal informs me it would be impossible to keep the door unlocked at night, on account of the children wandering and truanting.\n\nThe Fire Chief also mentioned to me that the doors of the infirmary open inwards instead of outwards, and these should be changed, to facilitate easy escape in case of fire.\n\nI shall be glad to receive instruction as what should be done.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nE.V.D.\n\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the report of the Chief of the Kenora Fire Department in regard to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is prepared to supply the two fifty feet lengths of linen fire hose but in order to have the necessary information to place before our Purchasing Branch I would appreciate if you would advise me as follows:\n\n(a) Type of hose - regulation rubber lined fire hose or unlined forestry hose.\n\n(b) Type of couplings - with lug, lugless or rocker lug.\n\n(c) Details regarding the thread of couplings required.\n\nYou may also arrange for the extension of the fire alarm system to the furnace room in the Principal's quarters at a cost of $20.00. Material costing not more than $50.00 may be purchased in order that the staff may erect a roof over the fire escape on the north side of the building.\n\nThe Department is not prepared to supply the 500 feet of hose for outside use nor the large bell on the building.\n\nF. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nI note that the Principal does not wish to leave the door leading to the fire escape unlocked at night. I would appreciate your reviewing this matter with him again. As a general policy the doors leading to fire escapes should be kept unlocked whenever the dormitories are occupied by the pupils. In many schools a bell is placed in the room of the person who is supervising the dormitory and a wire attached to the door leading to the dormitory. In the event of the door being opened the bell rings in the supervisor's room and in this way children can be prevented from truancy during the night. This is not a costly installation as a dry cell battery can be used. Please let me hear further from you in connection with this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario\n16th April, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Grand Jury in making their report to Mr. Justice MacKay, yesterday, report; in connection with the two Indian Residential Schools in Kenora, as follows:\n\n\"St Mary's Industrial School (R.C. Residential School). The school was found to be well managed. The building is in urgent need of painting and decorating throughout. The fire hose, command by the Fire Marshall should be replaced. The fire extinguisher should be re-charged once annually. The last inspection was in December 1935. They also require new enamel plates and cups for dining room use. One verandah needs a new roof, and one more fire escape is needed in the girls dormitory.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian School. The school appeared to be well managed, and the pupils contented. We found that no dormitories are provided with direct fire escapes. The existing fire escapes in centre of building should be repaired. Floors in all dormitories and class rooms should be covered with linoleum.\"\n\nIn reference to the above reports:- the painting, fire hose, and floor covering does not come up to us, as all estimates come under the Inspector now, and not through this office, as we do not see them.\n\nNo Fire Marshall has ever to my knowledge ever inspected any of my schools, but I do ask the local Fire Chief to inspect these building with me annually, and to give me a written report, as to anything he considers should be done, so as to make the schools as safe as possible from fire. These reports are always sent to Ottawa, and most of his recommendations are usually carried out.\n\nI have enclosed herewith for the Kenora R.C. Indian Residential School, the letter sent by the Purchasing Branch of the Department of Indian Affairs, dated 27th March, and the Fire Chief has been requested to see that all inspections are filled. They are inspected every year by him, but are not marked by us, as so considered they should be marked by the person who fills them. They were all inspected by us in March.\n\nOur letter of the 23rd ult. gives the requirements for the Cecilia Jeffrey School, and your letter No. 45-5 of 23rd ultimo informs us the school will be supplied with hose. As regards the extra fire escapes I will discuss this with the Town Fire Chief. But this is a standard school, and no such recommendation has been put in before by any Jury or Fire Chief.\nNeither of the two schools approve of your and the Jury's suggestions, that the dormitories be kept unlocked, shall I give definite instructions to the Principals on this point. They claim they cannot be responsible for the children, if doors are left unlocked at nights, and the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School says, if there was a bell put from the doors of the dormitories to the persons room who is supervising the dormitory at night, that person would quit, as her rest would be broken all night, and she would not get proper sleep, I cannot agree with his contention, but would like to know if I should instruct both schools, that some arrangement must be made so that the doors would not be locked.\n\nAs regards direct fire escapes from the dormitories at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, the children have to leave the dormitories and come down a few steps to reach the escapes, which are near the staircases, and there is no doubt a certain amount of danger in this, but as I pointed out to the Principal, if escapes were placed at each dormitory, this would give another avenue of egress to the pupils should they wish to get out at night.\n\nI am informed that a verandah is being built at the Sioux Lookout Residential School (which is the same design) as the Cecilia Jeffrey, this will act as an escape in case of fire, but will also allow the children to get out at night should they wish to do so.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\nSup't. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter 129-3-5 of 23rd inst., I regret I neglected to state the diameter of the fire hose required for the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nThe size is 1\" which is standard at all our schools here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAPRIL 29, 1928.\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 018\n\nSHIP TO P.

Frank Edwards,\n\nIt happened in an Indian school, in this Agency, a short time ago, some boys having made use of a ladder to gain access to the girls' dormitory.\n\nWe have a night watchman for only six months in the year, and even when he is on duty, he has to make his inspection of the barn and the pump house, and would be away for several periods during the night. While he was absent, the girls and boys could easily mix in the dormitories.\n\nI have found that the strictest supervision has to be exercised at all times, to keep the boys and girls in their places, and when discussing this problem with other principals, I find they have the same difficulties.\n\nI hope the Department is not going to ask our School to put into practice methods, which are not required by the other schools. I certainly would not appreciate working under such conditions, and I would like to receive further instructions from the Department, outlining how one might proceed to run a mixed school and at the same time safeguard the morals of the pupils.\n\nThe system we use is to lock the doors with padlocks, that can be removed almost as readily as turning the knob of the door. We arranged it this way, in the event of fire, so that we could feel we were using a system that would not, in any way, endanger our pupils.\n\nI am giving your letter considerable thought, and I shall await further instructions from the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nB/U.\nKenora, Ontario.\nApril 29th, 1938.\n\nThe Principal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received a letter from the Department in which they say they note you do not desire to leave the dormitories unlocked during the night.\n\nThe Department desires me to draw your attention to the instructions, recently issued, in which they expressed their definite desire that the doors should be unlocked at night.\n\nThey also say there is no reason why this can't be done at your school, because such procedure is followed at other Indian Residential Schools.\n\nThey also say they feel certain that if you give the matter further consideration, you will realize that in case of a fire, serious fatalities would undoubtedly occur if the doors to the fire escapes were locked.\n\nThe Department desires me to advise them, in the near future, that you are complying with Departmental regulations in this regard.\n\nI will be glad, therefore, if you will drop me a letter when you have carried out the Department's instructions.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Frank Edwards\"\nIndian Agent.\nMay 4th,\n\nSupt. Frank Edwards,\nAgent,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\n[1935-04-29]\n\nIn reply to your letter, I wish to make the following observations.\n\nIn the first place, I feel that there must be some misunderstanding as to which of the doors of the school are to be locked and which are unlocked. It has always been the practice in our school to see that all doors leading to the fire escapes are unlocked during the nights but the dormitory doors have been locked. I notice, in your letter, that you state that the procedure followed at other Indian Residential Schools is to have the dormitory doors unlocked. I have communicated with six different Indian Residential Schools and inquired regarding their procedure, and they all inform me that they lock their dormitory doors at night.\n\nIn addition to this, I have visited some other Indian Residential Schools, and they, too, locked their dormitory doors. In fact I do not know of any Indian Residential School that does not lock their dormitory doors during the night.\n\nI would very much appreciate having the addresses of some of the schools which leave their dormitories unlocked, as I would like to communicate with them, with a view to obtaining their methods of keeping the boys and girls under control. I cannot devise any plan that I feel would work satisfactorily with unlocked doors, and I think that it would be making something very unfair, to a member of the staff, who was trying to obtain a night's rest, to be responsible for the boys and girls in dormitories with unlocked doors. She would not only have to be responsible for those in the dormitories, but she would also need to be on guard against young men, who visit these Indian Schools, and watch for some opportunity of obtaining entrance to the girls' quarters.

Hoey,\nDirector of Education,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose, herewith, copy of a letter, which I have received from Capt. Frank Edwards, Local Indian Agent, also, a copy of my reply to him.\n\nNo doubt, in due course, you will hear of this from Capt. Edwards, and I shall appreciate your consideration of the difficulties with which we shall be confronted, if these instructions go into force.\n\nIf these methods go into effect, some of my staff are going to resign, as they feel they cannot carry on their work under such a condition. Why should one School be compelled to adopt a course, which is not followed by any other School?\n\nHoping for your favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.W.

We had to have fires during the night and it was not safe to do so without someone in charge.\n\nI shall appreciate if the Department will pay the salary, amounting to $30.00, for that month, which was at the rate paid for the previous six months.\n\nThanking you for your attention, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, asking the Department to pay for a night watchman for the month of April, as they had to retain him for that month.\n\nThe night watchmen at the other schools are paid by our Department for the month of April, but not at this school, and the Principal cannot understand why he cannot get a night watchman paid for the same time as the other schools.\n\nAs a matter of fact it was cold during April but not any more than in past years.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant you may authorize an expenditure not exceeding $35.00 for the purchase of wire to fence a piece of ground at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It is noted that the work will be done by the school staff. You may also purchase a drum of H.T.H.\n\nProvision was made in the current year's appropriation for an amount of $500.00 for general repairs and purchase of equipment at this school. In an official letter you were authorized to expend $50.00 and this letter authorizes an expenditure of $35.00 plus the cost of the H.T.H. We have already arranged for the purchase of the fire hose. All these items will have to be deducted from the amount specifically provided in the current year's appropriation.\n\nUnder separate cover you are being written with reference to the Principal's request for new farm machinery.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

In the first paragraph of your letter to him you wrote as follows:\n\n\"We have received a letter from the Department in which they say they note you do not desire to leave the dormitories unlocked during the night.\"\n\nOfficial letter of March 30, 1938 did not make this statement. You will note our letter read:\n\n\"I note that the Principal does not wish to leave the door leading to the fire escape unlocked at night.\" There is a considerable difference between what you wrote to Mr. Byers and what was included in our letter. Please show Mr. Byers my letter of March 30 and I think that such action will dispel the misapprehension under which he is now working.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nSIOUX LOOKOUT INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSIOUX LOOKOUT, ONT.\nMay 4th, 1936.\n\nMr. E.W. Byers,\nOceilia Jeffrey School,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast Saturday night I received a wire from you, \"Do you leave dormitory doors unlocked at night?\" We replied, \"Boys' dormitories locked, girls' dormitories unlocked.\"\n\nNow I presume from your haste in a wire that you must be up against some difficulty. I have visited a good many Indian Residential schools and others in the course of my work and in some of the very best schools I notice that they lock both girls' and boys' dormitories at night. In some schools I have even noticed padlocks on the doors as the principals of these schools said these boys were experts at picking locks. We got into difficulty here some years ago when the Boys' Master left a dormitory door unlocked because he had a boy who needed constant attention. While he was watching, a few hours after three boys slipped down stairs and started a fire in the wood room and were heard returning to the dormitory by one of the men of the staff. He went downstairs to find out who had gone down and found one of the boys still in the wood room adding coal oil to the flames.\n\nWhatever your difficulties may be I certainly would not leave boys dormitories unlocked under any consideration. But we do leave the key turned in the door from the hall side so that any member of the staff can open them. We have not found it necessary to lock the girls in, although, they know that the same thing would happen to them if they disobeyed rules.\n\nAs for having some member of the staff sleeping in the dormitory I cannot agree with it. It is trying enough to work with these children in the daytime without having to sleep in the same dormitory and continually getting the Indian odor from them. As for the trusted boy or girl who could have their bed close to the door I have never seen one who hasn't been sound asleep and you could have moved the whole dormitory out before they could have awakened up. I know this from years of experience and before my illness I walked through this building every night and walked past every child's bed to see if they were properly covered, sometime about midnight.\n\nIf you are confronted with some difficulty do not hesitate to write and I will give you the benefit of my knowledge and experience not only as Missionary and Principal but as eight years Police Magistrate with the Mounted Police.\n\nThe best policy I know of to follow is good common sense.\n\nWith kindest regards, I remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev.

Marshall, Principal of Sixx Lockout school.\n\nMr. Marshall has been engaged in Indian work for almost 40 years and in this letter he gives his experience in dealing with the Indian children.\n\nIn the Department's letter to me I was accused of being the only Principal who kept the dormitory doors locked and it is on this account that I have written you. From the previous letter I sent you and from Mr. Marshall's letter you will see that my school is not the exception. I do not know of an Indian school where the dormitory doors are not locked.\n\nI have also sent a copy of this letter to the Indian Agent and I understand he is mailing a copy to the Department.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMay 18, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant referring to correspondence which you have received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School and the Kenora Residential School regarding the instructions recently issued by the Department in connection with precautions that should be taken to minimize the danger from fire.\n\nBoth Principals should carefully read the instructions that have been issued and you should point out to them that the Department requires that these instructions be put into effect.\n\nThere was no necessity for the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School or the Principal of the Kenora Residential School communicating with other Principals to ascertain what they are doing. If other Principals are not following out the Department's instructions there is no reason why the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey and Kenora Schools should not do so.\n\nThere is no necessity for further correspondence regarding this matter as the instructions have been issued and, as pointed out above, we expect the Principals to carry them out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nVOTE 76 E.R., 630\nSir:\n\nRe: Sewage System, Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nFollowing the receipt of your letter of March 25th in connection with the above, the writer made an inspection of the new disposal bed constructed last fall but snow covered the ground and a later inspection was desirable. On May 30th, I again examined the system, while in Kenora on another matter.\n\nThe Indian Residential School is built on a sandy shelf from which the ground slopes fairly steeply to the shore line of Round Lake to the source of the water supply for the school. The slope is composed of fairly coarse sand to a depth of many feet, probably overlying gravel or bed rock. From the time this building was constructed we have experienced trouble with the disposal of sewage and laundry wastes. The laundry sump soon became useless when the grease blocked passage of the liquid through the sand. Various expedients were adopted to care for the laundry wastes but some of the drainage still frequently comes to the surface and creates unsatisfactory conditions.\n\nThe original disposal bed appeared to work satisfactorily at first but some three or four years ago the liquid commenced rising to the surface and proceeded down the slope into the lake. The construction of the new disposal bed in freezing weather, late last fall, did not permit of a satisfactory job being performed. The sand was frozen and in large lumps so that when the bed was re-built and connected with the septic tank, the liquid quickly percolated through the coarse sand, made outlets for itself and flowed down the slope into the lake. It still continues to do so and as the effluent runs into the small lake, the source of the water supply, the present conditions are very unsatisfactory.\n\nThe soil conditions and the location upon the slope renders it very difficult to construct and maintain an efficient disposal bed for this school. It may be impossible to secure satisfactory results with the disposal bed but I would like to suggest that an attempt be made to secure results by some alterations to the present bed before some other scheme for the disposal of sewage be decided upon.\n\nIt will be necessary to uncover the tile at the sides and ends of the present bed and build up the outer borders of the bed itself with heavy earth to prevent erosion from within the bed. It will also be necessary to haul loam to mix with the coarse sand so as to obtain a more satisfactory soil condition. Furthermore, the surface must be made so that a growth of grass or other vegetation can be assured. It will be necessary to fence in the disposal bed in order to prevent livestock from crossing the same and damaging it.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThis work should be done early in July when the school is mostly unoccupied and the sewage system not fully loaded.\n\nIt is difficult to say what the cost of this suggested work will be but at least $300.00 should be allotted for the work. I would also suggest that an addition be made to the siphon chamber of the septic tank this summer, unless funds have already been provided for that purpose.\n\nI would again point out that if it is desired to have this work proceeded with, it must be carried out during the period in July and August when the school holidays are on.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) D.B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Sewage disposal, Caselia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nOn receipt of your memorandum of March 22nd last, Mr. Gow was requested to make an inspection of the above sewage disposal system as soon as weather conditions were suitable. His report has now been received and a copy is attached. From this report it will be noted that Mr. Gow is not prepared to estimate closely on the funds required for additional work necessary, but considers that for the suggested work at least $300.00 should be provided. It will also be noted that if this work is to be done this season, it should be carried out during the period in July and August when the school holidays are on.\n\nIt would appear from information available that there has been trouble for some time with this sewage disposal system. This would appear to be at least partly due to the topography at this point and also to the fact that the soil is of such a sandy nature that considerable seepage through same takes place into the lake which is the source of water supply for the school.\n\nWhile under the circumstances it appears doubtful as to whether the system installed is the best, still as Mr. Gow only wants to do work which will cost a comparatively small amount this season, it is recommended that such work should be undertaken as a further experiment before any larger work would be planned that would revise the present system.\n\nFrom Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of March 18th last, it is assumed that he will probably be able to provide the required money for this work. I would, however, be glad to be advised as to what instructions are to be issued in connection with same.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n17th June, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sewage disposal, Cecelia Jeffrey Indian/Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI am forwarding herewith copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer together with a report from Mr. Gow relative to the above sewage disposal system.\n\nIt would appear that this system is not very satisfactory due to topography and to the nature of the soil and that it is doubtful whether the present system is the best. Mr. Gow considers, however, that work to the extent of $300 cost should be done and I should be glad if you would advise if this amount could be made available.\n\nDirector.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nJune 21, 1958.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nDirector & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Sewage disposal Cecilia Jeffrey\nIndian Residential School, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of June 17 enclosing report of Mr. Dow relative to the above sewage disposal system.\n\nI approve of an expenditure not exceeding $300.00 in order to improve the sewage system at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nIncluded in the amount of $61,460.00 transferred to your Branch at the beginning of the current fiscal year was an item of $1,460.00 for some work that we intended to do at the York Frances Residential School. However, it has been decided not to proceed with this work and we recently approved of an expenditure of $1,145.00 at the Allot Bay School. This leaves a balance of $355.00 still available.\n\nIt is likely that other work will arise within the next month or so which will require our transferring funds to your Branch and at that time we will include the balance of $45.00 required in connection with the sewage disposal system at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nDirector.\nCharles Niedner's Sons\n\nUnderwriters Linen Fire Hose\n\nFor Underwriters Protection\n\nCotton Fabrics for Insulating Purposes\n\nCoaticook, Que.\n\nSold to Department of Mines & Resources\n\nF.

Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nCOPY\n\nCECILIA JEFFREY SCHOOL\nPresbyterian\n\nKearora, Ontario.\n\nJuly 20th, 1938.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nNo doubt you will recall that during our conference with Mr. Phelan last June, that he raised the question re: the locking of our dormitory doors at night. Mr. Phelan stated on that occasion that the Agent had misread the Department's instructions and that it was the doors leading onto fire escapes that the Department wished unlocked. He further stated that it was not practical to have the dormitory doors unlocked.\n\nThe Indian Agent here insists that I unlock the doors and at the same time every other school in his agency have the doors locked. I have visited quite a number of Indian Schools and in every one visited the doors are locked.\n\nIt seems to me a deep injustice that a ruling should be made to apply to one school and other schools are left free to do as they wish. I must have the boards' support in this matter, otherwise the agent is going to force me to throw our dormitory doors wide open, with boys sleeping at one end of the corridor and girls at the other end with nothing but the open corridor between.\n\nThe members of staff feel that it is an impossible situation and some have even said that they would rather resign than work under those conditions. The principals of Brandon, Birtle, Portage la Prairie, and Sioux Lookout all say it is impossible. I hope you will do everything possible to have this ruling vetoed.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nSigned: E. W. Byers, Principal.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nAugust 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School in which he states that you are still insisting that all the dormitory doors remain unlocked at night.\n\nPlease note the instructions contained in circular letter of February 10, 1936 a copy of which is enclosed. The instructions contained in this letter were that the only doors that the Department required be unlocked during the night were those leading from the dormitories to the fire escapes. It is felt that if the Principal and yourself had carefully read the contents of circular letter of February 10 there would have been no necessity for all the correspondence that we have had in connection with this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nF. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the Superintendent of Welfare and Training's letter #129-3-5 of 9th instant, re locking Dormitory doors at night at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nI have given the Principal of the School, no other instructions as regarding locking doors, than are contained in Departmental letters and circulars, and the only doors we have referred to in any way are those leading from the dormitory to the fire escapes.\n\nI have not taken this matter up with the Principal for some time, except that on the 20th of July, I went to the School with the Kenora Fire Chief, to see what he could suggest as regards covering over the fire escapes, to prevent the fall of ice on them; he then mentioned about the children getting out, to the Principal, and it was suggested a hook and eye could be put on the doors so the children could if absolutely necessary push them open from inside, and I understood this is what the Principal intended to do, as is done at some of our other schools.\n\nThe Principal always seems to be offended when I give him any instructions, although I give them in as diplomatic a manner as possible, knowing he is very touchy.\n\nHe is the only Principal, I have where there are these difficulties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. Ryers, principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, called while in the city last week to discuss several matters in connection with the school.\n\nHe pointed out that the mattresses in both dormitories were in bad condition and a number should be renewed. Since then, I have received a report from Mr. Edwards, the Indian Agent, in this connection and he recommends that seventy-five new mattresses be supplied. He points out that some now in use should be destroyed, as they are badly worn and unfit for further use.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend that the 75 mattresses requested be supplied.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.C.

These are being purchased and when they are secured the total amount provided in the current year's appropriation for this school will be exhausted.

I am asking Mr. Byers to do this and send me a copy so we will have the information on file when required.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent, Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nSince writing you regarding a night-watchman for the Birtle school, I understand that in the other schools a watchman is allowed for seven months at a rate of $40.00 per month. At the Cecilia Jeffrey school, which is the largest in the agency, only $30.00 per month is allowed for six months.\n\nIn the matter of expense for bringing in the children, we have never received any allowance. At Cecilia Jeffrey our principal has very kindly brought in children going to other schools because they happened to be in the district where he was collecting children. For this he has received nothing, and a claim for bringing in our own children made by Mr. Byers was not allowed.\n\nOur Society has always been very generous in its contribution to Indian work and we feel that we should have the same allowances as other churches. May I suggest that these matters be considered and a fair arrangement made?\n\nThanking you for your attention,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nJ. Florence Kay\nIndian Secretary.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 23, 1936.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant regarding the amount allowed for the night watchman at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School I would refer you to my recent letter in connection with the request for a grant for a night watchman at the Birtle School. In providing the necessary equipment for this service it was definitely understood that a grant for a night watchman would only be allowed at those Residential Schools where there was a very serious fire hazard. Two years ago the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School applied to the Department through Indian Agent Edwards, for a grant for a night watchman and while the Cecilia Jeffrey School cannot be recognized as one in which the fire hazard is serious the Principal stated that he had engaged a night watchman to assist him and it was decided to allow an amount of $50.00 a month for 6 months. We have always understood that this payment was satisfactory to the Principal.\n\nSome years ago the Department purchased a boat for the use of the Cecilia Jeffrey School. Under these circumstances it was felt that it should not be necessary to make an allowance for the transportation of pupils as they can be carried in the school boat. We have paid small accounts for the transportation of pupils from points which the school boat could not reach.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMiss J.

Hoey\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal System, Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 24th of June last regarding the above, we are now advised by Mr. Gow that work for this season has been completed. As regards the work done, the following is quoted from Mr. Gow's letter for your information:\n\n\"The work carried out on this project consisted mostly of re-building up the disposal bed. As you are aware, this disposal bed was constructed early in the winter of 1937 during very severe frosty weather with the result that the ground was frozen and the job not properly finished. It was found necessary to dig up a considerable number of rows of tile, relay the same, reconstruct with denser material the borders of the disposal bed and add gravel and etc., to portions that had been washed away.\n\n\"The work carried out this summer is not expected to eliminate the trouble being experienced with the sewage disposal system at this school. The nature of the soil and the over-loading of the septic tank creates a condition where a disposal bed cannot be made to work satisfactorily. Accordingly, it is anticipated that more trouble will be experienced with this disposal bed and it was for this reason that we did not care to make further expenditures during the present season.\n\nYou will recall that an amount not exceeding $500.00 was approved for this work, but according to Mr. Gow's statement of expenditure, only $158.76 was actually expended. The reason limiting the work done this season to this amount being given in the last paragraph quoted above from Mr. Gow's report.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.S. Mills\n\nJ.M.

In the report from Mr. Gow which is incorporated in a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, a copy of which is attached, it will be noted that the work which has been done cost $153.74, Mr. Gow's reason for not spending further monies on the work being that it is not considered advisable as further trouble might be expected.\n\nDirector.\nA.

We also attached a duplicate of our previous charge for repairs to this machine in July.\n\nAs explained to you this equipment is out of date and will need many years use feel confident in assuring you that this charge has been the result of ordinary wear and tear and not been occasioned by any lack of care on the part of those responsible for its operation.\n\nThe major part of expense is due to the replacement of the refrigerant gas which had to be replaced in its entirety.\n\nWe have no reason for doubt that the new system will function properly and efficiently and would be able to operate without interruption for many years to come.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager\nCheyne Electric.\nOttawa,\nNovember 2, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to an expenditure incurred by the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School in repairing the Kelvinator plant.\n\nThe expenditure incurred is rather heavy and suggests that possibly this machine has not been receiving proper attention. It has been decided to pay the account for which you should forward proper voucher forms. In future, however, when you visit the school you should inspect the Kelvinator with a view to satisfying yourself that it is receiving proper supervision so that repairs can be kept at a minimum.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.

Indian Residential school and look into the matter of the Jury's recommendations, and after his inspection he will give me a written report which I will forward to Ottawa as soon as received.\n\nThe building at this time is not quite in a perfect state, rather dilapidated, but there is no question of its being entirely unfit for use. The School Authorities did not consider it necessary to make any repairs.\n\nAs far as the Cecilia Jeffrey School, the need for mattresses and clothing has been taken up with the department before, but I have informed them that I am unable to do this purpose.\n\nAs all estimates and so forth for the Residential Schools, are in the hands of the Inspector and do not go through our office, I do not like to interfere, although any requests made by the Authorities are of course forwarded to the Department either through the Chief or Assistant Chief.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJack Edwards\n\n[Stamp]\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nLetter No.110\n\nOffice of the Lenora, Ontario.

When the oven is operating, it gives off a gas which makes it impossible for anyone to remain in the room as this gas affects the eyes and in a few minutes it is unbearable. I have been at the school when the oven was in use and know the condition is such that no woman could carry on her work. The oven has not been in use for a couple of years. I would recommend that it be discarded and that a wood burning oven be installed.\n\nThe school is badly in need of paint, both inside and out and Mr. Byers has had very little assistance in this respect.

The suggestions as made by Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies, have been noted.\n\nMr. Hamilton suggested that the possibility of securing an adequate water supply from springs or wells in the vicinity be investigated and intimates that water from such sources would obviate the necessity for the present chlorination and would also permit of leaving the disposal bed in its present condition.\n\nMr. Hamilton's suggestion with respect to securing a new water supply will be studied on the ground shortly when conditions are more favourable. While it is understood a settler in the vicinity of the school has a water supply from a small spring, yet it would appear improbable that an adequate water supply could be secured in the vicinity, from springs. I know of no institutions or industry in the vicinity obtaining its water supply from wells. However, further inquiries will be made locally concerning the possibility of securing a water supply from such a source.\n\nWhile the elimination of chlorination is always desirable, yet it might be pointed out that the water in use at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School is not chlorinated to the extent that is necessary with the water supply for the Town of Kenora. Furthermore, I do not believe that the Department of Health of the Province of Ontario would approve of the suggestion that the effluent from the disposal bed be permitted to flow freely into Round Lake as at present, since the overflow from this small lake passes into Lake of the Woods - a short distance away.\n\nUnder the circumstances, a new water supply, in all probability, would not eliminate the necessity for overcoming the present condition at the sewage disposal bed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. D. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nT. S.

We are now in receipt of a reply from Mr. Gow copy of which is attached.\n\nIt will be noted that this is only an interim report as Mr. Gow has not as yet had an opportunity of visiting the School.\n\nThis project has been a matter of correspondence between this office and Mr. Gow for some time, and just prior to the receipt of your memorandum of the 9th we had received a letter from Mr. Gow in which he stated that he could not see any successful termination of the reported difficulties at this School as long as such disposal depended on present septic tank and disposal beds. He made the tentative suggestion that in his opinion the solution would be a sprinkler filter system but that he had previously hesitated to make such a suggestion on account of initial high cost and high operation charges after installation. Since the receipt of Mr. Gow's letter, we have carried on some research work in this office in connection with the use and cost of filter system which information has recently been supplied Mr. Gow. It is, therefore, expected that we will be receiving a further report from Mr. Gow dealing more completely with the whole situation.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.E. Mills\n\nJ. M.

A great difficulty at this school, of course, is the sewage disposal system. However, until a more complete inspection can be made, Mr. Gow does not feel that he can make any definite suggestions.\n\nA copy of the Chief Engineer's covering memorandum is attached.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMarch 31, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of January 30 regarding the Cecilia Jeffrey residential school I immediately communicated with the Surveys & Engineering Branch regarding the sewage disposal bed.\n\nI have just received their reply in which they state that Mr. Gow has again considered the matter but feels that he cannot make any definite recommendation until he has an opportunity of making a further inspection which will be delayed until the fine weather.\n\nMr. Gow is of the opinion that a sufficient supply of water could not be obtained from springs or wells in the vicinity of the school.\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 provision has been made for an amount of $400.00 for the purchase of new equipment and also repairs and improvements at this school. If you consider that a new wood-burning oven should be provided please let me have full particulars regarding the type necessary in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nYou might also let me know the quantity and kind of paint that you recommend be supplied and if funds are available an order will be placed here.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The outside of all buildings require re-painting in order to preserve the structure, and we would strongly recommend that this be done immediately.\"\n\nNew fire hose, especially in the barns, is required.\n\nThe Superintendent (Mr. Eyers) advises that a team of horses should be provided to replace present team.\n\nAll estimates for residential schools now come under the Inspector and not the Indian Agent; all requests received from the Principal have been forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nThere is no doubt the recommendations of the Jury are correct, but only a small amount was allowed for the school last year, and nothing could be done with the money available also probably a considerable expense will be necessary to put the sewage disposal bed in shape to function satisfactorily.\n\nSeveral of the local Indians are going to Winnipeg to see the King and Queen on May 24th, and requests have been made to send the Cecilia Jeffrey School Band there at the same time, but the Welcome Committee have no funds for this, as it would cost at the very least $200.00, and if we paid for this we would also have the other school asking why we would not pay for them.\n\nMrs. Straughan, Treasurer of the Presbyterian Missionary Society Toronto, was in to see me a few days ago and said the Secretary should pay for this, and she would take it up, with the Board, and Mr. McCauley, with the Hon. Mr. Smith, and see what could be done. She would try and raise the money somehow.\n\nI was also asked to take some Indians with costumes in, and they would be given a seat of honour or in some parade where they would see him at close quarters, but I am informed the Committee I could not do this unless some finance was supplied, and I did not see how our Branch could do anything along this line, I had also been asked to take part in the Indians part of a fagant at that time.\n\nI shall be glad to know what, if anything, is voted for the Cecilia Jeffrey School in the estimates.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1939.\n\nL.A.D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 24th ultimo in connection with the report of the Grand Jury recording their visit to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school.\n\nWhile we have had several reports from the Surveys & Engineering Branch no definite information has yet been supplied to us as to the probable cost of properly completing the sewage disposal bed. Mr. Gow feels that he cannot make any definite recommendation until he has an opportunity of making a further inspection during the fine weather.\n\nFor your information I may say that an amount of $400.00 has been provided in the current year's appropriation for the purchase of new equipment and repairs and improvements at the Cecilia Jeffrey school and this information has already been conveyed to Inspector Hamilton. Funds are so limited that it is practically impossible to expend more at a residential school than is actually provided. Under these circumstances the Department is not prepared to recommend any expenditure at the Cecilia Jeffrey residential school until we are aware of the cost of the work that will have to be done at the sewage disposal bed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 11, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received a letter from the Women's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church in which it is stated that one of their officers recently visited the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school and in submitting her report she refers to the bake oven which is not in use.\n\nYou will remember that you reported on this in your letter of February 26, 1936, and subsequently we communicated with the Principal but apparently it was not possible to overcome the difficulty from me and as a result the oven is not in use.\n\nHave you had an opportunity of inspecting this bake oven recently? Was any endeavour made to have the manufacturers or this oven replace it or at least put it in such condition that it could be operated? It was purchased at a considerable cost and should give satisfaction. Possibly you will have occasion to visit the Cecilia Jeffrey school in the near future when you could personally inspect the oven again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

At that time you intimated that Mr. Gov would make a complete inspection as soon as weather conditions permitted.\n\nAn amount of $400 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school but this branch does not wish to expend this amount of money until we ascertain definitely if any expenditure will be required in connection with the sewage system. It would, therefore, be appreciated if Mr. Gov could visit this school in the near future and submit his report.\n\nActing Director.\nDetailed Cost Estimates for Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School Sewage Disposal System.\n\nJune 15, 1938.\n\n**Original Disposal Bed Rehabilitation**\n\nLevel original area - 540 cu.yds. @ 40\u00a2 (average haul 140 ft.).......................... $216.00\nTrench old area and clean out tile,\nat 6\u00a2 per ft., for 1600 ft......................... $144.00\nLevel, relay and backfill trench\nat 6\u00a2 per ft., for 1600 ft......................... $48.00\nNew pipe connection to be made at tank........... $9.00\nProvide tar paper and place on tile joints........... $3.00\n\n$420.00\n\n**Triangle Separating Original Extension Bed**\n\nLevel to grade, 125 cu.yds. @ 40\u00a2 (Average haul 140 ft.).......................... $50.00\n\n**Extension Bed**\n\nRecovering of old tile and carrying to new bed at 10\u00a2 per ft., for 1600 ft..................... $160.00\nRecovering of old distributor \"T\"m\nat 15\u00a2 per ft., for 60 ft......................... $9.00\nNew pipe connection to old distributor 1/8 bend\nat 1\u00a2 per ft., for 60 ft......................... $1.00\nLevel extension area to grade with drag scrapers 700 cu.yds. @ 40\u00a2......................... $280.00\nTrench new area and place tile\nat 6\u00a2 per foot for 1600 ft......................... $96.00\nLevel, lay and backfill trench\nat 6\u00a2 per ft., for 1600 ft......................... $96.00\nTrench and lay distributors\nat 10\u00a2 per ft., for 60 ft......................... $6.00\nProvide tar paper and place on tile joints........... $2.00\n\n$580.00\n\n**Travelling Under Tile**\n\nGravel for 1 foot deep under tile and 1 ft. wide length 2800 ft., 105 cu.yds. @ .75\u00a2................ $79.00\nExcavation in trenches at 5\u00a2 per ft., for 2800 ft......................... $84.00\nWheeling and placing gravel, average haul\n100 ft., or 105 cu.yds., @ .85\u00a2.................... $76.25\n\n$139.25\n\n**Under Drain**\n\nTrenching 4 ft. deep & 1 ft. wide\n4 ft. deep, 180 ft. long @ 10\u00a2/lin.ft........... $18.00\nGravel fill, 20 cu.yds. @ .75\u00a2.................... $15.00\nWheeling and placing @ 10\u00a2 a yd.................. $4.00\n\n$37.00\nIt is planned to rehabilitate the original bed by digging up the tile to clean them out. The area will be re-graded. Further the plan is to extend the bed to the east a length of 60 feet with 60 feet porous tile lines to in number, making a total porous tile extension of 1200 feet. This with the 1500 feet provided in the original field would make a total of 2700 feet of tile will be in place. It is proposed to lift 1500 feet of tile from the lower bed developed in December 1937, and this would leave 1200 feet in place for use with the laundry waste, if desired.\n\nIt will be advisable to place coarse gravel under and around the tile lines to the depth of one foot below grade. Further it is advisable to install end underdrains along the downhill side of the disposal field in a gravel-filled trench and connected to the lower disposal field to provide against water-logging of the entire bed due to the failure of the subgrade to effectively carry off the liquid.\n\nIn addition it will be advisable to increase the septic tank capacity and particularly to increase the siphon chamber. In the first case to improve the settlement conditions as the school population has considerably increased since the original plant was built, and in the second case to lengthen the periods between dosing flows discharged by the siphons to the disposal field.\n\nThe walls of the inspection man-hole of the original septic tank were reported caving in and it was noticed the timber was rotted and sand filtered in. New walls and covers will be necessary. An additional soil depth of one foot has been built up and a road built over the original tank so that it is advisable a reinforced concrete roof be built to replace the wooden top. The present wood top appears to be overloaded, especially when snow or ice and vehicular traffic over it is considered.\n\n| Item Description                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Disposal Bed proper                                   | $1,000.00 |\n| Gravel sub-trenching and underdrain                   | 227.00 |\n| Septic tank addition with large siphon chamber annex   | 700.00 |\n| Re-roof septic tank and rebuild manholes              | 175.00 |\n| **Total**                                             | **$2,102.00** |\n\nJ.T. Ross.\nIt was obvious the tank was not holding back sufficient of the solids, particularly paper, which tended to block up the disposal bed; the siphon chamber was too small, causing too frequent flow into the bed and the land underlying the bed was not able to absorb sufficient water to prevent water-logging and overflow.\n\nSome remedial methods were needed in the septic tank. First an attempt was made to stop some of the paper by building up a wooden partition on the weir between the main section of the tank and the siphon chamber. Two 4\" iron pipes with single elbows were inserted in the partition so that the flow to the siphon chamber came from a depth in the main tank about 3 feet from the floor at the back end. The intention was to stop paper and other light solids which must have previously flowed past the baffle and over the weir.\n\n**Present Conditions**\n\nA series of samples were taken from the siphon chamber during the year's school term and they showed little of the light particles were being discharged from the tank. An inspection was made of the tank effluent and bed on June 4th. A carefully taken sample was secured directly from the outlet pipe of the main tank. Little obnoxious odor was noticeable from this murky pailful of water and only a very limited quantity of particles, about the size of a pinhead, were observed when the pail's contents were stirred up.\n\nThe disposal bed appeared to be water-logged, particularly noticeable at the centre where the ground was soggy. Most of the rest of the bed was probably clogged up. A flow of water occurred each time the siphon operated, welled up the surface and flowed away over ground to the southeast. Some of this water was scattered over the hillside, but in wet or winter weather could reach the lake, as the hillside would then have little absorptive capacity.\n\nThe laundry waste water is carried by a separate line down past the septic tank and now flows overland on the greased slope 500 feet south from the tank. It includes kitchen-sink drainage. A man-hole on the buried section of this line exists near the southwest corner of the original disposal bed and the water flows out of it at an elevation well above the lower disposal field. In the construction of supply tile line to this bed on December, 1957, a \"T\" entry was left for connection of the laundry waste in event a grease separation tank or contact bed were built so that the effluent could be disposed of in the disposal field.\n\nTopography of the original and second disposal field was checked over and borings made. This, with test pits made at the site of the lower bed dug just before its development showed that the best absorptive area was located in the original disposal bed area and its vicinity.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School\nSewage Disposal System.\n\nThe sewage disposal system of this school consists of a septic tank with siphon chamber and a disposal bed. Owing to overloading and lack of cleaning out of the tank and disposal bed over a period of 5 years, the system ceased to operate properly.\n\nIt was found the tank contained a large accumulation of solids which took up space designed for settlement and digestive action so that passage through the tank of daily flows was unduly speeded up. The consequent passage of solids quickened the accumulation in the disposal field, which clogged up, backed up the flow and stopped intermittent operation of the siphons. Finally an outlet was established from the outer end of the disposal bed and more or less continuous flow from the tank resulted. In November, 1937, it was noticed this flow carried particles about the size and shape of tea leaves, enough to soon block any disposal tile field.\n\nIn December, 1937, a new disposal bed was built in a field at a distance of 250 feet southeast of the tank. This location was used as an alternative to cleaning and extending the original bed, which was expected to be water-logged owing to necessary continuous use of the disposal system during mid term of the school. The tank was cleaned out under difficulties of this handicap. It was observed the school sewage filled this tank and siphon chamber in 24 hours.\n\nIt was evident by the following spring that there was insufficient absorption obtained in the new disposal area; as the bed overflowed and established a discharge path directly downhill into the adjacent lake. In August, 1938, this washout was stopped by building a clay dyke around the downhill side of the bed and re-leveling the bed. An examination showed that tile had not been dispensed, but nearly one fifth of a complete line of tile was found to be filled with black muck, mostly paper, and the underlying sand appeared to have little absorptive capacity. Where the tiles were lifted out there was no sign of discoloration or silting of the adjacent sand, but a flow of tank water along the open trench filled it to about 3 or 4 inches. After slowly seeping away a thick scum was left on the sand.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School.\n\nI have your memorandum of the 24th instant with regard to the above and carrying a copy of a memorandum that you had received from the Acting Director of the Indian Affairs Branch advising that the amount of $400.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school, and requesting a report on conditions of the sewage disposal system.\n\nI may say that we have been in correspondence with Mr. Gow for some months in connection with this matter, and have received a report under cover of a letter from Mr. Gow dated the 1st instant. I am attaching hereto the report accompanying Mr. Gow's letter and prepared by Mr. Rose or Mr. Gow's office. Copy of a blueprint to accompany Mr. Rose's report is also attached.\n\nIn his covering letter Mr. Gow states that they have been very busy on work connected with his own Bureau, and so have not been able to prepare detail drawings of the extensions and alterations proposed. However, the preparation of these plans is now under way, and they will be completed as rapidly as Mr. Gow's staff activities will permit.\n\nMr. Gow states that if any work is to be carried out along the lines suggested in Mr. Rose's report, it is imperative that such work should be done during the holiday season and as soon after July 1st as possible. It will be noted that in this connection, Mr. Rose has estimated the cost of the proposed work at $3,102.00.\n\nFrom Mr. Rose's history of this sewage disposal system as well as statements of present condition and recommendation with regard to what he thinks should be done, it does not appear to us that the $400.00 available for work this year will be of much use. However, as Mr. Rose is now thoroughly familiar with the whole situation, if the Indian Affairs Branch do not wish to make an expenditure in excess of $400.00 this season, our recommendation would be that the expenditure of this amount be left to the discretion of Mr. Gow as to what work could be undertaken to the best advantage with this limited amount.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\n\nT.S. Smith\n\nEnclosure.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Rose, of Mr. Gow's office, has made an inspection of conditions at the Cecilia Jeffery Indian Reserve in regard to the sewage disposal and recommends work to be undertaken as early as possible, preferably during the holiday season, the total cost of which is $2,102.\n\nWe are advised by your memorandum of the 21st instant that $400 had been provided for repairs and improvements. If this money was to be spent in connection with the sewage disposal system and if Indian Affairs cannot provide a sufficient amount to undertake the whole work it is recommended that Mr. Gow undertake whatever is most necessary and can be accomplished with the money provided.\n\nA copy of the Chief Engineer's covering memorandum is attached with Mr. Rose's report and blueprint sketch. We shall await information from you as regards the amount of money which you can make available.\n\nDirector.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Bake Oven Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nI wish to refer to Department letter, file 129-3-5 dated May 11th, and, if possible, would like to be supplied with the following information -\n\n1. From whom the electric bake oven was purchased\n2. Price paid and to whom cheque was issued\n3. If purchased in 1929, and did the Department receive a refund in the way of an adjustment?\n\nThe reason I request the above information is in view of the fact that from information gathered I understand the original cost was $714.00 and that shortly after the oven was installed, Mr. Byers complained that it was not satisfactory and some of the company's officials visited the school and an understanding was arrived at that an adjustment would be made and then Mr. Byers would look after the oven himself. The adjustment, I understand, amounted to a refund of $142.89 and was paid by cheque number 2966. Since that time the company has changed hands and experienced a fire, in which a number of the records were destroyed and no doubt the cancelled cheque is among these records.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from the Department concerning this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to the bake oven at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school. Our files have been reviewed and it is found that Indian Agent Edwards issued voucher 4754 on October 16, 1938, for $1915.55 in favour of A.T. Pyte & Company, Kenora, Ont., covering the cost of various equipment for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school.\n\nIncluded in the above voucher was an item for 1 Model O Economy electric bake oven at a cost of $770.00.\n\nWhile all our files have been carefully reviewed we cannot find any record of receiving the refund mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Agricultural Society of Kenora in conjunction with some interested local men have succeeded in arranging for ten members of the Cain riding school of Winnipeg to come to Kenora with their horses and conduct a riding school here during the Summer months.\n\nThey have also arranged to take part in the Agricultural Fair and stage riding events. This should greatly increase public interest in our Fair.\n\nThe manager of the Winnipeg club made a request for permission to stable their horses in the old barn situated across the lake from the school and belonging to the school. We do not use this stable room during the Summer and it will be no inconvenience to the school to have them there.\n\nAs to rent I did not make any arrangements but thought as they were assuming all responsibility for the care of the horse's that we should make no charge.\n\nKindly advise me if this arrangement meets with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter from the Principal Cecilia Jeffrey School re allowing the Cain Riding School to stable their horses in the old Barn on the Cecilia Jeffrey School Property.\n\nIf this is approved I shall be glad to have the necessary Authority and to know if any charge should be made for the privilege.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nPlease arrange for the transfer to the Surveys & Engineering Branch, from Vote 164 (76 Indian Education), of the amount of $2165.00 for improvements to the sewage disposal plant at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school.\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $5400.00 was provided for the sewage disposal plant at the Fort Frances Indian residential school.

The approximate cost of fixing up a condenser and supplying a new meter with labour, etc., would be around two hundred dollars ($200.00).\n\nTrusting to hear from you at your earliest convenience,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHC/MP\n\n[Stamp] Lifetime\nKenora, Ontario,\n1st September, 1939.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter handed to me this morning by the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School re fixing up the condenser and supplying a new motor for the Kelvinator.\n\nFrom Cheyne's letter you will see an expenditure of $200.00 is necessary at the present time to put things in shape.\n\nI shall be glad to receive instructions as soon as possible as the Principal informs me they have no ice.\n\nHe has asked me to send this letter by Air Mail so as to expedite a reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nCheyne informs me that to change the entire plant as recommended by him would cost between $1700 and $2200.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 7, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the last instant with reference to the repairs required for the Kelvinator at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian residential school. The Department will allow an amount not exceeding $200.00 for repairs to the Kelvinator. It is noted in the letter of the Chasne Electric Co. that the machine has been overloaded. This should be avoided in future and, if necessary, a quantity of ice should be put up in the winter and stored for summer use.\n\nIt is expected that the school management will give every possible attention to the proper operation of the Kelvinator because in view of present conditions it will not be possible to consider changing the entire plant at the cost mentioned in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I would be pleased to know if this money is still available. In view of the correspondence in connection with the bake oven I am not, at present, prepared to recommend the money be spent for this purpose. I would, however, refer to my letter of August 23, 1938 in which I recommended 75 mattresses, size 29\" x 72\" (probably 30\" x 72\") be purchased. I have today received word from Mr. Eyre concerning this matter, jointed out that some consideration must be given. If the \u00a3400.00 is still available I would recommend that the mattresses be purchased.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.T. Hamilton\nA.T.

Mr. Byers asks that the Department pay for this. It is a question whether we should do it or the school. Instructions were given Mr. Byers that the tank should be cleaned out at least twice a year but this has not been done and the reason given is that Mr. Davidson, the engineer said it was not necessary. I asked Mr. Byers if the Department's instructions or the School engineer's should be carried out and he had nothing to say. Please let me have instructions as to this.\"\n\nIt is my opinion that the cleaning out of septic tanks should be included in the operating of an Indian Residential School and the expense, if any, borne by the school authorities. On information obtained from Mr. Gow of the Dominion Water and Power Branch, I advised Mr. Byers last spring, in the presence of the Indian Agent, that he should see that the tanks were cleaned out regularly. Apparently this work has not been done.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department would instruct Mr. Byers in this connection, sending a copy of their letter to this office.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

We wrote to the Indian Agent and he stated that to November 24 the Cheyne Electric Company had not supplied an account sufficiently detailed to permit the Agent to certify and forward it for payment.\n\nI am writing to him again today with a view to obtaining an account from the Cheyne Electric Company. Anything you can do in this regard will expedite payment of the account. The fault, as you can see, lies with the Cheyne Electric Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Please see the Cheyne Electric Company at once and obtain the proper account. You should have it certified and forward it for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The account should show the exact dates on which the men were employed.\n\nAn explanation should also be supplied for the item of $2.40 for \"Transportation to and from work\".

The Indian Agent reported that in order to have the kelvinator functioning properly immediate repairs were necessary and he was authorized to have these done by the Cheyne Electric Company who had previously repaired the machine and were familiar with conditions at the school.\n\nSince making the repairs the Cheyne Electric Company has gone into liquidation and an order has been received from them to pay the amount to the J.

Bailey,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 3, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nI have your memorandum of the 2nd instant in connection with the repairs amounting to $500.00 to the Kelvinator at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThis school is located near the town of Kenora, Ont., and has a pupilage of 145. There is a staff of 16 persons which makes a total number of 161 persons for whom food has to be provided. The school is located in an area where agricultural possibilities are limited and as a result the Principal has to buy food in a wholesale manner and consequently has to have considerable space in one refrigeration plant to keep this food from spoiling. The Kelvinator unit at the Cecilia Jeffrey School was purchased on June 1, 1939, from the Campbell Heating Company, Kenora, Ont., at a cost of $1793.00. The Kelvinator is 7 feet wide, 7 feet long and 8 feet high. Its construction is described as follows:\n\n\"Built of one thickness of \"V\" joint, one thickness of paper, 4\" of cork board, another thickness of paper and another thickness of \"V\" joint board.\"\n\nWe have reviewed our records and find that previous to the recent expenditure of $500.00 the only other expenditures for repairs were the amounts to which you refer; namely, $48.07 on July 30, 1938, and $91.35 on October 28, 1938.\n\nR.A.

This office advised the Indian Affairs Branch that, as the order was not submitted on the proper departmental form, we could not act on it but would, on receipt of properly certified vouchers, issue the cheque in payment in favour of Chayne Electric and forward it to the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company, Limited, Winnipeg. Subsequently the Indian Agent at Kenora enclosed a newspaper clipping to the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, reading to the effect that Chayne Electric had made an assignment to the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association Limited, of Toronto. No official notice of this assignment has been received in the Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, from the Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association Limited.\n\nThe Canadian Credit Men's Trust Association Limited,\n137 Wellington Street West,\nToronto, Ontario.\nWe have today received the account in question, certified that the work and repairs had been satisfactorily completed, and we have issued a cheque in the amount of $200.00 in favour of Cheyenne Electric and have forwarded same to the J.H.Ashdown Hardware Company, Limited, Winnipeg, Man.

Mines & Resources.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School phoned me up about 7 p.m. last night and informed me a bad break had occurred in the main water pipe line from the pump house to the school, and that it must be repaired immediately and that the cost for temporary repair of the line would not cost at the most more than $100.00. He also informed me that the Engineer Mr Rose and the men who were doing the work at the last repair noticed that the pipes were badly pitted.\n\nMr Eyers informs me Mr Rose said he would make a report as to the state of the pipes.\n\nThe distance from the school to the pump house is about 600 feet, and Mr Eyers estimates it would cost in the neighborhood of $200 to do the digging and put in new pipe, but I anticipate it would cost more, particularly as the ground is frozen although it is only sandy soil.\n\nThe Principal suggests we should put in a new line and leave the present one as it is.\n\nThey are getting some water at the school through the present pipe line but there is considerable leakage and it necessitates much pumping, and of course might fail at any time.\n\nSome saving might be made if no foreman was hired and the work paid for on a day basis, the Principal says he could supervise the work, and I would suggest some of the pupils might do some of the digging, although I am afraid Mr Eyers might not like me suggesting this to him.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the pipe line at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. It is practically impossible for the Department to consider making this improvement at the present time due to lack of funds. However, the matter is being brought to the attention of the Surveys & Engineering Branch with a view to having one of their engineers visit the school at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. P. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 28, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nThe following letter has just been received from Mr. Frank Edwards, Indian Agent, Kanora:\n\n\"The Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School phoned me up about 7 p.m. last night and informed me a bad break had occurred in the main water pipe line from the pump house to the school, and that it must be repaired immediately and that the cost for temporary repair of the line would not cost at the most more than $100.00. He also informed me that the Engineer Mr. Ross and the men who were doing the work at the last repair noticed that the pipes were badly pitted.\n\n\"Mr. Myers informs me Mr. Ross said he would make a report as to the state of the pipes.\n\n\"The distance from the school to the pump house is about 600 feet, and Mr. Myers estimates it would cost in the neighborhood of $1.00 a foot, to do the digging and put in new pipe, but I anticipate it would cost more, particularly as the ground is frozen although it is only sandy soil.\n\n\"The Principal suggests we should put in a new line and leave the present one as it is.\n\n\"They are getting some water at the school through the present pipe line but there is considerable leakage and it necessitates much pumping, and of course might fail at any time.\"\n\"Some saving might be made if no foreman was hired and the work paid for on a day basis, the principal says he could supervise the work, and I would suggest some of the pupils might do some of the digging; although I am afraid Mr. Byers might not like me suggesting this to him.\n\n\"I shall be glad to receive your instructions.\"\n\nThe Agent has been authorized to arrange for the temporary repairs at a cost of $100.00.\n\nYou will note from his letter that the principal of the school considers that a new pipe line at an approximate cost of $1300.00 is required. No funds are available for this purpose at the present time but if the same is absolutely necessary it is hoped that funds can be secured as soon as Parliament re-assembles. In the meantime I believe it would be advisable to have one of your engineers visit Kenora in order to make certain that a new pipe line is required and submit a report for our consideration.\n\nDirector.\"\nKenora, Ont., Feb. 29, 1960.\n\nAGENT'S REPORT FOR MONTH OF FEBRUARY 1960.\n\nA break in the water main at the Cecilia Jeffrey School was reported. This break is between the pumphouse and the school and has now been temporarily repaired. A small barrel Chlorinator has been installed at the Kenora R.C. School and although this is filling the job at the present time there will be a lot of inconvenience in the spring owing to the amount of sewage spread over the ice to a considerable distance out.\n\nFrank Edwards,\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCecilia Jeffrey School\n\nE. W. BYERS\nPRINCIPAL\n\nKENORA, ONT., March 7th 1930\n\nCapt. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe manager of the Public Grocery approached me re the securing of the basement of the old barn in order that he might feed some hogs.\n\nWe do not use this basement during the Summer and as the Government is encouraging hog production it might be doing good service to allow him to use the same.\n\nI do not think he would care to assume any rental charge as he feels it is only an experiment and is not sure how it will plan out.\n\nSo far as I am concerned I would advise letting him have the use of the basement free of charge.\n\nVery truly,\n\nE. W. Byers\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario,\nMarch 11, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed letter has been received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. You will note the Manager of the Public Grocery here, wishes to secure the basement of the old barn at the school in order to feed some hogs. The Principal says the school do not use the basement during the summer and the Principal does not think we should make any charge, as this is an experiment and as far as he is concerned would advise letting the manager of the Grocery have the use of the basement free of charge.\n\nI shall be glad to know what you think should be done in this case. I personally think that some charge should be made, however small, and that a definite time should be set on how long he has the premises, providing the Department approve. I shall be glad to receive an early reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMarch 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School with reference to allowing the Public Grocery to use the basement of the old barn at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nFrom time to time requests reach the Department from outsiders to use buildings situated on residential school property and which are not at the time required for residential school purposes. It has not been our policy to favourably consider such requests as due to present conditions it is felt that it is preferable to reserve buildings located on residential school property for the purpose of the school and thus avoid many complications that might arise if outsiders had free access to Indian residential school property. Consequently you should inform Mr. Byers that the Department is not prepared to give favourable consideration to the request of the Public Grocery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.

At present the line is working satisfactorily, but I am informed that on four or five occasions during the past three years, leaks have occurred and repairs were necessary. One repair job was necessary in the fall of 1939 and the latest in March of this year. In all instances it was found that the pipe had pitted badly and holes had formed through the pipe. As the minimum depth of the line is about 8 feet, the repair work is fairly expensive. It is reasonable to assume that the pitting is occurring throughout the entire line as the breaks have occurred at various locations and that the leakages will occur more frequently unless action is taken to replace the line.\n\nIt is recommended that the line be replaced with 4\" transite pipe. This line extends only from the pump house to the pressure tank and is entirely separate from the suction line which extends from the pump house about 350 feet into Round Lake. It is not intended to replace this suction line at this time, as there is no evidence of any leakage in it.\n\nIn 1929 the cost of this 750' water line was $1,613.00 and this was for labour and material and included no profit for the contractor. The costs for pipe and labour are now slightly lower and the estimated costs of the replacement line are as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| 750' - 4\" transite pipe, F.O.B. site | $600.00 |\n| Labour                | $750.00 |\n| **Total**             | $1,350.00 |\n\nThe pump house is in urgent need of painting and some repairs to roof are required. A sum of $50.00 should be provided for this purpose. I would suggest, therefore, that $1,500.00 be provided to cover replacement of force water main, repair pump house and to meet engineering expenses. The above estimate is based upon the assumption that the work will be done by day labour under the direction of this office.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nI would also urge that $250.00 be provided for the sewage disposal system. We desire to fence off the disposal bed, to protect the bed from natural drainage, to cover the bed with loam and plant grass seed. At present the disposal bed is being used as a playground unless fenced off, protected and provided with surface growth. It will most assuredly deteriorate rapidly and become a failure within eighteen months. Last year, $1,100.00 was provided to repair the disposal bed and septic tank. The work was carried out in the late autumn - the total expenditures being $1,704.82. At that time we gave consideration to fencing and surfacing the bed, but decided it could best be done this spring or early summer. I cannot too strongly recommend that money be made available by June 1st for finishing up this disposal bed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. D.B. Gov.\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\nApril 13, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reference to Dr. McGill's memorandum to you of February 28th last regarding the water supply line from the pump house to the school, enclosed herewith are two copies of a report received from Mr. Cow.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Cow considers that the pipe line should be replaced and that the pump house is in urgent need of painting and repairs to the roof. He also considers that in connection with the sewage system the disposal bed should be fenced, covered with loam, and planted with grass seed to protect it from natural drainage.\n\nIn accordance with Mr. Cow's recommendations it is suggested that the Indian Affairs Branch be requested to provide funds as follows:\n\nReplacement of supply line ........ $ 1,350.00\nPainting and repairing pump house... 50.00\nCompletion of sewage disposal bed... 250.00\nEngineering expenses .................. 100.00\nTotal .................................... $ 1,750.00\n\nThese estimates are based on the assumption that the work will be done by day labour under the direction of one of our engineers.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

However, the matter will be kept in mind and you will be further advised about the end of May.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nApril 16, 1940.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the Birtle and Cecilia Jeffrey Residential Schools and have discussed its contents with Mr. Hoey.\n\nIt is our intention to write immediately to the Indian Agent at Birtle and while funds are limited I feel certain that we will be able to supply the beds and mattresses that you state are required.\n\nA recent report from the Surveys & Engineering Branch indicates that an expenditure of approximately $1750.00 will be required at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School this year in order to place the water supply system and sewage disposal bed in proper condition. Our funds are so limited that I feel you will understand that in view of this very heavy expenditure it will be difficult for us to find any large amount of additional funds to expend at this school. However, unless something unforeseen occurs either Mr. Hoey or myself intend to go to Kenora about the time the new Principal arrives and at that time the school will be carefully inspected and careful consideration given to requirements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMiss J.

After consultation with Capt. Edwards and Inspector Hamilton of Winnipeg, it was decided that I should address this to your Department with a respectful request that some provision might be made to supply the materials. We should endeavour to do at least the greater part of the labour.\n\nThe entire building is in need of paint. In places the wood has or is rotting from exposure to weather. A professional painter kindly gave us his opinion on each room throughout the building. (This was entirely free of any obligation.)\n\nWe could undertake to do the entire inside, and the outside up to the 1st story windows. The eaves and windows of 2nd. storey and attic would require special scantlings, swings, slings etc., and would be too dangerous for boys. This work alone would cost over $200.00, including all materials. The eaves troughs are off entirely in three places.\n\nMr. Miller, Manager of the Linoleum Department of the Hudson's Bay Co., Winnipeg, while visiting us on holiday, went over our rooms at our request, measuring up the floors for much needed linoleum. He has taken the measurements back to Winnipeg and will work out an estimate on a special reduced rate.\n\nWe find that linoleum is essential for the following: Hospital 2 Wards 15' x 13', 1 Hall 17' x 6'.\nHospital - Cont'd.\n\n1 Dispensary 8' 6\" x 6'\n1 Sunroom 14' x 6'\n1 Bathroom 9' x 6'\n2 Staff Bathrooms 13' 6\" x 6'\n1 Staff Dining Room 16' x 13' 6\"\n(Concrete floor)\n1 Residence Kitchen 16' x 13'\n\nThe floors need \"Lionoil\" or some such preservative. We have discovered a 45 gal. drum full of a floor oil, for which a local firm will exchange us Lionoil. This drum has been here, unused, for several years and is of a low grade.\n\nA set of six steps on the Boys' side is almost on the point of collapse. They will not satisfactorily stand repair, but need to be replaced.\n\nThe boys have no lockers of any kind in their Playroom, only a common room 18' x 3' lined with rows of Hooks which are at a dangerous height. We can install individual lockers for 75 boys at a cost of under $11.00.\n\nWe are in immediate need of 70 mattresses, single hospital type bed. These are essential to replace mattresses worn entirely through the middle from end to end.\n\nWe also need for this Fall, bed sheets throughout. We require at least 215 sheets. This means 520 yds. (with app. 2\u00bd yds. to 1 sheet), of unbleached cotton sheeting 5\u00bc wide in Bolts.\n\nWe can find no copies of any requisitions for school supplies etc., for September, and Capt. Edwards has none on his files. Could you please let us know as soon as possible if any have been sent in to your office. If not, we shall fill out your requisition forms immediately.\n\nWe do hope that some representative from your office will be able to visit us early this Fall.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ont. August 19th 1940.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDpt. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to Departmental letter 129-3-5 of the 16th instant in connection with repairs at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret the letter from the Principal was not enclosed with mine of the 9th instant. However, I now enclose it. I shall be glad to have this letter returned, or a copy of it, when you have taken the information required.\n\nWith regard to the steps on the boys' side, the Principal mentions it in his letter, which covers the situation. They are in very bad shape and would not be expensive to repair. They are a danger in their present state.\n\nIt is essential that some of this work be done immediately even if it be paid from next year's appropriations; providing this procedure is possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclosure\nOttawa,\nAugust 23, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Repairs -- Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 19th instant and also copy of a letter received by you from the Principal of the above-named school attached thereto.\n\nI note that in my letter to you of August 16 I stated that the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Cecilia Jeffrey School had already been spent. It is just possible, however, that a number of minor repairs are sufficiently urgent to demand our immediate attention. I should like, personally, to do all I possibly can to encourage the new Principal.\n\nMr. Phelan will, on his way back from the United States, visit Kenora in the course of a few days. I have been wondering if you would discuss the matter personally with him and have Mr. Phelan authorize whatever repairs he may consider indispensable at this date. An attempt will be made here to secure the funds necessary from one of the other appropriations.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.

Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nAccompanied by Indian Agent Edwards, I visited this school on August 31. The new Principal - Mr. Douglas S. Pitts - met us at the school and accompanied us on inspection of the main building and the outbuildings.\n\nAlthough Mr. Pitts has only been at the school for the last month, he has effected many necessary improvements. However, it is quite evident that the former principal of this school did not make any determined effort to keep the building in a proper condition. Actually, the Cecilia Jeffrey school is a very substantial building but it certainly has not been properly looked after. For instance, one or two of the boards in the platform at the entrance to the school had broken, and instead of replacing them a piece of tin was nailed over them. This, of course, has rusted and certainly does not present a very good appearance to anyone entering the school for the first time.\n\nI am placing on the Cecilia Jeffrey file a memorandum regarding the expenditures that I authorized, in conformity with your letter to Indian Agent Edwards of August 29th.\n\nThe Survey and Engineering Branch have completed the repairs to the sewage system and it is hoped that this will not cause us any further trouble. I impressed on the Indian Agent, Mr. Edwards, and also the Principal the necessity of cleaning out the system at regular intervals each year.\n\nThe barns have been very thoroughly cleaned and I authorized the purchase of new lumber to replace the old platform in the cow stable.\n\nMr. Pitts seems very much interested and is anxious to do as much work as possible without expense to the Department. As you are aware, he has had some years' experience in an Indian residential school and is more or less familiar with conditions. I feel that the Presbyterian Church has made no mistake in engaging him and Indian Agent Edwards is anxious to co-operate with him. I believe that we can expect good results from this school in the future.\nOttawa, September 5, 1940.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRe: CECILIA JEFFREY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nI visited this school on August 30 and, accompanied by Indian Agent Edwards, inspected the main building and all the outbuildings. I had a copy of the Principal's letter dated August 9th and also a copy of Mr. Hoey's letter to Indian Agent Edwards dated August 22nd.\n\nThe following expenditures were authorized:\n\n1. Set of six steps for boys' wing.\n2. Lumber for lockers in the boys' and girls' play-rooms. The labour for this purpose is being supplied by the school management.\n3. Linoleum for infirmary section of the school.\n4. Paint to the value of $100. This will be used in the interior of the building. The outside painting will have to receive consideration next year.\n\nIn the Principal's letter of August 9 he requested linoleum for several rooms in the building. There is no doubt this is required but it will probably involve a high expenditure. The Principal had not obtained any estimate of the cost of this linoleum and I therefore requested him to obtain estimates and supply these to Indian Agent Edwards, who will forward them to us for our consideration. The Principal also requested 70 mattresses. These are certainly necessary and Indian Agent Edwards will forward information regarding their size.\n\nI intimated to the Principal that it was doubtful if we could even consider supplying the sheets that he requested.\n\nPhilip Miller\n\nChief, Training Division.\n6 September, 1940.\n\n(Miss) P.

W. Byers, and he says he does not remember anything about it, although the account came to this office from the school.\n\nIf you will refer to my letter to you dated the 13th September 1939 and departmental reply #129-3-5 of September 19th, 1939, you will see the Principal had ordered these grates, and the Superintendent of Welfare and Training authorised the expenditure.\n\nThe account should therefore be in order, except that the Principal did not send it in to this office until very late.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir,\n\nI sent you a night telegram on the 18th instant, but have received no reply up to time of writing.\n\nThe water intake to the school would not function and the Principal had to get a diver, to get at the source of the trouble, which was found to be that owing to the low water in the lake the perforated cap on the intake got plugged up with mud, and nothing would pass through it.\n\nHowever this has now been cleaned out, and I shall be glad to know if the account is approved, the school is a long way from the lake and the children and staff were kept busy hauling water to the building in pails.\n\nThe Principal also informs me he has had to get boiler number 731 electrically welded, as it started to leak all round the seams, one leak being 16 inches long. This boiler appeared alright when the boiler Inspector inspected it last month.\n\nI am asking the Inspector if he is in this vicinity soon if he will inspect it again, as the Principal is afraid it may not stand up, and may have to be replaced.\n\nWill the Department pay for the welding.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 24, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant you were advised in our letter of the same date that we would allow the amount required for the diver to inspect the water intake at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nYou may forward for our consideration the account covering the cost of electrically welding the boiler at this school. You should point out to the principal that it will not be possible to consider any further expenditures without receiving specific authority. As a result of Mr. Phelan's visit and subsequent correspondence, a great deal of extra expenditure has been approved for this school and until all the matters discussed at that time are finally settled the Department is not in a position to authorize other expenditures.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nN. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\nFIRE DEPARTMENT\n\nKENORA, ONT.\u2014September 16th 1940\n\nCaptain F. Edwards, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nTown.\n\nDear Captain Edwards:\n\nAt the request of the new Superintendent of the Cecilia Jeffery School I made an inspection of the school and premises on Friday last and as requested by yourself I am submitting a report on same to you.\n\nTwo hose reels on the top floor are empty they require each one fifty foot section of one and a half inch linen hose the same as is on the other reels in other parts of the building.\n\nNew lock arrangements for the dormitories are contemplated and I would suggest that the arrangements made will enable the pupils to make their exit promptly in case of fire and the old system of keeping the doors locked be done away with.\n\nThe door of the furnace room leading into the main building should be regular fire door as it leads into a long narrow passage way which would allow a fire to make a fierce headway whereas a good fire door would prevent this.\n\nThere should be sufficient rubber lined firehose kept on the hose reel in the hose shed to enable the employees to be able to combat a fire in any of the outside buildings or the yard; the hose should be kept connected to the hose standard at all times and all this hose should not be used for any other purpose than for fire or for an occasional test.\n\nAll the chemical extinguishers should be carefully examined each year.\n\nRespectfully submitted by\n\nChief Fire Dept.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the local Fire Chief re the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. We get the Chief to visit the school annually, and will be again visiting them during fire prevention week, when we have test drills and regular inspections.\n\nIn November 1939, the fire Chief recommended we supply two fifty ft lengths of linen hose for inside the school and 500 ft rubber lined for outside. Departmental letter #129-6-5 of December 9th 1939 informed me that the Purchasing Agent was forwarding 500 feet of rubber lined hose to the school, but no mention is made of the linen hose for inside the building.\n\nThe Chief now recommends fire doors to the furnace room; this would I agree be a great protection, in case of fire from the boiler room, but the Chief has not recommended this before and in discussing the matter with him and the Principal, I was informed that the insurance rates would be much reduced, if this door was installed. We do not carry insurance but I am told the Church does on their property.\n\nThere should be enough hose to reach to the outside buildings with what was supplied last year, I will go into this with the Principal when I next see him.\n\nHe has been very much handicapped in starting work at the School as he has not had much co-operation from the late Principal Mr. Byers who is still living in the District.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Principal now informs he can find no trace of the 500 ft of hose, presumed to have been supplied by the purchasing agent in 1939.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-415\n\nSHIP TO Mr. F.

The 500 ft for outside use should be in 50 ft lengths.\n\n2. The diameter of all hose for both inside and outside use should be 1\u00bd inch.\n\n3. Couplings are required, and should be expanding ring couplings and the number of threads 8, 16, or 32 to the inch, for both kinds of hose, as these are standard threads and will fit any standard connections.\n\n4.

Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Metal Roof over Furnace Room\n\nThis roof has been punctured in innumerable places by persons trying to remove ice and snow which have collected during the winter months.\n\nThe roof leaks so badly and has done so, for so long, that the boarding underneath has rotted.\n\nMr. Phelan may remember, on his recent visit here, that I pointed it out to him, and at that time said that we were going to raise the metal roof and place a layer of cheap roofing paper between the boards and the metal roof. However after raising the roof and inspecting beneath, we find the woodwork too far gone. I asked a builder's advice re roofing paper, and he said that he would recommend removing the metal and replacing with a good grade of roofing. He pointed out, that the cuts in the metal would only pierce the roofing paper, and make it useless also.\n\nIf you consider this latter course wise, would you authorize the expenditure in time to complete the work before winter sets in? It would require 3; to 4 rolls of roofing or approximately 350 sq. ft. It will also require replacing several boards, about 50 ft. of 6\" x 1\".\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ontario,\n9th October, 1940.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School re metal roof over furnace room.\n\nI would suggest we approve the Principal's request as the amount will be very little, and it will prevent further deterioration at least temporarily.\n\nThe total cost should not be much more than $15.00 or $20.00 for the necessary roofing and lumber.\n\nI am well aware the Department has notified us that there are no further funds available for this school, but in view of the fact that if this work is done now it will prevent further rotting of the lumber of the roof.\n\nI therefore recommend the expenditure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 18, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant the Department will allow an amount not exceeding $20.00 for purchasing the necessary roofing and lumber to repair the metal roof over the furnace room at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The diameter of all hose for both inside and outside use should be 1\u00bd inch.\n\n3.

There has been several changes on the staff. The new teacher, Mr. Candy, is an exceptional young man. His class work I found very satisfactory. He is also taking a keen interest in physical training of boys and girls.\n\nWe are considering some gymnasium equipment and would like your opinion as to the use of parallel bars, travelling rings, etc., We could get parallel bars from Harold A. Wilson Co., for about $125.00 and upwards and would like to know whether you consider this a good investment for both schools. Birtle needs equipment for woodwork and I have an estimate for this which we are willing to supply if you think the money would be well spent. The estimate is for about $30.00 plus $25.00 for material.\n\nThey also want a movie projector and a movie camera at Birtle. I understand that the 16mm projector can be secured for about $55.00 but the 16mm camera is expensive to buy and also to operate.\n\nKenora: Mr. and Mrs. Pitts are doing good work. The building has been cleaned up and a good deal of painting done which improves the appearance of the inside. We are giving them a new staff car to replace the old Packard 1926. They are asking for some chairs for the chapel - 60 - an electric washing machine for staff laundry. We are able to supply these requests because we have watched the spending of our grant so carefully.\nMr. Pitts asked that a men teacher be appointed in Miss Wilson's place and Mr. Martin Rusaw has been appointed. His inspectors' reports were very good and he is especially qualified for manual training.\n\nI saw both Mr. Smith and Captain Edwards and they seemed satisfied with conditions in the schools.\n\nThe stove at Cecilia Jeffrey School, Kenora, is in very bad condition. The lids are so worn that they fall into the fire, which is very upsetting to the cook. One oven is useless because so much heat is wasted owing to the condition of the top and it is difficult to put on meals for 150 people with such poor equipment. Would it be possible to get a new stove from the Indian Department?\n\nThe new furnishings in the residence are very nice and Mr. and Mrs. Pitts are quite comfortable.\n\nI would be glad to have a reply as soon as possible about the stove and your judgment on the gymnasium equipment.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJ. Florence Lang\nIndians Secretary.\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant with reference to your recent visit to the Birtle and Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI am very pleased to know that you found everything satisfactory at Birtle and that the new teacher gives promise of being exceptionally capable.\n\nCareful consideration has been given to your suggestion of supplying gymnasium equipment. I really doubt the advisability of doing this and would suggest that its purchase be deferred. I note that Mr. Candy is interested in the physical training of the boys and the girls and I believe that without any expenditure he could follow the syllabus of physical training issued by the Strathcona Trust. If he does this there is no doubt that beneficial results will be obtained. Besides, he could encourage more outside games. After all outside play is preferable to inside play, no matter how good your inside equipment may be. When a few months of physical training as suggested above has been given I would recommend formation of a Boy Scout group and Girl Guide group for the girls. I feel very definitely that such activities would be better for the present and would likely have more lasting value.\n\nBefore you incur the expenditure that you mention for woodwork equipment I should appreciate\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nIndian Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n279 Lytton Blvd.,\nToronto, Ont.\nyour stating more definitely what you have in mind. We have recently added to our staff a man trained in vocational work and possibly if we had more explicit information regarding what you suggest in this regard we could offer some practical suggestion for you.\n\nAt the present time I would not recommend purchase of a movie projector and movie camera. This is very expensive equipment and certain difficulties are always being encountered in endeavouring to keep it in good condition.\n\nI have noted your remarks about the stove at the Cecilia Jeffrey School and I am writing to the Agent today requesting definite information regarding the type of stove that would be necessary. If at all possible this will be secured at an early date.\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss J.

O'Connor Ray\nIndians Secretary.\nOttawa, January 11, 1941.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant, in which you refer to your visit to the Kenora and Birtle Residential Schools.\n\nIt is very gratifying to learn that you found conditions at these schools satisfactory. I was rather favourably impressed after my interview with Mr. Pitts when he called at this office a few months ago. He is a young man and has had good training and valuable experience at one of our residential schools. He should certainly do good work at Kenora.\n\nThere is little that I can add to the advice sent forward to you by Mr. Phelan in his letter of the 10th instant. In a period as critical as the present period appears to be, we are naturally anxious to keep expenditures down to the lowest possible figure, regardless of whether these expenditures are made from parliamentary appropriations or from church funds. I am convinced, from experience, that excellent work can be done in physical instruction and in the promotion of manual training, while still avoiding the necessity of expenditures on costly equipment.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a photo of a group of girls that have just completed a course in physical training at the Christie Residential School (R.C.) British Columbia. The Provincial Director of Young People's Work, Mr. Eischenhardt, in commenting upon the work accomplished at this school, in a letter to the Principal, states:\n\n\"I again commend you for the great interest you are taking in those in your charge.\"\n\nMiss J.

I am trying to have an enlargement of the picture made and have it shown here in Vancouver.\n\nThe suggestion that the pupils of the Birtle and Cecilia Jeffrey Schools might be organized into groups of Boy Scouts and Girl Guides is in my judgment well worth consideration.\n\nMay I embrace this opportunity to wish you and your associates a very happy and prosperous New Year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.

I now enclose letter from the Principal which is self explanatory.\n\nYou will note that parts for the essential repairs would cost about $97.00, and it would cost a considerable amount to have these fitted and the stove rebuilt. I discussed the matter with Mr S. Ocharheim who does this work here.

F. Edwards,  \nIndian Agent,  \nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Forced Draft Blower.\n\nDear Captain Edwards:\n\nWe use a tremendous amount of fuel to heat the School Building during the winter months. After trying both coal and wood, and on the advice of several experts, we have found that coal is cheaper. However, we are starting our third car of coal (about 130 tons in all) and find that the fuel bill is a huge part of our expenses.\n\nMost large buildings now use an automatic stoker or a blower. They find that the heat is more easily controlled, that there is less waste, and that a cheaper coal may be used.\n\nWe do not wish a stoker, because the art of building and attending a furnace fire is one branch of training for our boys. But, I do think that a forced draft under the grates will give us more actual heat per unit of coal used. At present, the heat very seldom reaches the Residence. When we are able to force the draft, it does so easily.\n\nThe Fairbanks-Morse Company Ltd., of Winnipeg has quoted us a price on a small blower, taken from an Apartment Block in Winnipeg. It was replaced by an Automatic Stoker. The price of the blower, equipped with a 1/4 H.P. Motor would be $35.00. A pressure switch to control the fan would cost an additional $11.00. These prices are f.o.b. Winnipeg, all taxes paid.\n\nWe could place the blower between the two furnaces, with a butterfly damper on each line to control the flow of air. We could then use one boiler instead of two, except in cases of emergency.\n\nThis offer (price) is only for a limited time. If the Department would consider this purchase, it would save us considerably on costs, and would also save on the possibility of repairs to the second furnace which is in rather poor condition.\nI hope that you will bring this to the attention of the Department as speedily as possible, and that they will deem it wise to grant this piece of very valuable House Equipment.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nKenora, Ontario,\n27th February, 1941\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith is a letter I have received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, requesting us to supply a second hand blower at a cost of $35.00 f.o.b.

In turn, Mr Pitts will give $50 from school funds and personal funds for the school use, i.e., feed the extra horse.\n\nI would suggest that this offer be accepted, and thank Mr Pitts for his offer.\n\nThis letter is being written before receipt of a letter from the Principal, which will be enclosed if received in time for this mail, so it is imperative that a reply be received at once, if the deal is to be concluded.\n\nA reply by air mail will be appreciated,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 15, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant regarding the old building on the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School property.

We did all this but found that two platforms had to be entirely renewed.\n\nIn the case of a platform on the west side of the building, we feel that a roof over the platform will shelter it from rain and extreme weathering. A similar shelter over the kitchen door will accomplish the same purpose.\n\nWe should like to request that the Department will authorize us to purchase the lumber required. We would be very pleased to carry out all the work. The total cost for lumber would not exceed $25.00.\n\n(2). Re: Paint for outside steps, verandas, windows etc.\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan visited the school last Fall, we pointed out to him the need for paint to preserve the woodwork.

We will do all labour required.\n\nYou mention the Eavestroughing. This is in very bad condition. But in view of the shortage of Metals (and tinmiths) during the war, and the fact that paint is needed to preserve the wood from complete decay, we would rather have more paint. I hope that the Department will accept our recommendation in this respect.\n\nMight I also say, that our need for new mattresses is becoming serious. Some of the old ones can not possibly be used another year.\n\nYours Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ontario,\n3rd June, 1941.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School requesting us to supply paint for the school.\n\nYou will note the school will supply all the labour.\n\nAs regards the overhauling, the Principal suggests this be left over for a while as the paint is more urgently needed.\n\nIf possible mattresses should be supplied as the ones at the school are in very bad condition, this in my opinion is their most pressing need.\n\nI would refer you to letter #129-3-5 of the 3rd instant to me from the Superintendent of Welfare and Training.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\n| DATE     | DESCRIPTION                  | CREDIT AMOUNT | DEBIT AMOUNT | BALANCE |\n|----------|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|---------|\n| June 5 To| 3 ps. 2 x 6 - 12 848         | 60' @ 47.00   |              | 282     |\n|          | 2 ps. 1 x 6 - 12 #2          | 12' @ 35.00   |              | 66      |\n|          | 2 ps. 1 x 4 - 12 #2          | 8' @ 52.00    |              | 42      |\n|          | 1 ps. 2 x 6 - 16 848         | 16' @ 48.00   |              | 77      |\n|          | 2 ps. 4 x 4 - 12 Fir 32'     |               |              |         |\n|          | 1 ps. 4 x 4 - 14 Fir 39'     | 51' @ 58.00   |              | 296     |\n|          | 1 ps. 2 x 6 - 14 848         | 14' @ 47.00   |              | 66      |\n|          | 1 ps. 1 x 6 - 14 #2          | 7' @ 35.00    |              | 39      |\n|          | 1 ps. 1 x 4 - 14 #2          | 5' @ 52.00    |              | 26      |\n|          | 2 ps. 2 x 4 - 14 848         | 19' @ 47.00   |              | 89      |\n|          | 100 ft. 1 x 8 #3 Shiplap     | @ 46.00       |              | 460     |\n|          | 1 Roll White Slate Rfg.      | @ 5.60        |              | 560     |\n|          | Less Discount                | 180           | 1623         | 1623    |\n|          | To                           |               |              |         |\n|          | Railings                     | 100           |              |         |\n|          | 4 Bags Cement                | @ 1.00        |              | 400     |\n|          | 8 ps. 2 x 4 - 16 848         | 85' @ 48.00   |              | 408     |\n|          | Less Discount                | 91            | 817          | 2440    |\n\nCertified Correct\n\nAuthority 129-3-5 June 3, 1941\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to...

Mr. Pitts, the Principal, is away on a vacation and will not be back until the beginning of August. However, the girls' supervisor, Miss Robertson informs me that at the present time they are badly in need of at least 94 mattresses for beds seven feet long and two feet and seven inches wide.\n\nThe question of the mattresses has been taken up several times before, and both Inspector Hamilton and Mr. Phelan were shown these mattresses and they both agreed that new ones were required.\n\nThis, in my opinion, is one of the most pressing needs of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nFR/CS.\n108-23\n\nOttawa, July 16, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received your letter of the 15th instant, regarding the mattresses for the beds at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nI note your letter states:\n\nBeds 7 ft. long and 3 ft. 7 in. wide.\n\nAre you certain that this is the correct size? It is very unusual to have beds in our schools longer than 6 ft., and the majority of them are 2 ft. or 3 ft. wide.\n\nAt the present time mattresses cost approximately $7.00, and in view of the expenditure that we have already authorized at the Cecilia Jeffrey School, it is doubtful if we will have funds to buy any large number of mattresses. However, the request will be again considered when you reply regarding the size of the mattresses required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Frank Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\nKenora, Ontario.\nJuly 18th 1941.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter 129-3-5 of the 16th instant to hand this morning.\n\nI phoned Miss Robertson, Girls' Supervisor at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, in connection with the mattresses.

We had an electrician check it. He said that there was nothing out of the ordinary except that it probably needed cleaning. Soon afterwards, it stopped and we had it fixed, thinking that it was only something that would come under \"operational expenses\".\n\nAs it was summer, we did not have it installed until the last week of August. The wiring, including the armature, burned out. We found then that the bearings were binding.\n\nThe electricians and motor experts in Winnipeg said that the motor was wearing out from heavy use.\n\nThe motor has to be entirely re-wound, (including armature,) and the bearings must be replaced.\n\nSince the children are now back and we must use the furnace for washing and for laundry, and also for heating the buildings on account of the unseasonable weather, it is absolutely essential that we have the return pump in operation immediately.\n\nBecause of its urgency, I have thought it advisable to ask the Electrician to proceed with the necessary work, keeping the price as low as possible. The total expenses will be approximately $75.00\n\nI submit this above information, along with a letter from the electrician, hoping that the Department will agree to the urgency and will see fit to authorize the payment of this account.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, requesting that we pay for repairs to the motor for return pump furnaces.\n\nThe repairs are apparently required as a result of ordinary wear and tear.\n\nUnder the circumstances the only thing the Principal could do was to have the repairs made and apply to the Department and ask if they would take care of the cost, as it is essential that the motor works for the regular heating of the school.\n\nI shall be glad to know if the Department authorizes this expenditure and if so I will have the accounts rendered in duplicate and certified to by the Principal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nKindly return Mr. Moffatt's letter.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant you may forward for payment the account of $75.00 for the repairs to the motor at the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nPlease advise the Principal that the amount appropriated for this school in the current year's appropriation is now exhausted and no further payments can be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Occasionally we have received letters from the Gasoline Tax Branch of the Dept. of Highways, Toronto, that no confirmation for these sales had been forwarded from the Dept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, at Ottawa and advising at the same time that the gasoline tax be charged. Some times we have made sales of gasoline to this Indian School, gasoline tax exempt, which have gone unnoticed by the Gasoline Tax Branch as we have not had any letter advising us to charge the tax in every case. What we would like to know is, should we allow sales to be made to the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, Gasoline Tax exempt. Also, if this Indian School is gasoline tax exempt, do we allow it on the invoice covering the sale, or do they make an application at the end of the year for a refund of the gasoline tax.\n\nWe have written both the Indian Agent at Kenora and the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, but neither of these parties have been able to help us in this matter. If you could settle this matter for us, we assure you that it would be very greatly appreciated as we should like to know the proper method of handling the sales.\n\nWe thank you in anticipation of an early reply, and for your cooperation in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCANADIAN OIL COMPANIES, LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.M./RT\n\nTORONTO \u2022 MONTREAL \u2022 MONCTON \u2022 OTTAWA \u2022 NORTH BAY \u2022 LONDON \u2022 WINNIPEG \u2022 CALGARY\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKENORA \u2022 ONTARIO\n\nNov. 7th, 1941.\n\nCapt. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOur Hot water tank has sprung a leak. It is one of about 600 gals. with a steam coil inside, through which steam from the boilers heats the water for the school.\n\nInspector Kelly evidently warned our engineer a few years ago that the boiler might go soon through corrosion.\n\nWe sought professional advice and were told of a certain flanged plug, which, it was stated would stop the leak. This may do a temporary job. We will try it to-night.\n\nHowever we are informing you of this incident because it may mean that the entire inside of the tank is corroded and weak. If it should go, 60 lbs. of hot water might be serious.\n\nAlso, our Steam dryer has developed a leak. We think that this may be in one of the tubes at the back which carry the steam (about 90lbs). However we have been unable to get a steam fitter to check this. One will do so to-morrow. If the trouble is serious, I will let you know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ontario,\n6th November, 1941.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nEnclosed please find letter received from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, informing me that the hot water tank has sprung a leak, probably through corrosion. A temporary plug has been put in, but this is only a temporary solution, as probably the tank is going all over, and in my opinion it is dangerous, and a new tank should be installed.\n\nThe Department will have all particulars of the present tank and will know the cost of a new one at this time. It is also reported the steam dryer has developed a leak; the principal will get a steam fitter to check on this and if the trouble is serious will inform us.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 31, 1941.\n\nDear S.I.F.:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the hot water tank at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. To replace the tank would probably involve an expenditure of $200.00 or more and due to present conditions it is doubtful if a new tank could be procured for several months. The Department's funds are limited and at the present time we cannot see our way clear to replacing the tank. As a matter of fact we have already expended at the Cecilia Jeffrey School this year a great deal more than we originally intended. Consequently every effort should be made to patch the tank and make it do for the coming winter.\n\nIt is noted that you are arranging for a steam filter to shock the steam dryer and it is hoped that minor repairs will keep it in running order.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. F.

Residence: 26' x 30'\n- Kitchen Wing: 30' x 34'\n- Channel over Kitchen: 60' x 26'\n- Building 3 Stories High\n- Height of each floor = 10'\n\nWe have no record of the dimensions of the Kenora Roman Catholic Indian Residential School building and there is no plan of it as the structure is on a patch-work basis, having been altered several times, both by way of addition and reduction. To obtain the correct measurements, it would be necessary to have a qualified person examine the premises locally. In any event, however, it is much smaller than Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nIf you require further particulars please advise me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH.B. McKinnon, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nDec. 15th, 1941.\n\nCapt. F. Edwards,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Boiler & Furnace.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAfter considerable delay, I have been able to get an expert boiler maker of The C.P.R. Roundhouse shops to come and look at our boilers.\n\nMr. A. Favreau, Master Boiler Maker, retired, believes that the boiler is very old and not in sound shape for repair. It could be done, but might take a lot more time than estimated because if some tubes were to be taken out others might be disturbed. His opinion is that, if we let him roll all the tubes, it will help to prolong the life of the boilers, and certainly will not do any harm. His estimate for this is \"Less than $45.00, for both boilers.\" His estimate for the replacing of seven tubes is \"at least $150.00, with no guarantee.\"\n\nThe Superintendent of The Roundhouse recommended Mr. Favreau. He has himself inspected the job, with one of his foremen. They say that none of the men still active will do the job, because they do not know how long they may have to be.\n\nIf any big job had been undertaken, it should have been done in mild weather. Now we need both boilers. The boilers are such that, even though they may leak, when a hot fire is run on, they \"take up\" or expand so as to close the leak.\n\nMy suggestion to the Department, upon the advice of several experts is:- That we have Mr. Favreau Roll the tubes.\nThat we have any small Electric welding done.\nThat if anything serious be needed next year, the Department will realize that it is an accumulation of trouble through the years.\nand that we carry on with both boilers for the cold weather.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to Departmental letter 129-3-5 of 12th ult., re repairs to boiler at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nI have taken this matter up on several occasions with the Principal of the school, and last night he handed me the enclosed letter, which explains itself.\n\nMy recommendation is that we approve Mr. A. Favreau's recommendation and have the tubes rolled, and the small amount of electric welding done; this will be the cheapest action that can be taken to keep the boilers in operation during the cold weather.\n\nThe welding would cost in the neighbourhood of $5.00 or $10.00 and should any other charges be made the school authorities will take care of this.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Edwards\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, concerning the boiler at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, you may have the tubes rolled and a small amount of electric welding done. The cost of this should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.

We had the wall plastered (patched). Once again the plaster is off in many places. I am told that the wall was completely replastered about four years ago. It had often been patched before that.\n\nWe have discussed this matter with Mr. Lindstrom of Lindstrom & Wilson Ltd. He recommends filling up the holes left from fallen plaster and then covering the wall with a preparation known as \"hard wallboard.\" This substance is very strong and water resistant.\n\nI should like to request that the Department allow us to do this work, and that the Department will pay for this \"hard-board.\" The cost will be:\n125 sq. ft. hard-board @ 10\u00a2 $12.50\nless any discount.\n\nOur men will do all work, including patching the wall plaster, and painting afterwards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nD.

Roberts, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Roberts:\n\nIn accordance with our telephone conversation of a few days ago, I am hereby forwarding to you a request for certain essential repairs and equipment.\n\nThe wash-tub in our Steam Laundry Plant has been decaying for some time. The woodwork at both ends and at the bottom has completely gone. We have been repairing it with wedges, cement, tar, etc., but this is no longer practical. We should like to request at least a new outer part for the tub or if this is not practical, a used tub of about our size was advertised for $400.00 in the last copy of the Canadian Laundryman.\n\nOur machine was manufactured by the Canadian Laundry Machinery Company, of Toronto, and is called a Globe Washer. Its serial number is 12577.\n\nWe estimate that $400.00 would cover any cost for the Washing Machine.\n\nOur old barn which was the original barn on the property when bought from Long, is still in good shape, except for the foundation on one side. This foundation has cracked along the full length, and is buckling inward. A local contractor has assured us that it ought to be fixed immediately to save the barn, and that it can be fixed by shoring up inside with timbers and building a supporting cement wall against the inward lean. We have the timber, and our men can do the work. We should like to request the amount of $100.00 to cover the cost of approximately 100 bags of cement.\n\nPaint. All buildings are in need of paint.\nJune 26th, 1942.\n\nMr. Roberts, Cont'd:\n\nSome are in danger of needing replacement soon, if not protected from the deterioration of weather. We should like to request the purchase of Outside Grey or Red paint up to $100.00 in value. This is an absolute minimum requirement for this year.\n\nIn summarising, we hereby make request for:\n\n1. Washing Machine Tub for Laundry. Approx. $400.00\n2. Cement for Old Barn $120.00\n3. Paint for Outside Buildings $100.00\n\n$600.00\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nKENORA, Ont., June 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of the 18th inst., file 129-3-5, I have discussed the question of repairs and improvements for the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School with Mr. D. B. Pitts, Principal, and attach hereto copy of his letter dated June 26th outlining the School's most urgent requirements.\n\nI am enclosing a clipping from the recent issue of the 'Canadian Laundryman' referred to in which the second-hand washing machines Mr. Pitts has in mind is advertised. The Principal informs me he has already written the owners with a view of obtaining a priority on the machine listed at $400.00.\n\nIf delivery on cement can be obtained it is recommended that the foundation repairs to the barn be carried out.\n\nAs regards the paint - either grey or red would be satisfactory - depending on which can most easily be obtained.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI was sorry to miss the conference in Ottawa but was not able to go. As soon as the report is ready, we shall be glad to have a copy and shall try to carry out any suggestions made.\n\nMr. Roy Webb, Principal of the Birtle School, had a very serious accident on January 10th. He is in the Winnipeg General Hospital but is making satisfactory progress and I think will be able to return to the School shortly. We did consider sending in an Acting Principal but as Mrs. Webb returned a week ago, and there are four men on the staff, we decided they could manage until Mr. Webb returned.\n\nThere are several matters which I would like to talk over with you and, if necessary, I could go to Ottawa later on.\n\nWe have been under great expense for railway fares for children from Mistawasis. Mr. Lockhart would go for them and take them home in the school truck but it is out of commission - tires, etc. and I would like to know if you could help us to get an order for tires. The tires of the school car are also in bad shape. We can pay for them, if we can get them.\n\nMr. Phelan promised us new mattresses for the Cecilia Jeffrey School some time ago. We have not yet received them and the ones in use would certainly not pass the health inspector.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndians Secretary.\n\nP.S. We have had several reports on the condition of some Indians in the neighborhood of Rocky Mountain House, Alberta, where we have a Church and also a hospital. These are not Treaty Indians but there are a great many children who are growing up without any schooling. Our Church people are very much concerned and are considering some work among these Indians. Would the Department consider helping in any way or is this the responsibility of the Alberta Government?\n\nWe are buying a loom for the Mistawasis Reserve out of our own supply money and hope for some good results in craft work there.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1945.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I am sorry that you were unable to attend the recent conference in Ottawa. However, I expect to be at the office steadily during the next few months and will be glad to see you at any time you visit this city.\n\nI note your remarks regarding Mr. Webb, Principal of the Birtle School, and presume from your letter that Mr. Webb will be able to return to duties within a reasonable time.\n\nI understand that reclaimed tires will be on sale almost immediately to those people falling in certain categories. These are four-ply tires and, while not as good as the same tires formerly sold and at the same time slightly more expensive, they will at least serve the purpose for the time being. I feel certain that Indian residential schools come within the category of those entitled to purchase these tires. Application should be made to the Tire National Officer of the Rubber Controller's Office which is a branch of the Department of Industries & Supply. They have representatives in various parts of the Dominion. I feel certain that there is one in Winnipeg and quite possibly closer to Birtle. The Principal of the Birtle School should make application to him for the number of tires he requires and, as stated above, I feel certain that he will be permitted to purchase them.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nIndian Affairs Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n270 Lytton Boulevard,\nToronto, Ont.\nI have discussed with Mr. Phelan your request for mattresses for the Cecilia Jeffrey School and the Indian Agent is being written today and requested to state the number and size of mattresses required.\n\nI am referring to the Branch concerned your remarks regarding the Indians in the neighbourhood of Rocky Mountain House, Alta., and you will receive a further communication regarding this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 29, 1945.\n\nMr. C. Roberts, Acting Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nThe Department understands that additional mattresses are required at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. I am not certain exactly how many mattresses we can supply at the present time, but I would appreciate your consulting the Principal and advising me as soon as possible the exact number of mattresses which are really necessary. You should also state the size of these mattresses.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nReplying to Departmental Letter of January 21st - file 129-3-5 - I have to advise the matter of mattresses at the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School has been investigated and it will be absolutely necessary to replace 50 of the old ones. 10 more are in such bad condition they will not last more than a year. Consequently, if possible, I would recommend that 60 new mattresses be obtained for this school.\n\nI do not know whether it is due to age or poor quality of the present mattresses but the filling seems to be without any fibre or length. It is more a case where filled with saw dust or shortly chopped straw. The covering is 1 1/4\" on two thicknesses of mattress ticking - with the filling piled up on both sides of him.\n\nI examined these mattresses on January 5th and suggested they experiment by making the filling level and then sewing through from cover to cover in the manner known as 'quilting' but this did not prove satisfactory. The child's weight spreads the threads and the filling works out to the edges just the same.\n\nIt is recommended that the best grade possible be purchased. From past experience I am of the opinion there is no economy in purchasing a cheap trade of this type.\n\nThe size required is 6' 0\" x 4' 0\".\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 8, 1943.\n\nMr. C. Roberts, Acting Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, recommending that 60 to 60 new mattresses be supplied to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nI have paid particular notice to the information contained in the second paragraph of your letter and I would like to know if these remarks refer to the mattresses supplied to the Cecilia Jeffrey School in August of 1941. You will recall that you forwarded voucher 10495 dated September 16, 1941, in payment of these mattresses. If these are the mattresses to which you refer the Department does not desire to purchase the same kind now. I should, therefore, appreciate hearing from you immediately.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nReference Departmental letter, file 129-3-5, dated October 1, 1942.\n\nAn enquiry has been received today from Mr. D. S. Pitts, Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, as to the possibility of raising the grant toward payment of the night watchman's wages increased to $40.00 per month - so as to be on a par with the grant authorized for the St. Mary's School.\n\nHelp of all kinds is difficult to procure at the present time and I would recommend that Mr. Pitts' request be given consideration.\n\nC. Roberts,\nActing Indian Agent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1943.\n\nMr. C.

It developed a strong leak in the gas line. We called in Mr. Cheyne, expecting only a small job, such as we have taken care of in the past, and paid out of our grand, under \"Buildings & Repairs.\"\n\nI asked Mr. Cheyne for an estimate. He would only give this after he had seen pictures of the faulty part. His estimate was for $44.00. I told him that was out of the question and sent the part into the Kelvinator Company, Winnipeg. They had the job welded, and charged us $42.50.\n\nThe part was returned but after assembling was found to be still faulty. Kelvinator of Winnipeg re-welded, without charge.\n\nMr. Cheyne reassembled the condenser for us. After considerable dissatisfaction we called him in again. This time he repaired and adjusted the line strainer.\n\nAfter considerable urging, he handed in his Bill in the present form. The amount was higher than originally expected, but probably not in excess for the skilled type of work and the number of trips involved.\n\nHowever, it was sufficiently high that I would request the Department's earnest consideration in reimbursing the school for this payment. Our cheque was A-259 of June 7th, 1943, for $42.50.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nENQ: Invoices re Kelvinator;\nArt. Cheyne, Kenora, Ont.\nSTATEMENT\n\nMay 3, 1963\nH. C.

It is a very simple, neat, and satisfactory arrangement. It is merely hooked on to our old automatic control, and to the individual pumps. If lightning or some other overload strikes the line, it merely cuts off at the magnetic switch. This replaces the former complicated Compensator box with relays etc., To reset the new system it is only necessary to press a button. The old system required an electrician from town, and these visits were becoming more and more frequent.\n\nWe sincerely hope that Ottawa will look favourably on this move because of its necessity.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe Pumping equipment - Cecilia Jeffrey\nIndian Residential School.\n\nIn reply to your 129-3-5 of the 10th and 13th\ninstant in connection with the water system at the\nCecilia Jeffrey School, enclosed please find\nstatement submitted by the Williams Hardware Co.\nLtd. of Kenora.\n\nAs this was an emergency operation, the unit\nas listed was installed on the 15th instant.

A. Hoey Co.,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRE: FURNACE GRATES\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn reply to your wire to Mr. Patterson, the boiler is a Spencer Surface Feed 36 x 24. The grates are marked 9.F.G.6 B. and are 23 inches long with 26 sections to each grate. They are shipped from Penetanguishene, Ont., via Midland.\n\nHowever these grates were shipped to us and arrived yesterday. Therefore I submit the following information:\n\nIn 1941, we had need of a few grates to replace some broken and purchased 5 grates, each 40 lbs. J 1/4 per lb. Total cost about $6.40 per grate.\n\nBecause of the type of coal available (clinker forming etc.) we have used our reserve grates, getting them welded until no longer possible to repair them.\n\nIn Sept. of this year we decided to purchase 5 more grates and placed the order with William Haws Co. of Kenora, who in turn deal with Marshall-Tello of Winnipeg. After a delay of over a month 5 grates arrived and were too long. I wrote direct to Marshall-Tello and received the following: \"In reply to your letter of Oct. 27th, we have been looking into the matter of these grates and find that the correct ones were shipped to you. All our grates are at least 4\" difference in length and as the pattern cannot vary at the factory we are under the impression that the grate supports in your boiler must have warped, as all the ones we have in stock do not vary 1/16\" in length.\" Signed F.W. Piper Manager Heating Dept.\n\nIn the meantime, and because of this, we were getting anxious. The local welder said nothing more could be done with the old grates and frustrated having the Vulcan Iron Works of Winnipeg cast us new ones, as the foundry of Kenora had recently done. If this were to be done, we felt it wise to get a complete set of ten and two spares for the other boilers, total 12 grates.\n\nOn Nov. 15th, I visited Mr. Pipher and explained that these were not the correct ones and that we had purchased some before. (He intimated then that possibly they were from the American plant and that Marshall-Tello Co. owned the Canadian Spencer)\n\nContinued.\nUp until this time, we had intended treating this Account as an ordinary School Account (as in 1941.) However from the grates received we could see that the prices had advanced to almost $12.00 per grate and since we would now need at least a set of 10 grates, the cost would be quite high for our supplementary expenses. Therefore on Nov. 23rd, we requested Estimate from Williams Edwe with a view to requesting the payment of this expense by the Department.\n\nMr. Piper still maintained that his letter of Oct. 29th, was correct, but on my insistence was going to enquire of their factory. He also knew of the urgency of receiving the grates. Therefore, without any further word to me\u2014me to whether the right size could be procured,\u2014he had the twelve grates shipped direct from the Factory. That puts me \"on the spot.\"\n\nOur Engineer has found that these are the correct grates and has already installed 7, in order that we may use this Boiler. He says that there are at least two needed in the other boiler.\n\nI regret this long letter, but hope it clears up the matter.\n\nWe have now received 12 grates (correct size) from the Spencer Fdy Co., Ltd., of Penetanguishene, Ontario.\n\nWe feel sure that the Department will understand the unusual circumstances which led up to this unusual procedure.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal,\n\nCopy:\nN.

Typhoon Pumps (Fairbanks-Morse, Canada, Ltd.)\n\nIn November we had them overhauled by Machinists at\nStone's Boat Co., Kenora.\n\nSince then, they ran for three months and then trouble\ndeveloped! Three check valves had become encrusted with a metallic\nresidue (like iron rust) from the water and had seized partly open.\nOne had become worn too badly to have reamed, and we found it necessary\nto replace it with a new swing valve. Another cheque which was not\nholding, we ground down ourselves until it now works. (On advice of J.\nBrown, Plumber.)\n\nOn Thurs., March 9th, Number two pump stopped pumping\nalthough apparently operating. We checked it and found one plunger\nwith threads stripped on both plunger nut and rod sleeve.\n\nI took both pistons in to Stone's Machine shop and was\nadvised that both were badly worn. With calipers they found that the\nrod was worn down 20/1000 of an inch in the centre. This means that\npacking & bearing will not hold. They advised getting complete new\nAssembly. I ordered these by telephone immediately, because of so\nmany experiences in the past month of being without water.\n\nAs we have already borne considerable of the cost, I hereby\nmake request that the Department will accept this amount. It will\namount to about $50.00. (Have been unable to get price exactly as yet.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nCOPY:\nMr. H. Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ont.\nOttawa,\nMarch 30, 1944.\n\nMr. H. Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, you may forward the account covering the cost of repairing the phonograph pumps at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. It is noted from the Principal's letter that the cost will not exceed $50.\n\nH.A. Hoey,\nSup't. of Welfare & Training.\nCecilia Jeffrey  \nPresbyterian Indian Residential School  \nKENORA \u2022 ONTARIO  \nMarch 14th, 1944.\n\nThe Secretary,  \nIndian Affairs Branch,  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources,  \nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn our appropriations for 1945-6, which we have sent in to be prepared with the Estimates of Mr. H. Paterson, Indian Agent, we have asked for an Electric Ironer (Mangel) for Flat-work.\n\nTo-day, our old ironer stripped its gear and wore out. Gear. It was already very badly worn, (as we showed Dr. McGill when he visited,) and the heating Element and Automatic devices were past repair.\n\nWe therefore hereby make request for an Electric Ironer. We would suggest one as illustrated in the J.H. Ashdown Edw Co. Catal. (Winnipeg, wholesale.) Page E-96-3, Voss Electric, Model 402, or any other which the department is able to procure.\n\nI have given to understand that the old Ironer was purchased when the school was built and is therefore, 15 years old.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, Ont.,\nMarch 16th, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept't of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nEnclosed please find a letter from the Principal of\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, dated March 14th,\ninstant, in which he requests the purchase of a New Electric\nIroner (Mangel) for flat work.\n\nI have seen this machine in operation, and would say\nit is past repair and of very little use as a labor saver. The\nPrincipal, Mr. D.S. Pitts has informed me this morning that he\nhas tried to get one for the machine, but has been advised that\nthey are not available.\n\nUnder the circumstances as outlined, I therefore\nrecommend you give consideration to this matter.\n\n[Signature]\nNorman Paterson\nIndian Agent.\nREPORT ON KENORA INDIAN AGENCY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY, 1944.\n\nEX'D.\n\nSchools:\nNew Hot water Tank purchased for the Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.

Thorne of the Fire-Fighter Sales & Service. I would also refer you to our conversations with the Kenora Fire Chief on this matter.\n\nWe had occasion to use three of our School Extinguishers at a recent date. We could see that one of our neighbours was fleeing from fire. We were unable to tell whether it was the house or barn. (Only thirty-five yards away.) With near our men and some six boys we hurried to the scene of the fire, taking three Quick Extinguishers. As the Kenora Fire Brigade were on the scene, we did not use these but left them in the car. Unexpectedly, the well ran dry when the fire was under control. The nearest source was the lake, 300 yards away. While the Firemen were laying line to this the fire gained headway, fanned by wind. It was here that I decided to use our extinguishers, and to considerable advantage, until the water came on again. (One of the three did not function properly having become blocked. This one had been at the fire-hall recently to be checked.)\n\nWe feel the such neighbourly action is fully justified, as we have often received neighbourly help from others, and would receive such help again, should the school face such an emergency.\n\nAs you have had considerable experience with these extinguishers, we should like to leave any recommendations to the Department with you, and possibly we can arrange to work in conjunction with St. Mary's School. However, we have had to order refills for our old extinguishers, to avoid being caught without any protection.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nNovember 8, 1943.\n\nCecelia-Jeffrey Indian Residential School\nFENORA, Ont.\n\nAttention Mr. D.S. Pitts\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nRe Fire Extinguishers\n\nRegarding your 3 fire extinguishers which I checked at the Fire Hall, I regret that it will not be possible to procure the original type Karboloy recharge with metal acid bottle. These Thermoxo extinguishers were developed about 1927 and used a chlorosulphonic acid to provide the necessary reaction to expel the Karboloy inside stream Type Charge. The acid was placed in a sealed metal container but very often corrosion from the container in acid bottle holder making it difficult to inspect the unit or ascertain its further usefulness.\n\nAn improvement was made several years ago by using a CO2 Cartridge for the expelling agent and provision was made to convert the older machines when recharges were needed. The loaded steel charge Karboloy does not deteriorate and the CO2 Cartridge should be inspected and weighed yearly. Unless it shows 10% or more loss in weight the cartridge is still efficient. In many cases this cartridge lasts several years or more making it more reliable and economical.\n\nIn making the above conversion some new parts are required for the cap, also a new type cartridge holder & cartridge. With the suggested change your extinguishers should give many years of service. Incidentally they are considered the most effective turn-over extinguisher on the market, being credited by the underwriters for A and B type fires. The complete conversion recharge sells at $11.50 F.O.B. Hamilton, Ont., and consists of Karboloy, parts for ext. Cap, Cartridge Holder and Cartridge. Allowances of $2.50 are made on returned cartridges for future refills.\n\nTrusting I have explained the matter to your satisfaction and thanking you for your refill and conversion order on which I have requested rush shipment; I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\nFyr-Fyter Sales & Service\nDistributor\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept't of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe Fire Protection, I.R.Schools.\n\nDuring my last inspection of the Indian Residential Schools on April 26th and 27th, the fire equipment was inspected and it was noted that the 2\u00bd gallon Fire Extinguishers were of the old type and several had been used and not refilled owing to the difficulty in procuring refills for this particular type.\n\nThe schools have at present the following number and type of extinguishers:\n\n- St. Mary's I.R.School:\n  - 2 Thermene Soda & Acid Old Type 2\u00bd Gal. - Filled & in use.\n  - 2 Ditto - Empty to be filled.\n\n- Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.School:\n  - 1 Guardene - New Type - Filled & in use.\n  - 3 Ditto - Empty to be filled.\n\nIt will be noted there are two Thermene Extinguishers empty. These cannot be refilled with original type of refills and can only be made serviceable by being converted to take later type of refills or recharge. This costs approximately $11.50 each, whereas a new Extinguisher of the Pyrene or Guardene type would cost around $25.75 and can be refilled for .75 cents.\n\nThere are no extinguishers in the barn or Staff House, which should have some protection, especially in the summer.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey I.R.School:\n- 7 Thermene Soda & Acid Old Type 2\u00bd Gal. - Filled & in use.\n- 3 Ditto - Empty to be filled.\n\nThree more extinguishers are required. One in the basement hallway and two in the top floor corridor.\n\nIt appears to me that these Old Type Thermene Extinguishers could be replaced, at considerable less cost, when found necessary to have present ones converted and recharged. In doing so both schools would have similar and standardized equipment.\n\nI would therefore recommend that authority be granted to purchase the following when it is found necessary, after being used, instead of converting and recharging these old type Thermene Fire Extinguishers:\n\nFor St. Mary's I.R.School:\n- 4 Pyrene Acid & Soda 2\u00bd Gal. fire extinguishers.\n- 2 Ditto - One for barn and one for Staff House.\n\nFor Cecilia Jeffrey I.R.School:\n- 7 Pyrene Acid & Soda 2\u00bd Gal. fire extinguishers.\n- 3 Ditto - One for basement hallway.\n- 2 Ditto - Two for top floor corridor.\n\nCorrespondence leading up to this inspection is herewith attached. I might also add that the Kenora Fire Chief strongly advises this change. The foregoing is submitted for your information and consideration.\n\nNorman Selwyn\nIndian Agent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMay 8, 1944\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 18-415\n\nSHIP TO Mr. D.G.

(Mentioned in Annual Estimates). The point has now been reached when we feel it necessary to make the request for a new boiler.\n\nThe present equipment consists of two Spencer surface feed boilers, purchased, we believe, when the school was built. This would make them 15 years old. Furthermore, experts whom we have asked to look them over have given their opinion that the boilers are of too small capacity. (We are told that each was intended to care for approximately 3,000 feet Radiation, making a total maximum of 6,000 feet Radiation.) From the enclosed diagram you will see that our building is rated between 7,000 and 8,000 feet. This difference is probably accounted for by the fact that formerly there was a jacket heater to take care of the Domestic Hot Water tank which is rated approximately 1,500 feet of Radiation.\n\nAll advice we have been able to get, points to the use of one boiler to take care of the whole system. We propose to retain the better of the two old boilers as a standby and for change over in mild weather.\n\nWe would like to point out that we are using about three cars of coal and about 120 cords of wood on the average each year. (During the winter 1942-43, we purchased five cars of coal). Even with such consumption, it is always difficult to properly heat all of the building. The reason for this appears to be present inefficiency of the worn out boiler, and deterioration of insulation on the boiler.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Williams Hardware Co., Ltd.,\nKemora, Ontario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Nov. 14 | To account rendered as per Vouchers attached for supplying three Guardian Extinguishers for the Cecilia Jeffray Indian Residential School - October 1944. | $11.10 |\n\nThese have now been received.\n\nVoucher No.: 76-09-513\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the services have been rendered, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The demands of the school approximate 8000 sq. ft. of radiation, of which only 7000 sq. ft. can be supplied by the boilers now in place. The pump is rated to take care of condensate produced by 8000 sq. ft. of radiation.\n\n(b) One of the boilers has been condemned by the Province of Manitoba Boiler Inspector and must be replaced.\n\n(c) Mr. Gow's report confirms the suggestion advanced by the school Principal in his letter to the Indian Affairs Branch under date of August 15th last, namely, that when a new boiler is installed to replace the condemned unit it should have a capacity to meet all needs of the school. The second old boiler which is still serviceable would be retained for use in early fall and late spring, or in case of emergency. It will be necessary to install a new condenser pump capable of servicing 8000 sq. ft. of radiation.\n\n(d) The removal and replacement of the condemned boiler will necessitate cutting an opening in the wall and roof, and replacing same after the new equipment is installed; but the whole installation will not occupy any more space than at present.\n\n(e) Mr. Gow reports considerable difficulty in obtaining tenders on the work and, to avoid further delay, has forwarded only the one tender submitted by the Vulcan Iron Works Limited. The tender submitted by this firm\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n(8)\u2014\n\nAfter the removal of the old boiler, installing a new fuel-fired Vulcan boiler of 600 sq. ft. net capacity with adequate sized condensate pump and forced draft fan. It also includes carrying out all necessary structural changes, leaving the system ready for operation, for the amount of $4125.00.\n\n(7) In his covering letter Mr. Gov advises that all heating firms in the area are very busy and states his opinion that, even if interested, such firms would quote on installing a Vulcan Iron Works boiler, and their prices would not vary to any extent.\n\nThe tender has been examined, and for the work involved the price appears reasonable. The work is considered urgent, and if the condemned boiler is to be replaced this year, we recommend the Vulcan Iron Works tender should be accepted.\n\nHowever, to cover engineering expenses and any unforeseen contingencies, we consider $4700.00 should be made available for the project.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nFire Protection\n\nat\nCecilia Jeffray Indian R.R.

School\n\n(1) Hose Connections - These are all standard and well placed, and ready for instant use.\n\n(2) Fire Escapes -\nThere are escapes constructed of iron, step fashion and grilled, on the north side of building. The approaches from the floor could be remedied by giving quicker escape exit in an emergency. This could be done at a cost of approximately $400.00 or the present escape could be replaced by a modern type covered slide type which would eliminate icing conditions in the fall and winter, making the present escapes very dangerous.\n\n(3) Fire Doors -\nA fire door is required to replace the door now in use, leading from the boiler room to the basement corridor heading to the main building. This would cost approximately $100.00.\n\n(4) Fire Alarm -\nA fire alarm system to be installed that could be heard anywhere in the building at a probable cost of $100.00, plus an auxiliary bell in case electric unit was out of order. Cost of bell and installing would probably cost $75.00.\n\n(5) Fire Extinguishers -\nThere are twelve soda and acid type fire extinguishers in building, well placed and ready for instant use.\n\n(6) Electric Wiring -\nWiring seems O.K., as no complaint or recommendations were offered.\nOttawa, December 11, 1944.\n\nMr. W.

You should bring these matters to our attention again early next April.

Fife & Co.) to see if he could do anything re insulating the old boiler, provided nothing were heard from the Department. He says that the old boiler is not worth spending anything to repair. However, if we are forced to put a very temporary covering on top and sides and attempt to stop up as much as possible of the \"air leak\" through sides and top.\n\nWhatever is to be done, it is essential to act immediately. The winter so far has been exceptionally mild. In spite of this we have already burned one car, (approx. 45 tons) of coal, I must order another today, although we had been holding off the order so as to have room for repairs etc.\n\nMay we respectfully expect a reply, with any instructions necessary, by return mail?\n\nYours sincerely, and respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nCOPY! Mr. H. Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 11, 1944.\n\nMr. W. Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School with reference to the school boiler.\n\nAbout six weeks ago we received a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, with reference to their examination of the boilers at the Cecilia Jeffrey School. In this report they recommended the installation of a new boiler and estimated the cost at $4,700.00.\n\nFunds to provide the expenditure mentioned above were not included in our current year's appropriation and consequently it was impossible for us to immediately authorize the installation of a new boiler. We have been endeavouring to secure the funds by transfer from an unspent allotment, and we are hopeful that this can be arranged in the near future. As soon as we have definite confirmation to this effect, instructions will be issued to the Surveys and Engineering branch to install the boiler.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa,\nDecember 31, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of October 26, with reference to the condition of the boilers at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. We were unable to give a decision sooner on your recommendation, due to the fact that funds were not available. However, we have now arranged for funds and an amount of $4700 is being transferred to your office.\n\nRecently we received a telegram from the principal in which he stated that he was very much worried regarding the condition of the boilers at this school and was doubtful if they would last for the current heating season. From this information it is evident that the new boiler recommended in your memorandum is extremely necessary and should be installed at the earliest possible date.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 6, 1948.\n\nMr. N. Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of the 11th ultimo and previous correspondence, with reference to the boiler for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School. The Surveys & Engineering Branch phoned me this morning and brought to my attention a fact of which we are now aware, namely, that equipment of this nature is extremely difficult to obtain at short notice. It might require several months before delivery of the boiler could be obtained. The officials of the Surveys & Engineering Branch also feel that even if the boiler could be obtained immediately its installation during the present season would be practically impossible. However, it is their intention to endeavour to secure the boiler at the earliest possible date, but it may not be installed until after the present heating season closes. I have assured the Surveys & Engineering Branch that, if the boiler can be obtained, it should be purchased and delivered to the school where it will be stored in some building until installation can be made. Our reason for doing this action taken is that we wish to pay for the boiler, at least, from the current year's appropriation.\n\nYou might inform Mr. Pitts regarding the contents of this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| Date   | Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Dec. 20 | Fireproofing Door Frame and Door at               |          |            |             |\n|        | Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School                    |          |            |             |\n|        | 1 pc. 5/8\"x3-3/8\" - 14 Spr.                      |          |            |             |\n|        | 1 pc. 5/8\"x3-3/8\" - 3 Spr.                       |          |            |             |\n|        | 2 pc. 1x4-14 Spr.                               |          |            |             |\n|        | 1 pc. 1x4-1 Spr.                                 |          |            |             |\n|        | 3 only 8\" Heavy Strap Hinges                     |          |            |             |\n|        | 1 only #5 Thumb Latch                            |          |            |             |\n|        | 2 Sheets 30x90 Galv'd Iron                      |          |            |             |\n|        | 2 lb. 1# Galv'd Nails                            |          |            |             |\n|        | Metal Trim for Casing                           |          |            |             |\n|        | Labour                                           |          |            |             |\n\nTotal: $29.85\n\nNet: $29.85\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Landstrom & Nilson Ltd.,\nContractors & Builders,\nAddress London, Ontario.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1946 | To amount rendered as per Vouchers attached for Fireproofing door frame and door at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School during the month of December 1946. | $20.00 |\n\nVoucher No.: 76-10-891.\n\nI hereby declare that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and the cash item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

He was of the opinion that if the leakage of air could be prevented and the machine cleaned up generally, there seemed to be no reason why it should not operate satisfactorily.\n\nThe hypo-chlorinator has been shipped to Messrs. Walsh and Charles, of Winnipeg, who installed it. The manufacture of this type of machine has been discontinued and spare parts for it cannot be obtained. However, they are attempting to recondition it and if after being tested it is found to operate satisfactorily it will be re-installed at the school.

The boiler at this school has given out due to leaking tubes and is definitely out of commission. The second boiler is being used and has kept this school fairly warm during the mild spells. New boiler is to be installed this summer.\n\nH. Paterson,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nI submit the following report on the Cecilia Jeffery School, inspected April 26th, 1945.\n\nThe building was clean and the dormitories tidy and well aired. There are no drinking fountains in the dormitories and I would recommend that these be installed.\n\nThe steps from the basement to the first floor on both sides of the building should be renewed. They are about worn through and unsafe.\n\nThe galvanized urinals are in bad condition and should be replaced with a two-stall vitreous china urinal. They will cost about $150.00 plus the labor for installing. These are badly needed and when installed will make it easier to keep the room fresh and clean and eliminate largely the existing offensive odor.\n\nThe chlorinator appears to be working well and with careful supervision should render efficient service.\n\nI understand a new furnace has been ordered and it is expected to arrive any time.\n\nThe roof leaks in a couple of places and should be repaired. It is a tin roof and the tin may be cracked or it may be leaking around the mail heads and troughing will be required to do the work. The gutter troughing is also badly in need of repairing. On the north side in the winter ice accumulates on the roof and when it melts and loosens from the tin it crashes to the ground and carries large pieces of the eaves troughing with it. If it is possible to do anything to prevent the accumulation of ice on the north of the roof, it should be done, because it is destructive and dangerous to anyone passing below.\n\nFolding chairs are used in the chapel and there appears\nquite a shortage. Mr. Pitts states he has had a number repaired but some were past repairing and had to be discarded. I would recommend they be supplied with forty new chairs.\n\nAfter the roof is repaired some redecorating will be needed and a quantity of paint required. A list giving the quantity and color will be submitted later.\n\nA.G.

Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\n\nIn a recent report regarding his inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School on the 26th ultimo, Inspector Hamilton states that the steps to the basement on the first floor on both sides of the building should be removed. This will probably not be an expensive job and you may make the necessary arrangements to have the work carried out.\n\nHe also writes as follows regarding the roof:\n\n\"The roof leaks in a couple of places and should be repaired. It is a tin roof and the tin may be cracked or it may be leaking around the nail heads. A tinsmith will be required to do the work. The eaves troughing is also badly in need of repairing.

If it is possible to do anything to prevent the accumulation of ice on the north of the roof it should be done because it is destructive and dangerous to anyone passing below.\"\n\nIs it possible for you to secure a quotation from some capable person regarding the cost of the work required? If so, you should submit this for our consideration.

(This old boiler will be used as \"stand-by\" while other new boiler being cleaned or repaired.)\n\n2. Insulate Hot Water Tank. Cost, John Plaxton Co., $50.00. Tank is 100T. Tons, 3FT. Diameter, holds approx 550 Gals Water. Insulation will preserve fuel. This should have been done when we installed tank (ourselves) last year.\n\n3. Insulate some pipe from boiler to hot water tank to save on \"coolage\" from boiler room to school. Cost approx $20.00\n\n4. Install three Electric Coil Heaters to replace old ones. Cost: Heater only, Approx. $50.00 (3 @ $50.00) William Hardware Co. We have had considerable electric work done on the old ones, which are apparently corroding through metal casing. Coil and short circuiting. These heaters in hot water boiler are necessary unless we are to keep large boiler going in winter to supply hot water. (After consultation with plumber, we have found that this is better than raising tank to make use of high pressure boiler.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 1, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to additional repairs required at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. With reference to the first three items, regarding insulation of the boiler, water tank and piping, do the prices quoted include both material and labour? If these prices are for material only, you should let me know the quantity of material required.\n\nI would also like to have further information in regard to the type of electric coil heater which the Principal recommends. The cost of three of these is stated to be approximately $90.00, and if you were to make purchases over $80.00, they have to be submitted to our Purchasing Branch. Therefore, we need more specific information than that supplied in Mr. Pitts' letter of the 26th ultimo.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDA TORONTO ONT 29 1011A\n\nR A HOEY\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA\n\nOFFER FROM KENORA HOTEL TO BUY BREAD OVEN IN CECILIA JEFFREY SCHOOL\n\nPLEASE WIRE INSTRUCTIONS D S PITTS KENORA\n\nJ FLORENCE LANG\nOttawa, June 29, 1945.\n\nDear Miss Lang:\n\nI have your telegram of the 29th instant, stating that the Kenora Hotel has offered to buy the oven at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School. I have reviewed our file for the past three or four years and I cannot find any mention of this oven. Presumably the school is now buying its bread and the oven is not being used, but we do not appear to have received any definite information to that effect.\n\nBefore any government property can be sold, it is necessary to refer the matter to the War Assets Corporation, and, in order to do this, we require very complete information regarding this article to be sold. I am communicating with Mr. Pitts in this regard and when his reply is received, the matter will be referred to the War Assets Corporation if the Department decides to dispose of this oven. It is possible that we could use it at some other residential school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMiss J. Florence Lang,\nRoom 800 - 100 Adelaide St.\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, June 29, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nI received, this morning, the following telegram from Miss Lang:\n\n\"Offer from Kenora Hotel to buy bread oven in Cecilia Jeffrey School. Please wire instructions D. S. Pitts, Kenora.\"\n\nA review of our files for the past few years does not indicate any information to the effect that apparently you are not making use of the oven. Presumably you are purchasing the bread used at the school.\n\nPlease let me have detailed information regarding this oven. This should include the serial number, the size of the oven, when it was purchased and its present condition. It is possible that we may wish to use it at some other residential school, but, if we decide to sell it, we will have to submit the matter to the War Assets Corporation, and, before doing so, the information requested in this letter is absolutely necessary.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D. S. Pitts,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School,\nKenora, Ont.\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter dated Ottawa June 1st in connection with the insulating of the old Spencer Boiler, Hotwater tank and piping at the above noted school.\n\nThe prices as quoted by the John Blaxton Company include both material and labour.\n\nIn reply to the second paragraph, relative to the installing of three new electric coil heaters in the hot water tank; I have to report that Mr. D.S. Litts, principal, is rechecking on the proper unit that should be installed as it is not possible to purchase the 3 watt unit at present. A further report on these units will be submitted later.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 4, 1948.\n\nMr. H. Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 27th ultimo, in regard to the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, the following expenditures are approved:\n\n1. $100.00 for material and labour to insulate Spencer Boiler;\n2. $65.00 to insulate hot water tank;\n3. $80.00 to insulate pipe from boiler and hot water tank.\n\nIt is noted from the last paragraph of your letter that further enquiries are being made with reference to the Principal's request for three electric coil heaters.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSchools:\n\nSeveral inspections have been made during past 3 months, at both Residential Schools. Schools have been found to be well conducted internally, orderly and clean. New Boiler has been installed in Cecilia Jeffrey I.R. School and the boiler house has been insulated and repainted. The old Spencer Boiler has been insulated and will be used as a standby. Water Tank has also been insulated.\n\nThe contract of plastering the boys' and girls' Dormitories and other plaster work at the Kenora R.C. II School has been completed. This has made a wonderful improvement to these dormitories, and a first class job made. Two ventilators were installed, one in each Dormitory.\n\nThe Kenora R.C. II School closed for summer vacation on the 20th June and the Cecilia Jeffrey School on the 24th to 26th June. In this Agency, where many of the parents of pupils come long distances to get their children at school closing time, it is desirable and has been the habit in the past, to have both II. Schools close on the same day. This avoids confusion among the Indian Parents or any hostility and non-co-operation.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nIndian Agent.\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKenora - Ontario\n\nJuly 31st, 1945.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelps,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRE: SALE OF BREAD OVEN,\n\nDear Mr. Phelps:\n\nWe were away on our summer vacation when your letter arrived, in response to wire from Miss Lang.\n\nThis oven is not mentioned in any correspondence on our files (depleted) and Mr. Paterson was unable to find any mention of it in the files of the Indian Agent's Office. Hence, we felt that it was probably purchased by the W.M.S. direct. However, in conversation with Miss Lang, she could not recollect the purchase from her memory.\n\nThe oven was not in use for some time before we took over the school. (At the time of your visit, sir, I thought that we had drawn the matter to your attention.) The reasons given for non-use were:\n- An unbearable odor from some gas created in oven, which made it impossible to work at oven;\n- Expense of heating by electricity; (I checked this with the Superintendent of Public Utilities of Kenora. He confirmed that the consumption of power by oven was very high, driving up our \"demand\")\n- Insulation was badly damaged by mice, and the shell of oven was originally quite thin metal with little insulation on doors, allowing for waste of heat.\n\nWe are able to purchase bread in town, by contract, for $6 per loaf, delivered daily, and wrapped if required. This is cheaper than the wholesale price and is made possible because we purchase a fairly steady amount, (predictable) and purchase it during the baker's slack season, the winter. Our second season when his busy time starts, (Summer tourist season). We feel that the extra strain on the Kitchen Staff, in addition to reasons above, makes it wiser for us to purchase bread.\n\nOVEN:\nThere is no serial plate. Apparently it has been lost. I have no information on purchase date, price, or who from whom purchased.\n\nIt is an \"ELECTRIC BREAD OVEN,\" located on fourth floor, 8th above floor.\n\nOverall measurement, including stand, and heating unit on right hand side, 1st - 2nd floor, height: 7'5\" long, and 2'4\" from front to back. The inside measurements of oven area - two ovens, each with two cupboard type doors, 2'4\" high, 3'6\" long, and 2'7\" from front to back. There are three wire trays in depth.\n\nThe heat is supplied by a three-wire circuit and is controlled by 6 switches.\n\nThe oven appears to have been used very little. The outside shell is in good shape, but very thin galvanized steel. The insulation is very poor. Mr. Gray of Hotel was only interested for summer. His offer is withdrawn now.\n\n(over please)\nIf any disposition is to be made of this oven, we feel that now is the time, because when new production is started, this one will have no value.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKENORA, ONT., AUGUST 4th, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our discussion of the icing conditions at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School, our suggestion to relieve would be to insulate the main part of the building as well as the dormitories with a three inch layer of Vermiculite Insulation.\n\nThis could be done quite easily except for the steep parts off the wall plates which are inaccessible. These we propose to neglect.\n\nWhile it would be desirable to do these as well, we do not anticipate much trouble from these because of their steep angle which means that the heat pressure against these points would not be nearly as great as in the case of the horizontal ceiling. Opening up these points to allow insulation would be a costly undertaking because of the limited working space. Also some of the structural members would have to be cut which would seem undesirable.\n\nThe above proposal may not entirely cure the icing but it would undoubtedly relieve it to a great extent, because obviously if the heat is not allowed to reach the roof boards from below, the only heat which would melt the ice would be that from the sun outside.\n\nAlso, aside from reducing the icing, most of the heat would be kept below the ceiling, and thus a considerable annual saving of fuel should be effected.\n\nOur estimated cost of this as outlined above would be Six Hundred and Sixty-Five Dollars, ($665.00).\n\nHoping the above proposal will be considered, and to have the pleasure of serving you in this matter, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nLINDBRUM & NILSON LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHM/HG\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKENORA \u2022 ONTARIO\nMarch 13, 1945.\n\nCOPY\n\nMR. W. Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRE: Danger of Ice on Roof.\n\nThe following is for your information and for the information of the Department through you.\n\nSeveral times we have pointed out this danger to yourself and any other visiting officials. We hope that some action may be taken before some serious injury is caused. The danger is passed for this year, but it seems that plans should be made to prevent a repetition this next year.\n\nThis morning, at approximately 11:15 p.m., a slide of accumulated ice was released from the roof of the school without any warning. One of our men was working at a distance of 16 feet out from the side of the building. A large chunk of ice, approx. 5 ft. x 4 ft. x 6 inches, just grazed his leg, knocking him over, but not injuring him. (The school children had just crossed this spot, returning from recess.) The chunk of ice would weigh approx. 250 - 300 lbs.\n\nThis also concerns the new eves-troughing so urgently required. The above mentioned chunk of ice tore off a piece of the eves-trough, 21 feet long.\n\nCAUSE: The condition is probably caused by the snow melting on the metal (galvanized iron-sino) roof. It appears that the snow melts from either waste internal heat or sun's heat. When the water reaches the outer and lower two feet of roof (unheated) it freezes and \"builds up\". Then, in the spring or during a thaw, this unheated roof becomes warm enough to melt and release this load.\n\nREMEDY: The experts differ. It is a difficult problem. Lindstrom & Nilson Ltd., Contractors, believe that insulation will help. Hence our requisition last year for Insulation, Value $500.00. A very strong Eves-trough, with some form of Grid to retain ice on the roof until it melts has been used on some buildings. (Another idea, which is impractical, is to put steam heating pipes under Eves.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nLenora, Ontario,\nAugust 4th, 1945.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRoof condition\nCecilia Jeffries\n\nYour letter dated August 17th, 1945, requested we secure quotations regarding the cost of insulating the roof at the above noted school. I have had the pleasure of obtaining quotations from Lindstrom & Wilson of Kenora, covering this proposed work and their opinion as to the result and definite end of the icing conditions on the roof of the school.\n\nNorman Patterson\nOttawa, 16th August, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 31st ultimo and previous correspondence regarding the Bread Oven at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, we cannot find any record of this equipment having been purchased by this department. Under these circumstances I feel it must have been purchased by the Women's Missionary Society and if there is no use for it in the school, you have every right to dispose of it in any manner you see fit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. D.E. Pitts,\nPrincipal,\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nInformation copy sent to: Mr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ont.\nOttawa, 16th August, 1945.\n\nMr. Norman Peterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant enclosing quotation received from the Lindstrom & Nilson Ltd., with regard to insulating the roof of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School.\n\nIt appears from the communications that you have forwarded that the work they propose to do will remedy the condition about which they have been complaining. It has therefore been decided to accept their tender of $665.00 and you may arrange to have them begin the work immediately. The Department will expect you to inspect the work as it proceeds and make certain that the firm carries out what they promised in their quotation of August 4th.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 24, 1945.\n\nDear Mr. Pitts:\n\nI enclose account from Crane, Limited, Ottawa, covering two-stall vitreous china urinal supplied for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.

Inspector Hamilton assured us that he knew of no way we could secure them free through the department,(i.e. by application of his department to War Assets Corporation,)\n3. Application to W.A.C. produced no results nor any prospect of any,\n\nThey were purchased immediately because:\n1. Needed immediately,\n2. W.A.C., \"inner\" phoned long distance to say that only few available and should be purchased immediately,\n3. When lake shipping closed, they did not expect to have any more.\n\nWe decided to purchase out of school funds, i.e. Grant.\nHowever a letter has been received from our Head Office, requesting that we forward the invoice to the Department, making if they will refund the money to us.

A small proportion of such work might reasonably be considered as additional to the contract, but the greater portion consists of items which should have been drawn to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch, and which if approved should have been handled as maintenance items. Funds for the contract will not be sufficient to cover these items as extras.\n\nOur Winnipeg officer who has been in charge of the work has been instructed to investigate these items and report on them to this office.\n\nMr. Buck explained to Mr. Phelan that we propose to make final payment on the contract from funds transferred for the purpose, but for extra work not covered by the contract, separate certified accounts will be submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch, for payment as maintenance items.\n\nMr. Phelan indicated that this arrangement would be satisfactory.\n\nT.

The Surveys and Engineering Branch are arranging to have separate accounts submitted to this office for this work and we have decided to pay them. However, you should inform Mr. Pitts that in future the Department will not be responsible for any expenditure at Cecilia Jeffrey School which has not been previously authorized.

It measures approximately 110 ft. long, 40 ft. wide, and the loft is about 30 ft. from floor to ceiling. On the north side of Barn, there are two runways into the loft, each built up of solid earth. At these runways, (and more especially between the two) there is a downward slope to barn foundation.\n\nThis foundation, north side has developed a long crack, extending about five feet up from floor, for the full length of main stable (horizontally), about 60 feet.\n\nThe whole building is beginning to shift away from this broken wall.\n\nThe foundation is of concrete, about 12\" thick, but is not solid nor reinforced. A rather too generous mixture of stone was added within the concrete forms.\n\nIn 1942, we asked for, and received from the Department 100 Bags of Cement to correct the above noted condition. At that time we had an Engineer a man who claimed to be fairly expert at cement work and felt that with the cement, he could correct the condition. He left our employ soon afterwards. Then labour shortages became worse. The foundation break grew larger. We were unable to secure anyone to undertake the work. In the meantime, the company selling the cement was anxious for us to remove it from their warehouse. As cement will not keep indefinitely and we had several small jobs to do around the building, We used the cement hoping to purchase enough to replace that used, when we could start on the job.\n\nThe cement used was to put a concrete floor in the Piggery, in one half of the implement shed, in our blacksmith shop, and other odd improvements about the building.\nI regret very much that due to the circumstances here mentioned, the concrete was not used for purpose it was given. However, I feel that it was impossible to carry out the first plan, and also feel that cement has been used in such a manner as to improve the property. None was wasted. We still have about 15 bags, all of which we could still use to improve the School.\n\nWe now draw to your attention the need for speedy action to prevent the collapse of the foundation Wall.\n\nI called in Mr. Geo. Kimberley, local Concrete Contractor for expert advice. His opinion is that the condition is getting worse every year and this year is at a critical stage. He advised that it should be \"shored up\" with timber to help take some of the strain off the other walls. He pointed out that the cement work was done by small amounts pouring a small amount at a time and using smooth rock for \"fill\" and also reinforcing (and even large windows etc.) without having used reinforcing. His estimate of the cost of repairing the wall would consist of:\n\n- Excavating earth from outside of Wall,\n- Shoring up floor to take strain,\n- Removing old wall entirely,\n- Building new wall.\n\nEstimated cost for above, between $200.00 and $200.00. However, his costs appear high, (as he had offered to excavate earth and assist with labour). He is not very anxious to do the job, because of other work.\n\nI hereby make the request that this matter receive consideration as soon as possible. We would recommend that Mr. Gow of the Engineering Branch in Winnipeg, be consulted and asked to make a survey. (We have already mentioned this matter to Mr. Gow, Inspector Hamilton, and Mr. N.Paterson.) We feel that this is too large a job for us to tackle under present conditions, but would be willing to assist with labour.\n\nThe barn is valuable to the school as a storage for hay, shelter for cattle, and temporary quarters for teams. The rest of the building is in fairly good condition. The shingles were replaced a few years ago. (However the floor needs re-planking.)\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nCOPIES:\nA.G.Hamilton, Inspector, Winnipeg,\nD.B.Gow, Dist.

G. Pitts, Principal of the above-mentioned Residential School. There is a barn on the school property, measuring approximately 110 ft. by 40 ft., by 30 ft.\n\nThe foundation on the north side of the building has developed a long crack extending about 5 ft. from the floor for the full length of the stable, about 60 ft.\n\nMr. George Kimberley, a local contractor, states that the following repairs are necessary:\n\n(a) Excavating earth from outside of wall;\n(b) \"Cheering up\" floor to take strain;\n(c) Removing old wall entirely;\n(d) Building new wall.\n\nHe has offered to do the work for an amount not exceeding $1,200.00. The Principal considers that this offer is high, as the school management is prepared to excavate the earth free of charge and provide other labour assistance.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would arrange to have one of your officials visit this school and submit a report regarding what is actually required and at the same time give an estimate of the cost. Then we have this information we will be able to make a decision regarding the repairs before spring.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nThe floor in the children's dining room is made from a bulk asphalt mixture. It is continually being scrubbed and yet never appears clean. The appearance is depressing and the work of scrubbing the large area constantly is altogether too much hard work for the girls. I would recommend it be covered with AA battleship linoleum. New steps are being installed from the first floor to the basement on both the boys and girls side of the building. These stairs could also be covered with linoleum. These stairs are constantly in use and difficult to keep clean. The covering will lighten the work and increase the life of the stair treads. I would recommend that two rolls of AA battleship linoleum be supplied. The rolls are 6' wide and contain 60 sq. yards.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, February 8, 1966\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa.\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nGuelin Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 74\n\nSHIP TO\n\nRev.

Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKEMORA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nWith reference to your letter of September 29th, 1945, when you forwarded through your office the accounts from the above noted Company for payment on repairs to the pumps at C.J. School.\n\nThere was some further correspondence when the Department requested more information on hourly rate of wages, etc., and the Fairbanks - Morse Co. sent a further invoice for wages not included on first invoice.\n\nAs previously mentioned to you, the Company has on several occasions reminded me of their outstanding account. I have written to reassure them that the Department at Ottawa had the matter in hand and would take care of it. (Another account of about the same time was settled promptly).\n\nWe are, however, on behalf of the Company, requesting that you will seek to find out from the Department in Ottawa why the delay in payment. If the delay is caused by any misunderstanding on our part, we would seek to rectify it immediately, as we do feel that the Company is being penalized by non-payment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned) D.S.

This work was done on June 8th, 9th, 10th and part of 11th.\n\nRegarding the second paragraph of your letter requesting five copies of invoice for a previous pump repair made last December, amount $67.64, we are pleased to obtain same hereto. What appears to be the labour charge here which reads \"Remove and replace 2 lining and reball bearing connecting rod and weld areas needed\" is such that was actually done by an outside shop for which we were billed. A careful examination of our chart reveals that we omitted to include our own labour charges for this job which amount to 3\u00bd hours at $1.50 per hour, total $5.25. Our invoice in triplicate is attached.\n\nThe work was done by one man December 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th, 1944.\n\nWe trust this is the information desired, and that it will enable you to pass our invoices for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Can Dime F.

Three drinking fountains have been installed. The general health of the pupils has been very good. Several new pupils were admitted.\n\nW. Paterson,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Report of A. B. Berry, Director, Sanitary Engineering Division, Ontario Department of Health, dated February 16, 1946, re his inspection of Water Supply at Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nThe water supply at this school was also inspected on February 16th, 1946.\n\nAt the time of the inspection, no chlorine was reaching the water supply. This was probably due to the presence of sediment in the rubber hose and in the bubble jar. It is recommended that these be thoroughly cleaned. A considerable amount of trouble is being encountered at this institution in controlling the chlorine feed as, on the previous day, an excess of chlorine was being added to the water. The chlorinator is a suction type Wilson hypochlorinator.\nOttawa, April 30, 1946.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKawartha, Ontario.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. A. B.

It was an old structure which had evidently deteriorated considerably since that time. It shelters no live stock but is used for the storing of hay grown on adjacent rented farms and has no buildings.\n\nThe barn appears to have been set in a side hill cut, and the concrete lower walls, not having been designed as retaining walls, and having no reinforcement, have been unable to withstand earth pressures and are badly fractured. Movements caused by these fractures have tilted the superstructure to the extent that it might collapse during a bad storm.\n\nTo put the building in a safe and useful condition would involve extensive operations including the removal of the earthen banks, jacking up the superstructure, removing the fill behind most of the separate walls, lowering the superstructure into position with the attendant bracing and straightening that would be required. Mr. Gow estimates these operations would cost at least $2000.\n\nSince the building is only used for hay storage, Mr. Gow suggests the alternative of removing the earthen banks on three sides of the building to the level of the former stable floor, demolishing the lower concrete walls, and raising the superstructure to the former stable floor level. Attention on this alternative would be bracing and straightening operations. The cost of this alternative is estimated by Mr. Gow to be approximately $1500.\n\nMr. Gow states that in his opinion expenditures ranging from $1500 to $2000 are not justified, and recommends that the old building should be demolished, salvaging any material that appears to have any value. We concur in this recommendation.\n\nIt appears however that the school principal maintains some provision must be made for the storage of hay. Mr. Gow advises that in the event that Indian Affairs should decide to use the alternative of lowering the superstructure to the former stable level, he will contact Kenora firms and obtain confirmation of his estimate. He will also obtain prices for complete demolition. These prices are to be forwarded here for consideration when received.\n\nIt is our opinion that the building has outlived its usefulness, and does not merit any expenditure. If hay storage in a building is required, a new hay barn should be provided.\n\n(Sgd.) T. S. Mills,\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M.

Just how we cannot say. Possibly he will have to offer his regular employees a much increased rate of pay for the days they are engaged on such work or a relatively high rate to men from an outside source to induce them to undertake it. In any event, it is obvious that no sewage disposal system of this type will function satisfactorily for an extended time without periodical cleaning of the septic tank.\n\nDirector.\nMay 18, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal, Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario.\n\nThe following report has been received from Mr. Gow in connection with the above matter under date of May 6th:\n\n\"Recently I examined the site of the sewage disposal bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario. There has been overflow from the disposal bed for two or three years past and at the present time it is probable that none of the effluent from the septic tank is being absorbed through the tile distribution system. Some few months ago the Principal had a number of tile removed from a section of the bed where the liquid was being freely discharged to the surface and a sump 6 feet deep was dug at this point and partially filled with stone. For while this sump took care of the overflow from the bed but now there is considerable overflow from the sump. An examination of the tile removed shows them to be completely filled with solid matter and an examination of the solid matter shows it to be solids from the septic tank.\n\n\"The Principal of the School advises that the septic tank has been cleaned out only once or twice since he arrived there six years ago. In this connection he explains that it has been impossible to get men to do such work. They threaten to quit his employ rather than do such work and it has not been possible to get men from an outside source to do such work either. Such being the case it is not surprising that the distribution tile in the bed is not now functioning.\n\n\"Upon looking through our file, it is noted that there has been considerable correspondence with your office in connection with the sewage disposal system at this school and also that a considerable amount of money has been expended in connection with the same. The site of the disposal bed is now fenced off; it is not immediately by the tile and there has been sufficient attention paid to the bed to permit of a very good growth of grass; there has been no neglect in this respect. The bed was relaid in 1935 and at the present time is wholly ineffective. I do not see any alternative to the relaying of the tile during the coming vacation period and the matter is now being brought to your attention.\"\n\nThe matter of sewage disposal for this school came up in 1937 and again in 1939 when an extension to the old 1926 installation was made. The proposed work received serious consideration in 1939 before the extension was carried out.\n\nWe have asked Mr. Gow for an estimate of cost of his present proposals. Sprinkler treatment of the tank effluent was considered in 1939 but not adopted.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nChief Engineer.\"\nJuly 26, 1966.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal - Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario\n\nFurther to our memorandum of May 18th and with reference to the verbal request of Mr. Prouder we are now in receipt of a further report from Mr. Gow respecting the above matter. This report, dated July 23rd reads as follows:\n\n\"We have for attention your letter of July 6th in connection with the above mentioned subject and asking for an estimate of the cost of reconstruction of the disposal bed.\n\n\"Our letter of May 6th outlined the situation with respect to the condition of the tile bed and the septic tank. We appreciate the position of the Principal of the school with respect to the cleaning out of the septic tank, but unless a septic tank is cleaned of solid matter at least twice yearly, a disposal bed will rapidly become ineffective.\n\n\"The leakage from the disposal bed is disagreeable and offensive, but it disappears in the land before reaching Round Lake, the source of the water supply, and thus does not contaminate the water supply or cause annoyance or damage to other than the school property and management. We realize that it would be difficult to get labor to dig up, clean and replace the tile and unless some definite action is taken to clean the septic tank frequently replacement of the bed will only be a very temporary improvement. We suggest that conditions be allowed to rest for another year in the hope that the labor situation will improve.\"\n\nWe are in agreement with Mr. Gow that the work of cleaning the tile would only result in a very temporary improvement in the situation if the cleaning of solids out of the septic tank continues to be neglected.\n\nAs there appears to be a shortage of labour we must concur in Mr. Gow's recommendation to postpone action for another year in regard to the replacement or cleaning of the tile and disposal bed but suggest that Indian Affairs arrange for the cleaning of the septic tank as soon as possible. After the solids have been removed from the tank flushing of the disposal system with clean water might put it into shape for satisfactory operation until next year.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nOttawa, August 6, 1946.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent, Kenora, Ontario,\n\nI have just received a lengthy report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch regarding the sewage disposal system at the Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School. For the information of the Principal and yourself I quote the following from the report of the Surveys and Engineering Branch:\n\n\"From Mr. Gow's report, which Mr. Mills' quotes, it does not appear that it is likely that labour can be secured this year to improve the situation with respect to the condition of the septic tank, tile distribution system and disposal bed but that the installation will probably function after a fashion although not very satisfactorily for another year.\n\nIt seems clear that this problem has its origin in failure to clean out the system particularly the septic tank once or twice a year and that had this been done regularly, probably no problem would have arisen.\n\nThis is a matter which the School Principal will have to deal with in the future.

Paterson, Indian Agent\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: SEPTIC TANK & DISPOSAL BED.\n\nFILE: 129-3-5 (W1) of Aug. 6, 1946.\n\nAfter considerable trouble in locating anyone who would tackle this job of cleaning septic tank, I located Chan. Ratchford, Kenora. (Kenora's sewage men would not touch it.) His letter covering this subject is attached (copy).\n\nSix years ago, while we were cleaning this septic tank, the health inspector from Toronto, (checking Chlorine system in drinking water,) watched our men working. He said that we were doing the wrong thing\u2014that we should not touch the septic tank as this would disturb the bacterial action.\n\nTo prevent any \"foreign matter\" from entering the tank (that is other than sewage, and which would not deteriorate with normal bacterial action,) we have a screen before entrance to tank. We clean this once each week while school is in session.\n\nAs noted in your letter, it is practically impossible to get men to do this work. When asked our own men to do it, even with a considerable bonus, they told me they would quit first.\n\nDr. Ferguson, Health Officer and our own doctor, and I have often examined the disposal bed. It has always been our opinion that the tiles were bound to fill up with silt in a bed of such fine sand. There should have been coarse gravel, for example, around tiles.\n\nI feel that some further investigation of this matter should be made, possibly by some independent sanitary engineer. The Septic tank appears to be operating O.K., it is the disposal field which is at fault.\n\nAtt'd Copy, N. Ratchford.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCOPY: N. Paterson.\nChas.

Pitts\nCecilia Jeffrey School\nKENORA, Ontario,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have examined the sewage disposal plant at your school.\n\nRegarding your proposal to pump out and clean the septic tank, this can be done. The cost, including a power pump and tank work, would be around $150.00. However, this proposed cleaning of the tank would not get any place, as your trouble is not in the tank but in the disposal field. This field, as you can see by the cemetiles that have been taken up, are full, not of sludge or anything that has gone through the septic tank, but of fine sand of which the field where the tile bed lies is made up. The above conditions will not allow the siphons in the tanks to operate. Then of course you have no septic tank, or no sewage disposal plant. What you would have to do is introduce some wider drainage in your present location. This will give seepage tile, bring in some good clean gravel and make a new disposal field. If this work is done as it should be, you will have no more sewage troubles. If you try to get by with tank cleaning, flushing or other repairs, I would say you are just looking for trouble. To do this job as it should be done would cost around $2,500.00. As the summer season is now well on its way, you should have to make a start very soon to have the work done before freeze-up.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nSIGNED\n\nChas.

No response having been received in the interval, we again wrote Mr. Gow on August 13th on the matter.\n\nWe are now in receipt of a report from Mr. Gow in which he confirms the damage of eavestroughing by the action of heavy ice formations in the winter. He states that in his opinion ice formations will continue to cause damage to any eavestroughing that may be erected. This, of course, is an obvious statement of fact.\n\nMr. Gow reports also that the woodwork of the eaves should be painted before eavestroughing is reinstalled. He further reports however, that no local firms in Timora are willing to undertake the work or estimate on the cost. A Winnipeg firm whom Mr. Gow approached also has stated that it is impossible for any sheet metal contractor to secure metal for the manufacture of troughing, consequently it will be necessary to defer further action for the present.\n\nMr. Gow advises that no apparent damage to the building is resulting from the absence of eavestroughing.\n\nT.

We have noted the report by Mr. Pitts, Principal of the School, and also the letter of Mr. Charles Batchford outlining his viewpoint.\n\nUnder date of February 13, 1938, a member of your staff furnished you with a summary of the history of the sewage disposal system at this school up to that date. Upon being supplied with a copy of this summary, we wrote you under date of March 16, 1938 with respect to the matter. Since that time considerable money has been spent on the project and the correspondence file will reveal that the operation of the system has not been very successful. The file shows that late in 1938 this building had the septic tank thoroughly cleaned and enlarged, while the disposal bed was dug up, leveled off, the tile laid and the bed considerably enlarged. Some 30 tons of gravel were used in providing under-drainage for the tile and all tile joints were covered with tar paper. The rebuilding of the disposal bed was carefully undertaken and carried out in a very efficient manner. In the following year the whole area was fenced off and the top surface intermixed with black soil hauled to the site so as to provide a better mixture for the growth of grass. However, Mr. Pitts writes under date of August 16, 1946 that six years previously, or in 1940 when cleaning the septic tank, a Health Inspector advised against such cleaning and it is our understanding that this septic tank has not been cleaned out since that date. The position of the Principal of the School can quite readily be appreciated as Mr. Pitts has earnestly endeavored to have the tank cleaned out periodically but he was never supplied with any sludge pump or tank that would have rendered the work less objectionable. However, no disposal bed will indefinitely absorb solid matter without being completely plugged. The writer and other engineers from this office have made several examinations of plugged tiles removed from the disposal bed during the past year and they contained mostly solids passed on from the septic tank. I think it can be confidently stated that the rehabilitation of the sewage disposal system was efficiently carried out late in 1938 and early in 1940 and it is unfortunate that the war prevented proper attention being given to measures considered necessary to ensure proper operation of the sewage disposal system.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\"\nThe situation at the school now is that both septic tank and disposal bed are plugged and as Mr. Batchford pointed out, cleaning of the tank will not overcome the difficulty. The disposal bed must be relaid. Last week, I had our Resident Engineer, Mr. Galloway at Keewatin, visit the school, with reference to reported further difficulty being experienced in connection with the sewage disposal system. The following is quoted from Mr. Galloway's report:\n\n\"The sewage backed up from the disposal bed into the siphon manhole boxes, the manhole boxes of the septic tank, screen boxes and back into the drain hole of the basement under that part of the building in which the Principal resides. About 80 feet or so from the siphon boxes, Mr. Pitts dug a ditch in the disposal bed down to the tile, then broke the tile allowing the sewage in the ditch to release itself back to normal conditions. The ditch is now full of sewage water and running over like a spring on top of the disposal bed from where the tile was broken. Mr. Pitts is of the opinion that the tile system in the disposal bed is plugged with fine sand of which the bed is made up and is afraid that it will freeze up during the cold weather this winter.\"\n\nWith reference to the letter of Mr. Charles Batchford, I might say that I do not believe he professes to be an authority on the construction of disposal beds and insofar as our records show, he was never engaged on any work under our direction and so is not familiar with the method of construction used in the existing disposal bed. The above statement is not to be construed as any criticism of Mr. Batchford who I believe is quite an efficient and successful plumbing and heating contractor.\n\nAs for the statement of the Principal of the School, Mr. Pitts, I might say that he was not Principal at this Institution when the existing disposal bed was constructed and accordingly is not necessarily fully informed as to its construction. He became Principal in 1940 and co-operated whole-heartedly with our Bureau in the fencing and seeding to grass of the area used in construction of the disposal bed. In connection with his suggestion that the matter of sewage disposal at the school should be investigated by some independent Sanitary Engineer, I can only say that we would welcome any such move.\n\nIt would appear that Mr. Gow is correct in his statement that the disposal bed must be relaid and while we hoped by cleaning the tank and flushing the tile to postpone this work till next year, it would now seem necessary to relay the disposal bed at once, if the necessary material and labour can be obtained.\n\nIt should be remembered that a new disposal field alone will not necessarily solve the difficulties, as if the septic tank is allowed to fill up with sludge, thus leaving no room in the tank for septic action, the unsatisfactory condition of the disposal field is apt to occur once again.\n\nChief Engineer,\nNovember 6th, 1946.\n\nTo: SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM, OCEILLA JEFFREY\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - RENORLA, ONTARIO.\n\nFurther to our memorandum of October 6th, we are now in receipt of additional information regarding the above from Mr. Cox, under date of October 25th, as follows:\n\n\"This will acknowledge receipt of your letter of Oct. 25th with reference to the above mentioned subject and asking for certain data with respect to the needs of the school as regards water supply and also our suggestions as to the replacement of the present sewage disposal system.\n\nSince the receipt of your communication, we have had a visit from Dr. Pitts, the Principal of the school, and he exhibited the recent trouble experienced with the sewage backing up from the bed into the septic tank and then into the basement of the school. This backing up was released by breaking of the main distribution line of the diamond bed so that new the effluent from the tank would flow freely over the ground and disappear before reaching Round Lake, the source of the water supply. Dr. Pitts fears that with cold weather the ground will freeze and cause considerable flooding of the area in the vicinity of the diamond bed. However, he is of the opinion that even without the present winter with the present system provided, the anticipated freezing does not occur. The writer seconded the impression of Dr. Pitts that I visited the institution before freeze-up, however the situation and underscored to have some protection provided in the nature of straw or hay covering in order to prevent freezing.\n\n\"It is our intention to supply you with full details and drawings of the present septic tank as constructed, the separate lavatory drain and details of the existing disposal bed. We will at the same time outline the proposals for the reconstruction of the bed, presumably upon its present location, and will endeavor to give an estimate of cost within which the work could be carried out.\n\n\"Upon the occasion of his visit to the school, Mr. Pitts said that the daily use of water at the Institution should average 30,000 gal. per day. This estimate is based upon the operation of the pumps supplying the water, and in my opinion, such a use of water appears to be unusual in connection with an Indian School and can be partially explained by the obsolete system of toilets installed in the school. In any event, such a quantity of water is a heavy load on any sewage disposal system and must either be provided for or the use of water curtailed.\n\nIt will thus be seen that the Principal of the school and Mr. Cox are trying to provide protection for the system so that renewal can be deferred until next year. It is most probably too late now to be in renewal operation during the present year and so we must hope that Dr. Cox will be able to utilize a procedure during his projected visit to the school for a short period.\n\nWe have requested Mr. Cox to investigate conditions so that full information should be available when renewal of the disposal system is finally undertaken.\n\nJ.

They say that\nwe should have had authority from the department and these purchases\nshould have come from the department.\n\nThe furniture was necessary to bring up to normal\nrequirements some of the Staff Rooms and also to take care of\nfurnishing a new room for the new Manual Training teacher, Mr.\nMcGill.\n\nThe paint was for general repairs both inside and out,\nand also for use in the Manual Training Shop.\n\nWe have not bought furniture etc., for many years and our\nStaff rooms are needing some replacements. All of above was essential.\nNow, you have to refer to Staff more than in past. Costs are up,\nand furniture difficult to secure.\n\nI do realise that these should have been purchased by\nauthority. However they were needed at once, and we managed to secure\nthem through the kindness of Eaton's. I respectfully request\nOn the request of our Church Board, may I request now\na special grant to cover the above amounts?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nCOPY TO:- Mr. H.

Truck.\n\nSince receipt of your prompt wire offering us a 50% Grant in aid of purchase of Truck, and letter covering the same, several developments took place.\n\n(1) War Assets wired us to cancel their offer for Chevy Truck as quoted to you in my letter, since it had already been sold. They offered instead a heavier, less suitable truck (Dodge, dual wheels.)\n\n(2) By the time we forwarded your offer to our W.A.C., and then altered the whole picture with the new offer from W.A.C., we found that our own W.I.S. are very short of funds. They tell us that we are already over our limit for Equipment etc. Therefore there is no likelihood of their giving us anything from the Grant.\n\n(3) Therefore, regretfully, we shall have to drop this project for the present. I am particularly sorry after all your recent efforts in our behalf with W.A.C.\n\n(If there had been any way that I could have personally bought the 1943 Jeep for $340, you can be sure that I would have done so.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Price | Amount |\n|----------------------------------|----------|-------|--------|\n| Slick                            |          | 4.30  | 8.60   |\n| Endurance House Paint            |          |       |        |\n| 726 Outside White                | 8        | 3.75  | 30.00  |\n| 729 Inside Gloss White           | 8        | 1.02  | 8.16   |\n| Ripolin R.L.T.

Phelan,\nChief, Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nRE: SPORTS EQUIPMENT.\n\nYou may remember, during my visit to the Department at Ottawa during the month of July last year, the above matter was among the various things discussed.\n\nAt that time I mentioned the need of Hockey Equipment for the boys in these northern schools. At that time you told me to go ahead and make a purchase of some Hockey Sticks for the boys, not to exceed the sum of $100.00 and to send the Bill to you,\u2014direct to your office.\n\nI am therefore taking advantage of this, and am sending you four copies of the Invoice for these Hockey Sticks.\n\nWe are at present in the midst of our league playoffs. Our boys were undefeated during the Schedule, and if successful in the championship, expect to go to Winnipeg to play the city Champions there.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nExtract from letter from A.G. Hamilton, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba, dated March 7th, 1947. Original on file 129-3-1.\n\n---\n\nThe wall is lathed and plastered and the plaster has been broken in many places by the movement of chairs and benches. Mr. Pitts has requested 15 pieces of 4 x 10 \"hard board\" (not lather board) which is sufficient to cover a four foot strip all around the room. If supplied I understand Mr. Pitts will have it applied and if available I recommend the purchase.\n\nThe Kelvinator ice box needs an entire overhauling. I consider the equipment in poor condition and delay will only bring added expenses.\n\nThe floor in the cullery needs resurfacing. It is broken in several places and difficult to keep clean. The cullery sink and drain boards are badly rotted and should be replaced with a new unit. I trust the above recommendations will receive favourable consideration.\n\nThe high pressure boiler is located in the laundry and I understand is looked after by the laundry Matron. Thus, I would consider the engineers work. The engineer holds no papers for operating a steam boiler so he is merely a fireman for the low pressure boiler. The machinery and boilers are all government property and I believe it would be good business to assist in paying the salaries to all schools who will employ qualified engineers. The men should at least hold 3rd class papers.\nThe girls playroom is in the basement. The floor is cement, covered with black Mulsomastic finish which is difficult to keep clean and which, with all the scrubbing, appears dirty. I would require 1300 sq. ft. of Double \"A\" Battleship Linoleum to cover this floor and I know of no better covering to relieve a lot of hard labor. The Double \"A\" quality Brown Battleship Linoleum comes in rolls 6 feet wide and 30 yards long. It will require 25 rolls to cover the playroom and the hall leading to the room. I recommend that it be supplied.\n\nMr. Pitts is well pleased with the new low pressure boiler and reports no difficulty experienced in heating the building in spite of the extreme cold weather.\nOttawa, March 24th, 1947.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Indian Agent,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nReporting on his inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School on March 7th, Inspector Hamilton recommends that fifteen pieces of 4 x 10 \"hard board\" (not plaster board) be supplied to the school. Please arrange for the purchase and delivery of this.\n\nMr. Hamilton also reports that the scullery floor should be resurfaced and that the Kelvinator requires overhauling. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of these repairs.\n\nMr. Hamilton states that the high pressure boiler in the laundry is operated by the laundry matron. This appears unusual. Why is the engineer unable to operate this boiler?\n\nBernard F.

Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nI have had Mr. T. Crowley go over the suggested work of putting Hard Board around Children's Dining Room. (The contractors, Lindstrom & Wilson are too busy.) I shall forward the estimate of materials from Lindstrom & Wilson with the estimate of labour from Mr. Crowley just as soon as they are received.\n\nHARD BOARD.\n\nM. Olson of Refrigeration & Repair was called to replace a leak in one of the pipes containing gas on the refrigerator yesterday morning. He is to forward an estimate in triplicate on the cost of this immediately. (I would refer you to our letter to you of Aug. 3rd, 1946). This was also included in our Estimates for 1947-48.\n\nREFRIGERATOR.\n\nI would like to see this floor covered with a good grade Battleship Linoleum. The floor would have to be leveled first, and then waterproof linoleum could be used. This method has proved satisfactory in the cement which we used under linoleum at doors of scullery. We would like to recommend this linoleum. Replacing the old mulsomastic would only result in the same condition.\n\nNo mention was made by Mr. Hamilton of the condition of the Dishwashing Unit in the Scullery, although he noted that it was worn out. The Dietician who visited reported that this Unit needed to be replaced. Also recommended was a Potato Peeler.\n\nHIGH PRESSURE BOILER IN LAUNDRY.\n\nWe have drawn this to the attention of every visiting official. The Boiler Inspector notes it on each Inspection. The engineer does attend to the cleaning and maintenance of boiler, but sundry Matron fires it herself.\nMr. J. Paterson,\n\nRe letter from Col. Henry.\n\nThe Boiler is situated in the Laundry instead of in the Furnace Room. When the New Heating Boiler was installed two years ago, we consulted the Engineer on the possibility of putting the High Pressure Boiler in the Furnace Room\u2014and also hooking it onto the Hot water tank. He considered it a good idea but after careful measurements found that the drop would not be sufficient for the Steam.\n\nThe Laundry Matron prefers it this way now\u2014\n\n1. She understands the Boiler,\n2. She is not dependent on another member of Staff when she needs steam,\n3. The heat from H.P. Boiler makes the drying of clothes possible in the Winter time. (When clothes hung on lines in Laundry.)\n\nThe Matter could be easily arranged so that the H.P. Boiler could be in part of the \"Tank Room\" which joins the Boiler Room, by taking out Wall of Tank Room and extending it about 7' to West, and covering in the added portion. In this new small building of about 7'x10' could be moved the H.P.BOILER (Move Boiler north about 6'). The foundation wall could be left in place as a protection should the H.P. Boiler ever explode.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept of Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nRe: Repairs and replacements\nCecilia Jeffrey I.R.School.\n\nReceipt acknowledged of your 129-6-5 (W.T.), dated the 24th ultimo, in connection with the several repairs in the Dining Room and Scullery at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nI have now to report that the hardboard and material for the repairs to the walls of the dining room, has been purchased and delivered from Lindstrom & Milson, Kenora, Ontario. Although no mention was made of the labor cost involved in this repair, Mr. D.S. Pitts will be submitting an estimate covering the cost of labor later.\n\nIn connection with the repairs to the Kelvinator, an estimate on the cost of repairs, has been received from Mr. H. Olson of Kenora, and this is hereto attached for your information, as requested. It is recommended that authority be granted to have the Kelvinator repaired as outlined in the estimate.\n\nThe scullery floor at the school is in very poor shape, and needs re-surfacing. Lindstrom & Milson have checked the floor over, and will be submitting an estimate of cost at a later date.\n\nYour query relative to the matter of the high pressure boiler in the school laundry is explained in Mr. Pitts' letter covering the several repairs outlined above.

Paterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ont.\n\nRE: DISPOSAL BED\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nSeveral times lately I have mentioned in conversation the serious condition of the water from the sewage disposal bed flowing on top of the surface.\n\nThis creates a serious condition which may lead to an epidemic of Typhoid or Dysentery.\n\nThrough considerable correspondence in the past, the matter was drawn to the attention of the Department. The fact is that the tiles (weeping tiles) have become filled with the fine sand silt and refuse from the septic tank and these tiles no longer will carry water.\n\nFrom expert advice which we have obtained, it is obvious that HEAVY GRAVEL is needed in addition to the sandy ground. This job should be undertaken this summer while the children are away for holiday.\n\nWe request that you will forward this letter to the department with the urgent request that they will give it the consideration due such an emergency. (I would suggest that possibly the Provincial department of Highways might assist in the filling of gravel, trucks, men, and bulldozer, if asked to do so.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKensley, Ontario,\nJune 27th, 1947\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Disposal Bed at Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nA letter in connection with the condition of the Disposal Bed at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School has been received.\n\nA copy of the letter which is self-explanatory is attached to this letter for your information.\n\nMrs. D.S. Skittles, Principal of the school has on several occasions brought this to the attention of Mr. Pitts, Survey and Engineering Branch, who has been unable to improve the condition of the present building due to the fact that the school is not yet disposed of.\n\nAs Mr. Pitts is quite concerned about the health of the school children and staff, I would recommend that the Survey and Engineering Branch take immediate action with a view to having the matter resolved during the school holidays.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNorman Paterson\nCecilia Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKENORA - ONTARIO\n\nJune 25th 1947.\n\nMr. H.

Pire & Company, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nCheque No. 3653 for $99.60 was forwarded to the Company on March 19th, 1947.

Will you kindly have transferred of $2500 to our Engineering and Construction Service if you wish this project proceeded with.\n\nJuly 10, 1947.\n\nRe - Sewage Disposal - Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of July 9th, we are now in receipt of the following from Mr. Cow under date of July 16th:\n\n\"We have your letter of July 10 with enclosures relating to the above mentioned subject, and asking to be advised what we propose in regard to the sewage disposal system and whether or not we are prepared to start work during the present school holidays and also what money would be required to be secured from the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n\"I wish to refer you to our letters of September 27, October 31 and November 28, December 17, 1946, in connection with this project. These letters clearly indicate what is the matter with the disposal bed and outlines our proposals for the reconstruction. I do not know what the labor situation is like at Kenora at the present time but the work would have to be very closely supervised and so should be undertaken on a day labor basis. This office will endeavor to have the work carried out in August provided the necessary funds are made available. In November, 1946 we estimated the cost at $2,000, and as material and labor costs have increased since that date about 10%, funds amounting to $2200. Should be made available. Engineering expenses of approximately $100.00 will be additional.\n\n\"The work of reconstruction would involve about a two-weeks period and so if it is intended to proceed with the reconstruction we should receive the authorization and advance before the end of the present month so as to insure the work being carried out before the opening of the school term on or about September 2nd.\"\n\nFrom a study of the design of the present septic tank and disposal field, we believe that this system is very susceptible to clogging if frequent cleaning of the septic tank is not carried out. We brought to Mr. Cow's attention the various points in connection with the design which seemed to need his consideration and now we should like to receive the transfer of $2500.00 so that the work may proceed before school opens in September.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIt appears...\nIt appears necessary to impress on Indian Affairs Branch that the septic tank should be frequently inspected and the accumulations of sludge removed whenever necessary and during the school holidays. The removal of sludge might be necessary at least once a year and possibly twice in each year. This matter of sludge removal is very important if it is desired to avoid rebuilding the system again after a short period.\n\nT.S.

Gow\n\nRev.- Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario - Septic Tank and Sewage Disposal Bed.\n\nIn connection with the rehabilitation of the sewage disposal system at the above mentioned school, I took over supervision from Mr. J. T. Ross on the afternoon of Friday, August 15, 1947. At that time the cleaning of the septic tank had been completed. The top sand soil had been removed from the disposal bed and work had progressed to the extent of relaying 3 - 80' lengths of tile in the bed.\n\nWork was continued in digging up the existing lines of 6\" tile and examining the condition of the bed. It was found that the main heater 6\" clay pipe line was in good condition. However, at places certain amounts of mud was found but not sufficient to block the flow. As regards the 6\" tile lines, for a varying distance averaging 20 feet in length from the 6\" distributor pipe, each tile was found to be more or less filled with soft slimy mud from the septic tank and for the balance of the line this matter was practically solid and fairly dry, completely blocking the remaining 60 feet of the 6\" tile lines.\n\nNear the centre of the disposal bed, a few 6\" tiles were found broken. They may have been in this condition for some time, showing the infiltration of sand thus blocking four of the tile lines for varying lengths. About 500 - 6\" tile were found crushed or broken in different parts of the bed. These were probably destroyed in removing the top sand soil as they appeared to have been filled with the solid mud previously thrown on the lines of tile. Tile lines were removed and about 50 of slinders placed in the bottom of the trenches. All tiles were cleaned, replaced in trenches with ramper over all joints, slinders placed around and above tiles to a thickness of about 8\" and some sand thrown on top. Top sand soil was then pushed to the edge of the disposal bed by bulldozer and afterwards, by means of teams and scraper, was distributed over the bed. The disposal bed was then levelled to an elevation of 64.0 (project datum) or the equivalent of 20 feet of sand or seven feet of tiles. The wooden manhole of septic tank had rotted in places and were repaired, one over the siphon chamber being completely rebuilt, and all were left in good condition.\n\nA limited amount of work was done on the laundry waste. The manhole near the S.W. corner of disposal bed was repaired to stop the infiltration of sand.\n\nWork was temporarily shut down on August 29, having completed the rehabilitation of the sewage disposal bed and the repair of all manholes of the septic tank.\n\n(Sgd) W. H. Wallace\n\nW. H. Wallace.\n\nMr. D. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nSurvey and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. D. B. Gow\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario - Sewage Disposal Plant Rehabilitation, August, 1967.\n\nSolids in the septic tank main settling chamber were found to be almost a solid mass with over 4-foot depth of sludge floating and a semi-liquid below this running to solids at the bottom. The secondary settling chamber had only a frothy scum on top and a semi-liquid below; a black mass at the bottom and these merged so that no definite depths were determinable. In the siphon chamber there was a black, frothy material on top of the liquid. The chamber never discharged below the bell edge of the siphon so that none of this frothy material would stay indefinitely but the pumping job was done removed most of it at the time of cleaning operations. The siphon chamber flushed less than twice daily with the small holiday population in the school and flushing is much more frequent during the regular school term, mainly due to the flow of the battery toilets.\n\nThe disposal field had the outer half of the grid plugged solid with sludge which was practically dry and the inner sections of the field and the distributor line were full of a slimy black, semi-liquid which would not sink even in the coarsest gravel although the gravel surrounding the tile was blackened. This gravel layer, as soon as the bottom, absorbed fully a gallon of water per minute per foot of length when the siphon flushed once after the tank had been cleaned and the outflow was clarified. Therefore, with annual cleaning out of tank solids accumulation, the disposal field system may be expected to function properly again for ten years or more, especially if the excessive flow caused by the use of the automatic flush is cut down by the installation of individual toilets with single flush tanks, manually operated. The distributor riser at the outer end of the distributor line was filled with stones and topped over so that it was not operative. The outer two feet length of the distributor was filled almost solid. In effect the disposal field was in such a state as to be totally inoperative and for some time the siphon chamber effluent had been discharged from a hole breached in the centre of the distributor line and runoff had gone off into the field on the hillside furthest away from the buildings.\n\nIt was found that the sludge in the secondary settling tank could be pumped out with little difficulty by the sludge pump used. Finally, some stirring and raking to the suction pipe was done but as it was advisable to leave some sludge for seed under normal periods between cleaning operations, normally little raking is needed. Sewage flow from the building was temporarily turned into this tank to avoid raw sewage flow into the main tank, which was not needed. After an hour or so the semi-fluid sludge had moved and it was necessary to start sieving up the sludge. Then it had to be broken up further with a steel hoe from the furnace room and by adding water from a 3 inch hose it was possible to pump the mixture of black liquid and lumpy brown material. A special non-clogging gasoline motored sludge pump was operated on a stand to pump into a chute to be delivered into special-baffled sludge tanks carried by dump trucks. Owing to\nthe high lift and suction less due to the least air leak at joints or partly open valves affected by sticks, fruit, tennis balls and heavy sleighs, the pump would frequently stop and require clearing. One diaphragm was torn away from fastening down bolts. Due to these delays and the heavy long-time accumulation of sludge with consequent excessive water dilution needed, the pumping took twenty hours. To finish the removal of thick sludge from the primary settling tank it was necessary to employ two men to go down into this tank the last day. These men raked the last of the solids toward the pump suction-line and located at the lower level under the main manhole. Some debris like pieces of glass, pottery and waterlogged sticks, which were liable to plug the pump, were shovelled into a pail and lifted out. The tanks, including the siphon chamber, were all pumped out as empty as there are no special sumps. Complete removal of material is not advisable, in any event, as it was advisable to leave some old material to act as seed for continued bacterial action in the settling tanks.\n\nThe tops of the manholes had rotted to some extent and the original manhole built in 1928 over the siphon chamber was so rotten as to allow sand to sift down so it had to be rebuilt. It was found the timber cover of the tank was in good order as it had been covered.\n\nOne long root, about 1\" in diameter, had grown down into the main settling tank. It was presumed to be eartgiana from a hedge about 25 feet away. There did not seem to be any extensive root system developed, however. A few tiles in the disposal field had a fine rooting net developed in them presumably from alfalfa which got into the surface field to a limited extent. Not more than a dozen feet of tile seemed to be affected. A few defective tiles had collapsed and had sand in them but there was no sign of any general sifting in of sand. As a bulldozer was used to uncover the upper part of the bed, the number of collapsed tile is problematical as most of the breakage happened when this machine was used to pile up spoil along the edge. However, it may be said as long as the system has damp soil around the pipes, the joints which are originally covered with sand paper, will let in practically no sand or other fine material.\n\n(Sgd.)

Gow\n\nRe: Current Rehabilitation and Proposed Future Maintenance at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario.\n\nThis season's work of cleaning out tank and rebuilding disposal field is a recurrent expense item which it is considered could be much reduced by reasonably frequent cleaning out of the septic tanks. It is proposed that the tanks be cleaned out at least once a year at a cost of about $100.00 and the frequency the disposal field is rebuilt should be much reduced as settlement area in the tanks would not be unduly restricted by sludge accumulation.\n\nDue to the accumulation of several years' run, current pumping of the sludge involved much more difficult work than a single year's operation would involve. Four feet of floating material, possibly largely paper, had to be sliced and mashed into a pumpable mass with a considerable addition of water from a fire hose. In spite of several times the tank capacity was actually pumped, this dilution would be largely unnecessary for a single year's accumulation. This year because school teams were not available, trucks were employed and the work was much expedited as a tank or truck could be filled, loaded, dumped on any field a mile away and truck would be back for refill in seventeen minutes which would not be possible with teams. Other years, the school teams could be used at a time chosen when urgent work would be at a minimum and they could handle the pumping with more time allowed for cleaning the pump in between fillings. Owing to the obnoxious conditions of the work, the school authorities would be obliged to pay their staff and any extra help, current rates of labor in addition to their regular wages, while specially employed on this work. To work with teams, two special tank boxes would necessarily be supplied as the only sludge box with baffles available from the Town of Kenora is made for a dump truck. To have two of these boxes made would cost about $50.00 each and they could be utilized by the St. Mary's Indian School also, by arrangement with the Indian Agent at Kenora. The steel boxes can be opened with the whole back end to open quickly and on account of no caulking being necessary, their maintenance would be negligible and high first cost would be warranted.\n\nAllowing for slow pumping with two teams and boxes used, the pumping would easily be completed in three days if carried on annually and charges would be as follows:\n\n- Pump rental and transfer .................. $10.50\n- Two drivers for tank wagons at $6.00 per day . 56.00\n- Helper and tank cleaner at $1.00 per hr. . 24.00\n- Pump-mac at $1.00 per hour ................. 24.00 $94.50\n\nMuch depend on the willingness of the pump man to regularly clear the pump of various articles that stick in the two drop gates and pump diaphragm. A fisherman's rubber trousers and jacket with sou-wester hat are necessary for use with hip boots by a tank cleaner.\n\nD. B.

Wallace with reference to the work which was carried out under his supervision and giving details as to the conditions found. There is a memorandum also by Mr. J.T. Ross of this staff who initiated the work, outlining the conditions which he experienced while at the site in charge of the work. Also enclosed is a statement by Mr. Ross, dated October 4th, outlining what is considered necessary for the proper cleaning out of the tank at frequent intervals, and also a statement of the detailed costs of the various parts of the work as carried out in connection with the rehabilitation of this disposal bed.\n\nI might point out that this work was carried out for about one-half of the estimated cost. This was due mainly to the use of mechanical equipment and close supervision of the project. However, there is some additional work which it is intended to carry out before freeze-up in connection with the proper drainage of the site and this will probably increase the cost by $100.00.\n\nWe have discussed with Inspector Hamilton of the Indian Affairs branch here, the condition of the roof over the heating and pumping equipment at this school. This roof is in urgent need of replacement and he has been advised that we will have unexpended approximately $1,000.00 of monies made available for this rehabilitation work and that we are prepared to carry out this work this fall should he receive the necessary authority from his department at Ottawa to have the work done and the remainder of this money divided for that purpose. However, the length of time available for carrying out such work is rather limited and unless the work is authorized within the next week or ten days, it will not be proceeded with.\n\n(Sgd.) D. B.

Patterson,\nIndian Agent,\nKENORA, Ont.\n\nRE: ENCLOSED ESTIMATE FROM P.A. SHOP.\n\nDear Mr. Patterson:\n\nAs you will remember from previous correspondence, the visiting Dietician and Inspectors Hamilton both recognized the need for a new floor in the scullery. Mr. Bert Wilson, of Hindstrom and Wilson was to give an estimate. His first reaction was about $250.00. However, when I asked him for a written estimate he said that he would prefer not to take on the job, and referred me to Mr. Shop.\n\nMr. Shop's estimate is for what should be a permanent finish. Because of the constant water and damp action, some finishes such as linoleum, or \"Tromso\" products will not stand up.\n\nWe should like to ask that Mr. Shop's estimate be now accepted.\n\nFurther, you will remember our discussion of the condition of occasional overflow at the toilets in the Dormitories. Since the floor is wood, this condition\u2014even though only occasional\u2014tends to create an odor. Besides the floor itself, the undercoat and the classroom ceilings below, suffer considerably.\n\nWe are requesting a small cement floor, with a floor drain, to catch any liquid other than overflow or spillage of the boys. (Such drains are installed in the dormitory toilets at the Mohawk Institute in Brantford.)\n\nThis second estimate from Mr. Shop, of $82.00 per toilet including all the plumbing necessary in connecting the floor drains to main sewer outlet seems quite reasonable.

System for Education\n\nWe have received a small bequest from the estate of a friend of the school, to purchase something for the school. With this money, we are considering the purchase of a combination Radio, Phonograph, Public Address System, as per enclosed estimate. As the amount of money at our disposal only amounts to three hundred dollars, and as the equipment under consideration has considerable value from an Educational Standpoint, we wonder if the department would give consideration to the following suggestion.\n\nEach additional Loud Speaker Outlet costs about $20.00. We should like to place one speaker in each of the Three Classrooms and Manual Training Shop, also one in our Playroom, one in Dining Room and one in the Hospital. This makes a total of the possible eight speakers.\n\nThe Province of Ontario has a considerable programme of Radio Education. At present most of the Staff have used personal Radios in the Classrooms. We should like to use this master system.\n\nTherefore we request a Grant from the Department, to cover 4 Classrooms, Hospital, Dining Room, and 2 Playrooms, or 5 Speakers at $20.00 each, for a total of $100.00. We should look after the wiring etc., ourselves. (This would entail about 160 feet of wire plus connections at about .24 per foot.)\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nENQ: Prospective, REC: Principal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario\n\nRes: Radio, Phonograph, P.A.

Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Kenora Agency,\nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nAs mentioned to you over the phone this morning, the Disposal Bed has again given us trouble similar to the trouble of the past two years. Yesterday morning, I noticed a pool of open water in the bed. Upon further investigation I found that the water is erupting to the surface from one point, approximately the end of the tile line furthest from the Septic tank.\n\nThe similar trouble last year was found to be from the blocking of the tiles by sand and silt from the tank. It is hard to believe that the same thing has happened already, since the bed was ransomed during the summer of 1947. It is hard to believe that the line is frozen, since it has withstood the coldest parts of the winter.\n\nMay I again draw to the attention of the department the necessity of considering the installation of individual flush type toilets instead of the present \"battery\" type. As previously pointed out, the present type is obsolete, uncleanly and therefore unsanitary, wasteful of water, and imposes too much burden on the Septic tank and disposal bed.\n\nYou have already received a letter from us requesting that the department would consider sending a competent Engineer to look at the Pump and Chlorine system. Could they tie in with that, a complete check of the possibilities of changing the toilet system and also helping to clear up this matter of the new disposal bed overflow.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 6, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, file 108-13 (129), enclosing communication from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, I am bringing the matters mentioned in that letter to the attention of the Lands and Development Services with a view to having one of their officials visit the School in the near future.\n\nBernard F.

With reference to the sewage disposal bed, I would refer you to Mr. Mills' memorandum of October 20th, 1947, file IA 3572, forwarded to us under cover of Mr. Ward's memorandum of October 23rd. It appears from the Principal's letter that he does not consider the disposal bed satisfactory.\n\nIt is hoped that one of your officials will be able to visit this School and at that time you might consider the other two matters mentioned in the Principal's letter, namely the installation of flush toilets and a check on the pump and chlorine system.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Krista Masters\nAddress: Box 667\nKawartha, Ontario\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\nApril | On account rendered as per vouchers attached | 90 48\n\nTo emergency repairs to the water supply system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kawartha, Ontario.\n\nVeto: 514-09-422\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that all charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

As it was an emergency and essential that we have the water running for convenience, sanitation, and fire protection, we called in the only local mechanic who had had some experience with the pumps.\n\nHis first bill was not acceptable but since we were trying to clear this matter up before the end of the year it was forwarded to you. However, in the meantime I had Mr. Ericko review the bill with a view to reducing the amount. The corrected invoice is herewith enclosed.\n\nI would again like to point out to the department that it will be necessary to take considerable action with regards to these pumps in the very near future. I would request that plans be started now to have an engineer view this with the purpose of taking the necessary action this summer while the children are away.\n\nThe equipment has been in for twenty years. The pipes have been corroded and are leaking until they are now quite thin and in danger of breaking. The Chlorine system was a temporary expedient during the war. It was a cut-off of the town of Delisle, and was only intended to be temporary. The pumps themselves are old, complicated and are bound to give us more trouble. We would, therefore ask you to forward to the department our request that they give the whole pumping system a thorough check by a competent engineer.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKENORA  \nMAR 30 1948  \nINDIAN AGENCY\nKenora, April 6th, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Repairs to Water Supply System,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nAttached hereto please find our voucher No. 184,\nin the amount of $90.45, in favour of Kriake Motors Ltd.,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nA copy of a letter from Mr. Dr. S.

However, in the following 4 years there has naturally been some wear and some of the older mattresses have now given out.\n\nWe are now in need of new ones.\n\nIn our requisition, we requested 50 mattresses and the price at that time was $9.00 each. We realize that the price may have risen again. We would therefore, now ask that you request the department for mattresses for our schools. We should be satisfied with enough that they do not exceed the amount of $450.00 as requested last July.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nKenora, April 10th, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Requisition for Supplies\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian School\n\nAttached hereto please find Requisition for mattresses for the above noted Indian Residential School, with a copy of a letter received from the Principal.\n\nIt is recommended that this Requisition be approved.\n\n[Signature]\n\nNorman Patterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency\nCecilin Jeffrey\nPresbyterian Indian Residential School\nKENORA - ONTARIO\n\nApril 8th, 1948.\n\nMr. H.

However, we are writing to Indian Superintendent Paterson regarding the matters mentioned above and it is also our intention to have this school visited by Indians next winter or the next month. Following the visit of the latter, we will receive a report regarding any improvements that may be required at the Cecilia Jeffrey School. It may not be possible to provide funds this year for all the improvements that might be considered advisable.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P.

Ngary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MOD\nMr. Rose: Please let us know what further action is decided upon.\n\nR.A. Gibson\nDirector\n\nJuly 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal and Water Supply System,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\nnear Kenora, Ont.\n\nReferring to your notation on copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs dated April 6th, 1948, we are now in receipt of a report from Mr. J.T. Rose dated June 23rd, forwarded here by Mr. Gow. This report deals with the sewage disposal system as well as the flush toilets and pump and chlorine system. A copy of this report is attached herewith.\n\nMr. Rose found that the effluent from the septic tank was not running over the ground surface, but a break in a tile line apparently was allowing the effluent to form a small pond at one spot. This was probably partly due to the fact that the siphons were found to be out of action.\n\nThe siphons and the general operation of the septic tank should be frequently inspected. While the school is open, an inspection every day, and certainly not less than once per week would not be too often if trouble is to be prevented.\n\nThe partly unsatisfactory past operation of the sewage disposal system is, no doubt, largely due to the enormous load of discharge from the automatic battery type of toilets, which puts a strain on the disposal system. New manually operated independent closets should be installed.\n\nThe Wilson Chemical Hypo-Chlorinator appears to be unsatisfactory as repair parts and service are not available. The Wallace & Tiernan Hypo-Chlorinator should give more satisfaction.\n\nThe following is the estimate of cost for the suggested changes:\n\n- Sewage disposal bed tile replacement, covering and reseeding: $1,000.00\n- Gang Closets replacement: $1,750.00\n- Pumping Plant repairs: $400.00\n- Chlorination plant replacement: $400.00\n- Contingencies: $200.00\n\nTotal: $2,000.00\n\nIt is also recommended that $200.00 be supplied for repair work and testing units.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nIt would be most satisfactory to have all repair work and replacement work done during this present school holiday, but on account of the purchase of equipment, which takes time, it is unlikely that the whole work could be completed before September 7th. However, the work on the disposal bed should be done at once at a cost of about $100.00.\n\nKindly advise if Indian Affairs will transfer the entire $2200.00 now or only the $100.00 required for work on the disposal system.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nP.S.\nJTR/6.\n\nPlanes, Pumps and Scientific Services Branch,\n\nPM Dominion Public Works,\nWinnipeg, June 28, 1948.\n\nEnclosure - To Mr. D. B. Cox,\n\nRe: Sanitary Disposal and Water Supply and Wash Closet Installation at Cecilia Jeffery Indian Residential School near Hanna,\n\nDate: June 28, 1948.\n\n3. Primary Plant Inspection and Proposals:\n\nAs the sewage disposal plant at the school visited June 18 there was a pool in a slight depression in the disposal field, about 100 square feet in area and it averaged one inch deep. No overflow pan off the bed downhill. It is thought that during wet spring conditions the bed may have been saturated and under drainage become reduced, so that the flow of water started spread out of a loosely closed end of a tile line, or a joint tipped by heavy storms appeared used to backfill the bed. Since the break-out this outlet has been the easiest way for some of the siphon discharge. Most of the flow sinks away or is taken up by transpiration and evaporation, so there is no flow off the bed. The pipes were found to be stopped. The double bell and quadrant pipe coil was removed, raised above ground and tested and after it was replaced the siphon system. Siphon closure liquids were applied by use of a bailer pail in the presence of the School Principal and his mechanical operator, and the liquid was seen to contain a reasonable amount of black sludge, about the same as when the plant was replaced in operation last fall. The septic tank sludge accumulation was checked at the clean-out manhole near the tank inlet. Eighteen inches of top sludge, two and a half feet of thin liquid and one foot bottom sludge seemed to be in place. The Principal noted much of the top sludge was much less digested than he had observed last year, so he immediately ordered his operator to have a quantity of fresh prepared and proved into the tank. The Principal did not like to call his staff or anyone whom he could get now to have the tank cleaned out this summer during school closing, so has been recommended as a yearly necessity. He had not shown his new operator the plant plans and only had him clean the common sewers weekly.

Cox,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDominion Water & Power Bureau,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nMemorandum - To Mr. D. B. Gov.\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal and Water Supply and Flush Closet Installation at Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School near Kenora, Ontario - June 11, 1946.\n\n1. Sewage Plant Inspection and Proposals.\n\nAt the sewage disposal plant at the school visited June 18 there was a pool in a slight depression in the disposal field, about 100 square feet in area and it averaged one inch deep. No overflow ran off the bed downhill. It is thought that during wet spring conditions the bed may have been saturated and under drainage become reduced, so that the flush of water started spread out of a loosely closed end of tile line, or a joint tipped by horse-drawn apparatus used to backfill the bed. Since the break-out this outlet has been in contact with free air on the siphon discharge. Thus the flow from same is taken up by transpiration and evaporation, as there is no flow off the bed. The siphons were found to be stopped. The double bell and equalizer pipe unit was removed, raised above ground and tested, and after it was replaced the siphons operated. Siphon chamber liquids were sampled by use of a bailer past in the presence of the School Principal and his mechanical operator, and the liquid was seen to contain a red-brown scum which resembled almost the same when the plant was retested in operation last fall. The septic tank sludge accumulation was checked at the clean-out man-hole near the tank inlet. Eighteen inches of top sludge, two and a half feet of this liquid and one foot bottom sludge seemed to be in place. The Principal noted much of the top sludge was much less digested than had been observed last year, so he immediately ordered his operator to have a quantity of yeast prepared and poured into the tank. The Principal did not like to ask his staff or know where he could get more to have the tank cleaned out this summer during school vacation, but he has been promised an yearly necessity. He has also shown his new operator the plant plans and only has him clean the sewage screens weekly. A regular check on the siphon operation and correction of its action might have topped some of the trouble in the disposal field. The Principal agreed to close the end of the field tile where flow is too free, and he will have some loads of sandy soil from near by placed in the ponded area.\n\nStopping breaks and placing fill in the shallow depression should suppress surface overflow. It is believed, however, the reduction of flow that may be reached by replacement of gang closets and leaky taps will also improve operational conditions. Continual flooding due to cessation of siphon action probably allowed the bed to become sour, and a slimy mass may have formed which would reduce absorption. This should be corrected by aerobic bacterial action when breathing spells occur and air can get into\nthe lime from the breather pipe. Besides screen cleaning school attendants should be sure the siphons operate regularly, and they should periodically wash out \"Elsco\" flush bent of siphon chamber effluents. Annual removal of most of the septic tank solids should be required as regular practice. Special steel dump boxes for fresh haulage are required for this operation, which has previously been outlined.\n\nAs it is not feasible to shut down the disposal unit, a check of the actual cause of overflow from the tile line or lines, and resetting any displaced pipes or pipes, refilling any openings with new soil is advised to be done later on. This would provide a better seed bed for a good grass growth. The operation would cost about $100.00, if done in July or August.\n\n2. Gang Closets.\n\nOn the boys' side these are operated as a \"U\" shaped trough with five seats separated by walls with h-joint filled, framed partitions. A slight overflow prevents the tank periodically flushing. The trough is about four inches above the marble-covered floor and discharge is through a vented 6\" S-trap, also above the floor. The flush of water does not adequately clean the trough and unsatisfactory sanitary conditions result, requiring frequent scrubbing down further, leaving open possibilities for insect spread of disease like typhoid, dysentery and polio. The use of water is excessive and should be avoided as far as possible by the use of manually flushed closets. Also, the possibility of leakage of the disposal field and septic tank. Might lead sticks, rulers and books would get into the sewer from the closets of the separate type. A special refuse container of the lid type should be provided in the room, which is divided by a partition from the gang wash basins. Overhead a fuse canopy covering the closets is wanted to the same system as the ventilation system in the class rooms. The class room ventilation openings were closed because of the noise resulting from blow-back of odors, so that it appears advisable to rent the canopies in each of the boys' and girls' washrooms directly through fans on the wall opposite the closets. Then the class-room ventilators can be used again. There are two urinals of the vertical type installed on the wall at right angles to the gang closets nearest their discharge end. These operate most satisfactorily and permit space used by an old urinal to be used for a sixth closet, if this were considered necessary. The Principal of the school considered the boys needed four closets, only, as the pair of stall urinals are available.\n\nA replacement installation, running to least expense, would be to install the new individual flush-tank type closets on a concrete platform which would contain the horizontal soil pipe connection to the present vented S-trap. Present vents would suffice. The partitions need not be moved. As there are 9 washbasins and baths in the same room it is considered the ventilator canopy overhead should stay and be vented across the room directly outside.\n\nIn the girls' washroom there are six closets, where replacement with individual flush-tank units would involve work similar to that for the boys' side, but the six closets instead of four would mean a cost proportionately higher. In each case the partitions would remain. The cost of the new installation in the boys' section would be $450.00 and in the girls' $350.00, a total of $800.00, including concrete base. No expenditures for ventilation units are included.\nIn the girls' toilet the double gong, which basin unit was in noticeable disrepair and the drain often blocks up. Slip joints under basins were in some places disconnected and basin brackets broken off on most units. The connectors to the main drain are opposed instead of being into double \"T\"s. The main drain under the floor is too little slope and the traps at the end, instead of being a proper \"U\" trap, is made up of a lot of fittings, including a slanting bend located at the upper end of the basin drain. All this prevents easy drainage and could readily be corrected. The mastick-covered floors are subject to continual deterioration by scaly water, so it was recommended a waterproof plastic be applied to resist soap action. Due to amount of work barring brackets, besides plumbing, cost on basins would be $158.00.\n\n3 - General Building Maintenance Issues.\n\nPartly detached eave trough sections along the roof edges hang dangerously above both boys' and girls' dormitories. The whole system of troughing and down pipes should be salvaged, if it is not to be repaired. Water has been getting under the roof metal, particularly at the valleys where the wings are joined to the main building and inside places where falling off underneath. No defect is in any way obvious or evident, but caulking with roofing cement should be tried. A limited amount of insulation should be placed over dorm frames, with a clear varnish spray over upper storey tapestry brick will improve heat retention and exclude excessive moisture that tends to beat in when winds accompany heavy rainfall. The damaged part of the roof over the furnace room and adjoining areas can also be replaced, now that more metal is available. Partly on account of war shortages faulty taps have not been replaced and many leak badly. Probably much waste of water could be saved by removals, or at least by resetting the taps.\n\n4 - Pumping and Chlorination System.\n\nThe two 5,000 gallon Typhoon Pumps obtained of Fairbanks-Morse and installed in 1926 have had considerable repair work done and both its vertical studs connecting the water box bracket and base together pull out due to rust and chlorin accumulation. Double Arc lead and electric welding has been done to reinforce them, but without lasting success. Fairbanks-Morse provided these do not handle the 5,000 gallon size pump or spare parts now and 2,500 gallon size is the next largest stocked, so further repairs should be tried.\n\nRepairs may be done at a cost of $100.00 to $150.00 for each pump to open out and re-tap with larger size end nuts up six special studs to hold down the water box bracket, with extra size nuts threaded. The base may be hardened by the elastic welding done and \"doxy\" due to chlorine action, so that it is only advisable to try out repairs on one pump at a time.\n\nThe whole pump room and machinery several years ago was damaged by chlorine gas and the pump and valves are continually subject to corrosion by chlorine solution, which do doubt has damaged the valves. The unplated pipes are badly corroded. Wrenches have apparently been used on the valves, as their seating is poor, and the seat and stems are damaged. Replacement is recommended of two 3/4\", two 3\" valves and two 3/4\" checks and a 3\" pipe in suction lines as pump prime is generally lost. Besides this a 4' foot length of 4\" pipe and 6' feet of 6\" suction line are badly corroded on the outside. Red lead paint on the piping has kept the exterior in good appearance, so all the piping should be repainted with red lead paint regularly.\nOne of the pump meters had recently been burnt out, probably due to simple plugging as no fuses were blown in the protective switch connections, and the power supplying company could not explain the cause of the trouble. The meter has been rewound. The company went to the expense of putting in two new line wires and overhauled the line generally to prevent short circuits. For the above mentioned conditions it is considered advisable a check by one of our local offices electrical engineers might show the source of this type of trouble. Recommendation of remedial or control measures would be appreciated.\n\nThe cost of this pump house work on two pumps, piping and fittings would amount to about $200.00.\n\n5 - Chlorination System\n\nThe chlorination of the water supply by the Wilson Chemical Hypo-Chlorinator at the pump house is irregular; as the sight feeder builds up a chemical deposit which gradually reduces flow and makes the flow difficult to judge. Besides that, this Wilson type runs continuously with excessive waste of chlorine solution. There is no local representative or channel through which new parts or service are available, so that this machine and others in the area around Lenore have been lately replaced with more satisfactory by Wallace & Tieman Type-Chlorinators, for which there is a regular supply of parts and equipment. In addition, this equipment is automatically shut off and run during pumping only. This Hypo-Chlorinator, Type BHF, has proved satisfactory in many R.C.A.F. water supply plants. It is of a type recently put in to replace the Wilson unit at Norman river, and service for it can be readily arranged, which is an important consideration where operators change often and need supervision for dependable operation and standard tests by orthotolidin type tester.\n\nAs the elimination of this Wilson chlorinator was recommended in a letter of April 8, 1948 from this office, and no suitable replacement units have been obtainable from \"our Assets\", it is advised the Type BHF sold by Wallace & Tieman at $675.00 be purchased. The installation could use the present auxiliary piping, namely, but retapping and connections would cost about $15.00. The provision of an electrically driven water and convenience outlet combination with installation would cost not more than $200.00. The total replacement would therefore be about $900.00. An OTO Junior Type Test Unit costing $18.50 is also required for checking the quantity of the chlorine in the water at the school.\n\nSummary of Cost estimated on work allotted for investigation:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sewage disposal bed tile replacement, scouring and | $100.00|\n| Gang (Assets) replacement                        | $1075.00|\n| Pumping Plant repairs                             | $800.00|\n| Chlorination plant replacement                   | $400.00|\n| Total                                            | $1700.00|\n\nSummary of some recommended repair and Test Apparatus:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Gang wash basins in girls' wash rooms, repairs and new parts | $135.00|\n| Sewage disposal plant Embott Gears                | $5.00  |\n| Water Supply OTO Junior Type Test Unit           | $23.50 |\n| Total                                            | $168.50|\nIndian Education\n\nJuly 21, 1948\n\n516 48 49\n\n10-671 461\n\n129-3-5\n\nRepairs to the disposal system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School $100.00\n\n(This work being done under the supervision of the Lands & Development Services Branch)\nOttawa, July 21st, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal and Water Supply System - Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of July 9th, we will transfer immediately to your Branch an amount of $500.00 for the work required on the disposal system at the above mentioned school.\n\nWe are also prepared to consider the repairs to the pumping plant and chlorination plant.

Paterson,  \nSuperintendent, Kenora Indian Agency,  \nKENORA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson,\n\nWe have had trouble with the Hot Water tank heating system. The old boiler, (approximately 20 yrs. old), which we used as stand-by, sprung a bad leak. When the blacksmith, Onarheim came to weld it he found a split about 1/4\" long in the corner.\n\nWhile the boiler was \"out\" the men relied on the three Hot Water Electric Heaters in tank (each 3 K.W.). These did not work so they had the electrician take them off. The Electricians, Campbell Brothers found that although the electricity went through the coils they were not heating, but were burned out.\n\nAs we needed the Hot water and had no boiler, we had to order new 3 K.W. Heating Units. These are only made in a new style now with a 2\" socket (screws into boiler) instead of the old style 1\". This made necessary calling Onarheim, to cut our old coupling (1\") out of boiler and weld in a new 2\" couplings.\n\nOnarheim's Bill will be:\nWelding old Boiler $15.00\nCutting & welding H.W. Tank $10.50\n\n$ 25.50.\n\nI have been unable to secure the Invoices on this account but will forward them as soon as secured. Similarly, the electrician has not yet received the Invoice for 2 only 3 K-W. Water heaters. These also will be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nIn the meantime we would ask that you would request consideration of this emergency account by the Department.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nAugust 26, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School\n\nReference your 108-13 of August 9, 1948.\n\nThe Department approves an emergency expenditure of $25.50 for essential repairs required to the hot water heating system at the above residential school.\n\nBernard P.

The system is at present so completely inefficient - I refer here specifically to the chlorinating system - that we are now at no time assured of water which is fit for human consumption. Thus I find myself unable to accept responsibility for the health of those living in this school and dependent upon this system for daily water supply. I shall be unable to accept such responsibility until this system is in proper working condition, or has been replaced.\n\nI sincerely regret having to bring this matter so forcibly to your attention, but feel sure that you will understand that I am prompted to do so only by my strong desire to discharge fully the duties given me. You will realise the urgent need for having this system in working order just as soon as humanly possible, particularly at a time when the pupils are already beginning to return for the opening of the term.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, September 8, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, LAND & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES BRANCH\n\nRe: Sewage Disposal and Water Supply System - Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nI desire to refer to my memorandum of July 21st and previous correspondence in connection with the above.\n\nThere is a new principal at this school and I attach for your information a copy of his letter which he has forwarded to us through the office of the Indian Superintendent.\n\nWe would appreciate anything you can do to expedite the carrying out of the work that has been approved at this school.\n\nDirector.\n\nPT/MOD\nSeptember 6, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario,\n\nWe have your letter of the 2nd instant in connection with the chlorination system, etc., at the Cecilia Jeffrey residential school.\n\nWe received a report from the Lands and Development Services on July 6th and authorized them to incur a certain expenditure. As a result of your letter, we are communicating with them again, asking that immediate action be taken.\n\nIt may be interesting for you to know and to pass on to the new principal, the following comment made by the Lands and Development Services Branch regarding the sewage disposal system at the Cecilia Jeffrey school:\n\n\"The siphons and the general operation of the septic tank should be frequently inspected. While the school is open, an inspection every day, and certainly not less than once per week, should not be too often if trouble is to be prevented.\n\n\"The partly unsatisfactory past operation of the sewage disposal system is, no doubt, largely due to the enormous load of discharge from the automatic battery type of toilets, which puts a strain on the disposal system. New manually operated independent closets should be installed.\"\nWe infer from the above report that the automatic discharge goes on at night as well as in the daytime. Would it not be possible to control the amount? Shouldn't the usage during the day even reduced at other periods, but left as it is for the period that there is the greatest usage.

Ross's letter of September 1st, with reference to the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOn September 7th, our Mr. Hargreaves called at the above school on his way back from a trip through the West to inspect the water pumps; and the following report is submitted for your information and for transmission to the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nIn condensed summary, the water supply system may be described as follows:\n\nThere are two Fairbanks Morse Typhoon double acting belt driven water pumps, each having capacity to deliver 5000 Imperial gallons of water per hour against 100 lbs per square inch. Each pump is driven by a 7\u00bd horsepower, 220 volt, 3 phase, 60 cycle, A.C. Motor. The pumps are set up on concrete bases which extend approximately 1\u00bd inches above the pump house floor and approximately 5 feet below the pump house floor. A 1 inch suction line extends approximately 1\u00bd feet from the pump house to the intake and about 150 feet from the intake line to the intake. The suction line extending from the pump pit, is fitted with a foot valve and upon rising through the floor, branches to each pump through a double sweep elbow.\n\nNo fault is to be found with the piping arrangement, except that from time to time it has been found necessary to renew certain sections owing to rust and deterioration. Much trouble has been experienced in keeping these units primed, but following Mr. Ross's last efforts, this condition has been overcome and at the time this inspection was carried out, the units were working as satisfactorily as could be expected.\n\nThe pumps were installed in 1928, and are therefore 20 years old. They are not of modern design and are not capable of equalling the performance of a similar unit. While they are anchored to substantial concrete bases, considerable vibration was noted, due largely to the fact that shimming was needed. As a result of these vibrations and gradual wear and tear, the vertical studs which connect the water box bottom to the base, have pulled out from time to time. Various attempts have been made to replace these studs, but it has not been found possible to keep them tight, and unless these studs can be made to hold, undesirable results will follow. As this type of pump is no longer manufactured, vitally necessary replacement parts are impossible to obtain, and it follows that a satisfactory repair job cannot be made.\n\nAfter having given careful consideration to the requirements, it is felt that one new pump of modern design should be installed as soon as possible. This unit should be of a size calculated to handle the entire load and should be of a type specifically designed for this service.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs branch\n\nFor your consideration\n23/9/48 Director...\nOne of the existing pumps should be left in place to provide for stand-by service. At a later date, it would be good policy to replace this stand-by unit with one similar to the suggested new pump.\n\nIt is therefore, recommended that the following operations be carried out:\n\nProvide and install one shallow well type pump, equal to Duro series, 2000 Oilt-Rite for total suction lift of 25 feet or pump No. 2088 having a capacity to deliver 2500 Imperial gallons of water per hour against 160 lbs per square inch working pressure.\n\nThis pump shall be connected through V belt drive to one 7\u00bd horsepower 220 volt, 3 phase, 60 cycle A.C. Motor and supplied with all necessary starting switches and overload protection. The V belt shall have not less than 4 belts.\n\nOne of the existing pumps shall be removed from its base, and new holes shall be drilled into the base to permit installation of new anchor bolts which shall be located to suit the new pump base. Anchor bolts should be extended at least a distance of 4 feet into the basement and be thoroughly coated with a rich concrete mix. Extreme care will be taken to provide an absolutely firm foundation, using steel shims etc., where necessary.\n\nThe above pump including the motor, will cost approximately $550.00 and the installation charges which will include the dismantling and removal of the old pump along with minor changes to the piping, will cost approximately $350.00. It is felt that with contingencies, this work can be carried out for approximately $1,000.00.\n\nAt the time this work is done, the existing pressure switch on the pressure tank should be adjusted to cut in and cut out within the range of 20 to 60 lbs.\n\nIt is felt that nothing can be done to improve the sewage disposal system, short of removing the gang toilets and installing manual operating individual units.\n\nThe existing gang closets require continual flushing and huge quantities of water are used in order to obtain some degree of cleanliness. Under these circumstances, it can be taken for granted, that complete bacterial action does not take place in the first chamber of the septic tank; this is due to the excessive quantity of waste being continually admitted. The tank overflows to the siphon chamber and some of the solids are bound to pass over. This condition could result in the clogging of the siphon pipe, thereby stopping its action. In addition, the field tile bed being under continual discharge, does not have time to become aerated and thus the bed is at all times sodden and sour. Since the existing septic tank is judged to be somewhat on the small side, it should be cleaned at least twice a year.\n\nOur memorandum of July 4th, outlines the procedure to relieve the difficulty and it also includes for the replacement of the chlorinator plant. The chlorinator plant has been requisitioned, and it is expected that its installation will be completed in the near future.\n\nChief Engineer.\n| Date | Description                          | Amount |\n|------|-------------------------------------|--------|\n| Aug. 5 | 2 - 3000 gal water heaters          | $27.75 |\n|      | Replace water heaters               | $1.50  |\n|      |                                     | $4.50  |\n\nTotal: $33.25\n\nCertified Correct\n\nPrincipal\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Campbell Brothers\nElectrical Services,\nKenora, Ontario\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| October 8 | To account rendered as per vouchers attached | $6.00 |\n\nTo emergency repairs to the hot water system at the Cecilia Junior Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.

I am not sure that you are the one to whom I should write but, if not, will you kindly pass this matter on at once.\n\nA letter came in from Mr. T. G. Ross, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School at Kenora, saying that the heating system has gone wrong. There is no heat going into the Principal's residence at all and with the prospect of colder weather almost immediately there is great need of haste in putting this right. I take for granted that as the Government owns the school it is their business to attend to this, or at least to pay for it.\n\nI wonder if you would communicate with Mr. Ross and have him get the men to work at once on it. I think he has written to the Department of Indian Affairs but, as he is new at the principalship, I am not sure just what he has said but we cannot have the Principal and his family frozen out in the middle of a Manitoba fall.\n\nWould you let me know when you get this what is going to be done about it and how soon?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nTreasurer.\nOttawa, October 26, 1948.\n\nAttention Colonel B.F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/RM.\nExtract from Regional Supervisor Matter's Report on his inspection of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School.\n\nAt the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, I found that neither of the dormitories were equipped with fire escape ladders. They are so situated that in case of fire one of them is sure to be cut off. I left the matter with Mr. Paterson, the principal to prepare a report suggesting as to how it could be remedied along with an estimate of the cost. The electric wiring in the basement of this school is also dangerous. I saw electric irons being used plugged into a drop cord that had been joined in two places and they were not even taped. This is bad enough anywhere in the building but is doubly dangerous in a basement.\nOctober 15th 1948\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa, (File No. 461-5)\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nVOTE ... 516 ...

On more than one occasion it has failed to drain, and has flooded the floor of the furnace room. Previously we have managed to pump out, and get the drain operating satisfactorily. The day before yesterday, when it flooded the furnace room, we pumped the sump out and discovered that the drain was blocked, or appeared to be.\n\nAs repair to this defective drain will be a considerable expense, I am asking your permission for authority to proceed with the work, which will come outside the bounds of ordinary repair. I have been unable to get an estimate on this job, because labour is scarce, but have been given to understand that the job will likely cost about seventy dollars.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nKenora, December 8th, 1948\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Heating System,\nCecilia Jeffrey I.R.School\n\nYour letter dated the 17th ultimo, file 462-5(EL), advised that as soon as you received the report from the Lands and Development Branch you would give the above matter further consideration.\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. T.C.

This became absolutely essential when, for several days in succession, parts of the building \u2014 the residence included \u2014 were getting no heat, although there was a good fire on, and other parts of the building were quite comfortably heated.\n\nI have had three of the large traps in the steam line replaced, and the difference is quite noticeable. There is still a good deal to do, but I do not wish to carry on until receiving authority to do so. However, it is proving impossible to heat this building, and I am gravely concerned over the possibility of delay in having this work done.\n\nMay this matter receive the attention it merits as soon as possible, please.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPrincipal\nDecember 17, 1948.\n\nMr. H.

The pipe which supplies the basins with cold water has begun to leak in several places at the same time. Examination shows that this is due to corrosion.\n\nIt is out of the question to attempt to patch this up in a few places and hope to solve the problem that way. That pipe will need to be replaced right through. Since there are several basins attached to it, there is a good deal of labour involved. Thus the job will come outside the field of normal maintenance.\n\nSince this is an emergency (it has been necessary to shut off the cold water entirely from the basins) I shall have to cope with the situation at once. I shall give you a rough estimate of the cost of this job as soon as I can get a figure from the plumber.\n\nMay I request authority to remove as much piping as necessary in the boys' playroom at this time.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDec. 21, 1948,\n\nCecilia Jeffrey Residential School\n\nMemorandum of December 6th, 1948, enclosing report of Donald Inspection Limited on the above school has been removed from this file and placed in a special drawer in our records.\n| QUANTITY | PREVIOUS NO. | SHORTAGE NO. | LIST | GROSS | DISCOUNT | TOTAL |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|------|-------|----------|-------|\n|          |              |              |      |       |          |       |\n|          |              |              |      |       |          |       |\n|          |              |              |      |       |          |       |\n\nCRANE LIMITED\n93 LOMBARD STREET,\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\nTELEPHONE: 88-811\n\nCHARGE TO:\n\nSHIP TO:\n\nVIA:\n\nDATE: June 20, 1940\n\nINVOICE NUMBER:\n\nYOUR ORDER NUMBER:\n\nNO CLAIMS FOR SHORTAGES ALLOWED UNLESS MADE WITHIN FIVE DAYS AFTER RECEIPT OF GOODS.\n\nCLAIMS WILL BE ALLOWED FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE TO GOODS WHICH HAVE PROVEN DEFECTIVE IN MANUFACTURE WILL BE REPLACED IF CLAIM IS MADE WITHIN FIVE DAYS FROM DATE OF SHIPMENT.\n| Quantity | Previous No. | Shortage No. | List | Gross | Discount | Total |\n|----------|--------------|--------------|------|-------|----------|-------|\n| 1        |              |              |      |       |          |       |\n| 2        |              |              |      |       |          |       |\n| 3        |              |              |      |       |          |       |\n\nNo claims for shortages allowed unless made within five days after receipt of goods.\n\nNo claims will be allowed for labor or damage.

The directive recently received dealing with the subject of \"Indian Athletics\" is most illuminating. I sincerely appreciate having such valuable ideas brought clearly to my attention.\n\nIn seeking to make use of the suggestions made, by planning an active sports program for the pupils in this school, I find myself seriously handicapped by lack of equipment. With no facilities for indoor sport in this school, it is necessary for us to rely still upon outdoor sports. As we will be away from the closed reservations, we have only a very limited quantity of hockey equipment, skates for only a percentage of our pupils, and almost no equipment for skiing and tobogganing.\n\nI fully realize that this requisition is being submitted at a very late date. Much of it should have been requested before my arrival at this school. I should have appreciated the need, and understood the paramount importance of sports for our Indian boys and girls, much earlier in this term. That I have failed to do so I sincerely regret.\n\nYour directive on this subject has effectively brought this need to my attention. May I ask that this requisition be approved as quickly as possible, in order that this school may begin the type of winter sports program which will be in accordance with the wishes of the Department of Indian Affairs. If these supplies can reach us early in the new year, they will make a tremendous difference to the sports life of this school.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

There are two additional jobs on the heating system which are very imperative. The steam coil inside the hot water tank is leaking, and will require repair or replacement. Also, there must be a radiator in the water tank room. The one that is present in that room is attached to the steam line which leads to the chapel (a part of the main building which is seldom used for more than a few hours at a time) and hence is only heated when steam is turned on in the chapel line. I have been given an estimate - shown below - on the cost of installing a radiator which can be heated independently. The importance of having this done at once cannot be over-emphasized; when one knows that twice already during this winter it has been impossible to keep that tank room sufficiently warm to keep water from freezing in the glass gauge on the water tank.\n\nThe following is estimated cost:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Straighten pipe line to residence and replace traps throughout school | $600.00|\n| Repair or replace leaking coil in hot water tank | $75.00 |\n| Completely install radiator in tank room, including necessary pipe | $75.00 |\n\nTotal: $750.00\n\nMay I request that this expenditure be approved.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Plumbing Fixtures,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School\n\nIn reply to your telegram of the 21st instant, in regard to the above noted subject, I would now advise that a letter has been received from the Principal of this school, a copy of which is attached, in which he states that this work would require an expenditure of approximately $25.00.\n\nI would recommend that this expenditure be authorized.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nAttachments\nCecilia Jeffrey School,\nKensore, Ontario,\nDec 27, 1948.\n\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent\nKensore Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nFurther to my letter dated Dec 17, 1948,\nand to our subsequent conversation on this subject:\nI have asked Lakeside Plumbing & Heating\nfor an estimate on this job, and have been given the\nfollowing figures:-\n\nRepairs to basin drainage 56.75\nMaterial to renew pipes to basins 96.25\nLabour 70.00\nTotal 223.00\n\nMay I request that this expenditure be\nauthorized.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, December 27, 1948.\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kenora, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to Major Mackay's memorandum of December 17th bearing your notation of the 20th instant, together with a copy of Principal T.C. Ross' letter to Indian Superintendent Paterson under date of December 6th, you are advised as follows:\n\nNo inspection of the heating system has been carried out by this Division and the only information we have in this connection has been supplied by the Donald Inspection Company who have recently submitted a report.\n\nThis report merely describes the heating system in general, in one short paragraph with no detailed information whatsoever. It is impossible to comment without full technical details and the data should be obtained during the heating season by an officer conversant with this phase of the work.\n\nNo previous complaints with regard to the heating system are noted on our files. We are not surprised however, to learn that trouble is developing after years of operation. It has been observed that normal yearly maintenance is seldom given the attention it merits in these schools and due to this omission and normal depreciation, it is not surprising to note that Mr. Ross has found it necessary to carry out some work immediately.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch concur with our suggestion that an inspection of the heating system should be carried out, we will endeavour to assign one of our officers to the work when arrangements can be made. Until such a time as an inspection can be carried out, it will not be possible to provide any kind of an estimate of the cost of executing the necessary work.\n\nIn the meantime, while certain parts of the building may be uncomfortable as Mr. Ross has suggested, we see no prospect of grave consequences if this inspection should be delayed for several weeks or longer.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nR.A.

Thank you for having this matter attended to so satisfactorily.\n\nI wish to exercise the greatest care in maintaining this machine in the best possible way. I have been informed by others who are using the same type that trouble can be avoided by using specially prepared solutions. In this vicinity one of these machines is giving continuous good service using a solution known as Chlorox. It appears that the use of such solutions avoids the possibility of having pipes clogged with particles of solid, as will occur when solutions are prepared only with what apparatus is available to the average engineer, such as our own.\n\nThe cost of Chlorox is I believe about two dollars and half per doz. (five gallon container). For an initial charge there is an extra charge per container.

Your letter with its attached memorandum has caused me to review our correspondence on the subject.\n\nOn October 23rd, having found that the heating system was in such shape that it could not be depended upon, I wrote you requesting authority to proceed with some very essential work on it. As the weather became colder, pipes began to freeze, and our residence became so cold that we were unable to sleep at night. Although your department had given me no authority to do so I found it necessary to meet this emergency by proceeding with some of the more essential work. To date I have received no authority for any expenditures on the heating system.\n\nThe information you have given me is most encouraging. It seems that two well-qualified technicians have been engaged to repair this building. One of them is the same man who repaired my house. His report has been very good, and contributes nothing but sunshine. Since the other man, a dear friend of mine, called before him I assure you that he will be able to do his work efficiently.\n\nI am enclosing a receipt for $5.00 which I have paid for the work done today.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJAN 20 1949\n\nKENORA INDIAN AGENCY\nOttawa, 25th January, 1949.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDIRECTOR, LANDS & DEVELOPMENT SERVICES\n\nRe: Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School - Your File IA 1372-1\n\nWith reference to our memorandum of 22nd January, 1949, and previous correspondence regarding the heating system at the above school, I attach for your information a copy of a letter which we have just received from the Principal of the school.\n\nPP/UT Attach.\n\nDirector.\n25th January, 1949.\n\nMr. Norman Peterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th instant enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, with reference to the heating system.\n\nIn view of the contents of your letter, there seems to be no other action we can take except to pay approximately $300.00.\n\nHowever, you should tell Mr. Ross very definitely that in future the Department will not be responsible for any expenditure he incurs for which he expects the Department to pay, unless previous authority has been received through your office.\n\nBernard P. Henry,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nJanuary 18th, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing to ask if you would mind giving us some information re the salary cheques sent for the night watchman and the manual training teacher for the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School; and also for the manual training teacher at Birtle. In the Treasurer's office we have been notified that the night watchman's salary was last received for July, 1948; and the manual training teacher's salary was paid to the end of June.\n\nLast week the salary cheque for the night watchman was received amounting to $160.00 and on the enclosure with it was the note that it was for October to December. The night watchman's salary is at the rate of $40.00 per month.\n\nAs far as Birtle is concerned we have received the manual training teacher's salary to the end of October and are hoping that the balance will be received before too long.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would give us what information you have concerning these salaries and the months for which you consider they are paid so that we may pass it on to our Treasurer's Department.\n\nMay I say that I am sorry to trouble you about this matter.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPride E.

However, the short paragraph in their report which refers to the heating system contains no data on what it does or the requirements. There is a mild suggestion that a vacuum pump be installed to improve matters. This suggestion is enlarged upon to some extent in their letter of February 5th, but there is no evidence of any analysis or examination of the heating system having been made to determine if the installation of a vacuum pump would accomplish the desired results.\n\nReference is made at this point, to a letter from the Donald Inspection Company dated May 12th, 1948, under heading \"Re: Inspection and Maintenance Report for Indian Schools\". Item E in this letter calls for a \"full report covering electrical, water, plumbing and heating systems\". The report received in connection with the above school, makes only casual reference to the services mentioned in item E, and most certainly can not be considered as a report on which technical advice can be offered.\n\nFor your information and in response to the Donald Inspection Company's suggestion covering the installation of a vacuum pump, we point out that since the present heating system has been in operation since the building was erected, there is every possibility that numerous leaks have developed in the return piping and under such circumstances, a vacuum pump would not perform satisfactorily until such lines were repaired or replaced. It will take far more than a casual inspection to determine how much piping is in need of renewal or repair, along with a complete check-up of all the auxiliary elements which go to make up the heating system. Such an inspection must be carried out by someone qualified in that line of work if the results are to be of any value.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch have concurred with our suggestion that an inspection should be carried out by one of our officers, as soon as his services can be spared. It is our intention to have this survey conducted before the present heating season ends, in order that the equipment may be tested and examined under working conditions.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMr. Ross' letter indicates some impatience at the delay in carrying out work at this school. It should be borne in mind that the large and ever increasing volume of work which this Division is being called upon to handle, has made it impossible to assign an officer to visit Kenora up to this time. It is thought probable that our heating engineer may be assigned to this duty within the next two to three weeks.\n\nT.S. Miller\nChief Engineer\n23rd February, 1949.\n\nMr. N. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of 20th January, 1949, and previous correspondence in connection with the heating system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School, the following additional report has been received from the Lands and Development Services Branch:\n\n\"It will take far more than a casual inspection to determine how much piping is in need of renewal or repair, along with a complete check-up of all the auxiliary elements which go to make up the heating system.

The boiler was removed and replaced by a Vulcan Iron Works steam heating boiler having a capacity calculated to carry the entire load. The remaining Spencer boiler is now used only for hot water.\n\nA new Vulcan boiler was installed with a control that can be controlled by an automatic pressure switch arranged to operate the fan to maintain a steady steam pressure in the boiler. This automatic switch has never been used or cared for, and is now plugged with dirt and rust and is inoperative. A manual control auxiliary switch is connected in such a manner that the fan may be run as desired, but it is evident that it has not been used recently.\n\n[signature]\n\nDirector,\n[signature]\n[signature]\nThere is little evidence that any investigations have been carried out against the present fireman-secretary.\nUpon receiving a copy of your letter, I have written to Mr. Smith in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to request him to obtain the plans and specifications for the school building. He has informed me that he will forward them to me as soon as possible.\n\nJ.

It is noted that you consider the heating system can be placed in good condition at a cost somewhat less than $6,000.00.\n\nFunds to the amount stated will be available in our appropriation for the fiscal year 1949-50, and we would appreciate it if you would proceed with the preparation of plans and specifications, and have Mr. Gow obtain prices from reliable firms in the area.\n\nPP/ST\n\nDirector.\n23rd March, 1949.\n\nMr. M. Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nEnclosed in an extract from a report we have received from the engineer who recently inspected the heating system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nI would direct your special attention to paragraphs 6 and 10. It is hoped that the school management will be able to obtain a competent fireman-caretaker at an early date.\n\nYou will note that the engineer left strict instructions with the Principal regarding the operation of the vertical high pressure boiler. You should make certain these instructions are carried out, and advise us when they have been put into effect.\n\nIt is our intention to make extensive repairs to the heating system during the coming summer, and the Lands and Development Services Branch are preparing the necessary plans and specifications.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

It has been necessary to rearrange the piping somewhat in order to permit the new pump to rest upon the same base as the old\u2014the new pump being quite different in design to the old.\n\nAlso, some of the old piping began to leak as soon as the plumbers started to dismantle it. This of course involved some additional work and expense.\n\nBecause your Department insists that the expense of this installation be kept to a minimum, I have not felt free to authorize any work being done to increase the size of the cement base upon which the new pump rests. But I feel sure that a competent engineer would agree with me that the installation of this pump can not be considered complete and correct until the size of the base has been increased to at least the same dimensions as the bottom of the metal frame which supports both pump and motor. As installed the metal frame supporting the motor and pump protrudes inches in each direction beyond the edges of the cement base. My knowledge of mechanics is fairly elementary, but it suggests that this is not a sufficiently sound support for a pump and motor of this type which must be considered permanent. I should be pleased to be given an early and authoritative opinion upon this.\n\nIt is very gratifying to feel that there is now one pump which may be depended upon to keep us supplied with water. I wish to express to your Department my sincere gratitude to them for having provided this school with this valuable piece of equipment.\n\nSgd. T.

B. F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOnce again I am writing you concerning salary cheques for the night watchman at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School. We are grateful to you for the increase in the allowance from $60.00 to $80.00 per month for the night watchman. This will lighten our burden to quite an extent.\n\nFrom our Treasurer's department comes word, though, that there is still confusion concerning statements we have received with the salary cheques of the night watchman.\n\nIn regard to the cheque received January 10th, 1949, the statement No. 5037 reads - night watchman, October to December $180.00.\n\nThen another statement No. 5044, dated March 10th, is for October, 1948 to March, 1949 $180.00.\n\nIn looking over our receipts for 1948, with the statement No. 5075B, dated February 10th, for September, October, November, December and January there was a cheque for $200.00.\n\nIn April we received another cheque for $180.00 with the statement No. 3791B, marked January to March.\n\nYou will note in checking these statements that we did not receive any amount for the period March to October.\n\nIn summing this up it would appear that we have received as follows for the year 1948:\n6th April, 1949.\n\nMiss F.R. Matthews,\nNational Executive Secretary,\nWomen's Missionary Society, W.D.,\nof the Presbyterian Church of Canada,\nRoom 800 - 100 Adelaide St., W.,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss Matthews:\n\nWe have your letter of the last instant with reference to payment towards the salary of the night watchman at the Cecilia Jeffrey School.\n\nThe usual period for which we allow a grant for the above purpose, is from 1st October to the subsequent April 30th. This covers the school season in practically all the schools. According to our records, we find that the cheque for $200.00 (paragraph 5 of your letter) was issued for the five months stated in your letter, namely September, October, November and December, 1947, and January, 1948, at $40.00 a month. As a matter of fact, we should only have issued a cheque for $160.00, as we do not pay for the month of September.\n\nIn April, 1948, you were forwarded a cheque for $120.00, being the amount due for January, February and March, 1948.\n\nIn July, 1948, we forwarded you a cheque for $40.00 for the month of April, 1948.\n\nIn December, 1948, we forwarded you a cheque for $120.00 for the amount due for October, November and December, 1948. This was a mistake, as we should have allowed you $60.00 a month for these three months.\nIn March you were forwarded a cheque for \u00a3240.00 being payment at $60.00 a month for the months of January, February and March, 1949, and $60.00 being the balance due for the months of October, November and December, 1948.\n\nAccording to our records you have, therefore, been paid in full for the allowance towards the salary of the night watchman, namely $60.00 a month from October to the subsequent April 30th.\n\nThere will be another payment of $60.00 due you for the month of April. I trust the above has been of assistance to you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

A copy of this letter is attached for your information.\n\nMay I refer you to the last paragraph in which Mr. Ross asks if the Department would assist in paying the salary of a qualified engineer, and recommend that some action be taken in this regard.\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency.\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nRe HEATING SYSTEM\n\nIt was indeed satisfying to receive your letter and the extracts from Mr. Hargreaves' report. It is only such an efficient technical man who can really supply us with the correct answers to our problems. It was pleasing to note Mr. Hargreaves' fairness in commenting both on the limitations of our engineer-stoker and the need for repair to our heating system. The definite assurance that the Department is making plans for extensive repairs to the heating system during the coming summer removes a great deal of anxiety from my mind.\n\nI am glad to have Mr. Hargreaves' opinion as confirmation to my own view that a younger and able man is needed for the caretaking job here. I had already decided that it would be advisable to make a change before next winter.\n\nHowever, you will realize that it is not easy to obtain the most efficient of workmen at the salary we are able to pay. I do not anticipate being able to replace the present man overnight, but I shall certainly try to do so, and shall inform you as soon as I am able.\n\nI am indeed grateful to Mr. Hargreaves for bringing the matter of the high pressure boiler to my attention. His instructions have of course been carried out. I might add that I myself was amazed to find when I arrived at this school that it has been customary for many years to have this boiler operated by the laundry matron. She has done so successfully for many years now, and, with the heating system in such poor shape, it has required no more of her engineering-stoker's time during the winter months to try to keep the building comfortable than she has been able on her own much of the time.\n\nSince this matter has been brought so clearly to my attention, I have wondered if it might be advisable to obtain a little clearer direction on the subject. If it is necessary to have this boiler operated by an individual having first class steam engineering certificate, why should not provision be made by the Department for paying the salary which should reasonably be expected by an individual possessing those qualifications?\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Wiring at the Cecilia Jeffrey Residential School.\n\nAttached hereto please find a copy of a letter received from the Principal of the above school, Mr. T.C.

It has obviously been subjected to undue heat from the coal stove which for many years has been used to heat the building. This has caused the material to become exceedingly brittle, and attempts to patch it only in places will be futile.\n\nThe plank flooring is very draughty and will need to be covered with battleship linoleum. This will allow for the building being maintained at an even temperature, and will of course ensure longer wear from the new machinery which has been installed in it.\n\nThe following is estimated cost for having these repairs made:\n\n950 sq ft tentent @ $65.00 per thousand = $35.76\n16 sq yd battleship linoleum @ $3.25 = $52.00\nPaint = $10.60\nLabour = $7.82\n\nTotal = $102.26\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n25th April, 1949.\n\nMr. F.

We have also received your letter of the 4th instant in which you refer to your report of November 23rd, 1948, regarding the fire escape.\n\nWe have already authorized an expenditure of $6,000.00 for extensive repairs to the heating system at this school. This work will be carried out under direction of the Lands & Development Services Branch. It is doubtful if we will have funds in the current year's appropriation for extensive repairs at the Cecelia Jeffrey School other than those already authorized.\n\nHowever, we are bringing the matters mentioned in your two letters to the attention of the Lands & Development Services Branch, and when any of their officials visits the school he can discuss these matters with the Principal.

The electric wiring in the basement of the school is also dangerous.\"\n\nIt is doubtful if we will have the funds in the current year's appropriation for extensive repairs additional to those that have already been authorized. However, someone of your officials will be at this school in connection with the repair to the heating system; we would appreciate it if you could have him discuss the other matters mentioned in this memorandum with the Principal with a view to determining if immediate action is necessary, and if so, he should submit an estimate of the cost involved.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Lindstrom and Nilson Ltd.,\nAddress: Kenora, Ontario\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1949 | June 10 | To account rendered as per vouchers attached\n\nTo supplying material (Tentset) for the Royalty of the Pumphouse at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School under purchase order No. 43582, dated 14 May 1949 file 22754-4/7 Ont.\n\nTotal 30 89\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

In other similar jobs firply sheathing covered with battleship linoleum and heavy kraft paper has proved quite satisfactory. This would appear to be the most satisfactory and the most economical method of replacing these floors.\n\nThe following quantities of materials will be needed:\n\n- 645 sq yds AA battleship linoleum\n- 6160 sq ft heavy kraft paper\n- 62 gal LINOCRIP (glue)\n- 666 sq ft 5/16\" firply sheathing\n- 20 lbs nails\n- 680 ft \u00bc round\n\nNET prices quoted by local merchants for these materials are:\n\n- $1.00 per yd for AA battleship linoleum\n- $0.15 per 400 sq ft heavy kraft paper\n- $1.50 per gal for LINOCRIP\n- $102.00 per lb for 5/16 firply sheathing\n- 13\u00a2 per lb for nails\n- $2.70 per 100 ft \u00bc round\n\nThus if purchased locally, materials could be obtained for approximately $2900.00.\n\nOne local contractor, who would be available to do the work, has quoted me the price of $720.00 per lb for material and labour, after the old flooring has been removed. At this price, the expenditure involved would be $4,435.20.\n\nI am quite prepared to arrange to have this work done if authorised to spend $400.00 for labour, and supplied with materials listed, or authorised to purchase them.

Ross, in connection with the repair of the dormitory floors at this school.\n\nMr. Ross in his letter points out that if the Department will supply the material he will undertake to have the work involved completed by the members of his school staff during the summer holiday period.\n\nIt is recommended that some action in this regard be taken, and your advice and comments in this matter will be greatly appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

It was one of the subjects mentioned to the Regional Supervisor on the occasions of his visits to this school.\n\nThe recent visit of the Grand Jury, and their report on this school, has served as a further reminder to the necessity for having this work done soon. Their report, published by the press, was most unfavorable to this school as a whole, but referred to the condition of the dormitory floors as being \"unsanitary\". This is of course no exaggeration. The floors have worn through the top layer of varnish in several places. It is quite impossible to keep the floors clean in their present state. The rough surfaces produce numerous slivers for the many little feet which move daily over their surfaces. In fact it is imperative that these floors be renewed before the beginning of another term.\n\nI have discussed this matter with more than one authority on flooring, and have been advised that the present floor surface has reached a state of wear so great that the only solution is to remove the pre-cut top layer of flooring completely, replace it with a complete new layer of flooring, and cover this with battle-hip linoleum. I wish to be given authority to have this work done during the summer holidays.\n\nWhile making this request I am carefully considering the probable expense involved, and am avoiding asking to have any work done that is not badly needed. There is much more of the flooring that should be replaced, but I...\nam prepared to wait for a year to do that, believing that most of the remaining flooring will stand a further year's use without being worn to such an extent that the cost of replacement or scrubbing will be unduly increased by the effect. However, the four large dormitory floors must be replaced during this summer. It is utterly impossible to consider trying to keep children clean and healthy with the floors of their living quarters in such condition.\n\nIf your Department will approve the purchase of the material for this work I believe that I can arrange to have much of the work involved done by members of my staff during the summer months. If I receive a prompt answer authorizing me to proceed with this, I shall try to arrange to keep the Manual Instructor throughout the summer. He does excellent work, and would be quite capable of doing this work.\n\nIn making this request, I am not asking for authority for a definite amount to be expended. I am asking for the material and I do not know what price flooring and linoleum, felt (or paper), glue, etc can be obtained by your Department for.

There is no question but that they have to be repaired. The suggestion of the Superintendent and Principal appears to be sound and the most economical.\n\nI would recommend that arrangements be made to have the work proceeded with as soon as the school term is over in June. Might I point out that unless the work is done during the summer holidays that progress will be slower and more costly. Therefore, I strongly commend that the Departmental Purchasing Agent be requested to accept the tender submitted for the material and that an accountable advance of $400.00 be made to Mr. Paterson to cover any extra labour required to complete the job on time.\n\nP.

Mr. Gow has forwarded to this office tenders from the following firms:\n\nLakeside Plumbing and Heating Company,\nKenora, Ontario.................................$9,500.00\n\nRandall and Company Limited,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.............................$9,466.00\n\nJohn Plaxton and Co.

We also would like to do work additional to that called for on our plans and specifications. The Lakeside Plumbing and Heating Co., also expressed a desire to do some additional work.\n\nIt has been our experience based on the result of numerous inspections of Indian Residential Schools by our heating engineer, to note that in order to bring the heating and plumbing systems up to present day standards, much more work would be required than we have been in the habit of recommending, to carry out all the work necessary to achieve modern and up to date systems in every respect, would involve sums of money, which would be hard to justify. Taking the character of the buildings into consideration together with their age and the general condition of maintenance throughout, and not overlooking the type of men engaged on the boiler room staff, it was felt that the revisions should be held as fundamental and essential requirements, if the expenditures are to be justified. It is not recommended therefore that work additional to the plans and specifications be carried out at this time.\n\nOn the basis of prices received, it is recommended that the tender of the John Plaxton Co., Ltd., of Winnipeg, should be accepted.\n\nR.A.

The wire received from Col. Henry suggests that he believes that we have been supplied with flooring. If this had been so I could have gone ahead with laying the floors, and could have waited until a later date for the linoleum. However, as the material that we have acquired in what had been agreed was the most economical - simply sheathing - it is utterly useless to consider laying this without linoleum to cover it. You will likely be aware of the fact that this grade of plywood is not held together with waterproof glue. Thus, even a few weeks of wear will ruin the surface unless it is protected.\n\nI do hope that your Department will give me assurance quickly that the remainder of the material asked for will be made available. I dare not face the possibility of going through another winter with such shockingly awful floors in the dormitories. They are splintered so badly that children can't help picking up slivers from them, and they are so badly worn that it is not possible for anyone to scrape them smooth, having water leak through the ceiling. Furthermore, I am ashamed to allow visitors to see the condition under which our Indian children are obliged to exist in their sleeping quarters.\n\nIf I am to complete this job before school opens, I must have prompt assurance that the materials asked for will be made available quickly. I am doing everything in my power to see that this job is done because it needs doing badly.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nP.S. Check to: [illegible]\nMr. Norman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\n\nDear Mr. Paterson:\n\nNO DRAINAGE DITCH\n\nI discovered, at very short notice, that the municipal authorities had gone ahead with plans for the construction of a drainage ditch, part of which will cross this school's property. It is evident that someone had omitted to ensure that permission had been obtained from your Department. I am not sure that the fault was altogether that of local officials, but I am inclined partly to blame. At any rate, although I have perfectly good reason for believing that the project had been discussed before my time, there is nothing on file here to prove that there was correspondence concerning the project.\n\nIf there had been any reasonable shadow of doubt in my mind that your Department would object to the construction of the above portion of this ditch on the school property, I should have refused to allow the work to proceed. However, as the construction of this ditch is obviously an improvement to the school property, and as it is part of an improvement program being carried out by the Department of Agriculture, I felt quite justified in allowing this work to be done. I was given less than twenty-four hours' notice by the municipality, and so was unable to obtain proper authority from your Department. This is regrettable but was unavoidable at the time.\n\nThe construction of this ditch has involved a small expenditure on our part, and I shall give you full details concerning this. The ditch must cross a road on our property. This road is in constant use. Oats are daily proceeding from our barn to pasture, and the farm manager is obliged to pass it frequently when taking farm machinery etc. From the school to the fields beyond. Because it is in constant use, a bridge or crossing has to be constructed as soon as the ditch is completed at this point. The most economical way of doing this is to install a suitable size of culvert, and construct a proper \"fill\" at the point where\nthe road and ditch intersect. This is in process of being done. The Department of Highways agreed to lend the necessary culvert at short notice, and I have agreed to replace it. I have taken members of my staff from other work in order to provide the necessary labour.\n\nI sincerely regret the circumstances which have necessitated my incurring an expenditure such as this, without first obtaining authority from your Department. I telephoned you before making any of these arrangements, hoping that, under the circumstances, you would feel justified in concurring with my action and would feel justified in authorising what is a necessary expenditure and not a lavish one. The fact that you did not feel free to do so of course left me to make this decision alone. I have incurred this expenditure, believing that it was the only course at the time. I have done so believing that it was in the best interests of this school and your Department that I do so. I am fully aware of the fact that this expenditure may not be authorized, and that I may be obliged to meet it from my own resources. But I am confident that I have taken the only wise course.\n\nAs soon as I can obtain an exact price for the culvert used, I shall inform you. I believe that the cost is about $64.00. I request authority for this expenditure.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nRe: Drainage Ditch,\nCecilia Jeffrey Indian Res. School\n\nA letter has been received from Mr. T.C. Ross, Principal of the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, advising that the Municipality of Jeffrey are widening the drainage ditch and a portion of this ditch runs thru the school property.\n\nA copy of Mrs Ross' letter is hereto attached for your information.\n\nThe culvert has been placed and the approaches filled in by the Municipality. The culvert can be replaced from Lindstrom and Nelson of Kenora at a cost of $91.04.\n\nIt is recommended that authority be granted for this expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\nNorman Paterson,\nSuperintendent,\nKenora Indian Agency.\nSeptember 13th, 1949.\n\nMr. N. Peterson,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nKenora, Ontario.\n\nRe: Cecelia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Your File 129/30-4-461\n\nWe have your letter of the last instant enclosing a letter from the Principal of the Cecelia Jeffrey School with regard to the widening of the drainage ditch by the Municipality of Jeffrey.\n\nMr. Ross had no right to allow this work to proceed without informing the Department through your office, and obtaining our consent. However, there is nothing much we can do about the matter now, as the work has apparently already been completed. We trust, however, that Mr. Ross will not make a similar mistake in future.\n\nMr. Ross' letter mentions an amount of $64.00 for the new culvert. Your letter states $91.04. We cannot understand why we have received two different amounts, and consequently, we approve the amount mentioned by the Principal, namely $64.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Harrisons & Crossfield Ltd.,\nAddress: 1277 Winnipeg Ave., Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Sept 14 | To account rendered as per vouchers attached | $2.40 |\n\nTo supplying one drum of Chlorox to be used in the chlorinating system at the Cecilia Jeffrey Indian Residential School, Kamloops.\n\nVote: 516-\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material herein supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.
