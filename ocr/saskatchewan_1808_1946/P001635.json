LOUIS DE LANGEVIN, ST. LAURENT OR BATOCH\u00c9,\nAND DUCK LAKE.\n\nOTTAWA:\nPRINTED BY MACLEAN, ROGER & CO., WELLINGTON STREET.\n1886\nPRINCE ALBERT, N.W.T.,\n14th December, 1885.\n\nHon. Thomas White,\nMinister of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\u2014In accordance with instructions received from you during your late visit to the North-West, that I should, during my present visit to this District, collect all possible information regarding the alleged causes of the recent unfortunate outbreak in the North-West, I have the honor to report as follows. The six alleged causes are the following:\n\n1. That the Half-breed settlers did not receive patents for their lands, through delays, the fault solely of the Government, which rendered it impossible for them to obtain entry for the lands settled upon;\n2. That, owing to the system of surveys, these parties were unable to obtain the land they had settled on and improved prior to survey;\n3. That they were entitled to the same rights as had been accorded to the Half-breeds of Manitoba;\n4. That the lands on which they had for years resided had been sold over their heads to others, chiefly speculators;\n5. That the timber dues have proved very onerous to them, and were a grave cause of dissatisfaction; and\n6. That the dues for cutting hay on Government lands were also onerous, and a cause of great dissatisfaction.\n\nThe Half-breed outbreak has been confined wholly to those living on the south branch of the Saskatchewan River, above Range 26 west of 2nd Meridian, and those in the vicinity of and immediately west of that river, in the neighborhood of Duck Lake, as shown by the lists enclosed, prepared with great care and from the best information possible. Louis Marion, a very intelligent Half-breed, who has lived in the vicinity of Duck Lake since 1880; Louis Schmidt, a Half-breed, who lived from 1881 to 1884 in Township 45, Range 1, west 3rd; Baptiste Boyer, a Half-breed, who during the past ten years has lived in the vicinity of Batoche; and George Duck, lately Agent of Dominion Lands, Prince Albert, are my authorities for other information than that which has been obtained from the affidavits of the parties themselves, it being necessary to obtain information from other sources than the said affidavits, as many of the claimants have not come forward, although repeatedly requested to do so, and give evidence in support of their land claims. The lists include, I think, every Half-breed who is a settler on or claimant to land in that District, and who with their families constituted probably upwards of 95 per cent. of the Half-breeds who took an active part, as followers of Riel, in the late outbreak. The remainder were strangers who had no interest in the country or cause, but were attracted by the excitement and pillage incident to all such outbreaks; some few probably took part because their hearts were in it.\n\nDuring my first visit to Prince Albert, in August, 1883, I instructed Mr. Gauvreau, then Assistant Agent, a French Canadian, to visit every French settler, Half-breed or otherwise, in the District, ascertain what particular quarter-section he was on, and urge him to make entry. This he did; but, although the Roman Catholic priest urged them in a like manner, for some reason or other they failed to do so. Some were deterred through ignorance, thinking that they would have to pay taxes; others have stated that they feared if they did so the Government might call upon them to bear arms, but against what foe does not appear to have been very clear to them. Like all ignorant people, a few designing, mischievous men who have their ear, can work on their ignorance and prejudices for the advancement of their own selfish ends. This is particularly noticeable in the case of those who settled subsequent to survey along the South Saskatchewan River. In spite of the fact that every Dominion Land...\nAct which has ever been in force has contained a provision making it an illegal proceeding to settle on land subsequent to survey without first obtaining entry thereto, the necessity of which is obvious, many of them have done so, while others have squatted on odd sections, Hudson's Bay Company and School lands, knowing that they were set apart and not open for Homestead entry. It is said that they were urged to settle in this manner by certain parties who for some reason or another thought it advisable to concentrate settlement along the banks of the river as much as possible. While on this point it might be as well to direct your attention to the fact that the contention has always been for ten chain lots, and that many have preferred and all would prefer, if the land were available, claims of twenty chains; whereas, many of the leaders in the movement have preferred claims and entered by quarter-sections, thus by their own acts protesting against the ten chain contention.\n\nAnother, and the strongest point, is that except in the cases of the claimants to those portions of Sections 1, 2, 11 and 12, lying east of the Saskatchewan in Township 45, Range 1, west 3rd, every other settler could practically obtain what he desired, by taking legal subdivisions or portions thereof, as has since been done. I explained this to the Rev. P\u00e8re Andr\u00e9, in an interview which I had with him in the autumn of 1883, as I also did to the Rev. P\u00e8re V\u00e9gr\u00e9ville and Mr. Charles Nolin, in an interview in January, 1884. In fact, whenever the question came up I urged these people to take their claims in this way if they insisted in settling in this manner, thus saving the expense of a re-survey and the delay incident to the same, stating also that the Government, having once surveyed the country, would not be justified in going to the expense of a re-survey merely to suit the ideas of those who settled subsequent to such survey, and further, that those who were there prior to the survey would have strong grounds for insisting on entry being given as the law and system of survey required, viz., by quarter section. If the Government in these cases made a re-survey at the public expense, every other community and settlement throughout the whole country would have as good grounds for having surveys changed to suit their convenience, whims, or caprice. Other officials of the Government have also explained this to them. In all the interviews with these people they stated that they had been promised a river-lot survey. They seem to have based this assertion on the promises made by the Minister of the Interior to the Revd. P\u00e8re Leduc and Mr. Maloney of St. Albert, which was that when several had settled together prior to survey, and whose holdings could not be made to conform to the sectional system of survey, in such cases, the river lot system of survey would be adopted. Attention should be particularly directed to the fact that in all the petitions and letters presented by P\u00e8re Leduc and Mr. Maloney to the Minister of the Interior, not the slightest mention is made of the settlers on the South Saskatchewan desiring river lots. They represented the settlers at St. Albert, Edmonton and Fort Saskatchewan. In the petition presented by P\u00e8re Leduc and Mr. Maloney the settlers asked treatment similar to that which has been granted the settlers in Manitoba, and also at Prince Albert in the North-West. This treatment had been granted to the settlers on the South Saskatchewan in the river lot survey of the Parish of St. Laurent. Some considerable delay in granting entry occurred owing to \"One Arrow's\" Indian Reserve coming so close to the river that many of the lots could not have their two miles, which the settlers insisted on having. To this the consent of the Indians had first to be obtained and the necessary change in the survey effected and the plans prepared, so that it was not till November, 1884, that the office was in a position to grant entry.\n\nAlong the South Saskatchewan, outside the Parish of St. Laurent, prior to the survey, there were only seventeen families settled, and they extended along 60 miles of the banks of the river (counting both banks). The contention that the expense of a survey into river lots of that area should have been made to suit that number of settlers is absurd. Further, there is yet no evidence to show that such a survey was desired, in fact, the actions of the majority would indicate the contrary. Every one of them could have obtained entry by a quarter or half of a half-section, covering all their improvements, without interfering with the claims of others. The lists show who those seventeen were.\nIn March, 1834, I instructed Mr. George Duck (the plan of the Parish of St. Laurent having just been received, the change in the survey of the Indian Reserve, however, not being effected until the following November,) to proceed to that parish to take evidence in support of those claims there, and all others above and below the same. He engaged the services of the Rev. P\u00e8re Andr\u00e9 to assist him in explaining to these people the object of his visit; he obtained applications from nearly all the claimants, from the upper part of the settlement down to the south limit of Township 45, Range 1, west 3rd. In this Township, owing to a bend in the river, there were several disputed claims, which at the time could only be arranged by making a traverse of the improvements, which is now being done. If, at the time of survey, these claimants in said portion of Township 45 had furnished the surveyors with the information necessary to adjust their claims, they could have been settled so soon as this Township was open for entry, viz., September, 1831; but, since then, through transfers and settlement by others theron, they have become very complicated. If, at any time since then, these parties in said portion of Township 45, had united and furnished the Department, by means of survey, with the information necessary, the whole matter might have been arranged and entry granted long since. Below that point the settlers had taken up their claims in such a way that, with the information on the Township map, the river keeping across the entire lands claimed in an almost due easterly course, it was not deemed necessary to visit them on the ground to adjust the claims; these parties it was thought would be able to state, on application at the office, what lands were claimed by them. Many, although notified to make their applications for entry, refused to do so, in some cases purposely leaving their houses when visited for that purpose, and acting in this manner although urged by their priests and others to do as requested.\n\nThe information and evidence obtained by Mr. Duck having reached Winnipeg in June, shortly after I had started for Edmonton and Battleford to investigate and adjust the squatters' claims in those localities, Mr. Walsh deemed it advisable they should not be acted upon by the Land Board in my absence. On my return to Winnipeg, late in the autumn, they were taken up and the necessary recommendations made; and between the 27th February and the 6th March, 1835, all the claimants were notified to come forward and make entry; and those who were entitled to patent, having resided on their claims three years, were informed that upon their applying for patent the same would issue without delay. Only one entry has since been made, and that was by the Rev. P\u00e8re Moulin, on behalf of the Corporation of the Revds. P\u00e8res Oblats.\n\nFor convenience the lists have been divided into three classes, and I trust that the information contained in such lists of claimants before referred to, and the remarks thereon, will be found sufficiently full and explicit. These three classes are as follows:\n\n1. Those who settled on the west bank of the Saskatchewan and in the neighborhood of Duck Lake, who since September, 1831, have had an opportunity to make entry for their lands and apply for their patents so soon as the necessary three years residence had been completed, so that the question of surveys or patents does not affect any in this list.\n\nThere are in this list 75 residents as claimants. Of these 14 had settled prior to the survey having been made on the ground, 2 of whom have not yet made entry. Prior to the land being open for entry, and subsequent to the field work being done, the records of the Prince Albert office show that four other parties had squatted on the land, none of whom have yet made entry, although for four years they could have done so any day they applied.\n\nIn 1831 entry was made by ........................................... 2 persons.\n1832 do .......................................................... 21\n1833 do .......................................................... 23\n1834 do .......................................................... 8\n1835 do .......................................................... 1\nThis makes a total of 55 claimants of this class who made entry, leaving 20 who have not yet made entry.\n\nOf those who effected entry 12 were natives of England, Switzerland, the Provinces of Ontario or Quebec.\n\nThree claimants have lands elsewhere, either entered as a homestead claimed by virtue of squatting, or having been squatted upon by others and purchased by them therefrom.\n\nNine have made application for patent, and to eight of them patents have issued, one application not having been approved on account of insufficient improvements.\n\n2. List of claimants to land along both banks of the Saskatchewan River south of Township 45, Range 1, Section 11, W. 3rd.\n\nThe line is drawn south of this township, because in it the river makes a bend of nearly 90\u00b0 to the east; above the bend the course of the river is very nearly due north; and below the bend nearly due east. As has been already explained, this enabled the claims to be laid out with a width of 10 chains fronting on the river and to be allotted by legal sub-divisions or fractional portions thereof without requiring a survey on the ground. This list includes the claims of 138 settlers, of whom 49 are on lots in the Parish of St. Laurent, which parish contains 71 lots, and of which the survey was completed in 1879, but owing to the dispute between the settlers and \"One Arrow\" Indians about the location of the Indian Reserve, as has been already mentioned, it was not till November, 1884, that entries could be granted them.\n\nWhen the plan was sent to the agent in March, 1884, so much time had elapsed after the survey had been done on the ground that it was feared complication might arise, and, as the result proved, disputes over certain of the claims had arisen; therefore, I, at that date, verbally instructed Mr. Duck not to grant entry until he had gone through the entire parish, and obtained the evidence necessary to adjust such disputes. So much time had been occupied in obtaining the requisite evidence, as has been explained, that the parties were not notified till late in the following February, or early in March, none later than the 6th March, to come forward and make entry. Out of the 138 only one has done so up to this date.\n\nOf the 89 remaining claimants, 15 had settled prior to survey, 8 of whom had made entries according to sectional survey, and are as follows:\n\n- Joseph Paranteau, entered 20th October, 1882; patent issued 10th November, 1884.\n- Isidore Dumont, jun., entered 16th February, 1883; patent issued 12th May, 1884.\n- Isidore Dumont, sen., entered 19th November, 1883; patent issued 9th May, 1884.\n- Abram B\u00e9langer, entered 2nd June, 1884; patent issued 8th November, 1884.\n- Pierre Garripie, entered 23rd February, 1883.\n- Rev. P\u00e8re Fourmond, entered 26th October, 1882.\n- Alex. P. Fisher, entered 22nd January, 1883.\n- Gabriel Dumont, entered 1st March, 1883.\n\nIsidore Dumont, sen., was the father of Gabriel Dumont (Riel's commander-in-chief) and of Isidore Dumont, jun.\n\nIn what is known as the Tourond Settlement, near Fish Creek, 12 had made entries according to the sectional survey, as follows:\n\n- Calixte Tourond, Township 41, Range 1, W. 3, entered 3rd March, 1884.\n- Pierre Tourond do 41 do 1, W. 3 do 10th March, 1884.\n- Patrice Tourond do 41 do 1, W. 3 do 3rd March, 1884.\n- Maurice Henry do 41 do 1, W. 3 do 12th June, 1884.\n- Napoleon Venn\u00e9 do 42a do 1, W. 3 do 15th March, 1884.\n- Roger Goulet do 42a do 1, W. 3 do 15th March, 1884.\n- William Fidler do 42a do 1, W. 3 do 26th March, 1884.\n- Pierre Bellegerde do 42a do 1, W. 3 do 26th March, 1884.\n- Toussaint Laplante do 41 do 2, W. 3 do 2nd June, 1884.\n- David Tourond do 41 do 2, W. 3 do 10th March, 1884.\n- Josephte Tourond do 41 do 2, W. 3 do 3rd March, 1884.\n- Elz\u00e9ar Tourond do 41 do 2, W. 3 do 3rd March, 1884.\nThese are not exactly on the river, but in the vicinity.\n\nIn this list 34 had resided on their lands three years.\n\nThe remaining 58 settled subsequent to survey without obtaining entry, and insisted on having the survey changed to suit their ideas.\n\nOut of the 138 claimants, 36 failed to furnish any evidence as to the nature of their claims; 8 had made entry, which, with the addition of the 12 in the Tourond settlement, made 20 in all, any of whom when entitled to patent could have obtained it on application; leaving 74 claimants who had filed evidence of occupation in the spring of 1884, and 8 who had made application, but who had made no settlement on the land.\n\nIn this list, those who had filed evidence settled in the following years:\n\n| Year | Within the Parish Survey | Outside |\n|------|--------------------------|---------|\n| 1872 | 2                        | 0       |\n| 1873 | 2                        | 0       |\n| 1874 | 2                        | 0       |\n| 1875 | 0                        | 1       |\n| 1876 | 0                        | 2       |\n| 1877 | 3                        | 1       |\n| 1878 | 1                        | 2       |\n| 1879 | 2                        | 2       |\n| 1880 | 4                        | 0       |\n| 1881 | 4                        | 6       |\n| 1882 | 7                        | 16      |\n| 1883 | 8                        | 7       |\n| 1884 | 2                        | 0       |\n\nIt will thus be seen that in the whole list 34 had resided 3 years on the land. If there were any more it is wholly their own fault that the Department was not seized of sufficient information to know whether they were entitled to patents or not. Twenty of these were within the river lot survey, and the delay in according entry thereto has already been explained; the remaining 14 could long ere this have had entry if they wished.\n\n3. List of claimants to land along the south bank, and in the vicinity of the South Saskatchewan River, below the south limit of Township 45, Range 1, west 3rd, known as St. Louis de Langevin, which list includes 45 claimants in all.\n\nOf these patent has issued to one, Michael Canny.\n\nNine of these have had opportunity to make entry since September, 1881, but only one has done so\u2014the said Michael Canny. Canny appeared before me in January or February, 1884, and made his application for patent, by quarter sections; his neighbours, Lepine, Nolin, Dumais and others, protested, on the ground that Canny had agreed with them that he would not make entry. They stated that they had all agreed not to make entry, thinking that, by such a course, the Government ultimately would re-survey the land along the river into river lots. Four of them have preferred claims, two through purchase, the other two through their own actions; but these come within the disputed portion in Township 45, Range 1, west 3rd, already alluded to. Entry could not be given on account of these parties not having furnished the information required to adjust their dispute. Of the remaining 32; 4 made entry in 1883, shortly after the land was open for entry; 2 made entry in 1885. The remainder have not yet applied for entry, but have furnished this month the evidence necessary to enable the Department to know what lands are claimed by them.\n\nIt might be well to mention that the part of Township 45, Range 28, west 2nd lying south of the Saskatchewan River, though not surveyed till 1882, had its west\nlimit run in 1877, and the part north of the river was surveyed in 1878, so that anyone settling in the portion north of the river since 1878, which was open for entry only in 1883, could have readily ascertained upon what lands he was situated.\n\nThirteen of the 55 claimants were on the land prior to survey, or at least before the land was open for entry, and could have obtained entry at any time on application; 3 settled on the land in 1872.\n\n| Settled on Land in | Year |\n|-------------------|------|\n| 1                 | 1879 |\n| 3                 | 1880 |\n| 6                 | 1882 |\n| 12                | 1883 |\n| 3                 | 1884 |\n| 4                 | 1885 |\n\nThirteen have not yet begun residence but are merely claimants, 6 have made homestead entry, so that in March, 1885, there were only 7 who by length of residence were entitled to patents and who could have obtained them if they had conformed to survey, and their right not disputed by others; 4 however were thus disputed as has already been mentioned.\n\nOut of the 258 claimants included in the 3 lists, 40 had resided on their claims 3 years, 20 could not obtain entry on account of the disputed boundary between the Parish of St. Laurent and \"One Arrow\" Indian reserve, as heretofore explained, 4 were the disputed claims in Township 45, Range 1 west 3rd, also explained, and the remaining 16 could have effected entry and made application if they had so desired. The 20 claimants in the Parish of St. Laurent were notified not later than the 6th March, 1885, that they could make entry and obtain patents.\n\nBut going back to, say 6th March, 1884, and assuming that the delay in granting entries in St. Laurent Parish was wholly the fault of the Government, we find that at that date only 10, or less than 4 per cent. of the 258 claimants were entitled to patents.\n\nOut of the 258 claimants, 175 are Manitoba half-breeds; 24 are enumerated as North-West half-breeds; 18 are enumerated as doubtful whether Manitoba, North-West, American or treaty-taking half-breeds; 39 are American treaty-taking half-breeds and others who are not half-breeds.\n\nOf the 24 enumerated as North-West half-breeds, 8 failed to appear before the Half-Breed Commission, and as neither descendants of them nor heirs thereto appeared, it may be safely argued that they were not entitled to any rights as North-West half-breeds.\n\nOf the 18 enumerated as doubtful, 16, or any descendants or heirs of them, failed to appear before the Half-Breed Commission, leaving 4 who possibly are North-West half-breeds.\n\nDeducting the 8 who failed to appear and adding the 4 doubtful ones who possibly are genuine, gives 20 North-West half-breeds, being less than 8 per cent. of the whole.\n\nTaking all who are enumerated as North-West half-breeds, and assuming those considered as doubtful, if correctly placed, would leave about the same proportion, so that less than 10 per cent. are North-West half-breeds.\n\nTaking all who are enumerated as North-West half-breeds, and doubtful, would make 44, which is but 17 per cent. of the whole.\n\nThe total number of applicants of male adults before the Half-Breed Commission at Duck Lake and Batoche were 15, women and children 52.\n\nNow we come to Riel's councillors and leaders in the agitation, other than Riel himself.\n\nGabriel Dumont, councillor in chief, a North-West half-breed, had made entry for his land on the 1st March, 1883, and if entitled to patent could have obtained it.\n\nJoseph DeLorme, second in command, a Manitoba half-breed, first made improvements on his claim in 1882 and began residence the same year; the total\nvalue of the improvements on his claim is $450.00. As he settled subsequent to survey he could have obtained entry had he conformed to the survey as made.\n\nPhilip Garnot, a native of the Province of Quebec, first began residence on a claim purchased from Charles Nolin in 1883, the improvements were valued by him at $900.00, and as he settled subsequent to survey he could have obtained entry had he conformed to survey.\n\nBaptiste Boucher, a Manitoba half-breed, first came to the Saskatchewan in 1882, and has never applied for entry.\n\nMoses Ouellette, a Manitoba half-breed, refused to appear to give evidence, so I cannot state as to his land claims, except that at the time of the outbreak he was a resident on a river lot in the Parish of St. Laurent.\n\nBaptiste Paranteau, a Manitoba half-breed, has been living on his claim, a river lot in the Parish of St. Laurent, since 1872.\n\nPierre Paranteau, sen., a Manitoba half-breed, first settled on a river lot in the Parish of St. Laurent in 1882.\n\nEmmanuel Champagne, a North-West half-breed, first settled on the land claimed by him in 1877, a river lot in the Parish of St. Laurent.\n\nNorbert Delorme, a Manitoba half-breed, first settled on a river lot in the Parish of St. Laurent in 1880.\n\nAeneas Poitras, sen., a Manitoba half-breed, first settled on his claim in 1876, and could have made entry and obtained patent since early in 1884 if he had so desired.\n\nJoseph Vandalle, a Manitoba half-breed, first settled on the land claimed by him in 1882, and could have made entry had he conformed to survey as made prior to his settlement.\n\nPierre Henry, a Manitoba half-breed, first settled on his claim in 1882, came to the Saskatchewan in the same year, could have made entry had he conformed to the survey as made.\n\nFran\u00e7ois Fiddler, a Manitoba half-breed, settled not prior to 1882, abstained from giving evidence, could have obtained entry had he conformed to survey made at the time of his settlement.\n\nDavid Tourond, a Manitoba half-breed, had a homestead entry in Township 41, Range 2, West 3rd, made entry on the 10th March, 1884; first came to the Saskatchewan in 1882.\n\nCalixte Tourond, a Manitoba half-breed, had a homestead entry in Township 41, Range 3, West 3rd, made entry 3rd March, 1884; first came to the Saskatchewan in 1882.\n\nMaxime Lepine, a Manitoba half-breed, settled on land subsequent to survey, but it being a school section and he knowing it was such, could not obtain entry, desired that it be given as a river lot, though from sales he has made to others he originally must have claimed at least 40 chains frontage on the river.\n\nAlexander Fisher, a Manitoba half-breed, made a homestead entry and had been told, prior to outbreak, that he could have his patent any time he applied for it.\n\nPhilip Garripie, a Manitoba half-breed, had claims on the river, one of which he sold to Hayter Reed in 1878. This claim according to the description would also cover parts of the claims of several other settlers and contained 400 acres, another claim was also sold by him to T. J. Agnew for $2,000, in 1882, which is described as the S. \u00bd, Section 12, Township 45, Range 1, West 3rd; he then went and squatted on land in about Township 43, Range 27, West 2nd, but neither himself nor family have ever preferred any evidence in support of same though knowing it was surveyed.\n\nCharles Nolin, a Manitoba half-breed, at one time Minister of Agriculture for Manitoba. He left Manitoba in 1878 or 1879 and settled at Touchwood Hills; after residing there for some time he sold the claim upon which he had been living and, in 1882, moved on to a claim in Township 42, Range 1, West 3rd, then surveyed. He lived a year on this land and then sold his claim to Philip Garnot, the Secretary of Riel's council, and in 1883 squatted on Section 11, Township 45, Range 28, West 2nd, a school section, and then surveyed.\nMichel Dumas, a Manitoba half-breed, first came to the country in 1880, settled on Section 11, Township 45, Range 28, West 2nd, and sold his claim to Thomas McKay in 1882; never applied for entry.\n\nNapol\u00e9on Nault, a Manitoba half-breed, a cousin of Riel, and who, with Lepine, is said to have, on the suggestion of Riel himself during his visit to Manitoba in 1883, started the agitation and so shaped matters that a delegation was appointed to proceed to Montana and invite him to come and head the movement on the Saskatchewan, first came to the district in 1878, had two claims, one lot 26, St. Laurent Parish, and the other on the west side of the river, nearly opposite. He might have made entry for the land on the west side of the river which has been opened for entry since September, 1881, he lived on this claim for some time and in 1882 removed to lot 26, St. Laurent, upon which he continued to reside up to the time of the outbreak.\n\nOf the 21 enumerated, which includes all those prominent in the movement and instigators of the outbreak:\n\nOne was a native of the Province of Quebec.\nOne was a North-West half-breed, and 19 were Manitoba half-breeds who had received their lands and scrip under the Manitoba Act in Manitoba, as either heads of families or as minors.\nFour had obtained entry and could have obtained patents if entitled thereto.\nEleven settled subsequent to survey, and could have obtained entry at the date of settlement had they conformed to the survey as then made.\nFive were settled on river lots in St. Laurent Parish, and early in March, 1835, they were notified to come forward and make entry and obtain patents if entitled thereto. They were assured in May, 1884, by Mr. George Duck, and by myself in January and February preceding, that entry would be granted them shortly.\nOne (Philip Garrripie) had already disposed of two land claims, one for the consideration of $2,000, and had afterwards squatted on surveyed lands without applying for entry.\n\nIt has been stated that the location of the Land Office at Prince Albert was inconvenient to these people. It has also been stated that objection to making entry was, to some considerable extent, caused by certain parties who thought that ultimately the Government would by such a course be compelled to establish a land agency at Batoche, and one of themselves constituted agent. All the half-breeds in the Prince Albert district freight more or less. The headquarters for freighting is at Prince Albert, where they deliver the freight and are paid, and there is scarcely a half-breed male adult in the district who does not at least once, and many of them several times in every year, visit Prince Albert.\n\nThese people are frequently buying and selling their claims prior to survey or entry, or previous to obtaining a recommendation for patent, and no amount of explanation seems to make them understand that such transfers are illegal.\n\nFUEL QUESTION.\n\nThe total amount collected as timber dues, from all the settlers embraced in these three lists since the establishment of a Crown Timber Office, amounts to $80.25, which, divided by 258 the number of claimants, amounts to 31 cents each for two years, or at the rate of 15\u00bd cents each year for each settler. Of that amount $55.25 was paid by four settlers for timber dues for erection of stores and shops, leaving $25 which has been paid by the remaining 254 settlers as office fees on homestead permits, known as free permits\u201410 cents for each settler for two years, or at the rate of 5 cents per settler per annum.\n\nHAY PERMITS.\n\nAs you are aware the object of hay permits was to protect the small settler against the large stockman or speculator, and it has always been optional with settlers whether they took out permits or not. If they chose they could continue\nthe practice of the past by cutting hay anywhere. This has been explained to these people. They have never been asked to take out any permits or pay any dues, the hay being plenty and no large stockmen or speculators to interfere with them. The hay for the town of Prince Albert, or any large stockmen in that district, has been obtained elsewhere than in the neighborhood of these settlers.\n\n1st. This report shows that of all the 258 settlers at the time of the outbreak, not one was unable to obtain patent for his land through the action or rather non-action of the Government, and even in March, 1884, there were only 10 cases of delay, which delay was caused by the conflicting surveys of One Arrow's Reserve and the St. Laurent Parish.\n\n2nd. That not one man of the 258, or any one else who ever resided in the district, ever lost one inch of land through the system of survey, when such survey was made subsequent to his settlement thereon.\n\n3rd. That 92 per cent. of the 258 had no rights as North-West half-breeds. Of that 92 per cent., those who were half-breeds had participated in all the rights accorded those people in the Province of Manitoba.\n\n4th. That not one settler in the district had an acre of land sold over his head to which he had any claim, or had even preferred one.\n\n5th. That the timber dues were not onerous, amounting only to five cents per settler per annum.\n\n6th. That the hay permit question never affected them in the remotest degree. All of which is respectfully submitted.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWM.
