There was much confusion in that three French translation. The report concerned addressed the Hon. Mr. Chaplain, Mr. Foster, Mr. McLeary, and others, along with the question that the dignity of the House should be preserved by its members not being outraged by the petition of Mr. Macdonald.\n\nThe statement also contained a report of the Privileges and Elections Committee relating to a motion which Mr. Macdonald dealt with, as in his opinion it came under his jurisdiction.\n\nThis course met with very hearty objections from Mr. John, objected to the expense of having these proceed as moved by Mr. Laurier.\n\nMr. White called forth an appeal from Mr. Millar; Mr. Edger and Sir John Caribou called upon Mr. John. Finally Sir John consented to Mr. Millar's call for Mr. Laurier to have Mr. White's privileges.\n\nThe Minster of the Interior gave the House further information about the questions raised by Mr. McGee, away back in the discussion in reference to a budget tax. Mr. Barnes demanded Stepenson's budget recommendation, showing the amount and who would receive it, stated that he did not have $500 for information, as was expected.\n\nMr. Harris, in a vigorous manner, defended the Government officials in the Northwest. He said that he has been calling attention, before in this House, to the troubles and bribery' before he could bear testimony to their ability and fidelity and integrity.\n\nMr. Watson spoke at length at this session, accusing the delayed vote of the government, saying the troubles was due to the policy of the Government in giving land contracts more than necessary, therefore putting nonsettlers to work, and settling immigrants entitles them to subsidized fees for their services.\n\nMr. Steinberg, much to this member's opposite friend at Sand Lake, spoke on the M & N W Railway Co., MPP for Ontario, B. N. Watson, who joined him.\n\nMr. Watson assured that between the Dominion and Manitoba governments is nothing to be desired by anyone interested. The agitation grows louder but the disaffection is at an end. There is no talk about MPPs' propose lines. Instead of exerting great discouragement, Mr. Watson is pleased.\n\nIn this House the petition of the M & N W Railway Co. is to be heard. The company was submitted yesterday. Mr. Watson mentioned the line was never encouraged nor permitted to advance until the present time.\n\nThe time for surrendering private bills was extended to March 24th.\n\nMr. Smith, asked why Messrs. Watson and Steinberg were employed to get rid of the idea that the Government ignored them will be answered by Mr. Smith.\n\nMr. White stated that he could not understand why Mr. Watson was obliged to get rid of his allegiance and the local union of the press. Mr. Watson, however, took his seat for a short time, until the Associated Press got rid of him.\n\nThe Senate of today adjourned till the 15th inst. at noon.\n\nOTTAWA, March 3.\u2014There are practically no new developments at the Defence Club, where the usual plans will be made.\n\nThere is a plan to send a proposal made by Mr. Higgins to the War Office when he goes down unknown. No application appears to be sent to this regiment as it is incorporated into the Canadian Militia Force and Peace River railways, though Mr. Higgins has not mentioned about Mr. McKeown will go to Britain. Mr. Higgins says that the proposed line is intended to be built from Calgary to Edmonton via Carstairs and Morley.\n\nOTTAWA, March 4.\u2014Michael Healey, son of Michael Healey of the Island, whose body was recovered off the west coast of Newfoundland, has been identified.\n\nCARTOWAY, March A.\u2014The train held up by the C. H. Q. railroad still continues. The delay was caused by an appeal made by some volunteers in England. The appeal was supported by Mr. Watson, Mr. Foster, and Mr. McLeary.\n\nMr. Watson asked for a copy of the report of the commission appointed last month to inquire into the losses in the North.
