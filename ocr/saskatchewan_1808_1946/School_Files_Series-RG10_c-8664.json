A number of toilets are not in use due to lime deposits in the bowls as hard as cement. The work done by Mr. Babb of Portage la Prairie is still in good shape.\n\nIn view of the state of the plumbing, I asked Messrs Cadham Hardware Company of Portage la Prairie, to give me a price on the repairs needed, and beg to attach herewith their price, together with the detail of work required, which is very complete. I beg to suggest that the toilets in the dormitories be moved to the other side of the building; this matter was discussed with the Reverend Principal, and he agreed with the idea. The septic tank is on the East side of the building, and all the toilets are on the West side of the dormitories, which means that all the pipes run across the building to the main. By moving the toilets, a more direct run to the septic tank would be made, and lime deposits from the water would not so readily clog the pipes. I could not obtain a price on this work as the plumbers had left. The ceiling in the girls dormitory is in need of repair; patches 6 to 7 feet across have recently fallen down. The boys playroom also requires patching and is badly in need of painting. The outside steps to the rear entrance also require new treads etc. I have not received a report on the test of the water at the school, although Doctor Cadham informs me that there is considerable magnesia and sodium chloride present.\n\nThe Act.

I have got a large flow of water here. Have pumped it with an engine for two days and have not dried it. The Indian Agent sent some away to a laboratory and it contains magnesia and sodium chlorite. Now the priest has been cooking with this water and it makes good tea and he seems very pleased with it. I got some of this water in the other well but not so strong as this, we thought it was A.I. water, and if I were you I would quit at this flow, the rock below this vein of water is full of mineral, look at the country all around is amaritite gypsum and soda, and there is not a good water well between here and Kintons, this flow is down 125 ft. There are three other wells on this place and it is only fit for cattle, you cannot cook anything with it and the nearest good water here is in shallow wells.\"\n\nYour files contain a memorandum dated October 18, addressed to the Minister, from which you will observe that the department made an allowance of $160.00 to Mr. Smith for tools lost in connection with this work.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nThis furnace and boiler complete with wood grate $43.75\n\nFurnace less the boiler $29.50\n\nThe exact measurement diameter of your boiler would have to be supplied to ascertain if this could be used.\n\nDiameter of boiler inside and to the outer edge of the rim.\n\nCaddham Hardware Co.\n\nFARMERS' BOILER\n\nWith Sheet-Iron Cover and Cast Bottom and Legs\n\nBurns Coal, Coke or Wood\n\n| Nos. | Capacity, Bbls. | Size of Feed Door, ins. | Length of Wood, ins. | Size of Pipe Collar, ins. | Weight for Wood, lbs. | Without Cover Tel.

For the purpose of identification this was given our Lab. #4101.\n\nThe following is analysis of the water:\n\n| Substance       | Results (parts per million) |\n|-----------------|-----------------------------|\n| Calcium         | 443                         |\n| Magnesium       | 120                         |\n| Sodium (calc)   | 914                         |\n| Sulphates       | 1971                        |\n| Carbonates      | 19                          |\n| Chlorides       | 1040                        |\n| Total Solids (evap) | 4790                     |\n| Alkalinity      | 31                          |\n| Total hardness  | 1199                        |\n\nThe analysis shows this to be an excessively hard water and it will have a serious effect on both boiler and plumbing system. We also think that the water is much too hard for domestic purposes despite the fact that Dr. Cadham's bacteriological examination has showed it to be a safe water. We\nJ. Waite. Dec. 31, 1930.\n\nmean by this that the high content of sodium sulphate may give rise to intestinal disarrangement. We would, however, suggest that as the well is a new well and has been put down where the soil contains a good deal of alkali, the excessive hardness may be due to some of the alkali soil having got into the well and that by pumping out the well a number of times the water may improve in quality.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE NATIONAL TESTING LABORATORIES LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAB:LD.\nBacteriological Laboratory\nDEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND PUBLIC WELFARE\n\nDecember 17/30\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nA bacteriological examination of a sample of water received from you on Dec 15th shows no bacteriological contamination that would render it unsuitable for drinking purposes.\n\nI have submitted a sample to Mr Blackie, the government chemist for an analysis in connection with the chemical content. You will probably hear from him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nFred T. Cadham, M.D.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto a report by the Provincial Bacteriologist also a report from the National Testing Laboratories on the water in the new well recently drilled at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nI stopped drilling operations as soon as the sample of water was taken, the well being about 137 feet deep. According to the test the water is not good for household purposes. I have not taken up the matter of drilling deeper with the driller, but I am of the opinion that the Sulphates are contained in a vein of water at a depth of about 52 feet, this is a very heavy vein of water and I asked Mr. Smith to be especially careful and see that this vein was blocked off before drilling deeper. A considerable quantity of cement was used in trying to block off this vein, without apparent success. Will you please advise further in this matter. I might say that this water is apparently good to taste, and no ill effects have been experienced.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Asst.

I have to request that you will state whether this supply of hard water is being used for domestic purposes, i.e., for drinking and cooking, and, if so, if there have been any ill effects. You might also state whether it would be feasible to obtain the soft water required for use in the boilers from rain water from the roof, run into a cistern.

H. H. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. J. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPORTAGE LA PRAIRIE, MAN.\nSANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nThe senior room is in charge of Sister St. Philip de Lecree. The grades are arranged as follows:\n\nGrade III - 8  \n\" IV - 9  \n\" V - 12  \n\" VI - 2  \nTotal 31\n\nIn the junior room, Sister Marie Lorette is in charge with an enrolment of 44. The grades are as follows:\n\nGrade I - 23  \n\" II - 21  \nTotal 44\n\nBoth the\nSANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nBoth the classrooms were tidy and well aired. The children were clean and neatly dressed. All the boys had their hair closely clipped, consequently it needed no attention. The girls' hair was neatly trimmed and nicely combed.\n\nThe classroom work examined was good, and the children spoke out well. Their books have all been well cared for, and those in use as exercise books I found to be neat, and the work carefully set down. The handwriting, in most cases, was good.\n\nThe dormitories I found to be clean, and the beds all neatly made. Both rooms were well aired with plenty of windows admitting an abundance of light.\n\nThe sewing room is bright and well equipped. The girls receive excellent training in this department, and do good work.\n\nThe laundry is equipped with hand washing machines, which no doubt make the work much slower than the power machines, but give the girls a training more in line with what they will be obliged to use at home. The cement floor is in poor condition, and portions of it need to be renewed.\n\nThe kitchen is small, and consequently often very warm. I understand the girls are taught bread making, as well as other plain cooking, and under this department they are also instructed in the art of buttermaking.\n\nThe building was clean throughout, but dull and gloomy. No painting or decorating has been done for years, so that the place appears neglected. The plaster is bad.\nSANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D)\n\nbad, and in several places patches have fallen off. I understand this is due largely to defects in the plumbing, due to rust and corrosion. The water is very hard and eats into the pipes and taps, and I would judge that a thorough overhauling of all plumbing is the first thing needed before any plastering or decorating is done.\n\nThe front and rear steps leading to the building are in bad repair, and should be renewed. The Rev. Father Chagnon claimed that the eavetroughing leaked badly and should be renewed. The soft water is used for drinking purposes, and is none too plentiful, so that an effort should be made to save as much as possible.\n\nThe fire equipment is in good repair, and extinguishers are located at points throughout the building. I think, however, that two more extinguishers should be provided, one for the girls' dormitory, and one for the workshop, which joins the furnace room, and in which is located the forge and acetylene lighting plant. I do not think the forge should be in this building, and I doubt the safety of having the lighting plant located in such close proximity to the furnace. If this room were discontinued as a workshop, and an electric lighting plant installed, the risk of fire would be greatly reduced. I would again emphasize that I do not consider the present arrangement safe. The fire alarm consists of a triangular iron suspended from the wall. This is a poor arrangement, and cannot be heard throughout the building. A proper alarm should be installed, which will operate throughout the entire building.\nI had fire drill while there, and found considerable delay, mostly due to the fact that the alarm had not been heard by all.\n\nThe meat required is raised on the farm, and each fall the winter's supply is killed and hung in the storehouse. I found 14 quarters of beef, and 18 or 20 hogs still to be used. The weather had turned mild, and the Reverend Principal expected to cure most of the hams and pickle a quantity of beef in order that none be wasted.\n\nThe milk cows are selected from the stock herd of about 60 head, and during the greater portion of the year 10 to 15 cows are milked. I understand there is rarely a shortage of milk, and the butter made is used at the school.\n\nThe children are well fed, and have plenty of vegetables and meat, as well as bread, tea, and grease.\n\nPoultry is kept, and is well looked after, with the result that plenty of eggs are secured.\n\nThe grain produced, with the exception of a small amount of wheat, is used on the farm for the production of beef, milk, and eggs, and this produce is used in the feeding of the children and staff.\n\nThe garden last year was good, and plenty of potatoes, turnips, carrots, and onions still remained in the cellar.\n\nNo children were sick, and they all appeared contented and happy.\n\nThis fall a well was drilled, and a good flow of water secured, but unfortunately the water is so saturated with minerals that it is unfit for human consumption. Water has always been a problem at this school, and the outlook of obtaining\nSANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nof obtaining a satisfactory supply is not encouraging.\n\nThe school is filled to capacity, and I learned that there are at least twenty children of school age on the reserve unable to receive schooling. It seems unfortunate that arrangements cannot be made whereby these children may receive some education.\n\nThe Rev. Father Chagnon is assisted by the Rev. Father Poulett, a farmer, a mechanic, and a staff of Sisters.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nRegina, Sask., April 28, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Portage La Prairie and Manitowah Agencies. This report was made by Mr. Inspector Hamilton, who was occupied from the 26th February to the 11th April in making an inspection of these two agencies.\n\nThe Inspector reports that the classrooms in the Sandy Bay Residential school were tidy and well aired, and the children clean. The building is not in good shape, and I would hesitate to spend much money on it. In the first place the school is not in a good location in my opinion.\n\nOn the whole I would say that the report on these schools is very satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, May 6, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will forward, addressed to Rev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I., Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Amaranth, Man., 2 - 1-3/4 gallon Thermene extinguishers, complete with non-freeze chemical charges.\n\nThese extinguishers should be supplied at the lowest price charged this Department, and your account, in duplicate, covering the cost, F.O.B. Amaranth, Man., should be forwarded to Rev. Father Chagnon, who is being informed of the order placed with you, and requested, upon receipt of the extinguishers, to certify the account and send it to the Department for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Sir:\n\nIn a report received from Mr. Inspector Hamilton on his inspection of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School in February, last, he states that the workshop, which joins the furnace room, and in which is located the forge and acetylene lighting plant, constitutes a fire hazard. The Inspector is of opinion that the forge should not be in this building, and doubts the safety of the lighting plant being located in such close proximity to the furnace. He states that if this room were discontinued as a workshop the risk of fire would be greatly reduced. He emphasized the fact that he does not consider the present arrangement safe.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear as to whether you can arrange that the forge be installed in some other place, away from the lighting plant. You might also report if you consider there is danger from the lighting plant being near the furnace, and what precautions are taken to obviate any danger of fire.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the fire alarm consists of a triangular iron suspended from the wall, and cannot be heard throughout the building. I should also be pleased to have a report from you regarding an improvement in the fire alarm system.\n\nThe Inspector recommends that two more extinguishers be provided\u2014one for the girls' dormitory and one for the workshop. An order will be placed here with the Pyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada, Toronto, to forward, addressed to you at Amaranth, Man., two 1-3/4 Theremene extinguishers, complete, with non-freeze chemical charges. The account covering the cost of these extinguishers will also be sent you, and, upon receipt of the extinguishers, you should certify on the account as follows: \"Goods received. Prices charged fair and just,\" and forward same to the Department for payment. When these extinguishers are received, they should be located at convenient points\u2014one in the girls' dormitory and one in the workshop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector,\n169 Notre Dame, E.,\nCITY.\n\nDear Sir;\u2014 Re Sandy Bay Indian Boarding School.\n\nI am in receipt of a report from our Inspector in charge of the Neepawa District who has made a fire inspection of the above mentioned school and recommended as follows:\n\n(1) That the two and a half gallon soda and acid type of fire extinguisher on each floor should all be recharged and date of same recorded on tag attached to the fire extinguisher. He also recommends that two more extinguishers of this same type should be installed, one on the boy's dormitory and the other in the workshop.\n\n(2) There are two outside fire escapes of the sliding pole type, one from a landing outside of the boy's dormitory and one from a landing outside of the girl's dormitory. There is also an outside stairway leading down from the landing of the girl's dormitory which is in a very unsafe condition, and as the sliding pole is supposed to be used for descending to the ground, he would recommend that this stairway be demolished or shut off to prevent any of the children using it in its present condition.\n\nThere is only one exit door to this landing, which opens outward, and is o.k.\n\nIn the boy's dormitory there are two doors in the doorway leading to the outside landing. The outside one, or the screen, opening outwards, and the inside one opening inwards. He reports that the inside door is kept locked with a padlock, and he recommends that all existing doorways be made to open outwards, and that this door should be kept unlocked and some arrangements should be made so that this door should not be locked.\n(3) Acetylene gas is used for lighting the building, this gas being generated on the main floor. The compartment in which the gas is generated is near the furnace room; in fact, the furnace room and gas generating room are in one with no dividing partition of any kind. He recommends that owing to the fact that the building is occupied, this gas plant should be eliminated all together and an electric light plant installed. Failing this, however, the gas generator plant to be isolated entirely from the main building.\n\n(4) In the work shop on the ground floor of the building there is a grain chopping outfit, the power for which is furnished from a gasoline engine. The engine is in the same room and is not partitioned off. The gasoline for the engine is fed from a tank just on the outside of the basement wall, the gasoline being kept in a 40 gallon drum placed in a wooden box with lid close to the wall of main building, without any protection and which is not even kept locked. It is recommended that some arrangements be made for this engine to be kept in a fire proof room with self-closing fire door. Gasoline should be stored in an isolated building, under lock and key, where there would be no interference by the children occupying this school.\n\n(5) In the vegetable part of the cellar there is a small stove used for heating purposes. There is at least 60 feet of stove pipe from this stove to the chimney, and in several places it is too close to the woodwork, and is immediately below the gas generating plant. This piping is a very serious menace, and it is recommended that a solid brick chimney be erected to take care of this stove, thereby eliminating the serious fire danger of almost sixty feet of stove pipe.\n\nI am forwarding this report for your information, and at the same time forwarding a copy of same to J. Grove Smith, Dominion Fire Commissioner, and I would be pleased if you would kindly give the matter serious consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Fire Commissioner.\n\nR.\nWinnipeg, 23rd May, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received the enclosed letter this morning, and it seems so important that I have directed the same to you for consideration and attention.\n\nI have also sent a copy to Indian Commissioner W.

McKeown\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn response to your letter No. 126-9-5 of the 6th instant, I beg to submit to the Department of Indian Affairs the opinion of Mr. A. F. McKeown, Inspector of Fire Prevention Branch for the Province of Manitoba. Our shop suggests the building of a chimney for the work shop, so we could aim the forge's smoke pipe into that chimney, his recommendations also that the acetylene lighting plant be replaced by an electric plant.\n\nThe triangular iron intended for fire alarm, according to McKeown, should\nbe replaced by electric bills.\n\nI have received the two thermite extinguishers from the Pyrene Co., one is loaded and ready to use, the other container for sulphuric acid was empty, so the firm will have to supply another one, accounts for same not yet received.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO. Leclercq. D.R.\nOttawa, June 1, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to refer you to official letter of the 6th instant, placing an order for two (2) 1 - 3/4 gallon Thermens extinguishers, complete with non-freeze chemical charges, to be forwarded to Rev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I., Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Amaranth, Man. Father Chagnon states that these extinguishers have arrived and that one is charged, ready for use, while the other one was empty when received. I have, therefore, to request that you will forward a recharge for this extinguisher as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. H. Paget,\nAccountant & Purchasing Agent.\n\nPyrene Mfg. Co. of Canada Ltd.,\n1197-1207 King St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, June 1, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. Inspector Bunn, Winnipeg, enclosing a report from the Deputy Fire Commissioner, Fire Prevention Branch, Provincial Public Works Department, Winnipeg, regarding an inspection by one of their inspectors of the fire equipment, fire hazards, etc., at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this report it is recommended that the 2\u00bd gallon soda and acid type of fire extinguisher be recharged, and the date of same recorded on tag attached to fire extinguisher. In this connection, I have to request that you will ascertain the number of this type of extinguisher on hand at the school and arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the chemical refills required and instruct the Principal, when these are received, to see that the extinguishers are recharged and placed in good condition and made ready for immediate use in case of fire.\n\nThe Inspector states that there is a sliding pole type of fire escape outside the girls' dormitory and an outside stairway leading down from the landing, which is in a very unsafe condition. He recommends that, as this sliding pole is used in case of fire, the stairway be demolished or shut off to prevent any of the children using it in its present condition. Please take this matter up with the Principal and have him arrange to have this stairway either entirely demolished or closed off to prevent use by the children.\n\nThe Inspector also states that in the boys' dormitory there are two doors in the doorway leading to the outside landing. The outside one, or the screen, opening outwards, and the inside one opening inwards. He states that the inside door is kept locked with a padlock, and he recommends that all existing doorways be made to open outwards and the doors be kept unlocked and that some arrangements be made so that, in case of fire, this door would not be locked.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Inspector further draws attention to the workshop on the ground floor, in which there is a grain chopping outfit, the power for which is furnished from a gasoline engine. He states that the engine is in the same room and is not partitioned off. The gasoline for the engine is fed from a tank just on the outside of the basement wall, the gasoline being kept in a 40 gallon drum placed in a wooden box with lid, close to the wall of the main building, without any protection and which is not even kept locked. He recommends that the gasoline be stored in an isolated building, under lock and key, where there would be no interference by the children, and that some arrangements be made for the engine to be kept in a fireproof room with self-closing fire door. The school authorities should take immediate steps to overcome the danger mentioned by the Inspector in the situation of the gas tank and see that it is secured in order that the pupils cannot have access to same. We have already written the Principal regarding the fire hazard in this workshop, as it is not considered that the present arrangements are safe.\n\nThe Inspector has further drawn attention to the danger from fire of a stove which is used in the vegetable part of the cellar. He states there is about 60' of stovepipe from this stove to the chimney and in several places it is too close to the woodwork, and is immediately below the gas generating plant. This piping is a very serious menace, and the use of this stove should be discontinued. If it is necessary that a stove be kept in operation to prevent vegetables from freezing, it is recommended that a solid brick chimney be erected, thereby eliminating the serious fire danger of almost 60' of stovepipe. I shall be pleased to have a report from you regarding this matter and, if you recommend that a chimney be built, the cost of same. You might state whether it would not be possible for the Principal to arrange for some other system for the protection of the vegetables during the cold weather.\n\nWhen you have had an opportunity to take these matters up with the Principal, which it is hoped will be at an early date, the Department will be pleased to have a report from you as to the action to be taken to overcome the fire hazards reported by the Inspector.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, June 1, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, relative to the prevention of fire hazards in the building used as a workshop in connection with the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and requesting that an electric plant be supplied to replace the acetylene lighting plant at present in use.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department has received a report of the Provincial Fire Inspector who recently visited the School, recommending certain alterations and improvements in order to overcome any danger from fire. We are taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Waite and requesting him to get in touch with you with a view to having the changes recommended by the Inspector carried out. You will, no doubt, hear from Mr. Waite in due course, and I shall be pleased if you will cooperate in the carrying out of the recommendations of the Inspector.\n\nI may add that we have no funds available in our appropriation this year to change the lighting system at the School.\n\nWe are communicating with the Pyrene Mfg. Co., regarding the refill for one of the Thermene fire extinguishers which was recently supplied. The above company has forwarded their account to the Department for reimbursement of these extinguishers. If you have not yet received this account, I have to request that, when the refill is received, you will certify this fact and forward it to the Department as soon as possible so that reimbursement can be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. R. Bunn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n4th Floor, Commercial Bldg.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 3)\nSir:\n\nI received this morning from Mr. J. R. Bunn, who advises me that a copy has also been forwarded to the Department, a letter enclosing a report from the Deputy Fire Commissioner at Winnipeg in connection with conditions at the Sandy Bay school as they affect protection and the fire hazard there.\n\nFive points are dealt with and numbered. Several of them were dealt with by Inspector A. G. Hamilton in his report of his visit to that school which was forwarded to you under cover of my letter of the 28th ultimo.\n\nThe first item deals with fire extinguishers, and I agree with the recommendation that those now in use should be recharged and two new ones installed.\n\nThe second item deals with the outside fire escapes and recommends the use exclusively of the sliding to the exclusion of the outside stairway, which it is pointed out is in an unsafe condition and ought not to be used. It might either be demolished or egress to it shut off altogether. Under this head reference is made to two doorways in the exit to the outside landing in the boy's dormitory. The practice of locking these exit doors is common in many of our residential schools, and, that all principals may be reached, I think a circular should be addressed to them pointing out that the main reason for supplying fire escapes is defeated if the exit to them is barred. I am aware of the reasons advanced by principals for keeping these doors locked, but some other method must be devised of preventing their use by the pupils to clandestinely leave the building. In this instance I am writing to the Principal on the subject.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNumber three draws attention to the use of acetylene gas and the close proximity of the compartment in which it is generated to the furnace room. A recommendation is made that the gas plant should be eliminated and an electric lighting plant installed, but failing this that the gas generating plant should be entirely isolated from the main building. These recommendations are reasonable, but as the Department is aware this is a very old building and I am very doubtful of the advisability of expending money in its repair or in effecting any radical changes which would absorb a large outlay. However we must take note of the Fire Commissioner's recommendations.\n\nNumber 4 deals with the inadequate protection given to the gasoline tank which contains the supply for the engine used in the workshop on the ground floor of the building. Clearly a change ought to be made here and the gasoline stored in a proper tank situated away from the building where danger of fire and explosion would be reduced to a minimum.\n\nThe final item, number five, draws attention to the use of a stove for heating purposes in the vegetable cellar, the outlet from which to the chimney is covered by sixty feet of stove pipe. Such an arrangement is clumsy and dangerous, but the danger is enhanced by the fact that this part of the cellar is immediately below the gas generating plant, a combination which immediately suggests it as being dangerous.\n\nAs I observed in my covering letter enclosing Inspector Hamilton's report, the condition of this building does not in my opinion warrant the expenditure of a great deal of money. On the other hand, the observations and recommendations of the Fire Commissioner must be met, at least in part and where they can be without great cost. The safe storage of gasoline, of course, ought to be insisted upon and probably the erection of a brick chimney from the vegetable cellar would reduce the risk that now exists owing to the use of sixty feet of stove pipe. Extinguishers can be provided and instructions given as to their disposition, and it ought also to be made clear to the Principal that from time to time all of them should be emptied and recharged. There will then be the assurance that they will work effectively in case of an emergency. I doubt if it will be necessary to demolish the outside stairway, but in any event its use should be prohibited. It would probably not cost a great deal to re-arrange the doors in the boys' dormitory so as to allow of their opening outwards\n\n- and when -\nand when the change is effected it should be insisted that they be not looked. The cost of installing an electric plant instead of using the present acetylene gas lighting arrangement will entail an expenditure which may not be warranted in this building, but a re-arrangement of the present plant might be provided for if the outlay would not be too costly.\n\nAs I am anticipating that the Department would write me on this subject, I thought it well to express my views.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. W. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, June 4, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 208-11A, R.C. of the 26th ultimo, referring to the report of the Deputy Fire Commissioner at Winnipeg, in connection with conditions at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School regarding fire equipment, fire hazards, etc. In reply I have to say that the Department has received this report, forwarded by Mr. Inspector Bunn, and we have written both the Principal and Mr. Agent Waite in the matter.\n\nTwo fire extinguishers were recently supplied this school and recharges have been ordered for all the extinguishers on hand, with instructions that, when these are received, they be placed in the extinguishers and all extinguishers put in good condition, ready for use.\n\nRegarding the outside stairway leading from the landing of the girls' dormitory, instructions have been given to have this stairway demolished or entirely shut off, to prevent any of the children using it. The Department has directed that the doors leading from the boys' dormitory to the fire escape be arranged so that they will open outwardly and that all doors to fire escapes be kept unlocked. Further, instructions have been given regarding the proper storage of gasoline.\n\nRegarding the fire hazards in the workshop, the school authorities have been requested to take\n\nW. M.

If so would you kindly add it to my bill of material. The lumber co. have not sent me the bill of material as they promised by July 5th will you kindly add that also.

Creswell, of Gladstone, and on which Mr. George Ball has given a tender for the labour only, kindly have the Agent submit an estimate on the cost of materials required, and also submit his opinion as to the ability of Mr. Ball to carry out the contract.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nOttawa, July 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, enclosing a communication from George A. Ball, together with a detailed estimate of the repairs he will carry out at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and his quotation for performing the labour only, to the amount of $550.\n\nI have to request that you will submit an estimate of the cost of all materials required in carrying out these repairs. Your estimate should show, in detail, the quantities of the various materials required and the cost of same, including freighting to the school. I have also to request that you will state your opinion as to the ability of Mr. Ball to carry out the work in connection with these repairs, provided the contract is given to him. Your early reply is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nas soon as the contractors begin work repairing the school. I also beg to suggest that an automatic or electric fire alarm be installed in the school as all that is used at present is a hand bell and angle irons.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nJuly 13th, 1931.\n\nSir;\n\nI have the honour to submit the following report on the fire hazards, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School:\n\nNo. 1. This fire extinguisher has been recharged and is now in good condition.\n\nNo. 2. The stairway will be closed off as a temporary safeguard and demolished as soon as the carpenters are on hand to repair the school.\n\nNo. 3. The padlock is removed from the outside door and the inside door will be altered to open to the outside.\n\nWith reference to paragraphs 4 and 5 of your letter I beg to suggest the following alterations. There are two buildings connected to the school with a passage 10' long; the first building is 21 X 21 X 18, in this building are housed the lighting plant and workshop, the adjoining building is 21 X 31 X 22 housing the gas engine, chopping outfit and the tank of gasoline complained about. The vegetable cellar runs under these two buildings, the 60' of stovepipe being in this portion. I beg to suggest that the building 21 X 31 be moved to a site nearer the barn a distance of approximate 200 feet, a basement be built under the building, with a chimney from the basement floor, the chimney would be about 30'. By removing this building, the stove pipe menace would be eliminated, as the basement under the smaller building could be heated from the school furnace, the gas engine, chopping outfit and the gasoline would also be removed and the building convenient to the stable, where the crop is required. The smaller building would not require to be heated, but if the building were removed, the old basement would have to be filled in, a new basement wall being built, and a new end to the building. I was not able to get costs on this work but will do so.\nOttawa, July 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, relative to the action taken in overcoming the fire hazard at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your recommendation regarding the buildings housing the lighting plant and workshop, I have to say that the removing of part of the building in which is housed the gas engine, chopping outfit and gasoline tank to a site nearer the barn, placing a basement under same and building a chimney, would cost more money than is available at the present time. You should forward your recommendation as to what inexpensive changes could be made in the present situation as regards these buildings, in order to lessen the fire hazard, with an estimate of the cost. It is considered that satisfactory arrangements could be made to lessen the danger from the storage of gasoline and also from the present stove pipe which is used in the vegetable part of the cellar. You may also submit an estimate of the cost of installing a suitable electric alarm system.\n\nThe estimate of the cost of the above might be forwarded at the time you are submitting a detailed estimate of the other repairs required at this school, as requested in official letter of the 16th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

These prices and detailed estimates were asked for by Mr Ball at the time of his visit to Portage la Prairie, the firms being asked to send their estimates etc., direct to Ottawa. I have no doubt that the freighting of the material to the school can be done by the school and Department teams, free of cost. From inquiries I have made Mr Ball appears a capable carpenter and well able to do the work.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 31, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to the carpenter work required at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, the Department has received a price of $1,525 from Mr. E. J. Creswell, of Gladstone. We have also a quotation of $850 on the labour from Mr. George Ball, of Gladstone; a quotation of $418 for the lumber from the Corona Lumber Yards, of Portage, and $280 on the hardware from the Cadham Hardware Company, also of Portage. It is very difficult to compare quotations, as they make different recommendations regarding what should be done. Mr. Ball's suggestions include considerable metallic ceiling, which is not in Mr. Creswell's scheme, and his price, added to the materials, is correspondingly higher.\n\nI believe the best course to pursue is to have the Minister name a carpenter foreman, to whom the work could be entrusted. Either Mr. Creswell or Mr. Ball would be suitable. Concerning Mr. Ball, the Indian Agent had an interview with him and he also made enquiries. He states: \"Mr. Ball appears a capable carpenter and well able to do the work.\"\n\nThe carpenter foreman would be given direction by the Indian Agent and the materials he requires would be purchased by our representative. In this event, it would be necessary to have the name of lumber and hardware firms, preferably in Portage, who should be given the business.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nIndian Affairs.

Creswell of Gladstone, as carpenter-foreman. The decision regarding what repairs are most urgent will be left with you. You will give Mr. Creswell instructions and will engage an Indian carpenter or two, if available, to assist him. Mr. Creswell should be paid current rates for carpenter-foreman and you will keep labour returns, in duplicate, showing the receipts of the men employed. An accountable cheque for $400, with which you should pay wages, is being directed to you under separate cover.\n\nMr. Creswell will determine what materials he needs for the improvements upon which you and the Reverend Principal determine. You will obtain prices on these materials and award the business to those quoting the lowest, from the following firms:\n\n**LUMBER:**\n- Corona Lumber Co., Gladstone, Man.\n- A.

It is noted, from their estimate, that they will install, for $128.15, a Two Gong System and Fire Station for each flat, all to be connected up so that if an alarm were started on any one of the flats the whole system would alarm at the same time. The alarms would be placed about sixty feet apart on each flat, thus assuring that the sound could be heard loudly in every part of the building. A 12 volt wet storage battery would be used to supply the current and 6 inch Alarm Gongs. In the above system, there will be an eight (8) gong system, with four (4) fire stations, sufficient wire for installation and a 12 volt wet storage battery.\n\nWhen the above system has been installed to your satisfaction, you may submit a voucher for the amount stated, in favour of the Cadham Hardware Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BUSKARD,\n\nPursuant to telephone conversation, I am enclosing a copy of official letter of the 6th ultimo to the Indian Agent, concerning general repairs at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. I telegraphed Mr. Waite yesterday for a report, and his reply indicates that Mr. Creswell will commence work on Monday, next, the 14th instant; that Mr. Creswell intends to engage Indian carpenters as far as possible; that the Corona Lumber Company secured the orders for lumber and cement and have already delivered the material; that W. L. Pattinson secured the order for hardware, which is now being shipped.\n\nI may say that, on the 25th ultimo, Mr. Waite was instructed to have Mr. Creswell do some additional work to lessen the fire hazard at this school, at a total cost of about $500. Mr. Waite has called for prices on the materials required, but the only business already awarded in connection with this last work has been the installation of the fire alarm system by the Oadham Hardware Company, at a cost of $122.\n\nA.

WATER ANALYSIS\nOPERATION and CAPACITIES of Duro Softeners are WARRANTED ONLY when chemical analysis of water to be softened has been made by us or where reliable analysis has already been made and report sent to us for recommendation.\n\nDuro Water Analyses are made free of charge. Analysis cannot be made unless at least one quart of water is sent in thoroughly clean glass containers. Address, Engineering Dept., The Duro Company, Dayton, Ohio.\n\n2. SOFTENERS ARE NOT FILTERS\nIf water contains sediment when first drawn, filter must be installed ahead of softener. Organic growth and mineral salts deposit from some waters on standing or during shipment which does not allow us to state definitely as to the necessity of a filter on these waters.\n\nSofteners are made to SOFTEN WATER and not to FILTER WATER. Any water that requires CLARIFYING, due to IRON, MUD or any other FOREIGN MATTER, must be passed through a FILTER before being passed through SOFTENER or the softening mineral will be clogged by foreign matter, and its capacity will then be affected.\n\n3. IRON IN WATER\nIron is always present in water but usually in small amounts. It may be dissolved (invisible) in the water, or it may be in the form of rust (discoloration). Iron dissolved in the water will settle (precipitate) in the form of rust when coming in contact with air (oxidation).\n\nWhen present in quantities above .12 grains per gallon it causes iron stains in laundering, on the fixtures, etc.\n\nWater having iron in it in the form of rust will contaminate the mineral and affect its capacity. The water should then be filtered before it enters the softener.\n\nWhen the iron is dissolved in the water, it will oxidize immediately on being exposed to the air, or air in sufficient quantities may come in contact with it in the pipe and form rust.\n\nWrite the Duro Company for information on how to remove dissolved iron from the water.\n\n4. SALT IN WATER\nConsiderable SALT is PRESENT in some water on account of salt deposits in the earth. Salt in the water REDUCES the softening capacity of the mineral. How much, can only be determined by a chemical analysis which we make free of charge (see Water Analysis).\n\n5. SALT USED FOR REGENERATION\nHard fine-grained salt takes up less space than the soft flaky salt. Therefore we recommend the uses of a fine granulated salt both for hand and automatic softeners. Rock salt, however, can be used as it takes up about the same space as does the hard fine-grained granulated salt.\n\nIt is necessary that the salt used be of a very high grade both as to sodium content and freedom from dirt. It should contain at the very minimum 99% sodium chloride. It should be free from any material that does not dissolve in the water such as fine quicksand, which it is practically impossible to see in the salt.\n\nThe ordinary ice cream rock salt usually contains considerable ordinary dirt and should not be used.\n\nPURE SALT gives BETTER REGENERATION and CLEAN SALT prevents the pipe lines from clogging up.

This mill was purchased, I understand in the year 1912, and has been repaired from time to time, until now it is practically useless. The mill is an 8 foot wheel self oiling type and the cost is in the neighbourhood of $65.00, the tower is in good condition. The mill was purchased from The Ontario Wind Engine Pump Company, and the Reverend Principal requests that a mill from the same firm be purchased as the old one has given excellent service. At the present time water has to be hauled from Lake Manitoba a distance of 4\u00bd miles.\n\nThe Reverend Father also makes requisition for 3 hand power washing machines with wringers, three were purchased from the Marshall Wells Co. in the year 1929 under Voucher No. 671, at a cost of $19.55 each.

Extract of Tenders attached.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 126-9-5 dated August 8th, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nWinnipeg, October 21st 1931\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier  \nSuperintendent of Indian Education  \nOTTAWA  \nOntario\n\nDear sir,\n\nI have just returned from a visit to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe repairs to the plumbing system authorized by the Department are completed and I understand that the work is satisfactory. There is still a very offensive smell emanating from the soil pipe that goes through the classroom occupied by the girls. Father Chagnon intends to call the agent's attention to this matter on the occasion of his next visit to the school.\n\nFather Chagnon tells me that the wheel and gears of the windmill must be replaced without any further delay. This windmill supplies the water for the sewerage system of the school and if anything happened to it, especially in the winter time, conditions in the school would be very bad. This windmill was supplied by the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Co., who have a western office in Regina. The present installation has lasted for the last 15 years. The total cost according to Father Chagnon would be from $75.00 to $100. I would suggest that you authorize Father Chagnon to purchase the necessary repairs or to advise the Ontario Wind Engine and Pump Co., to supply them. I beg to call your attention to the urgency of this matter as great damage would result to the water supply system if a break-up would occur in the winter. Father Chagnon tells me that if the windmill were out of action during the severe weather for more than one day, that the pipe leading into the well would freeze up.\n\nI was informed that the dough mixer and gasoline engine which your Department promised to supply to Father Chagnon have not yet been received. As this machine is urgently needed, I hope that you will order same without any further delay.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 4)\nYour Department has in the past furnished three small washing machines and ringers about every three years for the Sandy Bay School. The present machines are worn out and should be replaced immediately. As the Sandy Bay School has possibly the worse equipped laundry of any school, I hope that you will take Father Chagnon's request favorably.\n\nThe refectory tables are in very bad condition. They were originally made with flooring, laid cross wise. Through natural wear and shrinkage of the wood, there is an opening between each board which is filled with dirt and cannot be cleaned. There being a carpenter on the premises, I believe that an outlay of not more than $50.00 would be sufficient to either make new tables or put new tops on the present ones. I would appreciate it very much if you would give instructions to that effect.\n\nI noticed that there are not enough pews in the Chapel for all the pupils. This shortage has existed for several years but as the pupilage has been increased by 5, it is now more acute. I would greatly appreciate it if the Department would supply 5 small pews about 5 feet long similar to those now in use. The present pews are about the simplest article that can be made. They have no back and no kneeler. The carpenter who is now doing the repair work could easily make these pews.\n\nI was told that there is no provision in the estimate for the carpenter work that is now being done for painting. It would be unwise, it seems to me, to leave the outside stairs without a coat of paint. A small additional sum to the one you are now spending would take care of this item.\n\nAs Father Chagnon has been most reasonable in all his demands respecting his school, I hope that you will be good enough to give the various items mentioned in this letter your favorable consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE REVEREND GREAT FATHERS\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 31, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the improvements at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. On the first instant, the Indian Agent was authorized to replace the windmill. I regret there are no funds for a dough mixer this year, as the entire vote for this school is now overexpended. A note has been taken for future estimates. Two or three weeks ago, the Department informed the Indian Agent that the small washing machines would have to be replaced from school funds this year. I am today writing to the Indian Agent, authorizing him to put Battleship linoleum on top of the dining room tables; to have the carpenter make five chapel pews and to purchase sufficient paint for the outside stairs. It is understood that the school will be responsible for the painting labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, October 31, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nReverend Father Plourde, of the Oblate Provincial's office, has just returned from a visit to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and I write to authorize you to effect three small improvements, which appear rather urgent and which can be done while the carpenter is at the school. Please arrange to have the dining room tables covered with Battleship linoleum. You may also have the carpenter make five small pews which are required in the chapel. Further, you may purchase a small quantity of paint for the outside stairs. The school authorities should be responsible for the labour.\n\nThe Department would be grateful if, in future, you would keep in mind the name of Mr. R. S. Ellis, of Gladstone, when any tinsmithing or plumbing is required at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

Mr. Ball, I understand, went to considerable expense in hiring a car to go to Sandy Bay making an estimate on the work required and the cost, and then going to Portage la Prairie in connection with same. As Mr. Ball has not been given any of the work in this connection, he thinks he should be paid his expenses in this connection as the work was undertaken at your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDavid Smith\nSigned Per D.S.\n\nMy Reply to the above dated November 25th, 1931\n\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nNo. 40\nNovember 25th, 1931.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, I asked Mr. Ball for an estimate on the repair work at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. It was impossible to give an estimate on this work without seeing what was required for repairs of this work. If Mr. Ball considers that he is entitled to be paid expenses for giving an estimate, on receipt of his detailed account for expenses, I shall be pleased to take the matter up with the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSigned J.

Smith Esq.,\nIndian Agent:\n\nSir,\n\nBefore writing to Mr. Murphy, I got\nMr. Smith to write you stating my claim,\nand you want me to give you a detailed\nstatement. Now do you think I went up\nto Sandy Bay for my health. You asked me\nto go and you should be man enough\nto pay me. The Indian dept or Mr. Murphy did\nnot ask me. You are no man & I wrote\nto you to pay me. Had you offered to give\nme any thing in reason I should have\nbeen quite satisfied and saved all this trouble.\nI did not want to bring it before Mr. Murphy,\nas he will have enough to answer in the\nHouse about the way that job was handled\nand other appointments. I have been\nasked to make a statement before 6 members\none a good Liberal & you will be\nsurprised to have the photograph of that\nman slap in the private room where I fell.\nand I carry the marks yet. I could have claimed $500 damages from the Dept. Several lawyers wanted me to let them go ahead it. You must know that there are a lot of very disappointed men over Mr. Murphy getting that appointment & are all trying to get some thing against him. Now I turned them all down - I felt that when you got thru with the work that you would figure in what you would give me for my time and you never even thanked me. Now there is nothing left for me to do but to give Mr. Murphy a chance to see that I get my money or I shall sue for it & let the Judge assess my claim. After the New Year I will get Mr. Smith to get in touch with Mr. Murphy.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nGeorge A. Ball\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a letter received from Mr. George Ball of Gladstone, together with all correspondence relating to the matter. Mr. Ball was asked to give an estimate on the repair work at the Sandy Bay Reserve School, and now wishes pay for his work in connection with same. I have again written to Mr. Ball asking him for receipts for auto hire and the number of hours worked and the price per hour, but to date I am not in receipt of same. The man-trap mentioned in his letter is the entrance to the boiler room. Mr. Ball fell down the steps and injured his face.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 18, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nPursuant to phone conversation, I have to send you a letter with enclosures from Mr. Indian Agent Waite, with reference to the claim of Mr. George Ball, of Gladstone, Man., for a fee and expenses in connection with last year's repairs at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will remember that your memorandum of April 29th authorized the engagement of Mr. E. J. Cresswell, of Gladstone. He was asked for an estimate. Your memo of June 5th directed that Mr. Cresswell be removed from the list and that Mr. George Ball and others be substituted. The Indian Agent was so informed, and, on his own initiative, he, on June 24th, wrote Mr. Ball asking him for a price. A copy of Mr. Waite's letter to Mr. Ball is one of the enclosures.\n\nI sent you a memorandum concerning this work on July 21st and on August 3rd you authorized the engagement of Mr. Cresswell.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Ball's claim, I may say it is not usual to pay a tenderer a fee and expenses, but the terms of Mr. Waite's initial letter to him were somewhat unfortunate. Mr. Ball might easily understand that he was to be given the work.\n\nWith the return of the correspondence, will you please let me know the Minister's wishes.\n\nEncl.\n\nDuncan C.

Please inform the Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and, if he still requires this equipment, you may make purchase and forward a properly certified account, in duplicate, in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nMr. Russell L. C. Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOTTAWA\nOntario\n\nDear sir,\n\nI have just returned from Sandy Bay where I went with Rev. Father Magnan, Provincial. We undertook the journey in response to a call from Rev. Father Chagnon.\n\nThe water supply of the school is worse, if possible, than it used to be. As you know, the attempts made at drilling have been a failure. The water that was found is unfit for consumption and is so hard that it clogs up in a short time all the water service pipes.\n\nFather Chagnon is of the opinion that a fairly satisfactory permanent water supply could be had by damming the creek which runs West & East on the school property. This creek is about 300 feet distant from the school building. Father Chagnon informs me that there is running water in that creek every Spring and that occasionally, there is also running water after a heavy storm. There is a fall from the school towards the lowest point in the creek of about 9 feet. If the bed of the creek as well as its slopes were dug three or four feet for a distance of about 200 feet x 100 feet wide, a storage sufficiently large would be had, which in Father Chagnon's opinion, as well as in Father Magnan's and myself, would give the school a sufficient quantity of water. A\nhome-made filter could be installed at the east end of this reservoir and the water that would thus be had would be in our estimation, far superior to anything they now have, even lake water. Lake water in itself would be preferable of course, if it could be piped to the school. As it is now, Father Chagnon has to haul lake water, but as he has no pumping system, the water has to be taken at a short distance of the shore at a depth not exceeding 18 inches. This water, especially after a storm, is so full of foreign matters, that it is not fit to drink.\n\nWould it be possible for you to send an engineer from the Waterways Dept., in Winnipeg to inspect the possibilities of damming the creek and establishing levels.\n\nOwing to the present depression, Father Chagnon is of the opinion that the work could be done at a very reasonable price, especially if he were given free hand in the matter. If I am not mistaken, $1000 were set aside for general repairs to the Sandy Bay School. Father Chagnon is of the opinion that this amount would be sufficient to build a water supply large enough for the general needs of the school.\n\nFather Chagnon took occasion of my visit to remind me that he has not as yet received the dough mixer which has been promised him for the last 2 years. As the estimates have been passed, I don't see any reason why this should not be attended to immediately.\n\nSeveral of the Principals which I met three weeks ago told me that they had not yet been notified of the amounts granted.\ntheir schools in the last estimates for general repairs and improvements. Would you be good enough to write to them and inform them about it.\n\nI would appreciate a copy of the letters that you will write them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6276, file 584-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 15, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe problem of a suitable water supply for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, at Marius, Man., has engaged the Department's attention on several occasions. I understand your office has never been asked to make a recommendation in this connection, as there has been considerable doubt about the advisability of indefinitely continuing the school at its present site. Your officers, however, did assist with the sewage disposal system, in 1927 - your file 15844-W.\n\nThe Church authorities have now made a suggestion that the creek which runs past the school be dammed and an outdoor reservoir prepared. There is not sufficient water in this creek at all seasons of the year to consider it as an ordinary source of supply.\n\nThere is no intention on the part of the Department to expend a large sum of money at this institution. However, it is desired that a survey be made, to determine the feasibility and approximate cost of damming the little stream. There are natural banks, about 150 feet apart, which could be used.\n\nWould you be good enough to arrange to have your Winnipeg office make a survey at the earliest possible date? I understand that an accountable cheque for expenses for one of your Winnipeg engineers has already been directed to your office.\n\nI may say that it is hoped, in the event your officer reports favourably, to have this work undertaken by the management of the school, using Indian and other local labour. Therefore, you might instruct him to give the Rev. Principal, upon the occasion of his first visit, advice as to where to put the dam and how it could best be constructed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T.

T. Ross, Assistant Engineer, made an inspection of the suggested reservoir site for a water supply for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. Sufficient instrument work was performed with level and compass to permit of the drawing of a contour plan of the creek valley for 1,300 feet upstream from the immediate school grounds. Sufficient borings were also taken along the most practical dam location to determine the nature of the foundation conditions. The inspection enabled us to study the water supply situation at the school, to ascertain the purpose of the proposed reservoir and also to determine what would be involved in the creation of the same.\n\nTOPOGRAPHICAL FEATURES:\n\nA small creek valley passes between the school building and the barns and it is along this creek that it is suggested that a reservoir be created. The accompanying contour plan shows the creek valley as it extends some 1,300 feet above the school grounds; sta. 90+00 being in line with the school garage. At Sta. 5+00 on the right bank and within the creek valley is situated the hog-pen, and from Sta. 0+00 to Sta. 6+00 is utilized as a hog run with a consequent rank growth of weeds, etc. Between Sta. 6+00 and 7+00, there is the remains of an old beaver dam in a clump of aspen trees. Above Sta. 8+00 and extending to Sta. 14+00, the banks are cultivated. At Sta. 14+00 the creek emerges from a fairly heavily treed area. It is said that the creek has its origin about three miles away.\ndistant, but in all probability the creek valley is not well defined for more than half of that distance. The creek valley, as shown on the plan, is shallow and the rise very gradual, being only 3.6 feet in 1400 feet.\n\nRUN-OFF CONDITIONS:\n\nInformation relating to the flow in the creek was obtained from the Principal of the school. Flow usually occurs for a period of two weeks to one month at the time of the spring freshets and during some years after heavy summer rains. In the years 1922 and 1923 flow continued during the summer months but such heavy conditions are unusual. It is difficult to estimate the maximum flow as no measurements were taken, but it is probable that a flow of 20 C.F.S. might be experienced and have to be provided for in the dam construction.\n\nThe spring of 1932 was quite dry and the Principal stated the creek flowed for two to three weeks. A flow of even 2 C.F.S. over such a period would be ample to fill any reservoir that it is suggested might be created at the school. While there remains some uncertainty in the mind of the writer as to the dependability of flow in this creek, yet such information as has been obtainable, is to the effect that flow occurs yearly at the time of the spring freshets and in amount sufficient for the purpose of filling the required reservoir.\n\nWATER SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS:\n\nThe school authorities estimate the water requirements to be 3,000 gallons daily or 1,100,000 gallons yearly. In comparison with other schools, such a rate of consumption appears conservative, and it is quite probable that were an adequate water supply available the daily consumption would be nearer 5,000.\nof 824.0. Such elevations will necessitate spring gallons or approximately 2,000,000 gallons yearly along either bank above the site for some considerable distance. It will show immediately the basis of our calculations. Water is required for watering the crops and domestic uses and that the area below stock, sanitary purposes and for cooking and washing.\n\nRESERVOIR POSSIBILITIES:\n\nThe school authorities have suggested placing a dam across the creek valley from Sta. 0476 to Sta. 7400 and up to contour 826.0 on account of the to impound 2,000,000 gallons of water, of which it was estimated they would utilize 1,100,000 yearly. This suggestion has been considered and in connection with the same the most favourable location for the necessary immediately above the lake to provide adequate dam selected. Any reservoir created to provide adequate for the common practice estimates a loss of two feet depth on small water supply must be capable of impounding sufficient water at the time of the spring freshet to take care of losses due to ice formation during the freezing period and the reservoir must provide for water usage during the entire year. In Manitoba common practice estimates a loss of two feet depth on small reservoirs from evaporation annually during the open water period. Again common practice provides for ice formation to a depth of three feet on small reservoirs during the freezing period, making a total loss of five feet on a reservoir from these two conditions. The gain from rainfall is usually neglected. These losses in reservoir depth are of the greatest importance in the creation of a reservoir in this creek valley at the Sandy Bay Indian School.\n\nExamination of the plan accompanying this report will show that in our opinion the most favorable site for a dam across the creek valley for impounding purposes is at Sta. 0476. The general contour of the ground will only permit of the construction of an earth dam to elevation 826.0 with a maximum reservoir elevation\nof 824.0. Such elevations will necessitate dyking along either bank above the dam for some considerable distance. It will also be noted that the elevation of the creek bed exceeds 818.0 and that the area below contour 820.0 is small indeed. While it would be necessary to remove the soil to a depth of twelve inches throughout the creek valley from Sta. 0450 to Sta. 7400 and up to contour 825.0 on account of the area being used as a hog run, this additional twelve inches becomes of minor importance. It would also be necessary to excavate from within the creek valley immediately above the dam to provide suitable materials for the construction of the dam and the dykes along the bank. Approximately 1000 yards of earth would be required for these purposes, but even the removal of this material would only appreciably enlarge the reservoir area above the dam. With reservoir surface at elevation 824.0, it would be possible to store in excess of 2,000,000 gallons of water at the time of the spring freshets. It is quite obvious, however, that with no inflow and with the reservoir drawn down two feet by evaporation and an additional 1.5 feet by usage during the open water period that the water supply would become depleted early in winter through the formation of ice and further usage. It might be pointed out, however, that such a reservoir would probably furnish an adequate water supply for the period April 15th to December 31st of each year and at a fairly moderate cost. Later in this report an estimate is given of the probable cost of such a reservoir. Because of the immense losses in depth due to evaporation and ice formation, the depth of water of\nreservoir becomes all important, the greater the depth in proportion to area, the less the losses. To provide a deep reservoir in this creek valley considerable excavation is required, the depth of excavation under ordinary circumstances being governed by the economics of the situation. The governing features in this particular problem are the nature of the material to be excavated and the necessity of having a reservoir of sufficient depth so that after providing for evaporation, ice formation and usage during the open water period, there remains sufficient depth of water to ensure a water supply during the winter months.\n\nThe construction of an earth dam to elevation 826.0 and the building of dykes are still required as is also the cleaning up of the reservoir area and the removal of the hog-pen. The Principal of the school stated that from their observations made during construction work, sinking wells, etc., hardpan was usually encountered about eight feet below the ground surface. At the time of the inspection we were unable to take any boring in the creek bottom at elevation 818.0 on the dam line because of the hardness of the material. It appeared to be hardpan and doubtless hardpan would be encountered at elevation 818.0 throughout the area to be excavated.\n\nTo obtain the minimum requirements of water supply the reservoir must have a depth of nine feet below elevation 824.0 and have a bottom area of 36,000 square feet. It is proposed that the reservoir be rectangular in shape, 240' x 150' with side slopes of two horizontal to one vertical. Such a reservoir located between Sta. 1400 and Sta. 4400 will necessitate some 9,900 yards of excavation, probably 5,000 yards of\nwhich would be in hardpan or material equally difficult.\n\nWith the construction of the dam and dykes to elevation 826.0 and the excavation of the reservoir just outlined in excess of 5,000,000 gallons of water could be impounded in the spring. However, at the beginning of winter the water level in the reservoir would be drawn down to 820.5 by evaporation and usage. Allowing ice formation to a depth of three feet would leave 2.5 feet or 562,500 gallons of water available for winter use.\n\nThe estimated cost of creating this reservoir is given below.\n\nESTIMATES OF COST:\n\nThe cost of the dam, dykes, clearing of reservoir area, replacement of hog-pen and fencing of the reservoir, are the same for both schemes outlined above. It is assumed that the Department would be called upon to replace the present hog pen with a new structure. No estimates of cost of piping or for pumping are given. The estimated costs for excavation are considered conservative when compared with cost figures furnished by the Water Supply Officials of the Railways, and taking into consideration the conditions under which the work would have to be carried out, it is considered essential that the reservoir area be cleaned out to a depth of twelve inches up to Sta. 7400 and that the hog-pen be removed. Some 2,400 yards of earth would be required moved in this process.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The water supply would be subject to contamination, vegetation growth will develop in the stagnant pool, giving the water a disagreeable taste and offensive odor. In all probability the Department would be called upon later to provide facilities for sedimentation, filtration, chlorination, softening and possibly cooling in order to provide a satisfactory water supply for drinking and cooking purposes. This is an important point in connection with any decision as to utilizing either of the two schemes outlined.\n\nUndoubtedly the water supply situation at this school is very unsatisfactory. The cost of the outlined scheme for providing a twelve months water supply is prohibitive. It would be more economical.\nand satisfactory to render useful the present salty water from the wells now in use. The scheme outlined for use during the open water period will furnish water for stock and sanitary purposes only, leaving unsolved the problem of a satisfactory water supply for drinking and cooking purposes. It is possible to improve present conditions at the school by providing additional cistern capacity and providing facilities for a measure of filtration through powdered charcoal of the water supply between the roof of the building and the cisterns. However, this phase of the situation has not been thoroughly inquired into by the writer.\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of July 15th regarding the water supply of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith, in duplicate, Mr. Gow's report on the proposal of the school authorities to construct a reservoir on the creek which runs past the school. The Rev. J.O. Plenderleith of St. Boniface, has requested a copy of this report and was informed by Mr. Gow that if considered desirable a copy would be sent to him from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. The second copy is being sent you for this reason.\n\nAs will be noted from the report the suggestion of the school authorities for the construction of the water supply reservoir in the creek which passes the school is not considered favourable, as the supply would be unsatisfactory, insufficient for all purposes, and quite costly to provide. While it is acknowledged that the water supply situation at the school is very unsatisfactory, it is considered that it would be more economical to make use of the present water from the existing well. Mr. Gow states that alternative means of improving the water supply have not been thoroughly considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector\n\nA.F.

There are nine outstanding points:\n\n1. Gears are SKF Self-Aligned Ball Bearings throughout. On the 1 bbl size, check gears are used, also used on the 1\u00bd bbl size in both high speed shaft and mixing arm shafts.\n\n2. Stainless steel shafts are used on 1\u00bd bbl size that will never rust, or will never be affected by the action of salt water. Ordinary steel shafts will soon be pitted or eaten by the salt which tears out or wears away the packing, causing the failure of the seal. The 1 bbl size has bronze covered shafts, which will also not be affected.\n\n3. The packing box on the mixing arm shafts is of improved design, permitting easy and quick changing of the packing.\n\n4. We extend the main or high speed shaft 4\u00bd\u201d to permit the mounting of a pulley at any time to drive flour sifter, dough scraper, etc.\n\n5. All gears are machine cut, insuring maximum efficiency and minimum of noise.\n\n6. The mixing arm is of special design to turn and stretch the dough evenly for maximum sugar absorption. The arm has flat surfaces, easy and quickly cleaned.\n\n7. Model 50 mixers are finished in white enamel, presenting a fine appearance.\n\nThe price is no more than is charged by Eastern Canadian Manufacturers for ordinary machines without all the above features.\n\nCanadian workmen and material.\n\nDIMENSIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS\n\n| Fig. | Capacity | Horsepower | Floor Space | Pulley | Sifting Weight | Price F.O.B.

For the coming year, the Principal would like 1500 feet of flooring for general repairs to the chicken house and ice house.\n\n2- The stable which is a very old building and which the Department had agreed a few years ago to replace with a new modern building is in need of repairs and the School authorities would appreciate a visit from the Inspector in that connection. The Inspector could recommend such repairs as in his estimation are necessary to prolong the usefulness of the building. In 1932, the Principal spent $59.65 in the purchase of materials for this work and would like the Department to assume the expense in this connection.\n\n3- The water supply of the School is very defective and whilst it may not be practical to spend any large amount of money in view of the fact that a new site will most likely be selected for this school when it is rebuilt, something nevertheless should be done along the lines suggested by the engineer of the Department of the Interior, Mr. Gow.\n\n(Sgd.)

Type \"Z\" Hopper Cooled Gasoline Engine with Type \"R\" Rotary Magneto and Throttling Governor, to be equipped with a Pulley of a suitable size to drive a Kipp-Kelly One Barrel Dough Mixer.

The speed of our engine is 600 R.P.M. and we are therefore furnishing it with a 6\" diameter Pulley to give you the correct speed on your Dough Mixer, and will arrange for shipment to go forward tomorrow.\n\nAgain thanking you for this business, which we can assure you is much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE CO., LTD.,\n\nPer.\n\nJ.N.

The said mixer has a capacity of 1 bbl. of flour, but the 2 H.P. engine is unable to handle such a load.\n\nOur experiments show that the engine giving power directly to the mixer, slows down considerably after 150 lbs. of flour are used, and when more is added it comes to a stop. As I will have to make use of a line shaft and place Machineries alongside the wall to save space in the room, it is my belief that our 2 H.P. engine will be unable to do the work.\n\nAs I have been advised to report all particulars before making use of the machine too long, I trust that you will take the matter up.\n\nI remain\n\nYours truly\n\n(Signed) O.

Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, in connection with the dough mixer received from the Kipp-Kelly Limited and the 2 H.P. Engine from Fairbank-Morse Co. Limited, Winnipeg, Man.\n\nI might say that voucher Nos. 0522 and 6539 of the 17th and 27th January have been forwarded to the Department for payment after receiving word from the Rev.

Waite\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 17, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a communication from the Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School in connection with the dough mixer recently supplied. It is noted that the 2 H.P. engine has not sufficient power to operate the mixer.\n\nThe specifications furnished for the mixer from Kipp-Kelly Limited state that a 2 H.P. engine would furnish ample power to operate a 1\u00bd barrel mixer. It may be that the engine is located too far away from the shaft driving the mixer. We are writing Kipp-Kelly Limited and requesting them to furnish the Principal with the necessary instructions for operating the mixer. I may say that, at other schools where a 1 barrel mixer was supplied, it is found that a 2 H.P. engine furnished ample power to operate same. When we have their reply, further consideration will be given the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nOttawa, February 17, 1933.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn connection with the Kipp-Kelly, one barrel, single arm dough mixer which you supplied for use at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Amaranth, Man., I have to say that a 2 H.P. gasoline engine was supplied to operate this mixer. In the descriptive leaflet of your dough mixer, it is noted that 1 H.P. is sufficient to operate the one barrel dough mixer. It was, therefore, considered that the 2 H.P. engine would be ample to operate the mixer.\n\nWe are now informed by the Principal of the School that, after a trial of the mixer, the 2 H.P. engine is unable to handle the load. He states that the engine, giving power direct to the mixer, slows down considerably after 150 pounds of flour is used, and when more is added it comes to a stop. He considers that the 2 H.P. engine would be unable to do the work.\n\nI should be pleased to have your opinion as to the H.P. required to operate the dough mixer supplied by you. I may add that the engine supplied for the purpose was a 2 H.P. Fairbanks-Morse. It may be that you can furnish the Principal, Rev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I., with full particulars regarding the operation of the mixer, and I should be pleased if you would communicate with him in the matter. Please also furnish the Department with information requested above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nKipp-Kelly Limited,\n68 Higgins Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nFebruary 20th, 1933.\n\nPrincipal, Rev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nAmaranth, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe received advice from Mr. A. F. MacKenzie, Secretary of\nthe Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, that the 2 H.P., gasoline engine\nwhich was supplied by the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company apparently is not\nstrong enough to drive the dough mixer, which we supplied you, sometime ago.\n\nWe consider that for ordinary doughs, 1 H.P., delivered at the\nmixing arm is enough power. With a belt driven machine, however, the amount\nof power delivered at the mixer, depends a great deal on the efficiency of\nthe belts, as considerable power may be lost through belt slippage and so forth.\nThere is also the possibility, that your present gasoline engine is not properly\nadjusted and if there are any gasoline engine mechanics available at Amaranth,\nwe would suggest that the engine be inspected, as the timing may be out or some\nsmall adjustment may be necessary.\n\nWe would also be pleased, if you could advise us the diameter\nof the pulley on the engine, the diameter of the pulley that the engine drives\nand the diameter of the pulley that drives the mixer.\n\nWith this information, we would then be in a position to\nadvise, if the mixer is travelling at the correct speed.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nKIPP - KELLY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A 2 H.P., gasoline engine should be large enough to operate this machine, but this depends a great deal on the efficiency of the drive. We do not know what arrangements had been made for transmitting by belts, the power from the engine to the mixer and we regret, therefore, not being in a position to advise you definitely, regarding this. There is also the possibility that the fault may lie with the engine, in that it may possibly not be adjusted properly.\n\nWe might state, that we have a number of these machines driven by 1 H.P., direct connected motors, which are operating very satisfactorily. We have found in all the machines that we have built, that only one of these required more than 1 H.P., motor and on investigating, we found that more than 196 lbs., of flour were being mixed and a very tight or stiff dough was required, which, of course, took slightly more power. A 1\u00bd H.P., motor was put on, which handled the load very easily.\n\nWe are writing Rev. O. Chagron, O.M.I., at Amaranth, as per copy of letter attached.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nKIPP - KELLY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I note you have communicated with the Reverend Principal regarding the matter.\n\nNo doubt, after the 2 H.P. engine which was supplied to operate the mixer has been properly adjusted and the belts tightened, it will be found there is ample power to run the machine. However, when the principal furnishes you with the information asked for in your letter to him of the 20th instant, I should be pleased, if further advice is required by him, if you would kindly supply same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nKipp-Kelly Limited,\n68 Higgins Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 13th instant, in connection with the complaint of the Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School that the gasoline engine supplied to operate the dough mixer was not of sufficient power, I have to say that, as you were informed, the Department took this matter up with Kipp-Kelly Limited, Winnipeg, who supplied the mixer. We are now in receipt of their reply, stating that they have communicated with the Principal regarding the operation of the mixer. No doubt, after the proper adjustments have been made it will be found that the engine is of sufficient horse power to operate the mixer satisfactorily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

O. Chagnon, O.M.I., We are mentioning this, in view of the fact that we are very much interested in this installation and while we believe that there should not be any difficulty, we nevertheless, are afraid that there may be some small thing that needs re-adjusting or fixing up.\n\nIf we had all the details of the installation, we feel quite certain that we would be able to make the proper recommendations.\n\nYou can rest assured, that we are only too glad to do this and are very anxious to see the whole installation successful.\n\nWe are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nKIPP - KELLY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCHK/FN.

There is no doubt that this equipment, if properly installed and adjusted, will operate satisfactorily.

Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, has forwarded to the Department a copy of your letter to him of the 10th ultimo, regarding the dough mixer and gasoline engine supplied for the use of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. It is noted you state that the 2 H.P. engine does not furnish sufficient power to operate the mixer.\n\nThe Department has taken this matter up with Kipp-Kelly Limited, Winnipeg, who supplied this mixer, and they inform us that they wrote you on the 20th instant, suggesting that there was a possibility that the engine was not properly adjusted, also that they consider the engine furnished should supply ample power to operate the mixer. In a communication they have forwarded to the Department dated the 25th ultimo, they state they have received no reply from you to their communication.\n\nI would, therefore, request that you take this matter up with Kipp-Kelly Limited and furnish at an early date complete details of the installation and full information which they require. The Department would request that you give this matter your prompt attention, in order that the equipment furnished will operate satisfactorily. If the machinery is properly set up and adjusted, there does not appear to be any reason why it should not work with complete satisfaction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I looked over this apparatus during my last visit to the school, some of the unions were leaking and repairs were made by Messrs Cadham Company, and it is my opinion that an experienced fitter will be required to assemble the parts. In view of this I took up the matter of having the parts assembled in Portage la Prairie and shipped to the school complete. I am informed that this would not be feasible, as the whole assembly would be too bulky to move into place. I have, therefore, asked the Cadham Hardware Co to submit a price for the assembly of the parts at the school and herewith enclose same.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo Rev.

You recently submitted a voucher for $38.31 and there is, therefore, a balance available of $211.69.\n\nI note that the quotation for the repairs to the drying apparatus amounts to $170.40, F. O. B. Amaranth, and, if the Principal is willing to charge the cost of these repairs to the balance available as mentioned above, you may authorize him to purchase them. In the event of your doing so, it is understood that the account covering their cost, viz., $170.40, will be forwarded in time to reach Ottawa before the end of the present month.\n\nYou will note that the Department can only provide for repairs at the Sandy Bay School the sum mentioned in official letter of the 2nd ultimo, viz., $250., of which amount there is only a balance remaining of $211.69. If the Principal has incurred other expenditures for which the accounts have not yet been forwarded, the Department will not be able to pay for the repairs to the drying apparatus in the laundry room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSir:\n\nI beg to attach hereto report on the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and to inform the Department of repairs that will be necessary in the near future. The plumbing on the North side of the building is beginning to corrode, and will give trouble in the near future. Repairs were made on this part some two years ago. The heating furnace will have to be rebricked this summer, part was rebricked last fall at a cost of $50.00, the rebricking of the other side of the furnace will cost about the same, a few minor repairs required to the pipes, such as repacking etc.\n\nThe rods in the laundry boiler will have to be replaced, and should be done at the time the heating furnace is repaired. The boys play room is very dirty, the Father claims it has not been painted since the school was built. Band and council meetings are held in this room. The school staff are prepared to do the work of painting if the material is furnished by the Department. I would strongly recommend that this work be done, the cost of the material would be in the neighbourhood of $35.00.\n\nI might say that the plumbing was well done and the repairs that will be required in a short time are not through faulty workmanship. The cost of plumbing will always be costly in this school until such time as a softer/can be used throughout the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, regarding repairs that will be necessary in the near future at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department is unable to advise what funds, if any, will be available for repairs at this school until the Appropriation for the coming fiscal year is approved by Parliament.\n\nI would request that, early in May next, you again draw this matter to the attention of the Department, giving full particulars as to the repairs required to the plumbing, the heating furnace and the laundry boiler and stating how much painting is necessary in the boys' playroom. As close an estimate as possible of the cost of the various repairs, painting, etc., should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

His estimate is returned herewith, for your information.\n\nI enclose an encumbrance certificate, authorizing an expenditure to the amount of $440.00 in performing the work, as mentioned in Mr. Cadham's quotation. I would request that you arrange to have these repairs carried out at an early date, and you should see that the work is satisfactorily completed. Please forward an account, in triplicate, stating in detail the materials supplied and the work performed. You should state, on each copy of the voucher, that the expenditure was incurred under authority of E. R. No. 900.

Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nAbout a year ago the water situation for the Sandy Bay Indian school was taken into consideration by the Department and engineers were sent out to calculate the possibilities of improving the water conditions.\n\nNothing has been accomplished as yet and I would be much obliged to know whether some little improvement could not be done. For your information permit me to outline our difficulties in obtaining drinking water.\n\nWe have two wells which would furnish a sufficient quantity of water, but it cannot be used, being that it is alkaline. To use the lake water is practically out of the question because the hauling distance as well as the quantity required is too great; hardly we have the rain water to depend on, but unhappily these woods are not always clean. As this last source is about the least, would it not be possible to have some kind of a filter installed so as to greatly improve and render this water suitable for drinking purposes.\n\nTrusting that you will favorably consider this suggestion, I wish to remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Our funds are so limited this year that it is difficult to provide any heavy expenditure. However, on the date your letter reached me, Father Plourde was in the office discussing the water situation at your school and urging that something be done immediately.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland, Acting Superintendent of Indian Education, is at present in the West, and expects to be back in Winnipeg about October 10th. I am writing Mr. Sutherland today, asking him to call on Father Plourde when he reaches Winnipeg, and, if the weather is fine, Father Plourde intends to drive Mr. Sutherland to Sandy Bay, in order that he may have an opportunity to look over the situation. With this in view, I believe the matter could be allowed to stand pending Mr. Sutherland's visit.\n\nWith kind personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. O.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe made a trip up to the Indian School at Sandy Bay and examined the following:\n\nMain Heating Boiler.\nLaundry Boiler and Water System.\nPlumbing on the North Side of Building.\n\nWe herewith give you our estimate for work and material required for the above.\n\nMAIN HEATING BOILER The south side of boiler should be repackaged, taking approximately 225 fire brick.\nThe 4\" and 6\" flange unions should be repacked, the interior of boiler should be thoroughly cleaned and scraped, and repack hand holes.\n\nLaundry Boiler The stay rods are gone completely and should be replaced. The balance of flues not replaced last year should be done new, there are 10 of these.\nThe boiler plate at hand hole has to be rebuilt up, this is burnt away and is in a bad condition; any boiler inspector will verify this.\nThe water lines not replaced last year are in bad condition and should be replaced; it will require 31 ft. 2\" pipe, 8 ft. 1\" pipe together with unions, elbows, fittings etc., necessary to properly complete the job.\n\nIn the laundry one section of the ceiling radiator is eaten through and places also the Radiator in the entrance to the laundry has a section eaten through; these should be replaced, but from a standpoint of economy these sections could be removed, and the balance of the radiator connected up. New Radiator valves are required for these radiators.\n\nDrying Room We gave you an estimate on Feb. 27th/33 for the supplying material and rebuilding the coils. We understand they were double coils, but find they are only single coils, our price for this work and material included in this tender.\nMr J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian School Sandy Bay Reserve,\n\nWith regard our contract of August 16th, 1933\nregards to Main Heating Boiler, Laundry Boiler and Water\nSystem, and Plumbing on the North Side of Building.\n\nLaundry Boiler\n\nUnder this heading of our estimate and the\nlast paragraph, namely:\n\"In the laundry one section of the ceiling\nradiators is eaten through in places, also the radiator in\nthe entrance to the laundry has a section eaten through,\nthese should be replaced, but from a standpoint of economy\nthese sections could be removed and the balance connected\nup.\"\n\nWe made the above recommendation when estimating\nthis work with a view of economy in every respect and\nhave exercised the same care throughout as though we were\ndoing this work in our own establishment.\n\nOur Heating Engineer has reported to us the\nfollowing; That when work was commenced on these two radiators\nthey are in such bad condition (that is the remaining\nsections) that it would be impossible to reassemble them as\nwe intended doing. Every section although not obvious when\nlooking them over in the first place would not stand a test\npressure, they are eaten through and are utterly useless.\n\nAs there is approximately 50 sq.ft. of radiation\nin each of these radiators this amount of heat cannot be\nsacrificed, it was rather cutting it down by originally taking\noff the section of each.\n\nAfter receiving this information the writer\npersonally made a special trip up to Sandy Bay to look this\nmatter over and report this situation to you as it exists.\n\nWe cannot finish this job using the old radiators\nunless we discard them entirely and we do not recommend this\nprocedure, therefore we are submitting a price to you installing\ntwo Radiators of 50 sq. ft. radiation each. It will be\nMr J. Waite,\n\nnecessary for us to know at once what we are to do as this cost if installation rests entirely if we are able to do it while our men are still on the job, or if it's necessary to make extra trips for this alone. The cost of supplying these radiators and installing same will be $60.00 complete over and above our original estimate.\n\nWe would kindly ask you to give this your urgent attention.\n\nWe remain\n\nyours truly,\n\nCadham's Hardware Company.\n\nJCC/2\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 21st ultimo, and your letter of the 30th ultimo,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received from Mr. J.G. Cadham, in connection with the repairs to the heating system at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. I also enclose Mr. Cadham's estimate forwarded to the Department, under covering letter of the 21st ultimo.\n\nI would be pleased to receive instructions in this matter by wire, if authority is approved for this extra work, so that the work could be proceeded with, while Mr. Cadham's men are still working there.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKensie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nOttawa, June 9, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn 1932, Mr. D. B. Gow, Acting District Engineer of your Bureau in Winnipeg, visited the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School in connection with the water supply. His report was forwarded to the Department under cover of your letter of August 22, 1932 (your File 15244-W).\n\nThe Department was unable to provide the funds required for the plan suggested by Mr. Gow at that time.\n\nThe Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School now reports that the water supply is again in a very unsatisfactory condition. I would appreciate if Mr. Gow would make another visit to this school at as early a date as possible and forward a report indicating what action he considers might be taken to improve conditions. It should be kept in mind that our funds this year are very limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRegarding the drinking water situation for the Sandy Bay residential school, I wish to say that to date it is becoming more and more urgent that something be done. As you are aware, the question was brought up two years ago, but the plans then proposed proved to be undesirable. Last fall we were advised to await the visit of Mr. J. D. Sutherland and to discuss the matter with him. Unhappily he was forced to cancel his visit and with winter setting in and with sleigh roads to haul water from the lake, we dropped the subject.\n\nThis spring we are still more embarrassed than ever as we haven't even our usual quantity of rain water. We have had so far only one barrel-full of water from our roof, which I may say was far from being fit to drink.\n\nHauling from the lake is no small task either especially during our ordinary spring work, and considering the distance and difficulty to reach water, only about three tanks can be hauled in one day, which is very little.\n\nI have a plan which I wish to propose to you, and I believe it would bring better results: Could the Department supply us with: A motor truck; a tank and pump and about 100 ft. of 2in. pipes.\n\nWith this equipment we could, at least in my estimation, supply ourselves with water more suitable for drinking purposes, as it would facilitate hauling and therefore we would not be obliged to fill our cistern and then let the water stand till all is consumed.\n\nI trust that once more you will be kind enough to consider the matter.\n\nI remain Dear Sir,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) O. Chagnon, O.M.I.\nPrincipal\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter received from the Rev. Father Chagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Manitowapsh Agency, which deals with the water situation at that point.\n\nThe Department, of course, are aware of the difficulties which have been experienced in trying to obtain suitable water for the school. A number of wells have been drilled at considerable expense to the Department without any success. During the past few years, the drinking water has been obtained from rain water from the roof of the school which has been stored in tanks. This method has not been satisfactory, neither do I consider it safe. The cost of piping water from Lake Manitoba to the school, a distance of 1\u00bd miles, is no doubt out of the question, due to the large expense which would be involved. Mr. Waite, the Indian Agent, is thoroughly familiar with the situation at this school and has expressed the opinion that the supplying of the truck and equipment would be the cheapest way of meeting the need. I believe something should be done in connection with the matter, and I am submitting the Reverend Father's request, trusting that it may meet with the Department's approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 9th instant with reference to the water supply system at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School and in accordance with your request Mr. Gow has been asked to make an inspection and supply a report indicating what action he considers might be taken to improve conditions.\n\nLast fiscal year Mr. Gow was supplied with a standing advance of $50. to cover expenses in reports of this nature. The amount of this advance outstanding on March 31st was returned to Mr. Allen, the representative of the Treasury in that Department on March 31st and no advance has been received for this work during the present fiscal year. I shall be obliged, therefore, if you will arrange to have a cheque for $50., payable to D.B. Gow, sent to me to be transmitted to Mr. Gow so that a standing advance of a similar amount may be available for the work which he is requested to do on behalf of the Department of Indian Affairs during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant (File No. 15244) with reference to Mr. D. B. Gow's visit to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. I regret that the standing advance was not issued to Mr. Gow this year, but I hope that this will not delay his visit to the school, as the situation is stated to be acute. An advance of $60 is being wired today, to the Bank of Montreal, Winnipeg, for Mr. Gow's credit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power &\nHydrometric Bureau,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 25, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the water situation at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. This matter had already been brought to the Department's attention, and the Dominion Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior was requested to have Mr. D. B. Gow, Acting District Engineer, at Winnipeg, visit the Sandy Bay School. The Department learned on Saturday, last, that Mr. Gow had not yet gone to Sandy Bay, but instructions were given to him by telegraph to visit this school today. No action will be taken regarding the water supply at the Sandy Bay School until Mr. Gow's report is received.\n\nIt might be advisable for you to get in touch with Mr. Gow and arrange with him to forward his report at the earliest possible date. He will, no doubt, let you know what he recommends be done to improve the situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nIn reply to Department letter 126-9-5 dated June 25th, I now have a copy of Mr. D.B.Gow's report, concerning the water situation at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, which I understand was forwarded to the Department yesterday. I was at Portage la Prairie the day Mr. Gow visited the school and therefore accompanied him there.\n\nMr. Gow's report sets forth existing conditions and I concur with his recommendation that, if at all possible, the equipment asked for should be provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith, in duplicate, a report on the Water Supply Situation at Sandy Bay Indian School near Amaranth, Manitoba. I would request that one copy of this report be handed over to the Department of Indian Affairs at the earliest moment as there is evidently some urgency in connection with the situation.\n\nIn connection with recommendations that have been made in this report, I am of the opinion that if the Department of Indian Affairs will supply the equipment recommended, they will eliminate a great deal of the dissatisfaction that has existed at the school with respect to the water supply. In my opinion it is a very cheap way of eliminating the dissatisfaction that has existed and furthermore we will not have any complaints from this school as to water supply for some years to come.\n\nA copy of this report has been handed to Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector, Department of Indian Affairs in the Commercial Building at Winnipeg, inasmuch as he is interested in the situation and accompanied the writer, at my request, upon the occasion of my inspection of the water supply system on Tuesday, June 26th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) D. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclos.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOTTAWA.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of June 9 in which you ask for an inspection and report on the water supply system at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Manitoba, I enclose herewith a report dated the 28th ultimo by Mr. B.E.Gow, together with a copy of his covering letter of the same date.\n\nMr. Gow's recommendation is to increase the facilities for hauling water from Lake Manitoba at an estimated cost of $1600.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nJuly 6th, 1934.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL,\n\nFor some time past, the water supply at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School on Sandy Bay Indian Reserve No. 5, electoral district of Neepawa, has been reported unsatisfactory. Reports received within the last month indicated that the situation was becoming serious and the Department arranged to have Dr. B. Gow, Acting District Chief of Engineer of the Dominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau, visit the Sandy Bay School.\n\nFor your information, I enclose Mr. Gow's report. It is evident from this report that something should be done immediately to improve the water supply at this school. The plan suggested by Mr. Gow involves an expenditure of $1,600.00. If you approve of carrying out Mr. Gow's recommendation, funds for the purpose are available.\n\nI would appreciate your returning Mr. Gow's report.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nREPORT ON\nWATER SUPPLY SITUATION\nAT\nSANDY BAY INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 26th the writer visited\nSandy Bay Indian School near Amaranth, Manitoba,\naccompanied by Mr. A. G. Hamilton, Inspector, Department\nof Indian Affairs, Winnipeg. Mr. Wade, Indian Agent at\nPortage la Prairie and in whose district the school is\nlocated was also at the school in connection with treaty\npayment. The water supply situation was fully discussed\nwith the Principal of the School, also different schemes\nfor improving the present unsatisfactory conditions.\n\nThe existing water supply at the Institution\nis briefly as follows: The school building is approximately\n100' x 40' and rainfall upon the roof is collected into an\nunderground cistern 12 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep,\nwith a capacity of about 7,000 gallons. This cistern is\nin close proximity to the kitchen and the water is\ndelivered to the kitchen by means of a hand pump located\nin the kitchen. This water is used for drinking, cooking\nand laundry purposes. For sanitary purposes three tanks\nwith a combined capacity of 2,200 gallons are located in\nthe attic of the building and a gravity water furnished\nthe school. The water supply to these tanks comes from\ntwo sources, but the quality of the water is much the same.\nA comparatively deep well, approximately 250 feet from the\nschool, is operated by a wind mill and a feed pipe leads\nto the water tanks, the energy necessary also being supplied\nby the windmill. A comparatively shallow well is located\nquite close to the workshop of the school and is connected\nto an underground cistern nearby; the dimensions of this\ncistern being about four feet square and sixteen feet deep.\nA pump driven by a small gasoline engine located in the workshop connects with this cistern and also to the storage tank in the attic and is operated during such periods as continued lack of sufficient wind to operate the windmill results in failure of water supply from the deeper well. The Principal of the School stated that this shallow well appeared to be going dry. The water from both these wells is very hard and distinctly salty. It is unfit for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes in the school, but I understand that in addition to sanitary purposes it is also used in the steam heating system, high pressure boiler and domestic water heater.\n\nThe amount of water that can be collected into the soft water cistern from the roof, even in a year of average precipitation, is far from sufficient to meet the requirements of the very limited use to which this supply is put and consequently water has to be hauled from Lake Manitoba - two and one-third miles distant. The hauling is done by team and a 400-gallon metal tank mounted on a wagon is used. It appears that only an average of one tank per week is hauled from the lake.\n\nWhile exceptionally light rainfall has been experienced at the school this spring, I would not say that water supply conditions at this Institution now are worse than they have been for several years past. However, conditions have been very unsatisfactory for many years past; they never were good, and the Principal and staff of the Institution have carried on year after year under very trying conditions, resultant from the nature of the water supply. Mr. Wade informs me that the annual expenditures for maintenance of the heating and plumbing system is very large and is undoubtedly due to the nature of the water supply since the salty water is utilized.\nConsideration has been given to different methods of providing a more satisfactory water supply but the fact remains that a satisfactory water supply cannot be assured except at a cost that must be considered prohibitive when consideration is given to the age and condition of the school. The cost of rendering the hard salty water fit for general use would be prohibitive and there are no facilities at the school for the operation of approved softening devices. Pumping the water to the school from Lake Manitoba would involve a large initial outlay and also a large annual operating charge for pumping etc., as the lift is considerable. The impounding of spring run-off in artificial reservoirs is not feasible at this location and the run-off conditions in the vicinity during the past two years have definitely proven this to be so.\n\nFrom an economic viewpoint, therefore, it would appear necessary and advisable to carry on at this school with the present sources of water supply - unsatisfactory as they undoubtedly are. However, it is possible to alleviate somewhat the trying conditions resulting from the present sources of water supply by providing equipment whereby a more adequate supply of Lake Manitoba water can be utilized in the Institution. In comparison with other Indian Schools, it is apparent that the soft water supply at Sandy Bay School, augmented as it is by hauling from Lake Manitoba, is conserved to a point where the Institution and its inmates suffer.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that the Department of Indian Affairs give immediate consideration to the purchase of equipment that will render it possible for the school to haul water from Lake Manitoba to the school rapidly and in such quantity that a much more\nextensive use of this water can be made in the Institution. The equipment required, with the approximate cost of the same at Winnipeg, would be as follows:\n\nI. Truck Chassis fitted with cab and built for load of 3\u00bd tons. Single tires on rear ---------------------------------------- $1,340.00\n\nII. Steel Tank 42\" dia. x 10' - 3/16 plate - Saddles and Fastenings --------------------- 135.00 25.00\n\nIII. Double Action Hand Pump ------------------ 25.00\n\nIV. 100 feet of 2\" hose ---------------------- 50.00 Strainers etc. ----------------------------- 18.00\n\n$1,600.00\n\nIt may be possible to reduce this estimate by utilizing a Ford Truck Chassis; the cost of which would be approximately $1,000.00, thereby reducing the estimated cost to $1,260.00.\n\nThe writer would also suggest that if the above equipment is provided, certain changes be made in the Institution to make possible more extended use of Lake Manitoba water during certain periods of the year. Lake Manitoba water should be used in the heating system, in the high pressure boiler and domestic water heater, rather than the salty water now used. To use Lake Manitoba water when available would necessitate shutting off the connection between the shallow salty water well near the workshop and the small cistern, utilizing this cistern as a reservoir for hauled Lake Manitoba water and pumping the water from this cistern to one of the three storage tanks in the attic. It is probable that a new 1\" pipe line would be required from this tank to the connections to the heating system, high pressure boiler and domestic water heater. However, savings effected in replacements would warrant the small expense involved in making these minor adjustments.\n\nAs a general rule it would be impossible to haul water by truck from the lake during the winter months although some winters it might be carried on for the greater portion\nof the winter. However, in winter water usage is not so heavy and furthermore there is less for teams and labor to be kept busy at.\n\nI understand that the Principal of the School originally suggested the supplying of a truck for water hauling. When questioned on the subject the Principal stated that if the equipment as recommended be furnished, he would be well satisfied. I am sure the equipment would be well cared for and believe that water would be used in much greater volume in the school and do much to eliminate the dissatisfaction that has been evidenced for years towards the water supply. With adequate quantities of water in use a general improvement in the welfare of the inmates of the Institution would naturally result.\n\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJune 28, 1934.\nREPORT ON\nWATER SUPPLY SITUATION\nAT\nSANDY BAY INDIAN SCHOOL.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJune 28, 1934.\n\nD.

This special feature shortens the installation time and makes complete trouble-proofing possible of this type of installation... reduces misalignment and end-thrust. The base is mounted on the corners instead of the center as heretofore. This new type of base makes it impossible to cramp the pump when changing lines.\n\nThe PATENTED VIKING RELIEF VALVE ON THE PUMP HEAD, which has received such enthusiastic approval also, since its introduction several years ago, is now included as standard equipment also. As you know, it allows the valves to be shut off when changing lines, etc., without stopping the pump.\n\nCan be driven by conventional power-take-off units or other similar means from the transmission or drive-shaft... sturdy, rugged pumps for all truck service.\n\nDIMENSIONAL SPECIFICATIONS\n\n![Diagram]\n\n* Can be furnished with 2\" ports on special request.

When you purchase your Viking, you are obtaining a product tested for many years of service and backed by the experience of an organization renowned throughout the world for its direct proportion to the revolutions per minute. The capacities may be materially increased when handling self-lubricating liquids, without decreasing the efficiency of subjecting parts to excessive wear, by stepped-up speeds.\n\nRefer to the accompanying illustration:\n\n1.

B. Gow,\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWith reference to our conversation yesterday concerning equipment for automotive truck, we submit for your consideration the following:\n\nONE - 42\" x 10' welded steel tank made up of 3/16\" black sheets, with one 16\" manhole and one each 2\" inlet and outlet (this tank cannot be properly galvanized).\n\nPRICE ........................................ $120.00\n\nIf bands required for fastening to chassis,\nadd ........................................... $2.50 ea.\n\nAlternative price on tank with same openings as above, but made up of 12 gauge galvanized iron sheets with welded seams and ends.\n\nPRICE ........................................... $90.00\n\nIf bands required for fastening to chassis,\nadd ........................................... $2.50 ea.\n\nONE - 2\" BEATTY Tank Pump, hand operated; suitable for fastening to skids, wood or metal platform, or truck.\n\nPRICE ........................................... $15.45\n\n(cont.)\nNovember 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nAs requested in your letter of November 12th prices have been obtained from Consolidated Motors Limited and Carter-Latter Motors Limited on truck suitable for use in connection with the water supply for Sandy Bay Indian School. Both firms are Chevrolet dealers and were asked to submit quotations on specified chassis and equipment. Their quotations are enclosed. The only material difference in prices is in connection with the price of spare tire. Until recently the Government could purchase tires at 20% below retail price, but since November 1st the discount is only 10% and evidently Carter-Latter Motors Limited are not aware of this fact.\n\nAs requested I am also enclosing quotations on equipment from Humford Medland Limited and Robinson-Alamo Company. The equipment required is as follows:\n\nI. One - 42\" x 10' - 12 gauge galvanized tank with 15\" manhole, one each 2\" inlet and outlet and with welded seams and ends.\n\nII. One 2\" Tank Pump, hand operated, suitable for fastening to truck.\n\nIII. Sixty Feet 2\" Cable Suction Hose, smooth bore with water hose couplings every 20 feet and with foot valve and strainer.\n\nQuotations were asked for on alternative equipment but it is recommended that the three items of equipment mentioned above be selected. Sixty feet of hose is now considered sufficient and if more is required additional 20' lengths can be secured.\n\nI would recommend the purchase of equipment from Humford Medland Limited, their price being lower.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 5)\nNovember 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the quotations being forwarded on truck and equipment for the Sandy Bay Indian School, I would also point out that there will be additional charges for the building of frame work to take the circular tank and also to provide for the mounting of the pump and for the carrying of the three lengths of hose. Prices have not been obtained for this work and I would suggest that after the order has been given for the purchase of the truck and the equipment outlined in my letter, that then the matter of the mounting of the truck, pump and hose be taken up.\n\nIn my report and recommendations under date of June 28th last, an item of $35.00 was included to provide for this work. I am of the opinion now, however, that this item will cost somewhat more than this amount and inquiries will be made shortly as to the probable cost of such work.\n\nI would also draw to your attention my report and recommendations of June 28th last wherein it was stated that if the equipment as outlined was provided, certain changes should be made in the Institution to make possible more extended use of Lake Manitoba water during certain periods of the year. I would again urge that consideration be given to carrying out these suggestions next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power\nand Hydrometric Bureau,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nD. B. Gow,\nActing District Chief Engineer.\nSir,\n\nAttention Mr. C.C. Parker\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant regarding water supply for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I enclose herewith copies of two letters dated the 24th instant from Mr. Gow, our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, together with quotations from the firms mentioned in your letter for the truck, steel tank, hand pump, hose and fittings.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Gow made certain recommendations as to the purchase of the equipment and draws attention to certain additional expenditures that will be necessary to supply water in the manner recommended in his report of June 28th last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

As this installation is being made on recommendation of the Dominion Water Power and Hydroelectric Bureau's representative we requested the Director of this Branch to have his Winnipeg representative call for tenders from the firms mentioned in your memorandum and we are now in receipt of quotations.\n\nThe quotation submitted by Consolidated Motors Limited for a Chevrolet #118X - 15\" F.B., 2 ton Chassis with standard cab equipped with 32 x 6, 10 ply first grade tires front and 32 x 6, 10 ply first grade dual tires rear is $1,286.70 net, while that of Carter-Latter Motors Limited is $1,286.81 net, a difference only of $.11\u00a2. Quotation is also given covering a spare tire and tube. In both cases the same gross price is quoted, $53.50 but the Carter-Latter Motors have allowed 30% discount from this amount whereas Consolidated Motors Limited have allowed only 10% discount. This means that the net price for truck with spare tire as quoted by Carter-Latter Motors is $1,269.08 while that of Consolidated Motors Limited would amount to $1,275.18.\n\nWith regard to the necessary equipment which includes one -42\" x 10' welded steel tank; One 2\" Beatty Tank Pump, hand operated and 100 - feet of 2\" Cable Suction Hose, with couplings, the quotation of Mumford Medland Limited is lower than that of Robinson-Alamo Company, the respective figures being Mumford Medland Limited....\nLimited $213.20; Robinson-Alamo Company $237.75.\n\nIt is recommended that the necessary equipment be purchased from the Rumford Medland Company Limited, their price being low and considered fair and just.\n\nI would be pleased to have your ruling as to what firm should receive the order for the truck chassis, the prices quoted by both firms being considered fair and just.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| To Account Rendered |  |\n|---------------------|--|\n| Nov.23             |  |\n| To Chief Cloth Wares |  |\n| Sold to Sandy Bay School | $50 |\n| Authority: Letter No. 126-2-5, Dated Ottawa |\n| October 18th, 1934 |  |\n| Voucher No. 12379 |  |\n| J.

(Federal District of Neepawa), forwarded through the office of Mr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man., that urgent repairs be carried out to the laundry drying room at the school.\n\nYou authorized that James Dalton, Neepawa, visit the school and report on the work required and the cost of same. Mr. Agent Waite was instructed accordingly, and he forwards a report from W. H. Dalton, Tinsmith, Plumbing and Heating, Neepawa, Man., giving, in detail, the material and labour required to the amount of $392.46. Mr. W. H. Dalton also states that, to the above amount, the sum of approximately $10 be added in case there are some extra fittings needed when the repairs are being made.\n\nThere are funds available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year to provide the expenditure required.\n\nI would request to be advised if Mr. W. H. Dalton may be engaged to supply the material and labour in having the above repairs to the laundry at the Sandy Bay School carried out.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, January 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing an estimate, stating in detail the materials and labour required in carrying out the necessary repairs in the laundry at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange with W. H. Dalton, Neepawa, Man., to supply the materials and labour in having the repairs carried out. It is noted that the cost, for materials, labour and transportation, will be $382.46 - to which should be added the sum of approximately $10.00, in case there are some extra fittings needed when the repairs are being made. You should request Mr. Dalton to have these repairs completed as soon as possible.\n\nAfter the work has been finished to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, setting forth in detail the materials supplied and their cost and also the number of hours of labour employed and the rate paid. These accounts, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. These accounts should reach the Department before our books close at the end of the present fiscal year. The entire expenditure incurred should not exceed the above stated amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nFebruary 5th, 1936.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nTHE HONOURABLE THE SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL:\n\nIn reply to your inquiry of February 5th, I may say that the Principal of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School was recently given permission to purchase a cupboard for class-room supplies, costing about $30, from any firm on the approved list. Whether this is the cabinet referred to in your correspondent's telegram is uncertain. Doctor Lerner has had no permission to purchase a physician's cabinet.\n\nThe requisition for drugs and surgical instruments referred to in the latter part of the telegram is probably the usual requisition for drugs for the residential school. The drugs will be supplied from the Medical stores at Ottawa. It is impossible that any substantial quantity of surgical instruments will be supplied. Doctor Lerner is a part-time physician, and the Department does not supply instruments to such employees.\n\nThe account for the cabinet and the requisition for drugs are in all probability on their way to Ottawa. When they arrive I shall report further.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n| Item | Description | Spec.

Arrangements were made with the Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie whereby the truck would be delivered to the Sandy Bay Indian School as soon as the condition of the roads permitted.\n\nI would like to point out that an additional invoice will be forwarded, when received from Mumford Medland Limited, covering the supplying of additional parts in connection with the assembly.

I have no doubt whatever that the requisition for drugs referred to is the usual drug order which would not be received under ordinary circumstances until the summer holidays.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n| Description                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total Price |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------------|\n| Brought forward                                  |          |            |             |\n| 1-2 x 1/4 black cast tee                        | 1        | 60         | 60          |\n| 1-2 x 1/2 gal. tee                              | 1        | 100        | 100         |\n| 1-1/4 x 1/4 black cast tee                      | 1        | 25         | 25          |\n| 3-2\" black cast elbow                           | 3        | 90         | 270         |\n| 4-1/4 black 1/8 elbow                           | 4        | 92         | 368         |\n| 3-1/4 black union                               | 3        | 90         | 270         |\n| 6-2\" N P closet elbows with washers              | 6        | 135        | 810         |\n| Transportation Receipt No. 168                   |          | 21         | 21          |\n| Labor to two Dalton and helper                  |          | 135        | 270         |\n| By Rebate on return transportation ticket from Amaranth to postage |          | 3.00       | 3.00        |\n| And dues                                         |          | 389.21     |             |\n\nAuthority: Department Letter dated January 23rd, 1935 file no. 126-9-5.\n\nWoucher No. B 529\n\nThree Hundred & Eighty-Nine $389.21\n\nIndian Affairs.

Feb 20/35\n\nMr. Waite,\nIndian Agent\nPortage la Prairie\nMan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to make a suggestion in regard to the water supply to the boilers at the Sandy Bay Indian School. There is a cistern just outside the laundry now if there was a force pump (hand) installed in place of present soft water pump and this pump piped to both laundry boiler and heating boiler and soft water when they have the supply and when there is no soft water use lake water. The water from the well from pipes I have renewed is very bad for both boiler and piping. The boiler that is in the laundry I believe has a slight bulge on the bottom. I don't know that it is very bad but I think it would be as well if that boiler was inspected by a boiler inspector. I set the blow off valve at 17# and told them at the school not to use more than that unless an\nInspector gave them permission to do so.\n\nI did not figure what the coat of paint and pipe and fitting for the above would cost but I would do so if requested.\n\nI told Father Chagnon that just as soon as the cars could get over to the school from here I would make an inspection of work just finished and see if same was satisfactory.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

E 568,\n\namounting to $183.75 in favour\n\nof Corona Lumber Co., Ltd., Gladstone, Manitoba.\n\nfor Building material for erection of garage to house truck at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nLetter No. 126-9-5 dated December 22nd, 1934.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOttawa, March 16, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nFor some time past, the Department has been allowing grant at the rate of $40 a month towards the salary of the night watchman at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. The amount available for this purpose is limited, and, as a number of Indian residential schools, which formerly did not receive any grant, are now requesting similar consideration, the Department finds it necessary to only allow grant towards the night watchman's services for a period of seven months.\n\nConsequently, in the case of the night watchman at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, the allowance will only be made until April 30, 1935. Payment of the grant for the night watchman will be resumed on October 1, 1935, and will continue until April 30, 1936. The same amount as formerly, viz., $40 a month, will be allowed. You should so inform the Principal of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nMarch 14, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the memorandum of the 6th instant, from the Minister's office, relative to a communication received by him from the Archbishop of Winnipeg, regarding the present condition of the SANDY BAY Indian Residential School, I would state as follows:\n\nIn 1906, under arrangement between this Department and the St. Boniface Industrial School authorities, it was agreed that the Church should build three boarding schools, the cost to aggregate $33,522.81, the value then placed upon the St. Boniface Industrial School property. The points chosen for the erection of these schools were Sandy Bay, Fort Frances, and Fort Alexander.\n\nThe building at Sandy Bay was completed in 1906 and handed over to this Department. During the fiscal year 1913-14, the Department expended the sum of approximately $20,000 for extensions and alterations and renewing heating plant. Each year since that time, a certain amount of repair has been made to this building. The building is old and inadequate to meet the requirements. It is not worth spending any large amount in repair. A new building is, no doubt, needed but on a different site, where an adequate water supply could be obtained, and large enough to provide accommodation for at least 100 children. Unless the amount required (approximately $150,000) could be provided under an extension to the Public Works Construction Act, there are no funds available to erect a new building.\n\nI regret that I was unable to visit this school during my trip west, but I understand it is the same size and type as the building at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nMan.\nMarch 14, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nWith reference to the memorandum of the 5th instant, from the Minister's office, relative to a communication received by him from the Archbishop of Winnipeg regarding the present condition of the SANDY BAY Indian Residential School, I would state as follows:\n\nIn 1906, under arrangement between this Department and the St. Boniface Industrial School authorities, it was agreed that the Church should build three boarding schools, the cost to aggregate $33,522.81, the value then placed upon the St. Boniface Industrial School property. The points chosen for the erection of these schools were Sandy Bay, Fort Frances, and Fort Alexander.\n\nThe building at Sandy Bay was completed in 1906 and handed over to this Department. During the fiscal year 1913-14, the Department expended the sum of approximately $30,000 for extensions and alterations and renewing heating plants. Each year since that time, a certain amount of repair has been made to this building. The building is old and inadequate to meet the requirements. It is not worth spending any large amount in repair. A new building is, no doubt, needed but on a different site, where an adequate water supply could be obtained, and large enough to provide accommodation for at least 100 children. Unless the amount required (approximately $130,000) could be provided under an extension to the Public Works Construction Act, there are no funds available to erect a new building.\n\nI regret that I was unable to visit this school during my trip west, but I understand it is the same size and type as the building at the Fort Alexander Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nThe Right Reverend Dr. Simott, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Winnipeg, has addressed a letter to the Minister, from which the following is extracted:\n\n\"I have just returned from a visit to the Indian missions in the northern part of my jurisdiction and I think it my duty to lay certain considerations before you. The missions I visited covered the Reserves of Shoal River, Birch River, Pine Creek, Waterhen, Crane River, Ebb and Flow and Sandy Bay. I found the Indians on these Reserves, with the possible exception of Pine Creek, in a pitiable state of destitution. The fishing and the hunting this year have been almost a failure, and as a consequence the Indians are without sufficient food or clothing. I personally receive all kinds of demands (I enclose a sample) and I try to give some help in every case, but you can realize that this should be a matter for Government support and not for private charity. May I ask that you request some one of your army of agents and inspectors to look into the situation.\n\nMay I now take the liberty of directing your attention to two other matters that concern me greatly:\n\n1. Winnipogosis. It seems to me that there should be a hospital built at this point for the care of the Indians and Half-breeds. There are 1200 Indians and Half-breeds on the Pine Creek Reserve and in the adjacent country, there are Half-breeds settled all around the shores of Lake Winnipogosis, and across the Lake there is the other Indian Reserve of Waterhen. A Hospital at Winnipogosis would be a most humanitarian way of helping a large number of people who have extreme...\"\nneed of hospital care and who are so far removed that they are practically without it. A Hospital at Winnipegosis would be serviceable also for the many fishermen who frequent this Lake both in winter and in summer. I commend this project to your earnest consideration.\n\n2. Sandy Bay. The Residential School at Sandy Bay is not only inadequate to meet the needs of the Reserve, but it is in a most disgraceful, not to say disgusting, condition. This School is in your own Constituency and you must be familiar with it. Either a new School should be built in a more convenient situation, or the old School should be thoroughly repaired and considerably enlarged. This matter has been under consideration for so many years, that it were time indeed that some definite conclusion be reached.\"\n\nThe Minister would appreciate a memorandum covering the matters referred to, which will enable him to reply to His Grace.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMarch 16th, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nI have to refer to your memorandum of the 5th March with extracts from letter from Most Reverend Dr. Sinnett, Archbishop of Winnipeg.\n\nI am attaching memoranda from Mr. Parker with regard to the question of relief and from Mr. Sutherland in connection with the Sandy Bay school. In regard to the latter I would also refer you to page 6 of my report of September 8th. Last, following my visit to Western Canada, my reference to the Sandy Bay school is as follows:\n\n\"We paid a visit to the residential school. Father Chagnon, the principal, has a fine collection of mounted birds and a nice garden. Outside of these two features there is very little concerning this school building that is worthy of commendation. The building is very old, the fire hazard great and upon first consideration one would doubt the advisability of spending more money in attempted repairs or renovations. As you are aware, the question of a water supply is a very great difficulty at this point.\"\n\nFrom Departmental experience in the administration of this school and from information obtained on the occasion of my visit, I am of the opinion that serious consideration should be given to the closing of this school.\n\nWith regard to the question of the erection of a hospital at Winnipegosissi, I may say that the Director of Medical Services advises me that while it is stated that there are 1200 Indians and Half-breeds in this district, only 200 of these are Indians. In the event of there being funds available for the building of a hospital for Indian patients in Manitoba, there are other localities where the necessity is greater and which would be more suitable than Winnipegosissi.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am very glad that the error has been brought to your attention so that it can be rectified. I am today writing to the Indian Agent at Portage la Prairie to inquire whether or not the truck has left Portage la Prairie. I am under the impression that it has not and if this is the case, immediate steps will be taken to have the name \"Department of Interior\" removed and Department of Indian Affairs, Canada, placed on the truck to conform to the remainder of the sign.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD.

Mr. Gow's estimate of the cost of the proposed installation is $23,281.50 which is made up as follows -\n\n(a) Intake $7,330.00\n(b) Pipe Line $8,470.00\n(c) Pumping System $1,050.00\n(d) Distribution System $3,965.00\nHauling - Railway to job $350.00\nWorkmen's Compensation, Contingencies, Engineering, Inspection, etc., 10% $2,116.50\n\n$23,281.50\n\nI might add for your information that the existing water supply system is briefly as follows -\n\nThe school building is approximately 100' x 40' and rainfall upon the roof is collected into an underground cistern 12 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep, with a capacity of about 7,000 gallons. This cistern is in close proximity\nto the kitchen and the water is delivered to the kitchen by means of a hand pump located in the kitchen. This water is used for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes. For sanitary purposes three tanks with a combined capacity of 2,200 gallons are located in the attic of the building and a gravity water furnished the school. The water supply to these tanks comes from two sources, but the quality of the water is much the same. A comparatively deep well, approximately 250 feet from the school, is operated by a windmill and a feed pipe leads to the water tanks, the energy necessary also being supplied by the windmill. A comparatively shallow well is located quite close to the workshop of the school and is connected to an underground cistern nearby; the dimensions of this cistern being about four feet square and sixteen feet deep. A pump driven by a small gasoline engine located in the workshop connects with this cistern and also to the storage tank in the attic and is operated during such periods as continued lack of sufficient wind to operate the windmill results in failure of water supply from the deeper well. The Principal of the School stated that this shallow well appeared to be going dry. The water from both these wells is very hard and distinctly salty. It is unfit for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes in the school, but I understand that in addition to sanitary purposes it is also used in the steam heating system, high pressure boiler and domestic water heater.\n\nThe amount of water that can be collected into the soft water cistern from the roof, even in a year of average precipitation, is far from sufficient to meet the requirements of the very limited use to which this supply is put and consequently water has to be hauled from Lake Manitoba - two and one-third miles distant. The hauling is done by team and a 400-gallon metal tank mounted on a wagon is used. It appears that only an average of one tank per week is hauled from the lake.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, September 18, 1935.\n\nJ.

Chagnon\nMcGill\n\nWhen submitting your report, will you please furnish a translation of Father Chagnon's letter enclosed.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt\nNovember 26, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 20th instant, with attached correspondence from His Grace Archbishop Simott, Winnipeg, regarding the condition of the building at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, and also a communication from the Principal, Reverend Father Chagnon, O.M.I.\n\nThis school is located on the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, No. 5, Manitowah Agency. The history of its establishment is as follows:\n\nIn 1905, the Roman Catholic Church authorities erected four Indian Residential Schools, viz.: Sandy Bay, Fort Alexander, Kenora, and Fort Frances, which they turned over to the Department, in exchange for the Residential School which was conducted at that time in St. Boniface.\n\nSince that time, considerable expense has been incurred on all the above named schools, in providing additions, alterations and repairs, but, notwithstanding the expenditure on these buildings from year to year, they are still in an unsatisfactory condition. The Sandy Bay School is in a more unsatisfactory condition than the other three buildings. It is very poorly located; the building is now very old, the fire hazard great, and it would only be a waste of money to attempt further repairs or renovations. The building is not large enough to accommodate the number of children of school age on the reserve. There are 130 children of school age, and the total number that can be accommodated in the Sandy Bay School is 75. Even at that, it is overcrowded.\n\nEfforts have been made, during the past few years, to obtain an adequate water supply, but no satisfactory solution\n\nEncl.\nsolution has been found.\n\nThe Department obtained, from the amount provided by the Public Works Construction Act, an allotment of the funds required to erect a day school building on this reserve, to provide classroom accommodation for 40 children. A site was chosen and plans prepared, but this work has not been proceeded with. The funds are still available, and it is considered that the erection of a day school during the coming summer, in addition to the accommodation at the residential school, would provide educational facilities for all the children on the reserve. It is proposed to proceed with the work of erecting the day school next summer.\n\nUndoubtedly, action will need to be taken in the near future to replace the present old building in use at the Sandy Bay Residential School. Officers of the Department have visited this school from time to time, and all have reported on the condition of the building and the lack of proper water supply. At present, water is being drawn, by a motor truck, from the lake, a distance of three or four miles. The Department has supplied a truck, with water tank, for this purpose.\n\nThe problem of providing educational facilities on this reserve might be solved by the erection of day schools. However, I am quite sure that the closing of the residential school would meet with strong opposition from the Catholic Church authorities.\n\nAs requested, I return herewith the correspondence which accompanied your memorandum, including three copies of the translation of the communication from Father Chagnon, the Principal.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n*Ottawa, December 5th, 1935.*\n\n**SHIP TO:** Mr. O.

I took this matter up with Mr. Waite, the Indian Agent, and as a result he informed me that the Rev. Principal wishes to be provided with a machine similar to the one now in use at the school, and submitted Mr. Lawton's name, along with the firm he represents. Mr. Lawton informed me the price of these machines is $150., but as his company is going out of business in Winnipeg and as he wishes to close down by the 15th of January, he will supply a 50 lb.

There is a considerable fire hazard and, besides, great difficulty in obtaining a water supply.\n\nIt will be necessary, before building operations are proceeded with, that a new site be obtained on the reserve, where an adequate supply of water for domestic and fire purposes is available. The Department understands that a site with adequate water supply can be obtained on the reserve, a distance of three or four miles from the present school. It will be necessary to obtain a surrender from the Indians of the Band of the area of - land required\nland required for school and farm purposes.\n\nI am unable to state when it will be possible to provide the necessary funds to erect and furnish a new building with accommodation for 120 children. This would involve an expenditure of approximately $130,000. The Archbishop might be informed that the need of a new residential school on the Sandy Bay reserve will be kept in mind and favourable consideration given when possible to obtain the necessary funds. The staff of the present school will, no doubt, be able to carry on, even under existing handicaps, until such time as it may be possible to erect a new building.\n\nI do not consider that it would be advisable to choose a site for the school until it is definitely decided to proceed with construction. However, the Department would have no objection to His Grace proceeding with the erection of a church, provided that a surrender from the Indians is obtained and this is forwarded to the Department, together with a surveyor's description of the proposed site of the church. Mr. Agent Waite, Portage la Prairie, is the proper officer to arrange with the Indians of the Band for a surrender of the area of land required for church purposes.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nFebruary 14, 1936\n\nDR.

Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure\nOTTAWA,\nFebruary 17, 1926.\n\nMy dear Archbishop Sinnott:\n\nRef: Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nIn reference to the suggestion contained in Your Grace's letter of January 13th, regarding the immediate selection of a site for the Sandy Bay Residential School, I would say that this would appear scarcely feasible on account of the severe weather conditions now prevailing in Manitoba. Without complete information on the subject I would consider that this is a matter that might be deferred until the ground is clear of snow, when a tentative site could be selected for utilization, in the event of a school being erected at a later date.\n\nBefore the matter of a site is finally decided upon, I should like to have our Departmental Architect review the situation as, in the past, the Department has been subject to unnecessary expense, through ill-advised action, in the selection of sites for residential schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nMost Reverend A.

Without complete information on the subject I think it would be advisable to leave the matter until the snow is off the ground; I will then be glad to co-operate with you in the matter of the selection of a site.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.)

INSPECTOR HAMILTON DATED APRIL 16, 1936, ON HIS INSPECTION OF THE SANDY BAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nThe fire hose on the first floor was detached, because of a leaky valve. This valve should be renewed.\n\nThe plumbing needs repairing in several places. One break on the ground floor will involve considerable expense as the flooring will have to be renewed. The pipe from the well to the school is also frozen or broken and all water used is now being hauled from the lake. The new truck is used for this purpose and has given good service. I noticed many of the taps are badly corroded and, before long, a large amount of repair work will be needed.\n\nThe furnace is in need of repair, but no doubt this can wait until summer. It appears to need a crown plate and possibly grates. The brick work on one side is badly in need of repair. In one place it is open two or three inches; in fact, pieces of brick have fallen out.\n\nThe stove for heating the root cellar has about 70' of pipe which runs along the ceiling to the furnace room. I understand this was not in use during the past winter as the vegetable crop failed. In my opinion this is a most likely source for a fire and the stove should not be used again with the present arrangement of pipes.\n\nI received no complaints of any kind in connection with the school. The Department, of course, are aware of the condition of the building and also the inadequate and unsatisfactory water supply.\nSir,\n\nThe sewerage system at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School is badly blocked. The staff at the school have done everything possible to clean out the pipes without success. There is no doubt that the floor of the children's dining room will have to be torn up to find the blockage, and portions of the floor will have to be relaid with new lumber. I cannot even make a guess at the cost of this repair, and as no names of plumbers are shown on the approved list for the district in which the school is situate, I would be pleased if the department would furnish the name of a plumber who could be asked to give an estimate on the cost of this work. There are also some minor repairs to be made to the heating system and to the water system.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nApril 16, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Kan., reports that the sewage system at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School has been completely blocked. It will be necessary to tear up part of the floor in the children's dining room, in order to find the blockage, and portions of the floor will need to be relaid with new lumber. There are also some minor repairs required to the heating system and the water system. Mr. Agent Waite requests that he be furnished with the name of a plumber, who can visit the school, submit an estimate of the cost and carry out the repairs required.\n\nThis school is a government-owned property, located on the Sandy Bay Indian Reserve, No. 6, Manitowah Agency, Federal Electoral District of Neepawa.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will furnish the name of a competent plumber to carry out the above mentioned work.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nMr. J.

I. Mott, Plumber, Neepawa, Man., to accompany you to the school, and, following his inspection, you should let me have an estimate of the cost of making the necessary repairs. No work should be done until our approval has been given.\n\nFor your personal information, I may say that the sum of $400 is provided in this year's appropriation for miscellaneous repairs at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. Consequently, you will see the necessity of being with the plumber when he visits the school, in order that only the absolutely necessary work should be considered, as it will not be possible for the Department to supply an amount greater than that stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The very necessary work at the school was gone over, and I expect an estimate of the cost of repairs in due course. The soil pipe is badly corroded and apparently collapsed. It is very difficult to estimate the actual cost of this repair until the floor is torn up. This pipe is a lead from one toilet and also services a sink and catch basin. There is also a danger of the main lead being corroded. The other repairs are to plumbing in the school, replacing corroded pipes, and repairs to the heating furnace. This repair is likely to be expensive as a new crown sheet is required, and considerable brickwork will have to be torn down and replaced. There are other pipes and fittings that will only last a short time. Moisture is showing through pipes in a number of places. This is due to various salts in the water eating through.\n\nAs soon as Mr. Mott's estimate is received, same will be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJ. Warte Eng.\nIndian Office\nPortage La Prairie\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is an approximate estimate on the work to be done on the Sandy Bay school.\n\nAs all this work is under the basement floor it is impossible to tell the exact extent of damage to the plumbing before the floor is taken up.\n\nI submit the following material list & prices to cover what I believe will be the necessary immediate repairs.\nThe work required to remove the drain from the bath basin on the second floor will amount to about $22.15 with a possible $10.00 or $12.00 extra in the event that the large soil pipe in connection with it has to be removed.\n\nRegarding the plate above the boiler door, this is not plumbing work and I would suggest you consult a bricklayer who specializes in boiler work as the plate would have to be removed. This, however, is the cause of no immediate trouble.\n\nI trust that this will be satisfactory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.J.

Repairs to the plumbing approximately $22.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, enclosing an estimate of the repairs required to the soil pipe and plumbing at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that you may arrange with Mr. R. I. Mott, Plumber, Neepawa, Man., to supply the material and carry out the work in placing the soil pipe in a satisfactory condition and in repairing the drains from the wash basins on the second floor. It is noted that the cost of the material and repairs to the soil pipe will be approximately $155, with an allowance for extras in the event that they are required, not exceeding the sum of $25. It is noted, further, that the work in repairing the drains from the wash basins would cost approximately $22, with a possible extra of $10, in the event that the large soil pipe has to be renewed.\n\nAfter the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, from Mr. Mott, covering the cost of the materials, also an account, in triplicate, covering the cost of the labour. This latter account should show the number of days or hours employed and the rate paid. When you receive these accounts, you should attach them to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nRegarding the repairs required to the heating furnace, it is noted that this work will have to be done by a brick layer, who specializes in boiler work. When we have the name of the brick layer to be employed, you will be advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ.

He will, in future, request authority when he finds that the work will exceed the estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed you will find my account in quadruple as asked for. I have itemized each job separately. The jobs for which I sent you estimates are on the first sheet of the statement. The first on which I quoted you $155.00 with $25 for extra has as you will note amounted to somewhat over $155.00 due to the fact that it required more material than I had figured on and more labor due to the depth the pipe was buried.\n\nTo put the wash basins on the second floor in order so as to give any satisfaction it was necessary to renew all pipe and fittings to the main stack.\n\nThe soil pipe from the toilets in the girls dormitory was almost entirely clogged and had to be removed as was the 5\" main thru the boys playroom and also below the basement floor. As most of this pipe was in good condition it was possible to remove the scale and replace most of the same pipe.\n\nI wish to thank you for this work and trust that it will be satisfactory.\n\nI will also greatly appreciate consideration in any future work you may have in my line.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.J.

HALL:\n\nThe following is an extract from a letter received in this office:\n\n\"Mr. Martin Jackson of Langruth was down to see me a few days ago. He has been putting down a well on his farm. Mr. W. Smith, a well-driller, did the work.\n\n\"Mr. Smith intimated to Mr. Jackson that there was some well casing in the Indian Reserve at Sandy Bay which was of no value as it had been put down in a dry well seven or eight years ago. He intimated that it would be no trouble to have that casing and Mr. Jackson pay what the Department felt should be paid.\n\n\"However, before getting permission to remove the casing, he removed the casing and put it down Mr. Jackson's well. Mr. Jackson was under the impression that he had received permission but subsequently it transpired that no permission had been given and I think the Priest at Sandy Bay laid information against Smith for stealing the pipe.\n\n\"The Mounted Police made a visit to the area and reported to the Indian Department what they had found. The pipe is at present on Mr. Martin Jackson's farm, down his well 80 feet of it and 20 feet lying on the surface.\n\n\"For your information I may say that the wholesale price for this pipe new is around 70\u00a2 a foot. The pipe has been down in alkali ground where chemical action will no doubt have deteriorated the metal for many years and so it is up to Mr. Crerar to say how much a foot Mr. Jackson shall pay for this second-hand pipe.\n\n\"I shall be glad if you will take this matter up directly as these gentlemen are both rather worried.\"\nMEMORANDUM\n\nWill you kindly let me have a report, for the Minister's information, as to what action you would suggest should be taken with a view to selling this pipe to Mr. Jackson.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt.\nOctober 26th, 1956.\n\nRESPECTFUL,\n\nThe Honorable The Superintendent General,\n\nReferring to Mr. Scott's memorandum of October 23rd in reference to some well casing which was removed from the Sandy Bay School grounds without authority by Mr. Martin Johnson, or Mr. W. Smith, a well-driller, acting on his behalf, I would state that the disposition of government property such as this must be made through the Dominion Salvage Officer.\n\nThe only suggestion that I can offer now is that Mr. Johnson should submit a price for this casing and it will then be placed in the hands of the Dominion Salvage Officer for disposal. I do not see how we can place a price on the pipe but if a fair offer is made I think we might make a recommendation to Colonel Beer that it be accepted. We paid for this pipe ten years ago at the rate of $1.14 per foot.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 23rd instant, No. 126-9-5, in connection with repairs to the water supply and heating systems at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, the following quotations were received from the firms mentioned - F.O.B. Amaranth, Manitoba:\n\nThe James Robertson Co., Ltd. $200.54\nThe J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd. 209.18\nMarshall-Wells Co., Ltd. 220.89\n\nThe above quotations cover pipe in random lengths, so that if the pipe is purchased, it may not be possible to supply the exact quantities and therefore the cost would not be exactly as stated above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.G.

They replied to my letter on October 14th, and I enclose a copy of their reply. The Burns and Company referred to in their letter was taken over by The Marshall Wells Co., Limited of Winnipeg, and I immediately got in touch with this firm asking them to furnish the repair. The Marshall Wells Company wrote back stating the John Inglis Company - the firm who made the furnace - was out of business, but enclosed a catalogue of the furnaces manufactured by this firm when in business, with the information that the parts could be purchased through them. I immediately transferred this information, with the catalogue, to Lye and Sons. This was forwarded on the 6th ultimo. Having received no reply I again wrote them, and today I am in receipt of their reply, which also is attached herewith.\n\nPersonally, I do not think it necessary to tear down the boiler. All that is required is a new flame sheet and minor repairs to several pipes. It will be necessary to tear down some of the brickwork to install the flame sheet, and I do not consider this a big job.\n\nI feel that this firm has been very lax in attending to this work, as most of the inquiries were made from this office.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe firm made one visit to look over the boiler on October 14th.\n\nThere is no doubt that the work will now have to stand over until spring. I am informed that the boiler can be fired until that time, under certain inconveniences.\n\nI beg to suggest that another firm be given the work, as in Lye and Sons letter dated October 14th they write as follows:\n\n\"However, if you would prefer to turn the job over to one of the Hardwares there, it will be quite satisfactory to us\".\n\nA full copy of this letter is attached.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nFortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nThe writer was up to the Sandy Bay School to inspect the furnace and the repairs required. However, we were unable to get much information with regard to the heating plant as it has no number, just the maker's name. We understand from the father, however, that the plant was supplied by Burns & Co. of your City. They are out of business now, we understand, but it might be possible for you to get the required information from Mr. Burns, first hand. We are at a loss to know what size flange sheet is required and feel the job might more easily taken care of from there where you no doubt can get the information required, quite easily. If you could have the part that is mentioned cut to the School we could quite easily do the job, however, if you would prefer to turn the job over to one of the Hardwares there, it will be quite satisfactory to us.\n\nIf you wish us to go ahead with the job, we would be glad to have you supply us with some further information with regard to the plant.\n\nRegretting our delay in this matter, we remain.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.W.

We also have been trying to get any information we can in this regard, but so far have nothing definite.\n\nApparently the only way to have this work done would be to tear down the old boiler and find out what is required, so that the necessary parts may be obtained. This can not be done at the present time, and as the furnace, so far as we can see, is in no worse condition than it has been for some time, we would suggest that this work be done in the spring.\n\nWhen we agreed to do this work we thought it would only be necessary to get the name and number of the boiler, and order the parts required. However, as you know it seems to be impossible to get this information therefore it will be necessary to tear down the boiler. It has made the work very difficult for us, and we can not see how it can be done at this time of year under these conditions, as it will be necessary to take out the old part and possibly have a new piece specially made to fit the boiler.\n\nWe regret there has been such a delay over this matter, but it has not been entirely our fault.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.W.Lye & Son Ltd,\nper: (Signed) R.E.Lye.\n\nREL:GL.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to repairs to the boiler at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you consider the necessary work on this boiler can be delayed until next spring.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

The three machines were purchased from the Marshall-Wells Company of Winnipeg at a cost of $37.55, and I am recently in receipt of a letter from the Reverend Principal asking that these machines be returned and one gasoline driven washer purchased in their place.\n\nThe Marshall-Wells Company will accept the return, and quote a price of approximately $109.50 for the gasoline driven machine. There is no doubt that the hand power machines are not suitable in a Residential School unless a power driven machine is provided for the heavy washing. This would be a supplementary unit to the hand washing machines they already have.\n\nI request therefore, a further amount of $49.50, so that a power machine may be purchased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, February 27, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, regarding the authority granted you for the purchase from a firm on the approved list of three (3) hand power washing machines and three (3) wringers for use at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is now noted that these three (3) machines were purchased and forwarded to the school but that the Principal is requesting that they be returned and a gasoline driven washer purchased in their place at an extra cost of $49.50 over that of the three hand power machines. In this connection, I would refer to your letter of January 5th, last, in which you stated that the Principal requested that hand power machines and wringers be supplied. The Principal should have definitely made up his mind as to his requirements before making his request. However, in view of your report that these hand power machines are not suitable for the heavy washing in a residential school, the Department approves of your arranging to have the three machines and wringers returned and a gasoline driven washer supplied in their place. It is noted that the cost will be, approximately, $109.50. There should be no expense to the Department in transportation charges for returning the three machines.\n\nAfter the gasoline driven machine has been delivered at the school, you should obtain an account in triplicate, covering the cost, which you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Father Plourde and the Rev. Father Provincial called recently to discuss conditions at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. We, of course, realize that this school is poorly equipped and needs, not only equipment, but extensive repairs.\n\nThe one feature especially emphasised was the drudgery of the laundry. The machines are hand power and, to do the washing for all the children in this manner, is altogether too much work as many of the pupils are quite young. The Rev. Principal requested three gasoline washing machines at an approximate cost of $375. However, I think a power washer more suitable. The washer would cost approximately $240. F.O.B. Winnipeg; re-conditioned and guaranteed Extractor $255. and a 4 H.P. gas engine, new, $160., or a re-built one and guaranteed $80. There would perhaps be additional cost for shafting, hangers, and pulleys, of $65.\n\nTotal Expense -\nWasher $240.00\nReconditioned Extractor $235.00\n4 H.P. Engine $165.00\nPulleys etc. $65.00\n\n$ 705.00\n\nThis amount could be reduced, if it is impossible to provide the funds, by supplying:\n\nWasher $240.00\nRe-conditioned 4 H.P. Engine $85.00\nPulleys, shafting etc. $65.00\n\n$ 390.00\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA,\n\nStanley Brock\nStanley Brock Limited quoted on the washing machine equipment and Mumford Madland Ltd. on the engines. Prices are F.O.B. Winnipeg. If possible, I would like to see this equipment allowed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, May 31, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to new equipment that is required for the laundry at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nI regret that the funds at our disposal will not permit our supplying the equipment mentioned in the first part of your letter. However, you may purchase the following:\n\n- Washer - $240.00\n- Re-conditioned 4 H.P. Engine - $50.00\n- Pulleys, shafting, etc. - $65.00\n\n$355.00\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L.

Allotment 2 Sub-allotment 209.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nof Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa\n\nForm No. 518\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nJune 1, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nCertain improvements are being made at the Sandy Bay Residential School in the lay-out of the rooms and during my recent visit to the school with Dr. Lerner, he inquired if it would be possible to have a small room set aside for a dispensary and examination room. The matter was taken up with the Reverend Principal and he is willing to give a portion of a room which would have to be partitioned, windows installed, and a doorway cut through from the main passage. The approximate cost including labour, lumber etc., enamel paint, windows and door would be $95.00. The school staff are not prepared to do the work as they have more work than they can handle, but would give all assistance possible if a carpenter were hired. The wages of the carpenter are included in the $95.00.\n\nThere is no doubt that a dispensary should be allotted Dr. Lerner. The drugs at present are kept in a cabinet in the entrance hall. This is most inconvenient and insanitary as the cabinet makes an excellent leaning place for the Indians. Will you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJune 1, 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to Department letter 126-9-5 dated December 7th last, I beg to advise that the brick work on the boiler at the Sandy Bay Residential School should be repaired at this time. In addition to the repairs that were necessary last year, the brick arches in the fire box also require repairing. The Reverend Principal suggested that I recommend the name of the Yates Company, Brandon, Manitoba to do this work. He claims this is a reliable firm which has done considerable work on boilers in various residential schools in the province.\n\nThe laundry boiler is in need of repairs. The brick work inside and out is breaking down, new plates are required, also repairs to various steam pipes and connections.\n\nThe main pipe and connection to two toilets is blocked. The school staff spent several days trying to remove the cause without success. From previous experience I judge the pipe to be corroded and will have to be replaced.\n\nA number of similar repairs are needed for the heating system. Various pipes should be replaced and all radiator connections renewed. The school staff would do the radiator repairs if five dozen radiator connections were purchased.\n\nIn all probability repairs will be required to the brick work on the chimney and I beg to suggest that a boiler expert be sent in and an estimate obtained on the work required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, June 18th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the first instant, with reference to repairs that are required to the boiler at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may have this boiler examined by an expert and forward an estimate of the cost of the work required. Yates Neale & Co., Brandon, Man., are on the approved list.\n\nAn estimate should be obtained only on the work absolutely necessary. Our funds are extremely limited and the Department is not in a position to expend any large amount on repairs to the boiler at the Sandy Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Mr. S. J. Waite is the Indian Agent and the agency headquarters are located at Portage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nThe services of a plumber are required and I would appreciate your advising the name of the person who should be employed for this work.\n\nActing Director.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nChief Welfare and Training  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am informed that absolutely necessary repairs have to be made to the heating plant in the Sandy Bay Residential School. The boiler in the laundry has also to undergo considerable repairs as it is unsafe to use in its present condition.\n\nYour agent, Mr. Waite, informed the Principal of Sandy Bay that he had received orders from Ottawa not to proceed with this work without receiving further orders concerning it. As the school will open September 1st, you will understand very readily that the repairs mentioned above should be attended to without any delay and I hope that on receipt of my letter you will be good enough to give orders to have this work proceeded with at once.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJOP:IR\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, August 9, 1937\n\nDear Father Pleurde,-\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the boiler in the laundry at the Sandy Bay Residential School. This matter was brought to our attention some time ago by Indian Agent Waite, but we have not yet received official instructions regarding the name of the plumber who is to be employed. I expect to go to the Minister's office today, and will discuss the matter with them again.\n\nFor your information I may say that an amount of $500 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Sandy Bay School this year. On the recommendation of Indian Agent Waite, a gas power washing machine was purchased from Marshall-Wells Company at a cost of $109.50. Later you visited Inspector Hamilton and we authorized an expenditure of $390 for washer, reconditioning engine, pulleys, and shafting. You will therefore note that the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for the Sandy Bay Residential School has already been expended, and it will only be possible to do the work that is absolutely necessary on the boiler.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

However, in view of the necessity for some further repairs at this School, the Department approves an expenditure of $150 for lumber and material to replace the present cupboard in the kitchen. You may also purchase lumber for new stair treads. I regret that it is not possible to allow the amount mentioned by you for paint and salamine. However, you may expend a sum not exceeding $100 for this purpose. This amount will at least provide for those rooms which are used most frequently.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe School at Marius.\n\nActing on your letter of August 18, we investigated the condition of the work therein mentioned.\n\n(1) LAUNDRY BOILER.\n\nBoiler is 30\" Dia 8 ft long - 20-3\" Tubes, Grates 49x30 inches. 20 lbs pressure used.\n\nThe Brickwork is in very bad condition, the whole of one side will have to be taken down and rebricked, and all the fire brick lining will have to be renewed, and a new cast iron Arch Plate installed.\n\nWe estimate the cost of this Brickwork at;-\n\nONE HUNDRED & FORTY EIGHT DOLLARS..........................$148.00\n\n(2) The Grates on this Boiler are also badly warped and should be replaced, but we would recommend that they be replaced with grates only 36\" long in place of the 49\" now in. We suggest Herringbone pattern 4\u00bd wide with grate rest to cost.........................................................$36.50\n\nAs a better grate for the Boiler, and you would still be able to burn cord wood with more economy.\n\n(3) A great deal of the Steam & Water Piping over and around this Boiler will have to be renewed. All the Return Piping at the Boiler and the Return from the Coil in Dryer is badly corroded and just now is full of wooden plugs which are liable to blow out and cause damage.\n\nThe Return at the Boiler is full of mud and scale, and no means has been provided for getting it out.\n\nThere are several Radiators that were connected with this Boiler that have been broken and disconnected and should be repaired and put back.\n\nNew Discs should be put on all the Valves at the Boiler as none of them will hold tight.\n\nA new Blow Down Valve is required, none is on now.\n\nAll the pipes to the Water column should be renewed.\nand a Blow Down Valve be put in the bottom of Water Column to keep it clean.\n\nThe Hot Water Tank is set too low and as it has to come down to do the Brickwork, we would suggest that 2-0 longer supports be used under it when put back, so as to raise it two feet above the water line.\n\nA new 6\" Smoke Pipe to Agricultural Boiler is needed.\n\nAn automatic float air vent should be put on the return main at the Boiler, no means has been provided to eliminate the air.\n\nThe Boiler and Hot Water Tank also should be thoroughly cleaned, and the steam gauge refuses to work and should be replaced.\n\nWe estimate the cost of the above to be:\n\nTWO HUNDRED & FORTY THREE DOLLARS & THIRTY FIVE CENTS....$243.35\n\nHEATING BOILER.\n\nBoiler is 60\" Dia, 10ft long with 66-3\" Tubes and is a four pass setting, (not a standard brick setting) which requires a good draft.\n\nThe centre dividing plate between the Tubes at the front of the Boiler, prevent the upper smoke doors closing properly. This of course checks the Draft which is never very good, and smoke comes out into the Basement. It will be necessary to use a cutting torch to fit this plate and also make new fasteners for doors.\n\nThe brick lining on one side is completely gone as well as the arch sides and cast iron arch plate. The other side will have to be taken down to make repairs also.\n\nWe estimate the cost of this work to be:\n\nONE HUNDRED & FORTY FIVE DOLLARS & SEVENTY FIVE CENTS....$145.75\n\nHEATING BOILER.\n\nThe Water Column has never been provided with a\nblow down valve, this should be remedied, as if this pipe becomes clogged, no one can tell where the water is in the Boiler.\n\nThe drip from the steam main enters the return above the water line, and there is no means of eliminating the air from the steam and return mains. This makes for a very erratic heating job and should be remedied.\n\nAll separate returns should enter the Boiler below the water line, here they do not.\n\nIt will likely be necessary to renew the return from the Boiler to the outside of brickwork. This could all be done together as well as cleaning the Boiler.\n\nThe estimated cost of this is:\n\nONE HUNDRED & TWENTY DOLLARS & SIXTY CENTS..................$120.60\n\nRADIATORS.\n\nTwo Radiators have been disconnected and moved due to changes in the Chapel, these Rads will have to be reconnected with larger pipe due to the distance they are away from the tees in the Main.\n\nThe cost of this to be...........................................$29.25\n\nThe Soil Pipe from the Boys Dormitory has become full of urinal corrosion, due largely to a shortage of flushing. The pipe will have to be cut out and a section put in where it is found to be corroded and a cleanout put in.\n\nThe estimated cost of this is.................................$40.00\n\nA 3\" overflow installed in one of the three Attic Tanks and connected with the 4\" vent stack with deep seal trap, could be installed for the sum of..........................$35.00\n\nWe would recommend that a new Chimney be built for the Heating Boiler and a new Breeching be installed as the one now in is inadequate to properly take care of the smoke from the Boiler. As far as we could find out without climbing to the top, the present Chimney is only 9x12. A new Chimney should be at\nleast 18x18 inside and 60 ft high, and could be built with new breeching for the sum of:\n\nTHREE HUNDRED & FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS..................$355.00\n\nWe humbly submit this request for your consideration.\n\nThese prices are based on Board and Lodgings for men being supplied by the School.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nYates Neale & Co.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He left me a list of what he required, but in some manner this has become mislaid.\n\nI would appreciate if you would phone him and ascertain exactly what he wants and you can then arrange for its purchase and shipment to Sandy Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.G. Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\n320 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 126-9-5 dated September 11th, I would report that on October 1st I inspected, with Mr. Waite and Mr. Yates, the plumbing repair work at the Sandy Bay School.\n\nThe work is well along and when completed, about next Tuesday, should leave the heating and plumbing in good condition. The work has been well done and has entailed not only a large amount of labour but also considerable amount of new material. I would point out that some of the pipes renewed were filled with a hard, almost cement, substance and in some cases the opening left would not admit a pencil. Other pipes were so badly rusted that they broke when disconnected. This work only covers known weak spots; no doubt breaks will continue to occur as the water in use is very hard on any pipe or plumbing fixture.\n\nThe repair work outlined for the furnace has been completed and the Rev. Father admits it operates much better. The danger from fire has also been greatly reduced.\n\nThe chimney has been thoroughly examined and the men tell me there is no danger from fire. The type of furnace in use needs extra draft, and the chimney is lacking in size. However, it has served for many years and the draft has been improved by the repairs made to the brickwork of the furnace. A new chimney will not be erected.\n\nI did however authorize two new closet bowls and new pipe leading from the two closets in the boys dormitory. Both the bowls and pipes were found to be cracked and the renewal meant considerable expense. The extra expense for material and labour will not exceed $65.00. I hope you approve of this expense.\n\nBills covering the work will be submitted to Mr. Waite and forwarded for payment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.G.

Normandin.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nNovember 19th 37.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nPortage la Prairie\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAs you requested we proceeded to Sandy Bay to see what could be done with the leak in the Laundry boiler.\n\nAfter removing some of the brickwork, we found a hole had been eaten through the side of the shell of the boiler, near the back lug, 2 \u00bd\" below the lug, and 2\" from the lug toward the back of boiler. It will be necessary to have a boiler maker put a patch over this weak spot. It has apparently been caused by a leak from above, sometime in the past, there being no leak from above now. Likely from some of the pipes we removed during repairs this fall. The rest of the boiler seems to be in fair shape, but is getting old and Sandy Bay water is hard on steel.\n\nI took the matter up with the boiler maker here immediately on my return, as I knew you would want to know the cost. As near as we can tell it will cost $75.00, including the trip today. If this is done the boiler should be good for two or three more years, but can tell you better after the boiler maker has gone over as much of the boiler as he can get at. However no guarantee can be given as to how long this boiler will last. This price also includes cutting out and replacing the necessary brickwork.\n\nA new boiler of the same size and type, which, by the way, is the best for the work it has to do, would cost about $400.00, using the present casting and part of present brickwork.\n\nAs soon as you can, please let me know what to do, as the longer this job is left the harder it will be to get there by car. We had to shovel a lot of snow to get through today.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nYates, Neale & Co.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nOn the 18th inst., I received a phone call from Mr. Inspector Hamilton in which he quoted a telegram he received from Reverend O. Chagnon, Principal, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School reading as follows:\n\n\"Laundry boiler shell bursted. Send steamfitter at once.\"\n\nI immediately got in touch with Yates, Neale & Co., of Brandon and Mr. Yates advised that he would look into this immediately. The attached letter is his report on the break.\n\nMr. Hamilton instructed me to take up any matter of expense, in connection with the repair to the boiler, directly with the Department.\n\nWill you please telegraph instructions as the laundry boiler is very necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nOttawa, November 24, 1937.\n\nJ.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage La Prairie.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Sandy Bay Laundry Boiler.\n\nActing on your letter of Nov 25/37, we repaired the Laundry Boiler at Sandy Bay.\n\nIn order to put on the patch it was necessary to cut in a Hand Hole above the repair to insert bolts from the inside.\n\nThe Boiler Maker, Mr. Hosie, at one time a Provincial Boiler Inspector, reports that the Boiler is badly pitted from the inside and is liable to blow through at any time. It is a condition that makes it almost impossible to predict how long the Boiler will last.\n\nIt is this man's opinion that the Boiler should be replaced next summer. It will not be necessary to replace any Boiler Castings, just the Steel Boiler and that part of the brickwork which is over the lugs of the Boiler.\n\nWe are enclosing the account for the amount of the repairs.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nYates, Neale & Co.\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from Yates, Neale & Company of Brandon, Man., in which they advise that in their opinion the laundry boiler at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School should be replaced next summer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nEncl.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\nYour file 40-39\n\nOttawa, January 8, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you report that it will probably be necessary to replace the laundry boiler at the Sandy Bay Residential School in the near future. The letter from Mr. Yates states that a steel boiler will be required.\n\nAs all purchases are now made by the Purchasing Agent, it is necessary to have complete information regarding any article required. You should therefore let me know the height and diameter of the steel boiler that would be necessary for this school, also any other information that will assist us in placing an order.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.A.

(RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 6)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Mr. Crerar,\n\nI am wondering if it is going to be possible for you to build that Indian School at Sandy Bay this coming year. I do not wish to annoy you by my insistence, I have too much regard for you personally and as a Minister of the Crown to be guilty of that, but at the same time I am concerned about the welfare of my Indian children. The School at Sandy Bay is not only a menace, but it is hopelessly inadequate to take care of all the children on the Reserve. I know you have the right idea on the education of Indians, namely, to educate them as Indians and not as Whites. I would like to see a school established where that programme would be carried out to the letter.\n\nI read your New Year's message on the mining industry in Canada. It was most inspiring and I am so glad that this work is in your capable hands.\n\nMay I offer you my best wishes for the New Year.\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd) Alfred A. Sinnett.\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 11th instant regarding the typhoid outbreak on the Sandy Bay Reserve, this was brought to the Minister's attention. Subsequently a letter has been received from Archbishop Simott, of Winnipeg, copy of which is enclosed. The Minister approves of your recommendation that when the Branch is in a position to spend any more money in connection with the education of the Indians on this Reserve, it would be advisable to construct a Day School rather than spend any more money in building or improving the Residential School.\n\nThe Minister wishes to personally answer Archbishop Simott's letter and would like to send him a report of your Branch reviewing the whole situation and your reasons why his request should not be granted. In preparing your memorandum the Minister thinks that you should refer to the Residential School situation which existed at the time the Sandy Bay School was constructed and the changes that have taken place since which would to some extent do away with its necessity now. No doubt the pupil records of the school for the last few years will show that most of the children came from the Sandy Bay Reserve.\n\nEnclosure (1).\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nIn response to the request contained in Mr. Jackson's memorandum of January 16th, I am submitting herewith a report on the educational facilities and general social and economic conditions at the Sandy Bay reserve, province of Manitoba.\n\nThe Sandy Bay reserve consists of an area of approximately 12,000 acres and borders on the west shore of Lake Manitoba, just east of the Canadian National line which runs from the city of Portage la Prairie to Alonza. This reserve has a population of 480 Indians and a school population of approximately 160. There is a pupil enrolment at the Sandy Bay Residential School on this reserve of 75. A per capita grant of $185.00 is paid by the Department. It would appear that no provision has been made on the reserve for the education of the additional 85 pupils. It is difficult to determine from the records here the exact date of the establishment of the residential school. It was taken over by the Department in the year 1936 and it is estimated that the building is between 45 and 50 years old.\n\nIn the year 1934-35 I recommended the construction of a day school on this reserve, and this recommendation was approved by the Superintendent General. An amount necessary for the construction of this school was placed in the 1934-35 estimates, but the construction of the school was not proceeded with.\n\nThis Band of Indians is in many respects one of the most backward of any band in the Dominion. In the year 1928-29 an attempt was made to promote a housing programme -\nprogramme on the reserve and a liberal amount was included in the estimates of that year for that purpose. Only a few of the Indians, however, took advantage of the offer and the outcome of the undertaking was wholly unsatisfactory.\n\nDr. M. R. Elliott, Provincial Epidemiologist, Province of Manitoba, in a special report dated December 8, 1937, on the sanitary conditions on this reserve, states:\n\n\"We would consider, from this investigation, that a definite focus of infection - whether it be from the water supply or carriers - exists on this reserve and that existing sanitary conditions are favourable for a much greater spread of disease in the spring months, if not at present. Toilet facilities do not exist and the houses, which consist of one-storey log shacks, are hopelessly overcrowded.\"\n\nIt should be borne in mind that the Sandy Bay reserve does not provide such scope for development. Part of the area is swampy and the greater part of it covered by poplar and brush. While some open spaces could be farmed by the diligently inclined, the major portion of the top soil is shallow, inclined to be alkali and in part stony. The areas surrounding the reserve are of similar character and only a few settlers live on lands adjoining the reserve boundaries. The limited agricultural possibilities at this reserve may in part explain the present backward condition of the Band. It is significant, however, that the Indian inspectors who have visited and reported on the reserve from time to time express the view that this Band of Indians appear to be more restless and more nomadic in their habits than the majority of Indian bands, even in the western provinces. Inspector Hamilton, in a report dated October 15, 1935, states:\n\n\"I am informed that these Indians attend town fairs and sport days all over the southern portion of Manitoba and are often two or three hundred miles away from their homes.\"\n\nThe existing conditions are sufficiently disturbing to justify a very thorough investigation of the\neducational needs of these Indians.\n\nIndian day schools were wholly impracticable at the time the Sandy Bay Residential School was established. The Indians at that time were engaged wholly in hunting, fishing and trapping. They had not at that date acquired even an elementary knowledge of agriculture. They lived a primitive, nomadic existence and supported themselves from the fur and game resources of the country. A residential school was the only institution, at that time, that could possibly meet the needs of such a band. The utmost credit is due to the early missionaries for the self-sacrificing attempts they made to educate and Christianize the Indians of this country. It is not necessary to question either the loyalty or devotion of the members of the teaching staff of this or any other residential school. The principals of these schools have been instructed to follow provincial curricula - curricula which, in my judgment, are altogether too academic and abstract to meet the needs of our Indian population. It is worthy of note that there is in evidence today a tendency on the part of public school authorities to place steadily increasing emphasis upon manual training, vocational instruction and courses of study designed to equip the average pupil for the tasks he must undertake after his departure from school.\n\nOur Welfare programme, for which provision was made in the estimates of last year, is designed to re-establish our Indian population on a self-supporting basis. The purchase of farming equipment, the construction of homes, the clearing of land and the purchase of seed has substantially improved conditions on a number of reserves in Western Canada, and it is our hope that this programme can be further extended. The residential school, in relieving Indian parents of the responsibility for the care of their children, appears to have a tendency to encourage them in their nomadic and roaming habits. We have instances of land cultivated and seeded in the spring and abandoned later by Indians who refused to remain on their reserve to harvest the crop. On the other hand, where parents have had to accept responsibility for the care and welfare of their children and where provision has been\nmade for the education of these children at Indian day schools, the Indians appear to be more willing to cultivate reserve lands, take a greater interest in agriculture and consequently tend to become more self-supporting. My recommendation of 1934-35, that an Indian day school be established on the Sandy Bay reserve, was prompted by the conviction that an up-to-date day school would have a tendency to encourage the Indians of this reserve to become less nomadic in their habits and more interested in the development of their lands.\n\nA fully equipped fire-proof residential school, with accommodation for 165 pupils, would cost approximately $150,000. I cannot, in view of conditions at present existing on this reserve, recommend that such an institution be established.\n\nI have already intimated that the resources of this reserve are limited and the lands submarginal. There is nothing on the file to indicate that these resources are capable of supporting an Indian population equal to the one at present on the reserve. A survey of the lands available, with satisfactory soil tests, should be undertaken at an early date. I am convinced that a capable investigator would discover that the Sandy Bay reserve is only capable of supporting a comparatively small Indian population, the members of which might earn a living by cattle raising, fishing and the cultivation of small gardens, and that additional resources should be secured for these Indians, particularly the younger members of the Band, in another section of the province.\n\nMay I recommend, therefore, the establishment on this reserve of a fully equipped two-room day school, with full basement accommodation, suitable for manual training, carpentry work, sewing, fruit preserving, etc. Living accommodation for the members of the staff should be provided at the school. A suitable area of land adjoining the school should also be selected, with a farmer manager in charge, capable of giving instruction to the pupils. This farm could easily become a supply station for the school and provide the\nvegetables and meat necessary for midday meals, which have become so beneficial and popular at other day schools throughout the Dominion. A school such as this would provide accommodation for approximately 80 pupils, and, in addition, would provide a community centre where adult education could be provided in the evenings and where short courses relating to poultry keeping, live stock bee-keeping, health and sanitation could be organized from time to time.\n\nI feel confident that Archbishop Simnett, who is deeply interested in the welfare of Indians, would be glad to co-operate with the Department in the promotion of any programme designed to improve conditions on this reserve.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nOttawa, January 12th 1936\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nSandy Bay Residential School.\n\nVOTE 169 (20) Allotment 2103\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, July 14, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Sandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Agency,\nElectoral District of Neepawa, Man.\n\nProvision was made in the current year's appropriation for an amount of $1,000.00 for repairs and improvements at the above mentioned school.\n\nThe school management advise that, if lumber and other material at a cost not exceeding $1,000.00 are supplied, they will do the necessary work without cost to the Department.\n\nI enclose Purchase Requisition, specifying the lumber and other supplies that they request. I should appreciate the approval of the Honourable the Minister for the Purchasing Agent to secure prices on the articles mentioned on the Purchase Requisition. In that event, the purchase requisition should be handed to Mr. Bailey.\n\nIn the event of the quotations received exceeding $1,000.00, I should appreciate being informed, in order that we may decide what articles should be deleted.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP.\nExtract from letter dated July 6, 1938, received from Dr. J. J. WALL.\n\nIt is with respect to the fire hazard at night in four of our Schools. They are Sandy Bay, Man., Round Lake and Cowessess of Broadview, Sask., and lastly and especially Hobbema, Alta. In any of these institutions, should I sleep there, I always have the flash-light, overcoat, socks and gloves available and prepared for a sudden dive into the winter night. This fear in these four places certainly has not become an obsession but it has started to bother my conscience.\n\nI know how foolish it would be in these hard times to imagine that funds are available for proper reconstruction. But is it not possible to get proper escape apparatus installed. Every second for evacuation time must be conserved. I am not frightened so much of the flames at night but I am fearful of the superheated gases developing and flooding the halls. Only a partial lung-ful of this and a person is out. All the fire fighting equipment possible will not avail such a case. That was my experience years ago at the Royal Victoria in Montreal when we had that terrible movie fire which took so many children. It was not the flames, as I recollect, none were even scorched.\n\nMy belief is that this problem can be solved in preparing proper escapes. Iced poles of iron, narrow snow or ice filled metal stairs on the outside possibly open to a wall of flames from some window it passes will only add to the panic at night. Poor lighting over these meager affairs will not assist.\n\nThe panic in the children when a real fire does break will be stupendous. The stoical Indian in such case is a figment on the part of certain popular authors.\n\nDont be sore at me, Phil., as I am prepared to lay a two to one bet up to 100 bucks that in case of such an eventuality in any of the four, happening in winter between ten at night and four in the morning, the mortality will exceed...\nthirty per cent.\n\nThe ideal thing would be an inspection of each by an officer, like the Chief of the Montreal brigade, who has had plenty of experience dealing with such institutional hazards. His first consideration would be to figure the route the fire and gases would take so that adequate methods and routes of escape can be instituted. Steel fire doors would undoubtedly be installed on each floor above the first. Steel tower-like escapes as on the Kent Street School at Ottawa would replace at strategic points the old dangerous poles and narrow stairs. Lists of pupils to utilize each escape would be posted at all times and each child's name checked from list as it passes by a responsible guardian. Many of the children otherwise, in the event of a genuine alarm will, if not watched, take refuge in a clothes closet or under its bed.\n\nNight watchman was a step in the right direction but much can happen in the winter when he is penching in the outbuildings and barn and the time he returns to the school.\n\nMuch as I hate to bring your attention to this whole question in these four places, please understand it is not done so with any sense of butting in. It is for these poor kiddies sake, many of whom one becomes attached in his duties. In case also, should any catastrophe arise, we all shall be scourged properly at any investigation especially at the hands of politically conscious lawyers who cynically will give little credit to those who really and truly have the fullest interests of these tots at heart.\nOttawa, July 16, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\n\nYour memorandum of the 14th instant, re the purchase of material for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, has been received and referred to the Purchasing Agent to secure prices on the materials. However, before this can be done I should like to direct your attention to the evidently careless manner in which these requisitions have been prepared.\n\nMaterials for Granary and Barn:\n\n100 finishing nails, 2\";\n100 finishing nails, 2\u00bd\".\nDoes this mean 100 lbs. of each?\n\n100 lbs., 3\" nails;\n1 keg, 3\" nails.\nIs this a duplication?\n\n100 lbs. 2\u00bd\" nails;\n2 kegs, 2\u00bd\" nails.\nAre these quantities duplicated; if not, why does the requisition not state '3 kegs, 2\u00bd\" nails.'\n\n8,000 Shingles.\nShingles, to the best of my knowledge, are always ordered by the bundle or square, four bundles being required for one square. We have no knowledge of the number of shingles in a bundle.\n\n900 ft. Roofing.\nIt is not understood whether this means 'Ready Roofing', or 900 sq.ft. of sheeting. If it means the former the requisition should state the number of ply.\nI realize that this requisition may have been received in just this form from the Principal of the School, but, if so, it should have been referred back to him for proper descriptions, or corrected in your own office.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to the order for materials for the Sandy Bay Residential School, our Purchasing Agent has taken exception to the manner in which we requested certain articles. I refer to the following and give the Purchasing Agent's comments:\n\n1. 8,000 shingles - \"Shingles, to the best of my knowledge, are always ordered by the bundle or square, four bundles being required for one square. We have no knowledge of the number of shingles in a bundle.\"\n\n2. 900 ft. Roofing - \"It is not understood whether this means 'Ready Roofing', or 900 sq. ft. of sheeting. If it means the former the requisition should state the number of ply.\"\n\nPlease let me have the necessary information in connection with the above two items.\n\nIn one place on the requisition there is a request for 100 lbs. 3\" nails and in another place one keg 3\" nails. As there are 100 lbs. in each keg, was this a duplication or do they require two kegs of 3\" nails?\n\nI find, also, a request for 100 lbs. 2\u00bd\" nails and two kegs of 2\u00bd\" nails. Is this a duplication or do they require three kegs of 2\u00bd\" nails?\n\nI should appreciate very much receiving an immediate reply.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

The following definition of \"shingles\" may be found in Rose's Handbook of Useful Information:\n   \"Shingles are usually 16 inches long, and a bundle of shingles is 20 inches wide, and contains 24 courses in the thickness at each end; hence, a bundle of shingles will lay one course 80 feet long. When shingles are exposed 4 inches to the weather, 1000 will cover 107 square feet; 4 1-2 inches, 120 square feet; 5 inches, 132 square feet; 6 inches, 150 square feet.\"\n\nFather Chagnon, therefore, had in mind to order a quantity sufficient to cover about 850 square feet.\n\n2. The 900 ft. of roofing must be interpreted to mean 900 board feet or what is commonly known in the lumber business as \"roofing boards.\" All lumber dealers will understand this expression.\n\nThe quantity of nails specified in the list that I left with you and which was prepared by Father Chagnon includes two barrels of 3\" nails and three kegs of 2 1-2\" nails. This quantity of nails may seem rather large, but I understand that a large part of this order will be used to re-nail the siding on most of the building.\n\nAs the season is far advanced, will you be good enough to urge that the purchase of these materials be done without any further delay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 7)\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1938.\n\nEXD.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of July 16 with reference to material ordered for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe delay in answering this memorandum is due to the fact that we felt it necessary to communicate with the school management and their reply has just been received.\n\n1. Quantities of nails required are as follows:\n\n   2 Kegs 2\" nails\n   3 \" 2\u00bd\" \"\n   2 \" 3\" \"\n\n2. When shingles are exposed 4 inches to the weather the Principal states that 1000 shingles will cover 107 square feet. As there are 550 square feet of roof to be re-shingled the Principal requested 5000 shingles. I understand that there are approximately 250 shingles in a bundle and, therefore, 32 bundles should meet the requirements.\n\n3. The Principal's reply with reference to the roofing reads as follows:\n\n\"The 900 ft. of roofing must be interpreted to mean 900 board feet or what is commonly known in the lumber business as 'roofing boards.'

The tires for this truck were never replaced and are now in such a condition that a complete set would seem to be required. Your agent at Portage la Prairie might look into this matter and if his report is favourable, I hope that the Department will not delay in the purchase of these tires. The truck being the property of the government, the school has every right to look to the Department for its upkeep and maintenance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. G. Plourde, O. M. I.\nOttawa,\nNovember 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand that a complete new set of tires is required for the truck supplied about five years ago to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School for hauling water from the lake to the school. Please examine this truck at your earliest convenience and if new tires are required you should let me have full particulars so that an order may be placed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nJ. Waite, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nI might add before closing, that the possibilities of getting water from a deep well were never fully explored. Your engineer, of course, would be in a position to advise your Department on this particular point.\n\nI am leaving this matter entirely in your hands and I confidently hope that you will give it your early attention.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Hosy,\nDirector of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hosy:\n\nThe water supply at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential school has been quite unsatisfactory for the past five or six years. Could not something be done to improve conditions now existing.\n\nI would suggest that you ask your engineer to make a report on this problem and that he be asked to suggest what could be done to install inadequate water system.\n\nSome six years ago, the Department supplied a truck equipped with a large tank. This truck has been used ever since to haul water from the lake, a distance of about three miles to the school. If no better system can be found, I would suggest that a cistern of sufficient size be built and that pressure tanks be installed so that in case of fire there would be at least some kind of protection for the children and staff of the school. I am informed that the cistern now in use was poorly constructed, and cannot hold a sufficient quantity of water. The system suggested for St-Philip's school if put in operation at Sandy Bay would be much better than the one now in use.\n\nAt my suggestion, the principal early this month had a well twelve feet deep dug on the shores of the lake about 200 feet from the edge of the water. From information which I have received today, it would seem that the water from the lake seeps through the sand into this well. If this could be verified, it might be possible to pipe the water from this well to the school. I understand that a system of this kind was installed at the Fort Qu'Appelle hospital and is proving very satisfactory.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

BAILEY\n\nI desire to refer to our purchase requisition dated November 30, 1938 for 7 tires for the Chevrolet truck at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nDuring the latter part of 1934 the water supply from the well at the Sandy Bay Residential School which had been gradually diminishing ceased completely. Although the possibility of securing water by digging another well was carefully considered this procedure was rejected as we could obtain no assurance that there was any likelihood of obtaining water. The only other alternative was to expend an amount of $25,000.00 in piping water from Lake Manitoba, a distance of approximately 2 miles. As no funds were available for this purpose no action was taken on this recommendation.\n\nIn order to supply water the Department purchased a Chevrolet truck in January, 1935. This truck is equipped with a tank, and water is transported from Lake Manitoba to the school at regular intervals.\n\nSince supplying the truck the Department has not paid any cost for its maintenance or its operation as these expenses have been borne by the school management.\n\nA recent letter received from the school management stated that new tires were required for the truck and on writing to the Indian Agent he recommended that 7 tires be supplied.\nYou will note that this truck is used only for the transportation of water from the lake to the school. I consider that it is reasonable for the Department to supply new tires and it would, therefore, be appreciated if you would arrange for the immediate purchase of the tires requested on purchase requisition of November 30.\n\nR.

I feel certain that you can easily obtain this information.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nExtract from Inspector Hamilton's report on the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School dated November 29, 1938:\n\nThe dormitories were all well aired and spotlessly clean. The beds were neatly made but the mattresses are very poor - in fact 60% of the beds are fitted with straw ticks. I would recommend 36 mattresses for the girls and 24 for the boys.\n\nThe old gas plant is still operated for lighting purposes. This is located in the carpenter shop which adjoins the furnace room. I have always been very nervous concerning this lighting equipment and would strongly recommend that it be discarded and replaced by an electric lighting plant. I trust this matter will receive favourable consideration.\n\nThe boiler of the main heating plant is at present in fair condition although I am informed that the boiler inspector is of the opinion it will not pass another inspection. The boiler is old and, I have no doubt, it will be necessary to make a replacement soon.\n\nThe reception room on the main floor is 10 x 16. This room is in constant use by the Rev. Principal and other members of the staff. I would recommend the floor be covered with inlaid linoleum. It would be more easily cleaned and much more cheerful than a bare floor.\n\nThe kitchen is well kept. The hot water tank needs to be renewed. This tank is 16\" across and 4 ft. 9\" high. A new tank is urgently needed.\n\nThe laundry is well equipped except that there is no extractor (tumbler type). They have no way to get the water from the clothes, except with the hand wringer. If possible, an extractor should be provided.\n\n(Sgd.) A. G. Hamilton,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nManitoba.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your recent report on your inspection of the Sandy Bay school you may purchase the quantity of linoleum required for the reception room on the main floor of the school. It is noted that this room is 10' x 16'.\n\nPlease let me have more specific information regarding the hot water tank that you state is urgently needed in order that the necessary information may be given to our Purchasing Agent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.

The capacity of the plant, I am informed, is 6000 watts. A temporary wiring is being installed at present in a number of rooms and the permanent installation will be carried out when certain improvements are made to the building. Under the present arrangement wiring for the light will be dropped from the ceiling which is antiquated system, and I beg to suggest that daylight units be furnished. The cost of each unit would be in the neighbourhood of $1.50 and 50 would be required. The daylight unit would be out of reach of the children, give more diffused light, easier on the children's eyesight and less wiring would be required. The system would also affect a saving in bulbs over a period of time as there is always a danger of hanging bulbs being broken.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of the 13th instant you may purchase the 50 daylight units for the Sandy Bay residential school at a cost of $1.35 each. You may also secure the new grate for the cook stove at this school.\n\nThe accounts covering the cost of the above should not be forwarded until after the first of April as no funds are available at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

He thought the fire-proofing could be done for about approximately forty thousand dollars, which would be twelve to fifteen thousand over the estimate for frame construction. This he was to take up later by letter with Mr. Jackson.\nWINNIPEG, February 16, 1939.\n\n2\u2014Mr. Philip Phelan,\n\nI might add that bids on these goods were asked from Marshall-Wells Co.

This material was not provided for, through an oversight, in the first estimate prepared by our engineer. It will be used to install electric lighting in the three staff houses and the outbuildings of the school.\n\nThe principal also informs me that no fixtures of any kind were forwarded with the first order for materials and he would like to know if it will be acceptable to the Department if he purchases these fixtures himself, provided he does not spend more than $75.00 for this purpose.\n\nI would have preferred to have the Department purchase the materials, shown on the enclosed invoices, but I received the request from the principal by long distance telephone and his plea for quick action was that the engineer, who is installing the plant, would be idle unless this material was forwarded immediately. I hope that the above will serve as sufficient justification for our not having asked your purchasing agent in Ottawa to place this order.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nPAY TO: Gutta Percha & Rubber Limited,\nADDRESS: WINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Feb. 29 | To 7 inner tubes for Chevrolet 2 ton truck used at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, as per account attached. | 42 51 |\n\nCode: 76-09-613\n\nAuthority: Department Order 12524 dated February 14th 1939.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nVoucher No.: 1922\n\nDATE: February 22nd, 1939\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are enclosing a Pamphlet showing the type of Refill which must be used in this Extinguisher. This is called the Conversion type, and instead of using the bottle Acid which you have done in the past, they supply the CO 2 Gas Cartridge. In order to use this Cartridge it is necessary to install a New Cartridge Holder and Piercing Pin. This Pamphlet will give you full instructions, which are very simple, for converting this Extinguisher over to use this type of Refill. The Refill will cost you $10.00 Net.\n\nThe advantage over the old type of Refill is that unless the Extinguisher is used, it does not need to be recharged every year, they will last indefinitely, and in the event of the Extinguisher being used, if you return the Cartridge to us, we can give you a credit note of $2.50.\nWe are sending two of these Refills to you and trust that you will find them satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nEnc.

Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Water Supply System Sandy Bay Residential School,\nAmaranth, Manitoba.\n\nAs per your instructions, I have visited the above named school for the purpose of making an investigation of the existing water system, and I have the following to report in this connection:\n\nMy first visit to the school was made early in January, and during that trip I was fortunate enough to meet a member of the Catholic Church who was able to give me considerable information regarding the purpose of the request for the investigation of the system. He also advised me of the existence of the Interior, in 1934, and of which report I advised you, in my wire of January 6th, 1939. I immediately got in touch with Mr. Gow, and he very kindly forwarded me his office copy of the report, which I carefully examined, and then returned to him.\n\nAs previously advised in my wire, I am of the opinion that Mr. Gow's report covers the situation, under consideration, very thoroughly indeed, and the recommendations made, are, in my estimation, such, that the report should be acted upon in its entirety.\n\nWith reference to the instructions contained in your wire, regarding the suggested seepage sump, on the bank of Lake Manitoba, to be used as an intake for the proposed system, I may say that I have had sufficient work carried out on this proposed project to justify an opinion as to its feasibility in this particular locality, and the following is a detail of this work, together with the conclusions arrived at:\n\nAt a point on the bank of Lake Manitoba, corresponding approximately to Sta. 1 00 on Plate #2 of Mr. Gow's report, I had a hole dug to a depth of 5'-6\", and the infiltration to this hole, or well, was carefully noted. The results as far as seepage was concerned were quite satisfactory; water bearing soil being encountered at the depth of 5' and continuing to the full depth of the hole. The infiltration was greatest from ......\ngreatest from the lake, or North side of the excavation, although we had a fairly steady flow from the South side also, this water appearing to flow from the swampy ground, indicated on Mr. Gow's plan, between Sta. 4700 and 2600.\n\nRegarding the soils encountered in the excavation, these consisted of peaty muck to a depth of 5', 2' above and to the full depth of the hole. The water which resulted from the infiltration had a good color, and while slightly salty to the taste was quite palatable. We procured two samples of water, one from the excavated well and one from Lake Manitoba, the purpose of the two samples being, to try and determine whether the water in the well was a result of infiltration from the lake, or from the swampy ground. The following results of having this water analyzed would seem to prove that the water in the well was a result of seepage from the swampy ground:\n\nExtract of Report, made by the Department of National Health, Winnipeg, Manitoba, on two water samples.\n\n| Sample | Bacterial Colon Plate Count |\n|--------|-----------------------------|\n| Sample #1 (from lake) | Negative 300 |\n| Sample #2 (from well) | Positive 2000 |\n\nRemarks:- There would appear to be no infiltration from the lake to the well.\n\nFrom the foregoing, it would appear that there is no purpose continuing along this line of investigation, as the difficulties that would have to be overcome, to protest such a source of supply from contamination, would, no doubt, outweigh any financial saving which would result from the avoidance of the construction of the intake proposed by Mr. Gow, that is of course, if sufficient water could be procured by such a method, for the proposed system.\n\nIn reference to your request for information on the wells in the vicinity of the school, and the feasibility of securing the required supply, by drilling a deep well, I may say that I am of the opinion that it would not be advisable to make any attempt to procure water for this purpose, by this method. My reason for being so definite in this regard is a result of a careful study of the situation, in which study I was fortunate enough to be able to procure the services of the driller of all the wells on the Indian Reserve in question, also innumerable other wells in that part of the province. Mr. Smith, the name of the driller referred to, informs me that from his experience in drilling in that part of the country he believes that, as far as quantity is concerned, the matter is a foregone conclusion, but the quality of the water would not be of the standard required. Since these statements are amply supported by actual wells in operation in this area, I have no hesitation in recommending that the matter of drilling for water be dropped, and this of course results in having to depend on Lake Manitoba for the required supply, which to me appears the only logical source of water supply for any system that may be installed at this point.\nIt is noted in Mr. Gow's report that some question had arisen as to the advisability of the installation of an expensive water system at the school in question, owing to the fact that the school buildings are very old, and I also understand that some proposal had been made to change the site of the school. Since this opinion may have had some bearing on previous reports, I may say that at this time the matter of enlarging the school is under definite consideration, and from my observations I would say that the matter of an adequate water supply for such a large institution is of the greatest importance at the earliest possible date, and as mentioned earlier in this report I would suggest that Mr. Gow's recommendations be carried out in this connection.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(sgd.) J.A. Atkinson,\nJunior Engineer.\nMarch 3, 1929.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe - Water Supply, Sandy Bay Residential School, Amaranth, Manitoba.\n\nIn further reference to your memorandum of November 15th last transmitting a copy of a memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs regarding the above matter I might say that in accordance with your instructions, Mr. J. H. Atkinson of our Engineering staff was requested to visit the school and look carefully into the question of an adequate water supply. A report on a proposed water supply system at this point was made by Mr. D. B. Gow of the Water and Power Bureau, dated September 5th, 1928, and was referred to in a preliminary report wired in by Mr. Atkinson. Further instructions were sent the latter to supplement the Gow report with additional information covering depth of wells near the school at present and possibility of further drilling.\n\nMr. Atkinson's report has now been received and a copy is attached hereto for your information. You will note he is of the opinion that the Gow report covers the situation very thoroughly and that in his estimation the recommendations made are such that the report should be acted upon in its entirety. The system proposed by Mr. Gow consists of an intake line extending from a point 630 feet beyond water's edge of Lake Manitoba to a concrete lined well, a total distance of approximately 3,500 feet. A pump is to be located at this well, and a main supply line from this point to a reservoir in the immediate vicinity of the school. The total length of this supply line is approximately 6,450 feet. A second pumping outfit would be installed at the school to pump water to reservoir tanks already in place in the attic. It is proposed to utilize the present distribution system, replacing such piping as is necessary and adding whatever piping is required for the additional services it is proposed to install. A summary of Mr. Gow's estimates of costs of the above proposals is as follows:\n\n(a) Intake - $7,320.00\n(b) Pipe Line - $3,470.00\n(c) Pumping System - $1,900.00\n(d) Distributing System - $3,965.00\nContingencies Supervision, etc. $2,116.50\nHauling - Railway to job $350.00\n\nTotal estimated cost --------- $22,821.50\n\nJ. H. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIn regard to the amount shown for the distribution system, I might say that Mr. Gow recommended the installation of a hot water supply boiler and a high pressure steam boiler, which have been included in this item at an estimated cost of $665.00.\n\nWith regard to the further information requested from Mr. Atkinson covering possibility of using wells, you will note he is of the opinion that it would not be advisable to make any attempt to procure water by this method. He reports that from information received and from his personal observation, while sufficient quantity of water can be got, the quality would not be of the standard required, and he therefore recommends that the matter of drilling for water be dropped. This, of course, results in having to depend on Lake Manitoba for the required supply.\n\nIn view of all the circumstances, I concur in Mr. Atkinson's suggestion that Mr. Gow's recommendation as outlined in his report be carried out, and would further suggest that the Director of Indian Affairs be so advised in order that he may be in a position to provide for the necessary funds for this work in the Supplementary Estimates if it is his intention to have the work carried out during the coming season.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.

Apparently this scheme has been under consideration by the Church authorities for some years. It was brought to the attention of Mr. Gow when he made his report in 1934, but according to the information furnished to me it was not carefully considered.\n\nAs I mentioned to you over the telephone, the Minister is most anxious that arrangements should be made to have Engineer Atkinson go to the school at once and investigate the possibility of securing a source of water in the manner suggested by the Church authorities.

A.A. Sinnott,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg, Man.\n\nExcellency and Dear Monsignor,\n\nI have received your letter of the 31st of March concerning our water supply system at our school. I wish first to thank you very heartily for your interest in our behalf.\n\nWith regard to the project of transferring our Indians into another Reserve, my firm conviction is that they would never consent to leave Sandy Bay. If there should be the necessity of enlarging the reserve, the best mean would be to grant them more space along the shore of Lake Manitoba.\n\nAs to the enlargement of our school, providing two fire-proof dormitories, I sincerely hope that the Department of Indian Affairs shall not remit the project for another year. In the present conditions, we are greatly exposed to a complete fire destruction, so I would take the liberty of asking your Excellency to do your utmost towards the Honourable Mr. Crerar to have this enlargement done this summer.\n\nAs to the water supply, Mr. Gow's project of providing the water from the lake, would be indeed too costly, I would prefer to continue carting the water from the lake, as we have done from the last fifteen years rather than to hear that the enlargement has been postponed for another year.\n\nI have learned with pleasure that the Department of Indian Affairs, will ask the engineer Mr. Atkinson informations on the possibility of barring a brook near the school so as to store up the water in spring. I believe that this project could be made at a very low cost and will provide abundantly the water necessary for the laundry and sewer purposes. My experience since thirty years at Sandy Bay allows me to ascertain that the water coming from this brook in spring would be more than enough, outside of the drinking and cooking purposes, to provide for all the other needs of the school.\n\nWith deep respect, I remain, Excellency, yours in Christ and in Mary Immaculate.\n\n(Sgd) O. Chagnon, O.M.I.\nWinnipeg, Man.,\nApril 7th, 1939.\n\nHon. T.A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar,\n\nI enclose the answer which I received from the Fathers at Sandy Bay Indian Reserve. I think it solves the difficulty. Father Chagnon, who signs the letter, is an old man who is very sound in his judgment and has had a long experience. When he says that the Indians would not leave Sandy Bay, I cannot but believe him. No doubt some would go, but there would be no use in creating another Reserve and have to keep Sandy Bay at the same time. Better to procure some land North of the present Reserve.\n\nAs to the water supply, I am persuaded that it is better to forget the recommendations of Mr. Gow. It is an unnecessary expense. I know that there is a creek which flows by the School and in which there is considerable water in the spring-time. Were this creek dammed, enough water could be secured for laundry and sewer purposes. With the wells and water hauled from the Lake, there would be no shortage for drinking and cooking.\n\nMy conclusion is to go ahead with the two new fire-proof additions and forget about the water difficulty. That too is the conclusion of the Fathers in charge of the School. You will have done everything that I could ask of you and I would be thoroughly satisfied. The additions are necessary and they will make the institution such as to satisfy the needs of the place for many years to come. I hope, therefore, that there will not be further delay.\n\nI enclose Mr. Gow's Report as requested.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\n(Sgd) Alfred A. Sinnett,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - Sandy Bay Indian Reserve.\n\nFor your information, I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter the Minister has received from the Reverend A.A. Sinnott, Archbishop of Winnipeg, to which you will find attached a copy of a letter from Father O. Chagnon, the Principal of the School.\n\nAs you know, the Surveys and Engineering Branch are securing a further report on the possibility of impounding the water in the creek which passes close by the School. No doubt this will be received very shortly. In the meantime, the Minister has approved of the necessary steps being taken to proceed with the construction of the two dormitories. It is estimated that the cost of these two buildings will not exceed $40,000.\n\nMr. Gow's report of September 5th, 1934, is enclosed.\n\nC.W.

The engineer was on the premises and had I not placed this order immediately, he would have had to be brought back to Winnipeg and sent back again on receipt of the material needed for the complete installation of the plant. This would have meant an expense of at least $30.00.\n\nI secured three bids; firstly, from the Dominion Electric Co.; secondly, from Marshall-Wells of Winnipeg; and thirdly, from Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd. I placed the order with the Dominion Electric Co. because their price was the lowest.

Cuff, Esq.,\nManaging Director,\nChristie School Supply Limited,\nBrandon, Man.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nLands, Parks and Forests Branch\n\nWasagaming, Man., May 10th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe - Sandy Bay Indian School Water Supply.\n\nAs instructed by you in your wire in connection with the above matter I proceeded to the Sandy Bay School and examined the area for the purpose of considering the construction of a dam for impounding a water supply for the school, and in this connection I have today forwarded to you a sketch plan of the area together with a suggested layout of the proposed dam.\n\nAs you will note from the plan, we suggest the construction of an earth dam at a point on the plan referred to as Station 6+00. This point is on a dry water course to the west of the school and is, I believe, a very good site for such a construction.\n\nIn approaching this problem I considered the following factors:\n\n1. Source of supply\n2. Drainage area or watershed\n3. Quantity of water required\n4. Evaporation, percolation and absorption\n5. Protection of winter supply in dam\n6. Type of dam and cost of proposed work\n\n(1) Regarding the source of supply I may say that a very well defined water course extending in a westerly direction for approximately one mile drains an area estimated at about six square miles. This area is comparatively flat country and is quite heavily covered with brush. The stream bed referred to indicates that there has been a considerable flow at one time, but there was little evidence of flow recently. However, we were advised by the officials at the school that after heavy rainfall the stream will flow for several days at a depth of about one foot, depending of course, upon the duration and intensity of the storm.\n\nAs mentioned above, the stream drains a piece of land about three miles by two miles. This area appears to me to be very definite in length since it terminates at the highway, which is the highest of land in a westerly direction. This height of land has constructed drainage ditches through it draining the land to the west of the highway into Lake Manitoba, to which lake the dry creek bed upon which the proposed dam would be constructed, also drains. This item is of particular interest in that I believe one of these ditches might be connected with the creek bed, if and when required, without much cost. This matter was not, however, gone into by me other than to discuss its feasibility.\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n(2) Drainage area or watershed\n\nThe proposed reservoir will be entirely dependent on rainfall and snowfall, and with regard to the latter our examination of the area was at the time of year when the runoff from snow should have been noticeable but we saw practically no indication of water throughout the whole of the drainage area. We were, however, advised that two weeks before, that is, about the 24th of March, there had been a considerable flow in the stream had lasting about seven days. From reports generally in the district the conditions this spring were extraordinary owing to the lightness of the snow, etc.\n\n(3),(4),(5) The matter of quantity was considered and was based on the following:-\n\n(a) Reported requirements\n(b) Evaporation, seepage, percolation\n(c) Ice coverage in reservoir\n\nIn connection with the reported requirements it was definitely stated that 600 gallons per day would be ample. We have allowed for 1,000 gallons per day and this would amount to 365,000 gallons per year. All other factors combined would not, we assume, equal this amount, but the capacity of the reservoir proposed is such that we believe that all factors, whatever they may be, will be adequately taken care of, if the reservoir is filled to capacity. The location of the dam was chosen because it reduces the length of the dam required and also it reduces the amount of excavation which we consider is necessary to give the depth of water which will allow for the thirty-six inches of ice which will result in the winter, together with the body of water required for the period of four months when the ice is on the reservoir. We believe also that the depth of the reservoir proposed will be beneficial from an evaporation standpoint.\n\n(6) The type of dam proposed is of the earth type with no core wall or reinforcing of any kind other than the proposed minimum twenty-five percent clay well tamped in place under the topsoil. The soil in the vicinity of the dam is a sandy loam to a depth of about four feet where heavy clay loam or hardpan is encountered. Regarding the cost of this proposed work the following is a detail of the items of cost:-\n\nExcavation within reservoir area 4,172 cubic yds. Excavated by drag scraper methods and used in the construction of the dam and the balance wasted in the vicinity of the dam site. We estimate the cost per yard will be .20\u00a2 making a total cost of $834.40.\n\nA one yard dragline which I believe is available in Manitoba could be used to advantage on this work and would reduce the cost considerably, as this machine will remove approximately 500 cubic yards of material per ten hour day, with a fuel consumption of two gallons of fuel. However, this matter can be gone into if it is necessary.\nThe dam would be constructed by the placing of the above mentioned cut material, care being taken to compact the mass by proper dumping and rolling. The removal of the house and debris generally, within the reservoir area will cost approximately $100.00.\n\nRegarding the connection of the water supply to the school, this will be carried out by the installation of a two inch main from the dam to a sump at the windmill site by gravity and will be pumped to the school system by windmill. A summary of the total cost is as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Excavation and dam construction                  | $1,000.00 |\n| Removal of buildings, debris, stumps, etc.       | 100.00 |\n| Cost of 2\" piping, valves, etc., from dam site   |        |\n| of windmill carried below frost line.            | 150.00 |\n| Labour                                           | 150.00 |\n| Pipe fittings, etc.                              |        |\n\n$1,400.00\n\nPlus 20% for contingencies ........................................... $380.00\n\n$1,680.00\n\nIn that this type of construction is new to me I shall be very glad indeed to be corrected on any point upon which I appear to be in error. I have, however, given this matter considerable consideration and believe that the estimate and detail as submitted is a sound estimate of the proposed work. I regret the delay in forwarding this material before.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(SGD) J.H. Atkinson,\nResident Engineer.\n\nT.S.Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering & Construction Services,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of April 6th last regarding the possibility of securing a water supply for the Sandy Bay School at Amaranth, Manitoba, for domestic purposes except drinking by impounding water in an adjacent creek bed, attached hereto is a copy of a report on the proposal prepared by Mr. Atkinson.\n\nThe following points in Mr. Atkinson's report should be noted:\n\n(1) Source of supply and quantity available. There is a well defined watercourse with a drainage area of about six square miles. While there was indication of a considerable flow at one time, there was little evidence of any recent flow and there was at the time of the inspection no indication of water throughout the whole drainage area. It was reported, however, that about two weeks previously, March 24th, there had been a considerable flow lasting seven days.\n\n(2) Requirements of the School. These are stated to be 600 gals. per day but Mr. Atkinson based his estimate on 1,000 gals. per day or 365,000 gals. per year.\n\n(3) Estimated cost of impounding works. Mr. Atkinson states that provision could be made for impounding the required amount after making due allowances for losses due to seepage, evaporation and ice, at a cost of $1,680.00. This includes excavation of reservoir, construction of dam, clearing up site and piping water to buildings. It would appear from the plan submitted that a more adequate spillway should be provided, thus adding possibly $150.00 to the total cost.\n\nIn a report on this project in 1932 submitted by Mr. Gow, the school authorities estimated their requirements at 2,000 gals. per day or 1,100,000 gals. per year. Mr. Gow stated that in comparison with other schools this consumption was conservative and estimated that if an adequate supply were available the consumption would be nearer 5,000 gals. per day. Basing his assumption on 4,000 gals. per day he estimated that the cost of providing an 8 months supply would be $1,800.00 or a 12 months supply $7,850.00. These costs did not include piping to the school nor any allowances for engineering, supervision or contingencies.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr. Gow stated further that in his opinion such a source of water supply is unsuited for drinking or cooking purposes and should not be so utilized. It will be subject to contamination; vegetable growth will develop in the stagnant pool, giving the water a disagreeable taste and offensive odor and in all probability the Department would be called upon later to provide treatment to remedy these conditions.\n\nIt would appear from the foregoing that the information supplied to the Chief Executive Assistant by the Principal of the School as noted in your memorandum of April 4th last - that the creek flowed throughout the year - is erroneous. It should also be noted that Mr. Gow's wire of April 5th last quoted in our memorandum of that date stated that run-off conditions since 1932 had been such that little consideration should be given to the scheme except possibly for summer stock watering in some years.\n\nIn the circumstances and in view of the fact that nothing but a safe water supply should be provided for an institution of this nature, I would refer you to my memorandum of March 3rd last submitting a report by Mr. Atkinson in which he concurred in Mr. Gow's findings as reported by the latter under date of September 5th, 1934.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The report indicates that the water supply, which might be obtained by damming the water course, would be very doubtful as to quantity and quality of the water.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is recommended by our Engineers that instead of expending funds on a scheme of such an uncertain nature steps should be taken to obtain the water supply for this school from Lake Winnipeg as recommended formerly.\n\nDirector.\nMr RAHoezy,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn instructions from the above organization, I am seeking some information as regards the extension to the Indian School at Sandy Bay, Manitoba, the Supervising contractor being Mr P. Desrosiers, Contractor of St Boniface, Man.; and to the best of knowledge Mr Desrosiers is the Supervisor of Construction for the Oblate Fathers of St Boniface.\n\nThe information that I am seeking is; Has the Dominion Government, through the Department of Indian Affairs, assisted in any way with a financial grant, towards the New Extension of this School? If so; Do the hours of Labor and Rates of Wages, as established in the provisions of the Fair Wage Act of Manitoba prevail:\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that Mr Desrosiers, has hired Bricklayers in Winnipeg to go out to Sandy Bay at the rate of .75\u00a2 per hour, which is not in accordance with the Fair Wage Act of Manitoba, as the rate set by the Board for country work is .90\u00a2 per hour, with a proviso subject to, definite agreements made between Employers and workmen with the approval of the Provincial Government, that men hired in Winnipeg and sent to work in the country shall be paid .90\u00a2 per hour plus .15\u00a2 per hour to cover cost of Board and Lodgings, which category this extension to the Indian School would be applicable.\n\nI hope I have made our position clear, as to what conditions on this project, should prevail, and if through the medium of your office, on behalf of the Dominion Government that, at least, the Owners or Supervisors should see that the Bricklayers employed on the job be paid the Fair Wage Rate as complied with under the Act.\n\nTrusting that you can supply the information requested and take any necessary steps to prevent any infraction of the Act.\n\nThanking you on behalf of the above Organization.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has at this date an enrolment of 75. The Government contributes $165.00 per pupil per annum.\n\nIn the estimates of this year provision was made for a grant to the church authorities, on the understanding that an extension and certain repairs would be undertaken at Sandy Bay this summer. I was not aware that the work had started, but it is just possible that arrangements were made whereby the work started immediately following the close of the school for the holiday period beginning July 1.\n\nI am today requesting from the church authorities a statement showing the character of the construction, number of men employed, wages, etc. Just as soon as this information reaches me, I shall be glad to communicate with you again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

It is expected that the new additions as well as the repairs in the old building will be completed by the 7th of October and that the children will be admitted on the following Monday, October 9.\n\nI inspected the beds and mattresses which have been in use up to the present time and I must admit that I was painfully impressed by their dilapidated condition. I am informed that the beds used in that school were transferred from the old St. Boniface Indian Industrial School in 1904. I just mentioned the word \"mattress\". This is really not the word to use because it does not describe the kind of bedding that the school has been using since it was established. What answers to the word \"mattress\" is a ticking filled with straw.\n\nIt seems to me that the Sisters should not be asked to place all this old bedding in their fine new dormitories. Would it not be possible for you to authorize your Mr. Hamilton in Winnipeg to purchase a sufficient number of beds for the opening of the school.\n\nHoping that you will give this request your earliest consideration, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

W.,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nFrom: The Office of the Resident Architect, Department of Public Works\nWinnipeg, November 2, 1939\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian School, Sandy Bay, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 15th, Mr. Ritchie of this office accompanied Mr. Hoey of the Department of Mines and Resources to Sandy Bay on the 24th ultimo and inspected work done on the Indian school there, and following is his report:\n\nThe work completed as follows:\n\n1. New South Wing: Walls 13\" clay brick and hollow tile; floors 8-\u00bd\" concrete on 12\" massillon steel joist; 20 year bonded roof on steel decking insulated with 1\" rigid insulation board; stairs and landings are concrete and separated from the old building by a 9\" brick firewall.\n\n2. New North Wing: Similar in all respects to new South Wing.\n\n3. Old Building: This building has been completely renovated. All wooden stairs were removed, stair wells were floored over and the space made available for school purposes. The northern 30 feet of this building originally contained two floors, these floors were removed and an additional floor added to conform with the remainder of the building and the new additions, all windows realigned. The additional dead load is carried on new steel frame work of 12\" I sections and H columns to new concrete footings. The old frame walls and roof remain.\n\nThe ground floor corridor partitions have been rebuilt and replastered. Other partitions have been removed, rebuilt or new partitions installed as is noted on the drawings.\n\nThe laundry wing was also re-designed and renovated; new plumbing, floors, partitions, etc.\n\nAll old buildings have been completed reroofed with asbestos shingles and all recovered with an asbestos siding which has a \u00be\" rigid insulation backing.\n\n4. Electric wiring; All new wiring in old and new sections in rigid conduit or BX cable.\n\n5. Heating: All existing heating equipment removed. New Dunham Differential System installed and hooked up to new boiler. This system has been inspected and tested satisfactorily by C. A. Dunham Co. Limited.\n\n6. Plumbing: All new plumbing throughout old and new buildings. The old piping and fixtures have been reused where possible. A new 8' x 18' x 8' two chamber concrete septic tank has been built.\nbuilt and seems to work very satisfactorily.\n\n7. Water supply: Two new concrete storage tanks have been built. Rainwater storage tank is 16' in diameter and 14' deep. Lake water storage tank 24' diameter and 11' deep. Each tank is built underground, covered with 4' of earth and connected to a new pumping system.\n\n8. Generally: Materials used are sound and substantial. The workmanship is fair. A rough estimate of the work done runs between $85,000. and $90,000.00.\n\nEnclosed are drawings and photographs of above Indian School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) E. Parkinson,\nDistrict Resident Architect.\nWINNIPEG, November 16, 1939\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs promised we are enclosing our fourth report on additions to and alterations and improvements at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nMay we be permitted to say that His Excellency, Archbishop Sinnott of Winnipeg has expressed his satisfaction to Reverend Father E. Lamontagne on what you have done at Sandy Bay this year, and on the extra accommodations that you have provided for the children of this reserve. We have been asked by Reverend Father E. Lamontagne, Provincial, to express to you his thanks for your cooperation in bringing about these very needed improvements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.-O. Plourde,\nGeneral Superintendent.\n\nEnd.\nOttawa, November 17, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 16th instant and also copy of a report on the repairs and improvements at the Sandy Bay Indian residential school, attached thereto.\n\nI am today sending forward this report with a memorandum to the office of the Minister.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, November 17, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Addition and repairs to Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Manitoba.\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your consideration and for whatever action you may deem necessary, copy of a report on the construction of an addition to the Sandy Bay residential school and certain repairs to the school itself, received by Mr. T. S. Hills, Chief Engineer of the Department, from Reverend E. Lamontagne, O.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Order, Manitoba, and Reverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I., General Superintendent of Indian Missions of the Oblate Order. I am enclosing also plan of the Sandy Bay building and a report on the additions and alterations that have taken place, received by this Branch from Mr. E. Parkinson, District Resident Architect, Department of Public Works, Winnipeg. You will note that I am attaching a number of photographs of the Sandy Bay building to these reports.\n\nA memorandum dated April 18, 1939, received by this Branch from Mr. C. W. Jackson, reads in part as follows:\n\n\"As you know, the Surveys and Engineering Branch are securing a further report on the possibility of impounding the water in the creek which passes close by the Sandy Bay residential school. No doubt, this will be received very shortly. In the meantime, the Minister has approved of the necessary steps being taken to proceed with the construction of the two new dormitories.\"\ndormitories. It is estimated that the cost of these two buildings will not exceed $40,000.*\n\nIt is my understanding that an agreement was entered into between the Department and the church authorities with respect to the construction of these dormitories and certain general repairs to the old school structure. We do not appear, however, to have a copy of this agreement on file in this Branch.\n\nIn addition to the inspection made of this building by Mr. Ritchie of the Public Works Department on October 19, the Superintendent of Welfare and Training also inspected the building on the same date and reported thereon in his regular monthly report for October.\n\nIn view of the fact that only $40,000 was provided in the 1939-40 estimates for repairs and alterations at the Sandy Bay school, it will be necessary to consider ways and means of meeting the additional expenditure, estimated by the church authorities to amount to $18,750.34.\n\nDIRECTOR.\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miller,\nChief Engineer,\nMines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nComplying with the request contained in your letter of June 26th, we beg to submit our fourth report on the building of the additions to the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nAt date of writing the two new wings with connecting passages and fireproof stairways are fully completed, including painting.\n\nThe extensive repairs to the school building proper, to the laundry annex and to the tool and workshop have also been completed with the exception of painting. This work is being done at the present time by contract and we expect that it will be completed about December 1st.\n\nWe have been asked by the Department, through Mr. C.J. Jackson, to forward a special report on the extensive repairs carried out in the old school building as well as in the laundry annex and workshop. This has been prepared and is attached hereto, as both the construction of the new building and the repairs to the old were carried out in the same time, and as materials were purchased for both without any record being kept of what was being used. We have not been able to secure the figures which we hereby submit are to some extent approximate. However, they have been gone over very carefully by both the contractor and the book-keeper and we are assured that they represent a true picture of the materials used and the wages paid for these repairs.\n\nIn our previous report, we mentioned the building of two large cement water tanks to provide water storage until such time as a new pipe line is installed from the lake to the school. These are now in operation and are giving, under the circumstances, satisfactory results.\n\nLast Tuesday, Mr. R.A. Hoey, Superintendent of Training and Welfare, Mr. Gordon M. Ritchie, Rev. Father M. Lemontagne, and Rev. Father Plourde, made an inspection of the work done at Sandy Bay. Whilst we cannot speak for Mr. Hoey or Mr. Ritchie, we might state that they seemed to be quite satisfied both as to the quality of the work done and as to the reasonableness of the amount expended on the project.\n\nOur last report covered wages paid in August and purchases for which we had received invoices at date of writing. From September 1st to October 30th inclusively the following sums were paid out in wages:\nWe are also enclosing invoices received up to date of writing.\n\n**J.H.

We are enclosing receipted invoice in quadruplicate from the above firm. It seems that this was paid directly by the School and is not to be a charge on the new building.\n\n2nd We are also enclosing credit note from the Alip Brick, Tile & Lumber Co. for $4.60. This amount now stands to the credit of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\n3rd In our report dated August the 10th, we stated that wages for week ending July 25th were $200.00; the right amount was $200.00. If you will consult page 2 of our Return of Labour for week ending July the 25th you will notice that the sum of $201.00 was extended to page 3 as $201.00. This error was only noticed when preparing our last report.\n\nIn your communication of October the 10th you ask for receipted freight invoices for the following amounts:\n\n$ 64.79\n$1,280.00\n$1,444.75\n\nNo account was rendered by the Thorderson Transfer Co. for the first and last of these amounts as weights were not available at the time that the freighting was done. For the $1,280.00 item, you will find a charge of $24.35 in the Thorderson Transfer's account of August the 25th.\n\nIn our letter of August the 17th last we requested that Marshall-Wells' invoice No. 100-5 for $200.00 be returned to us so that we might try to obtain a reduction in price. This is hereby returned. Unfortunately we were not successful in our attempt to have the price of the item reduced.\n\nIn an interview which we had lately with Mr. C.W. Jackson regarding the cost of repairs to the old section of the Sandy Bay School, it was suggested that we make a special report on those repairs and allocations showing amounts spent on materials and wages on each separate item.\n\nOur Superintendent was asked to prepare this report and to be as accurate as possible in his estimate of materials and labour for these repairs. We are listing these repairs and allocations below:\n\n| Item                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Main Building: 100' x 40' Basement and Bunkers |          |\n| Wages                                     | $600.00  |\n| Lumber                                    | $301.44  |\n| Ten Feet                                  | $200.00  |\n| V.

(RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 8)\nIn our report of September the 26th we stated that the unexpended balance on this project was $154,69. From the 26th of August 1939 to October the 26th inclusively, the sum of $6,450.19 was paid out in wages and $9,400.88 was expended on material purchases. The overexpended balance on this project would therefore seem to be $15,885.72.\n\nThe attached credit memorandum from Crane Ltd for $204.74 and from the Canadian Pail-Making-Hose Ltd. for $77.65 would reduce this overexpended by $282.39, giving an apparent net overexpended of $15,603.33.\n\nWages of the few workmen which are now employed in the manner stated in Paragraph 3 of this report will increase the above overexpended. On the other hand, credit notes for materials returned will offset this charge in part.\n\nIt appears from the above figures that the two new wings measuring 36' x 60' with full basement and 2 stories plus connecting passageway which house the fire-proof stairways and the new toilets and bathrooms and which are also composed of full basement plus 2 stories, have cost about $5 less than estimated.\n\nSince this report was prepared, pay roll No. 26 covering the period from Saturday, October 26th to Friday, October the 27th Inclusively, was received, as well as the following invoices:\n\n| Invoice No. | Description          | Amount |\n|-------------|----------------------|--------|\n| 72656       | J.H.

This work will absorb $700.00.\n\nWe believe that the sum of $700.00 should be allowed for unforeseen expenses and also to provide payment for goods purchased for which invoices have not yet been rendered.\n\nIncluding the above 3 items, the overexpenditure on this project will have been $15,730.34. The above figure is as correct as can be arrived at under the circumstances.\n\nWith the figures which we had in our possession on the 5th instant, date on which the first part of this report was prepared, we had estimated that after making into account the sum of $17,479.71 spent on alterations and repairs to the old buildings, the two new wings and connecting passages had cost about $5 less than estimated. Subsequent invoices received on the 9th instant, as well as pay roll No. 25, plus $700.00 provided for unforeseen expenses have somewhat altered this figure.\n\nWe wish to take this opportunity to thank you for your valuable advice and guidance in connection with this work.

E. Lamontagne, wherein he states that no separate accounting was kept to show the division between costs for constructing the new wings and renovating the central portion of the existing building. However, from the figures furnished the following tabulation summarizes the situation:\n\n| Description                                                                 | Cost       |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------|\n| Total cost of all work including two new wings and reconstruction of central portion | $58,730.34 |\n| Cost of reconstruction of central portion not covered in agreement         | $17,608.32 |\n| Cost of two new wings                                                      | $40,922.02 |\n| Amount provided under terms of agreement                                   | $40,000.00 |\n\nThe expenditure on the two new wings has therefore exceeded the amount provided under the agreement by $922.02, which is considered reasonable for contingencies and extras.\n\nI am also forwarding herewith two copies of a report on the completed work submitted by Mr. Parkinson, Resident Architect at Winnipeg for the Department of Public Works. You will observe that Mr. Parkinson estimates that the work carried out on the new wings and renovations would cost between $85,000.00 and $90,000.00. It is assumed that Mr. Parkinson's estimate is on the basis of Winnipeg prices.\n\nAttached also is a summarized list, in duplicate, of outstanding accounts with credits and paylists totalling $17,076.95, together with such accounts and paylists in triplicate.\n\nWith respect to the Crane Limited accounts of August 29th and 31st for $1,449.75 and $94.75, and which are included in the above mentioned list, we have written to Crane Limited asking for receipted freight vouchers in support of freight---\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys & Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nfreight charges shown thereon. When these vouchers are received I shall forward them to your office.\n\nOf the $40,000.00 allotted to this Service accounts have been paid to the extent of $39,999.92, leaving an unexpended balance of eight cents (.08).\n\nIn accordance with your verbal instructions the attached accounts are transmitted as it is understood that same will be referred to the Indian Affairs Branch for whatever action is to be taken.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 8)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nReports on the construction of the above school indicate that the total expenditure for the current year when all accounts, vouchers, etc., have been received, will amount to $58,730.34 which means an over-expenditure of $18,730.34, as only $40,000.00 was provided in 1939-40.\n\nWork on the school has included not only two new wings but a considerable amount of repair work and alterations to the existing central portion of the building. Apparently work was carried out simultaneously on old and new sections and the church officials had some difficulty in separating the expenditures. In an attempt to segregate these costs Fathers Lamontagne and Plourde have arrived at a figure for the old building of $17,808.32. Of the $40,000.00 provided accounts have been paid totalling $39,999.92, and accounts outstanding, as tabulated by our Engineers, total $17,076.95. Accounts are still being received and it is probable that the above figure of over-expenditure is very close to the correct one.\n\nOur Engineering and Construction officers, of course, found it impossible to divide the accounts into new construction and renovations to the old part of the school so that the only conclusion which can be arrived at definitely is that there will be required the sum of $18,730.34 to pay for work carried out at the school this year.\n\nI am attaching a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, a summary of unpaid accounts, a report prepared by Mr. E. Parkinson, District Resident Architect, and the report of the Oblate Fathers by Fathers Lamontagne and Plourde.\nThere is also being forwarded under separate cover accounts which remain unpaid and which are summarized in the tabulated statement prepared by this Branch.\n\nSummarizing this situation it appears that there is an over-expenditure of $18,730.34. According to figures supplied by the church officials some $17,808.32 was spent on the old building and $922.02 over the $40,000.00 on the new. Consequently it might be said that the Department has carried out its assistance to the extent of $40,000.00 and that the amount of the accounts outstanding is approximately equivalent to the work done on the old building.\n\nWhether or not the Department is prepared to assist in the renovation of the old building to this extent, $17,808.32, is a matter of policy.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 5, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\nSURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Sandy Bay Residential School\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your memorandum of December 30 reporting on the reconstruction of the above school.\n\nIt is noted that there are unpaid accounts to the amount of $17,803.32.

At the present time it appears that some $34,000 is available from the latter project and a Memorandum to Council is being drafted asking for authority to pay or refund to the Church authorities the amount of the over-expenditure as represented by accounts submitted. Some of these accounts have already been forwarded to you.\n\nIf your understanding in regard to the additional payments is in accordance with that outlined above, would you kindly advise me if you would like to have all accounts submitted to you for inspection before they are paid by this Branch from the Port Alberni Vote, or if you would prefer that they be checked by our Architectural Division and paid without further reference provided they are considered in order.\n\nJ.

Sutherland, Esq., Chief Architect, D. P. W.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFROM: The Office of the Resident Architect,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nWinnipeg, November 2nd, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Indian School, Sandy Bay, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 19th, Mr. Ritchie of this office accompanied Mr. Hoey of the Department of Mines and Resources to Sandy Bay on the 24th ultimo and inspected work done on the Indian School there, and following is his report:\n\nThe work completed as follows:\n\n1. New South Wing: Walls 13\" clay brick and hollow tile; floors 2-1/2\" concrete on 12\" massilon steel joist; 20 year bonded roof on steel decking insulated with 1\" rigid insulation board; stairs and landings are concrete and separated from the old building by a 9\" brick firewall.\n\n2. New North Wing: Similar in all respects to new South Wing.\n\n3. Old Building: This building has been completely renovated. All wooden stairs were removed, stair wells were floored over and the space made available for school purposes. The northern 30 feet of this building originally contained two floors; these floors were removed and an additional floor added to conform with the remainder of the building and the new additions, all windows realigned. The additional dead load is carried on new steel frame work of 12\" I sections and H columns to new concrete footings. The old frame walls and roof remain.\n\nThe ground floor corridor partitions have been rebuilt and replastered. Other partitions have been removed, rebuilt or new partitions installed as is noted on the drawings.\n\nThe laundry wing was also re-designed and renovated; new plumbing, floors, partitions, etc.\n\nAll old buildings have been completed reroofed with asbestos shingles and all recovered with an asbestos siding which has a 1\" rigid insulation backing.\n\n4. Electric wiring: All new wiring in old and new sections in rigid conduit or BX cable.\n\n5. Heating: All existing heating equipment removed. New Dunham Differential System installed and hooked up to new boiler. This system has been inspected and tested satisfactorily by G. A. Dunham Co. Limited.\n\n6. Plumblings: All new plumbing throughout old and new buildings. The old piping and fixtures have been reused where possible. A new 8' x 18' x 8' two chamber concrete septic tank has been built and seems to work very satisfactorily.\n\n7. Water supply: Two new concrete storage tanks have been built. Rainwater storage tank is 16' in diameter and 14' deep. Lake water storage tank 24' diameter and 11' deep. Each tank is built underground, covered with 4' of earth and connected to a new pumping system.\n\n8. Generally: Materials used are sound and substantial. The workmanship is fair. A rough estimate of the work done runs between $85,000. and $90,000.00\n\nEnclosed are drawings and photographs of above Indian School.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) E.

This work is being done at the present time by contract and we expect that it will be completed about December 1st.\n\nWe have been asked by the Department, through Mr. G.W. Jackson, to forward a special report on the extensive repairs carried out in the old school building as well as in the laundry annex and workshop. This has been prepared and is attached hereto. As both the construction of the new building and the repairs to the old were carried out in the same time, and as materials were purchased for both without any record being kept of what was being used for one or the other, the figures which we hereby submit are to some extent approximate. However, they have been gone over very carefully by both the contractor and the bookkeeper and we are assured that they represent a true picture of the materials used and the wages paid for these repairs.\n\nIn our previous report, we mentioned the building of two large cement water tanks to provide water storage until such time as a new pipe line is installed from the lake to the school. These are now in operation and are giving, under the circumstances, satisfactory results.\n\nLast Tuesday, Mr. R.A. Hoey, Superintendent of Training and Welfare, Mr. Gordon M. Ritchie, Rev. Father E. Lamontagne, and Rev. Father Plourde, made an inspection of the work done at Sandy Bay. Whilst we cannot speak for Mr. Hoey or Mr. Ritchie, we might state that they seemed to be quite satisfied both as to the quality of the work done and as to the reasonableness of the amount expended on the project.\n\nOur last report covered wages paid in August and purchases for which we had received invoices at date of writing. From September 1st to October 30th inclusively the following sums were paid out in wages:\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are enclosing receipted invoice in quadruplicate from the above firm. It seems that this was paid directly by the School and is not to be a charge on the new building.\n\n2nd: We are also enclosing credit note from the Alsip Brick, Tile & Lumber Co. for $4.68. This amount now stands to the credit of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\n3rd: In our report dated August the 10th, we stated that wages for week ending July 28th were $880.11; the right amount was $860.11. If you will consult page 2 of our Return of Labour for week ending July the 28th you will notice that the sum of $761.86 was extended to page 3 as $751.26. This error was only noticed when preparing our last report.\n\nIn your communication of October the 19th you ask for receipted freight vouchers for the following amounts:\n\n$94.76\n$1,258.86\n$1,449.75\n\nNo account was rendered by the Thorderson Transfer Co. for the first and last of these amounts as weights were not available at the time that the freighting was done. For the $1,258.85 item, you will find a charge of $24.53 in the Thorderson Transfer's account of August the 30th.\n\nIn our letter of August the 17th last we requested that Marshall-Wells' invoice No. 190-8 for $1653.00 be returned to us so that we might try to obtain a reduction in price. This is hereby returned. Unfortunately we were not successful in our attempt to have the price of the item reduced.\n\nIn an interview which we had lately with Mr. C.W. Jackson regarding the cost of repairs to the old section of the Sandy Bay School, it was suggested that we make a special report on these repairs and alterations showing amounts spent on materials and wages on each separate item.\n\nOur Superintendent was asked to prepare this report and to be as accurate as possible in his estimate of materials and labour for these repairs. We are listing these repairs and alterations below:\n\n| Item                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Wages                                     | 900.08   |\n| Lumber                                    | 361.14   |\n| Ten Test                                  | 285.95   |\n| V.

From the 26th of August, 1939 to October the 20th inclusively, the sum of $6,450.19 was paid out in wages and $9,408.22 was expended on material purchases. The overexpended balance on this project would therefore seem to be $15,635.72.\n\nThe attached credit memorandums from Crane Ltd for $201.74 and from the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Ltd. for $77.65 would reduce this overexpenditure by $279.39, making an apparent net overexpenditure of $15,406.33.\n\nWages of the few workmen which are now employed in the manner stated in Paragraph 3 of this report will increase the above overexpenditure. On the other hand, credit notes for materials returned will offset this charge in part.\n\nIt appears from the above figures that the two new wings measuring 34' x 60' with full basement and 2 stories plus connecting passages which house the fire-proof stairways and the new toilets and bathrooms and which are also composed of full basement plus 2 stories, have cost about 5% less than estimated.\n\nSince this report was prepared, pay roll No. 25 covering the period from Saturday, October 21st to Friday, October the 27th inclusively, was received, as well as the following invoices:\n\n1st: Return of Labour No. 25 $292.14\n\n2nd: J.H.

This work will absorb $700.00\n\nWe believe that the sum of $700.00 should be allowed for unforeseen expenses and also to provide payment for goods purchased for which invoices have not yet been rendered.\n\nIncluding the above 2 items, the overexpenditure on this project will have been $16,750.34 The above figure is as correct as can be arrived at under the circumstances.\n\nWith the figures which we had in our possession on the 6th instant, date on which the first part of this report was prepared, we had estimated that after taking into account the sum of $17,479.73 spent on alterations and repairs to the old building, the two new wings and connecting passages had cost about 5% less than estimated. Subsequent invoices received on the 9th instant, as well as pay roll No. 25, plus $700.00 provided for unforeseen expenses have somewhat altered this figure.\n\nWe wish to take this opportunity to thank you for your valuable advice and guidance in connection with this work. We have very much appreciated your unfailing good will and your readiness to be of help to us at all times and under all circumstances.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Reverend Oblate Father.\n\nPer\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]: VERRY POOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDir. of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe - Indian Residential School, Sandy Bay,\nManitoba. Your file 126-9-5.\n\nI am returning herewith the copy of the report on the construction of the addition to the above school enclosed with your memorandum of the 17th November last. This was discussed briefly with the Minister before he went away. It would seem that the additional amount over and above the $40,000 provided was incurred largely in connection with work done on the old building. The Minister would like the matter brought to his attention again when the Supplementary Estimates are being prepared. He expressed the view that it might be possible to provide the necessary funds for the additional expenditures from the amount that has been set aside for the construction of the new Alberni School. In discussing the question with the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the latter stated that he should be in a position to know definitely by February 1st what funds might be available for that purpose.\n\nC.W.

Rev. Alfred A. Simott, D.D., Archbishop of Winnipeg, dated Jan. 17th, with reference to the amount of money expended in connection with the above School.\n\nWill you please have a draft reply prepared for the Minister's signature.\n\nW.J.F.

Gravel,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Gravel,\n\nAt the risk of a certain amount of bother and annoyance, may I take the liberty of saying that I recently visited the enlarged Indian School at Sandy Bay. It is superb and certainly the equal of any Indian School in this Province. I want to express my sincere thanks to you for your kind consideration and generous response to my appeal.\n\nNot only were the two wings constructed, and happily fire-proof, but very substantial reparations were made in the old building. Now I can feel more at ease, for the lives of the children will be safeguarded against the danger of fire, no matter what might happen. I fear the Fathers spent more money than they were authorized to spend by the Department, but personally I am convinced that it was money judiciously spent. I am told that they exceeded the amount authorized by at least $20,000.00. If the Fathers approach you, I am sure you will give them a sympathetic hearing.\n\nThe new building is capable of holding 150 children. There are that many, or almost that many, on the Sandy Bay Reserve. The children must be educated and I hope that the Department will authorize the Fathers to take as many children as may be necessary to fill the school and that the necessary funds will be provided in the estimates of the current year.\n\nWith sentiments of the highest esteem,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour very humble servant,\n\n(signed) Alfred A.

I was very gratified, therefore, to learn that after an inspection of the plant your own views were in accord with the reports that had already reached the Department. I must state, however, that I was somewhat disturbed to learn that the original estimate of the cost of these repairs had been exceeded by the sum of approximately $50,000. If I remember correctly, the first estimate of the cost of the repairs proposed at this school was $25,000. This was later increased to $40,000, on the understanding that the additions would be of fireproof construction throughout. No provision has of course been made in the 1938-40 estimates for the payment of the additional amount referred to in your communication, and this sum, if it is to be paid, will have to be submitted to and passed by Parliament.\n\nI note, also, your request for an additional per capita allowance at this school to enable those in charge -\n\nMost Reverend Alfred A.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDuring my recent visit to the Sandy Bay Residential School, I made an inspection of the new additions which are evidently fireproof. The old portion of the school has been sided with a pulp composition but it is still an old building. The dormitories, both girls and boys, are in the new buildings, the class rooms etc., being in the old. I was specially interested in the fire protection of the building, which I do not think is adequate. In the case of fire breaking out in the old building, it is expected that the children would immediately be transferred to the fire proof new additions, and from there they would be able to reach the outside. The old building is of frame and, in the event of fire, would burn very fast. I feel that the doors between the old building and the new should be of steel or at least fire-proof. There should also be a means of more readily access from the roofs of the new additions to the ground, and in my opinion, there are not enough hose lines. I am not an authority on fire protection and beg to suggest that an architect or some person with a knowledge of fire protection be sent to the school to look over these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nApril 2, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo with reference to the Sandy Bay Residential School. Immediately following the completion of the new additions to this school it was visited by an officer of the Department and a representative of the Architects Branch of the Public Works Department at Winnipeg. Both of these officials have reported to the Department and we are consequently fully informed regarding the present condition of this building.\n\nIt is the intention of the school management to provide fireproof doors as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

As you know this truck is used for hauling water. The account was certified and forwarded to the Department by Rev. Father Chagnon. I am informed this morning by the Western Canada Motors Ltd. that it has not yet been paid and they are pressing for a settlement.\n\nWould you be good enough to have this matter attended to as soon as possible so as to put a stop to their repeated complaints.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The account was mislaid on our file and we have recently received a request from the Company for payment. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that these three invoices may be paid. The coding is as follows: 584-76-09-810.\n\nR.A.

School.\n\nWe would certainly prefer to see you supply new machinery for this School but under the circumstances, that is to say in view of the present war conditions, we would be satisfied with the rebuilt machinery offered above.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 9)\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nAnswering your communication of recent date regarding the purchase of equipment and furniture for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, I beg to report as follows:\n\n1. LAUNDRY\n\na) 1 Extractor 26\" in diameter costing about $490.\nb) 1 Washing machine 40 x 54 costing about $498.\nc) 2 Small laundry trucks of a size to fit with the two above machines.\n\n2. FURNITURE, general\n\na) 5 Congoleum rugs 9 x 12\nb) 4 \" 7 x 9\nc) 1 \" 5 x 7\nd) 1 \" 15 x 18 or 2.7 x 9\ne) 4 Complete beds, i.e., bed, mattress and spring, for the Principal and Assistant Principal's rooms, the Agent's and the Nurse's rooms.\nf) 3 Desk chairs\ng) 10 small washstands, white\nh) 6 Armchairs\ni) 18 Blinds 27 3-8\" in width and about 72\" in length for infirmary.\nj) 14 blinds 27 3-8\" in width and about 72\" in length for halls and toilets.\nk) 60 blinds 27 3-8\" in width and about 72\" in length for boys' and girls' dormitories.\n3. FURNITURE, infirmary\n\na) 1 Kitchen table with steel top, white enamel\nb) 14 Chairs white enamel\nc) 1 Small desk\nd) 10 small bed tables with top 18 x 24 or about\ne) Complete bedding for 10 infirmary beds,\n   including white bedspreads, woollen blankets,\n   pillows, pillow heads and sheets.\nf) 1 sofa or couch\ng) 2 Hospital beds complete with tables.\nh) 1 Infirmary scale\n\n4. FIRE PROTECTION\n\na) Fire hose, 2-2\" 50' long, 3 1 1-2\" 50' long,\n   1 nozzle 2\", 1 nozzle 1-2\", 2 valves 1-2\",\n   1 valve 2\" and 1 tee 2\".\n\nWe believe that for the staff rooms, the Department\nshould supply 4 small desks, 4 dressers and 4 bed tables.\n\nThere is nothing in the above in the way of cup-\nboards or wardrobes for staff rooms, sisters' quarters,\ndormitories as well as storerooms. In the reconstruction\nand re-apportioning of the various rooms of the old school,\nall the old cupboards had to be torn down and the lumber could\nnot be saved, so that lumber will have to be bought to supply\nthe school with all these essentials. The engineer promised\nto supply a list of the lumber required for this purpose\nand I will forward it to your Department as soon as I have\nreceived it.\n\nWe are of the opinion that all this furniture should\nbe bought by your Inspector, Mr. Hamilton, after consulting\nwith the Principal and the Sister Superior in charge. In\nthis manner the most suitable furniture will certainly be\nbought at reasonable prices. Moreover this method would\nsave a great deal of time. We have complete confidence in\nyour Inspector, Mr. Hamilton. He is a good buyer and always\ntakes the interests of the Department at heart.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.G. Plourde, O.M.I.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir-\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nReferring further to the equipment for Sandy Bay, I forgot to mention in my previous letter that there is no linoleum at all in the halls and Father would like to have you supply about 180 yards of battleship linoleum for this purpose.\n\nThe enclosed list of lumber and hardware is to be used for cupboards and wardrobes as mentioned in the second last paragraph of my letter of the 3rd instant. It is to be hoped that care will be exercised in the purchase of this lumber as the Principal wishes the money that has been voted for the equipment of his school to go as far as possible.\n\nOnly a few window screens were made last year. To complete this job would require two rolls of galvanized mosquito screening, 56 inches wide.\n\nThe following lumber is needed for pews in the Chapel:\n\n| Quantity | Size   |\n|----------|--------|\n| 10       | 2-18   |\n| 5        | 2-14   |\n| 3        | 1-18   |\n| 8        | 2-14   |\n| 8        | 2-16   |\n| 10       | 1/2-6  |\n| 30       | 1-12   |\n\nI hope that sufficient money will be left after the above furniture and materials have been bought to take\ncare of the wages of a master carpenter. The school engineer is a very handy man but it would too much to ask him to make all this furniture and take care at the same time of the school machinery and boiler room.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSANDY BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n18- 1x12 - 16ft.\n5- 1x12 - 6\n24- 1x12 - 14\n50- 1x12 - 12\n5- 1x4 - 18\n12- 1x10 - 10\n\nclear fir\n\n18- 1x2 - 16\n14- 1x12 - 14\n25- 1x12 - 12\n60- 1x10 - 10\n8- 1x10 - 16\n3- 1x8 - 10\n14- 1x6 - 16\n4- 1x6 - 12\n46- 1x6 - 10\n4- 1x4 - 12\n\nsp.\n\n6- 2x2 - 16\n6- 2x2 - 14\n2- 2x2 - 12\n10- 2x2 - 10\n\nfir\n\n8- 2x2 - 6\n57- 2x2 - 10\n95- 2x2 - 12\n3- 2x2 - 14\n22- 2x2 - 16\n10- 2x4 - 12\n\nsp.\n\n24- 2x4 - 12\n4- 2x6 - 12\n12- 2x12 - 12\n12- 1x4 - 12\n\nfir\n\n576 ft- 1x6 - sp. flooring\n76 ft.- 1x4 - fir flooring\n425 ft- 1x4 - 10 ft V joint fir\n\n3ply fir\n\nIndian Affairs.

Since this method of providing water was adopted, all hauling was done over a prairie trail. When the weather was nice this trail proved to be a satisfactory road, but on all rainy days and all through the winter the hauling was extremely difficult being besides most harmful to the truck used for this purpose.\n\nRev. Father Chagnon early this month graded this road partly with the school equipment and also with machinery borrowed from the Municipality. He would like the wages paid for the work to be assumed by the Department.\n\nHoping that you will be able to accede to his wishes, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have recently reviewed the report made by Mr. Gow on September 5, 1934. This read in part as follows:\n\n\"The existing water supply at the Institution is briefly as follows: The school building is approximately 100' x 40' and rainfall upon the roof is collected into an underground cistern 18 feet in diameter and 10 feet deep, with a capacity of about 7,000 gallons. This cistern is in close proximity to the kitchen and the water is delivered to the kitchen by means of a hand pump located in the kitchen. This water is used for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes. For sanitary purposes three tanks with a combined capacity of 2,200 gallons are located in the attic of the building and a gravity water furnished the school. The water supply to these tanks comes from two sources, but the quality of the water is much the same. A comparatively deep well, approximately 250 feet from the school, is operated by a wind mill.\"\n\nRev. O. Chagnon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal, Sandy Bay Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\nand a feed pipe leads to the water tanks, the energy necessary also being supplied by the wind mill. A comparatively shallow well is located quite close to the workshop of the school and is connected to an underground cistern nearby; the dimensions of this cistern being about four feet square and sixteen feet deep. A pump driven by a small gasoline engine located in the workshop connects with this cistern and also to the storage tank in the attic and is operated during such periods as continued lack of sufficient wind to operate the wind mill results in failure of water supply from the deeper well. The Principal of the school stated that this shallow well appeared to be going dry. The water from both these wells is very hard and distinctly salty. It is unfit for drinking, cooking and laundry purposes in the school, but I understand that in addition to sanitary purposes it is also used in the steam heating system, high pressure boiler and domestic water heater.\n\n\"The amount of water that can be collected into the soft water cistern from the roof, even in a year of average precipitation, is far from sufficient to meet the requirements of the very limited use to which this supply is put and consequently water has to be hauled from Lake Manitoba -- two and one-third miles distant. It appears that only an average of one tank per week is hauled from the lake.\"\n\nIn reporting on the present water situation you should refer particularly to the following:\n\n1. The approximate amount of water that is collected from the roof into the soft water cistern.\n\n2. The number of tanks of water per week that have to be hauled from the lake.\n\n3. Did the well mentioned in Mr. Gow's report go dry? If not, is it still too salty for use?\n\n4. Are you aware of any wells having been dug in the vicinity within the last year from which good water\nhas been obtained? In that event you should let me know the depth of such wells and their approximate cost.\n\nI should appreciate having your reply at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH.A.

HOEY.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAnswering your letter of the 12th Instant, I beg to say: Mr. Gow's report made on September 5th 1934, described exactly what we had to do at Sandy Bay before construction of two new wings in Autumn 1929. You ask me to answer four questions.\n\n1) In summer 1940, our soft water cistern with a capacity of 7000 gal. was filled about 4 times.\n\n2) We go to the lake three times a day with a tank of 600 gal., at a distance of about 2\u00bd miles.\n\n3) There are two wells mentioned about in Mr. Gow's report; The one near the school has gone dry, the other on which there is a wind mill is still used in summer for the animals but the water is as salty as before.\n\n4) There has been no wells dug recently in the vicinity.\n\nAll the water that we use at Sandy Bay goes firstly in a large outside cistern of 25000 gallons, from this it is pumped by the electric plant into 3 pressure tanks installed in the furnace apartment.\nWith a tank containing 600 gallons we must go to the lake 3 times a day in order to furnish enough water for the school. The winter of 1939-40 having been very mild without hardly any snow and we did not lack of water. With a colder winter and more snow it will be more difficult.\n\nWe receive $40.00 a month from the Department for hauling water from the lake to the school. Bad roads, rain, cold, truck repairs, hinder us from making the 3 trips a day, but as the cistern has a capacity of 25000 gallons, we can regain time when everything goes well.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO. Chagnon\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nNovember 22, 1940.\n\nDear Father Chagnon:\n\nI desire to acknowledge with thanks your letter of the 16th instant reporting on the water situation at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.

This truck has been in use since 1938 and its mileage is 24000 miles for the hauling of water for the school on a distance of three miles in rough roads and sometimes in very bad roads and it is not surprising that serious troubles have happened lately.\n\nMay I suggest that an urgent solution be given to this important problem because our storage of water requires it and I take the liberty to suggest to you that this truck be exchanged for a new one with the exception of the water tank and the pump equipment.\n\nMr. Johannesson at the Langruth Garage would make the exchange for a new Fargo Truck on a basis of about $900.00 in return.\n\nThanking for the consideration you will give to my request, I remain yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These were purchased at the same time as the truck was secured.\n\nIn reporting on the water situation at this school in 1936 Mr. Mills, of the Surveys & Engineering Branch, stated that in a report submitted in 1935 Mr. Cow estimated that 3000 gallons a day was the minimum quantity of water required at this school. Mr. Cow's report of September 5, 1936, estimated that it would cost approximately $25,000.00 to provide an adequate water supply to this school. This would involve piping the water from Lake Manitoba.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Connections at both ends are required, because they are wearing quickly, there is some screwing and unscrewing at every load, so when one end is worn out, we use the other and it gives us time to order a new connection.\n\nIf a new truck is supplied, Jhoaneson Garage of Langruth will install the tank on it.\n\nFrom the 7th of January, we are conveying water, day and night, with horses, it is nearly enough for the daily requirement, but in case of fire it would not be enough and we would be helpless for want of water.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO.

A few days ago we received a letter from the Principal at the school, asking when shipment would be made. In that letter we advised that the factory had been held up on account of shortage of material, and we hope to be shipping in a few days.\n\nBoth the Washer and the Extractor are in our Warehouse at present. There are a few changes to be made in the Extractor. We are planning to ship these Saturday of this week, and not later than Monday. We are sorry for the delay but no doubt you appreciate these are trying times and material is very difficult to secure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJFK/P.\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nVice-President.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

These were purchased at the same time as the truck was secured.\n\nIn reporting on the water situation at this school in 1938 Mr. Hall of the Survey & Engineering Branch, stated that in a report submitted in 1938 Mr. Gow estimated that 3000 gallons a day was the minimum quantity of water required at this school. Mr. Gow's report of September 5, 1934, estimated that it would cost approximately $3,000.00 to provide an adequate water supply to this school. This would involve piping the water from Lake Manitoba.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

(RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM RESPECTING PURCHASES OF FORD VEHICLES\nDIRECT FROM THE FORD COMPANY\n\nA letter has been received from the Ford Motor Company in which they offer to sell Ford products to all Government Departments on the same basis that is now extended to the Department of Munitions and Supply. This selling plan is predicated on all transactions being made direct with the Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, Windsor, Ontario, and does not permit of used vehicles being traded in. The offer is to be effective immediately and will continue in force for the duration of the war unless you are otherwise notified.\n\nThe prices charged for purchases on this basis will be considerably less than those for purchases through Ford dealers. It will be appreciated that under this arrangement the dealers will not participate financially and therefore cannot be expected to assume any responsibility for delivery or warranty.\n\nThese special prices will be referred to hereafter as the \"War Supply Prices\" and the prices for products bought in the regular way through the dealers will be referred to as the \"Standard Prices\".\n\nTreasury Board Minute (T.193643 B., dated April 30, 1940) directs that in certain instances, where a vehicle of a type that is manufactured by the Ford Motor Company is being purchased, the Department concerned must obtain a specific bid from the Ford Motor Company at Windsor, Ontario, on a comparable Ford vehicle at the War Supply Price.\n\nDetails of the Company's selling plan are as follows:\n\nSELLING PLAN\n\n1. Tenders\n   Invitations to tender are to be sent to the Head Office of the Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited, Windsor, Ontario. The Company will tender direct for any vehicles where no trade-in is involved.\n\n2. Prices\n   (a) The basis of price quotations will be the same as that in effect on the Company's quotations to the Department of Munitions and Supply.\n   (b) Prices quoted will include sales and excise taxes and will be firm for the period specified in the tender except for any changes in these taxes prior to delivery of the vehicles.\n   (c) Prices will include pre-servicing at factory and a filling of oil. Gasoline will not be included or supplied.\n   (d) Quotations made will specify all standard and optional equipment and will represent an all-inclusive price delivered at destinations indicated in tenders.\n(e) Service parts will be sold to Dominion Government Departments at dealer price less 15% f.o.b., Factory or any of the Company's Branches. Official departmental orders on this price basis will be honoured only at the Head Office, Windsor, Ontario, or at the Branch Offices at Saint John, N.B., Montreal, Toronto, Ont., Winnipeg, Man., Regina, Sask., Calgary, Alta., and Vancouver, B.C.\n\n3. Terms of Payment\n\nIn extending these prices to the Government, the Company states that it is a necessary condition that payments be effected promptly and that a limit of 30 days after shipment be the maximum period for extension of credit.\n\n4. Transportation\n\n(a) The Company reserves the right to use the most convenient method of transporting vehicles to destination, including road, rail, transport or boat service. The Government representative, to whom the vehicles are to be consigned, will be designated on the order, and he will be responsible for acceptance and unloading, if necessary, at destination.\n\n(b) Charges for transportation included in price quotations will not be in excess of similar charges to dealers which are based on shipments in carload lots. Should, however, the delivery requested by Government departments necessitate shipments in less than carload lots resulting in higher transportation costs, then quotations will be increased to the extent of such higher costs.\n\n5. Warranty\n\n(a) Manufacturers warranty will extend for a period of ninety days or 4000 miles of operation, whichever occurs first. Claims under warranty will be reported on Form N.D.C.-789 on which will be recorded all particulars such as model of vehicle, serial number, motor number, etc. Parts which are claimed to have failed in operation and consequently have been replaced should be held pending instructions from the Company as to disposition. Form N.D.C.-789 will be forwarded to the Head Office of the Company at Windsor, Ontario, marked for the attention of the Service Department. Examination of parts will be made by the Company's representative at the point where the parts are being held by the department concerned. This location will be indicated on Form N.D.C.-789. Examination and report by the Company on claims will be made in not more than thirty days from the date thereof. In cases where the company wishes the parts in question returned to its nearest branch, transportation costs on such parts will be assumed by the department. Credits for parts which have\nbeen found to be defective will be made at prices at which parts are sold by the Company to the departments concerned. Local purchases made in the field from dealers will be supplied by dealers at retail prices less discount usually allowed by dealers to fleet owners.\n\n(Note.- Form N.D.C.-769 is a Department of National Defence Form, and a copy for reference purposes should be obtained from that Department).\n\n(b) Allowances for labour arising out of warranty claims where such labour is performed by Government departments or outside garages will be made at the Company's current flat rate labour schedule at the rate of seventy-five cents per hour. No allowance will be made where labour expended is less than one hour. Where the operations performed are not included in the flat rate labour schedule the time to be allowed will be mutually agreed upon by the Company and the Department concerned.\n\nThe following should be noted in connection with transactions of the nature above referred to:-\n\n(a) Lubrication Service\n\nAfter initial servicing by the Company, the Department concerned will make its own arrangements to have the vehicle taken care of in this respect at Government expense.\n\n(b) Delivery and Handling\n\nThe Department will make whatever arrangements are necessary to take delivery at destination. Costs for such, if any, will be a charge to the Government.\n\n(d) Disposal of Used Vehicle\n\nWhere a purchase has been made at the War Supply Price and there is a used vehicle to be disposed of, the Department concerned will, as soon as delivery of the new vehicle has been made, notify the Salvage Officer that the used vehicle is to be sold. Such notification will show the Committee's Application Number which appears at the top of Page One of the Application Form and will include a request that the Salvage Officer quote this number when reporting the sale to the Committee.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 21, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI attach copy of purchase order for a new Ford truck to carry the water at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. In connection with this truck I also attach memorandum respecting purchases of Ford vehicles direct from the Ford Company. Your attention is directed to the different paragraphs in this memorandum.\n\nI wish to draw your particular attention to paragraph 12. You should notify me immediately on receipt of the new truck in order that I may arrange with the Salvage Officer to take charge of the old truck. The latter should be stored at the school until the Salvage Officer disposes of it.\n\nIn your letter of January 13 you stated that when the new truck is supplied you can arrange with Johanson Garage of Langruth to install the tank on it. Purchase order No. 5406 was forwarded to you on January 31 covering the hose that you requested in your letter of January 13.\n\nYou are well aware of the critical conditions through which we are passing at the present time and as a consequence it will be increasingly difficult to replace equipment owing to lack of funds. Under these circumstances it is most necessary that the management of our Indian residential schools take every possible care of equipment supplied to the schools. With regard to the new truck that has been ordered it should only be used for the transportation of water. It must not be used for any other purpose whatsoever. I feel certain that you will carry out our instructions in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. O. Chagnon, C.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMarius, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 22, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWe have received five accounts totalling $287.00 for wages for making cupboards and other articles of equipment at the Sandy Bay Residential School.

So I have bought them. Had I known it would cause you some trouble, I would have asked authority to buy.

This cement produces a very fine dust which is most disagreeable. In all your modern fire-proof schools, you have made provision to cover these floors with battleship linoleum. Father Chagnon is willing to forego everything else this year in order to enable you to supply the necessary quantity of this linoleum for his school chapel. It measures 32 x 60 - 200 yards would suffice to cover the whole floor.\n\nHoping that you will be able to accede to Father Chagnon's demand, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. O.

This would involve an expenditure of approximately $350.00. It is possible that the floor may have already been painted but that the paint has worn off. It would be appreciated if you would again discuss the matter with the Principal and communicate with me further.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O.

Phelan  \n\nLast year the Department was good enough to supply a truck for the hauling of water for the Sandy Bay Indian Res. School. At the present time this truck is housed in a garage which is not built for winter use. It is not insulated, nor is there room in it to put a stove. The Principal would like to enlarge it to provide sufficient room for a heating system of some kind. He has forwarded the enclosed list of material which would be needed for this purpose.\n\nIf enlarged as suggested, the garage would be of sufficient size to house the Farm truck which has to be used occasionally to pull the truck out of snow banks in the Winter.\n\nThis is an improvement which should really be attended to immediately. Nothing was asked for this purpose in last year's estimates because it was thought that the truck could be kept in the garage as it had been in previous years. Bearing in mind the recommendation contained in one of your previous letters, that particular care be taken of the truck on account of the impossibility in which the Department may find itself to replace it, Father Chagnon is willing to supply all the labour necessary to enlarge the garage if you can supply the material.\n\nBack in 1939 the ice house of the School was burnt and as the Department does not carry insurance on its buildings, the School received nothing to compensate it for this loss. Owing to the fact that the electrical plant is a local affair, it was not thought advisable to supply the School with a frigidaire at the time it was renovated and enlarged. The School has therefore been without refrigeration facilities for the last two years.\nMr. Ph. Phelan\n\nSept. 27, 1941.\n\nThe Principal is agreeable to supplying all the labour in connection with the building of an ice house if the Department will supply the material necessary for the purpose. I am enclosing the list of this material as it was forwarded to me. I consider that an ice house is quite essential for the School and you may wish to pay for the above out of the emergency funds.\n\nWhen furniture was supplied for the School, the following articles were omitted from the list:\n\n3 doz. No. 28-L204 chairs.\n3 only No. 28-L196 rockers\n6 only No. 28-L201 chairs\n\nThe above articles are as per enclosed illustrations from Eaton's Catalogue.\n\nHoping that you will give the above your favourable consideration, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6277, file 584-5, part 9)\nOttawa,\nOctober 2, 1941.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo making a request for certain expenditures at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nIt has been decided to request the Purchasing Agent to secure the lumber required for enlarging the garage.\n\nIn the appropriation for the current fiscal year an amount of $500.00 was provided for repairs and improvements at the Sandy Bay School. We have already expended an amount of $45.00 for repairing the water tank which leaves a balance of $455.00. Recently we have been in correspondence with you regarding the request of the Principal for linoleum and this matter has not yet been settled.\n\nPurchase of the material for the garage will involve considerable expenditure and consequently until we receive a reply to official letter of September 25 we will not be able to consider any further expenditures at the Sandy Bay School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nWINNIPEG, October 3, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn September the 19th last I wrote you in connection with providing linoleum for the Chapel of the Sandy Bay Indian Res. School. A few days after making this request I received a letter from the Principal of the above School in which he made demands which he considers are of a more pressing need than the supplying of a linoleum for the School Chapel. Consequently I wrote you on September the 27th about these demands.\n\nThere is no doubt in my mind that the School can get along without linoleum on the Chapel floor and that the building of an ice house and the enlarging of the truck garage are more urgent so I would ask you to overlook the Principal's demand for linoleum and accede to his other requests, if it is at all possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I thank you, dear Sir, for those articles which are to come.\n\nI am asking myself if you understood in my previous letter, the matter concerning the primary class which we opened this year? We have absolutely nothing at all to furnish this apartment, no desks, no blackboards no shades etc. At the present time the teacher teaches to 30 pupils and it is very inconvenient for both teacher & pupils. If the Department could provide us without too much loss.\n\nI am sending you a sample of inkwells as I am not sure of the manufacturer of the desks. I find but those letters A. S. Co. Some are marked No 2 and 13 are required, No. 3 IO are required. Others No 4 7 are required, which equals to 30 desks in the class room.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The hand equipment was also checked and I requested the Principal to purchase refills. The account will be forwarded to the Department when purchase has been made. There are two standards that should be cut and made ready for use in the case of an emergency. One hose should be replaced. It has been in the school for fifteen years. The requirements in material to complete the work are as follows:\n\n1-\"Y\" 50 ft. 1\u00bd inch hose (cotton) 1- nozzle.\n1- 2 inch \"T\", 1- 2 inch \"Y\", 1- 2 inch coupling, brass lined, 50 ft. cotton hose 2 inch, 1- nozzle.\n50 ft. of 2 inch cotton hose.\n1- \"Y\" 1\u00bd inch, 50 ft. 1\u00bd inch cotton hose.\n\nI would also recommend the purchase of a 40 foot extension ladder at an approximate cost of $32.00.\n\nThe barn is also in need of repairs before the severe weather sets in. Material requirements were checked and are set out below:\n\n20- pos. 2 X 12 - 12, 1000 ft. 2 X 10 - 10, 75-pos.\n2 X 4 - 12, 20-pos. 2 X 6 - 10, 500 ft. spruce sheeting.\n\nThe school staff will do the work on the hose standards etc., and repair the barn without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 25, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant with reference to additional fire equipment which you consider necessary at the Sandy Bay School. The Department is not exactly certain what you want as you show in two places 50' of 2\" cotton hose and also in two places 50' of 1\u00bd\" cotton hose. Was this duplication or do you want 100' of each width of hose?\n\nAs you have previously been informed, an amount of $500.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Sandy Bay School. We have already expended over $492.00. Under these circumstances the material for the barn and the new ladder cannot be authorized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSANDY BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nMARIUS, P. O. MAN.\n\n17th Nov. 1941.\n\nMR. J. WAITE.\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nThe Batteries of our Electric Plant are about run down. 3 out of 56 cells have been discarded and some more will be put aside before long.\n\nHad the Electric Plant been used for the work it had to do, when bought (Dec. 1938) i.e., lighting a building of 100-30, it would be good yet.\n\nYou know in 1939, two wings have been built; one 34-60 the other 34-60. Our Electric Plant had to light these #2 buildings, to pump 1800 gals. of water every day, to pump the returned water of the heating system, in winter, which requires in the first case a motor of 2 H. P. in the second a motor of three fourth H. P., both motors running 4 hours a day, in winter.\n\nConsidering the additional work done by our Batteries, they have done well to stand this length of time. It will be 3 years next January.\n\nI would have asked you, at the time of your recent visit, if I had not written Rev. Father Plourde. The very day of your departure, I received Father Plourde's answer telling me to ask through the Indian Agent.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO. Chagnon, O.M.S.\nPrincipal.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nNovember 20, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose, herewith, a letter received yesterday from the Reverend Principal, Sandy Bay Residential School. The letter is self explanatory and is a request for new batteries for the electric plant. This matter was not brought to my attention at the time of my recent visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nDecember 1, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the batteries at the Sandy Bay Residential School. Our records indicate that these batteries were supplied less than three years ago. It is difficult to understand why they have been allowed to deteriorate to such an extent that the Principal claims they should now be replaced. No funds were provided in our current year's appropriation for the replacement of these batteries and under these circumstances the school will have to do the best they can with the present set of batteries until after next April.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nSir,\n\nI wish to advise that two boys, sons of Mr. Cahill, Farm Instructor, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School are being employed as night watchmen alternate weeks. The boys are twins sixteen and a half years of age, named Joseph and Endore Cahill.\n\nTheir work is entirely satisfactory, but they appear to me too young for work of this nature.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nDecember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 20th ultimo with reference to the employment of Joseph and Endore Cahill as night watchmen at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nI will discuss this matter with Rev. J.O. Plourde, C.M.I., who is in Ottawa at the present time, and I will write to you later.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.

HOEY.\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th referring to my 2 16\u00bd yrs. old watchmen. Although young, they are performing their work better than the ones I had before. They keep awake, make their round on time, report any unusual thing, if any, on the morning. These boys' father is my mechanic at the school; they work with their father, and are very quick to learn.\n\nBesides watching, the watchman has to fire the heating plant, at night, see that the motor operating the vacuum and the one operating the water pump, work properly.\n\nThe reason I have chosen these boys is, I would have no house for a married man, an unmarried man would have to pay his board out of his $40.00 salary. My 2 boys (nearly 17 yrs. old now) are young, but if youth is a fault it is a fault that one can get rid of every day.\n\nWishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, I remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO.

There are no fittings attached to them. The nozzles and couplings of the old one can be used, but I have no tools to put them on, both hoses and fittings will have to be sent to somebody equipped with tools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO. Cochran.\nPrincipal.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJanuary 30,\n1942.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attached letter was received from the Reverend Principal of the Sandy Bay School and is self-explanatory.\n\nWill you please advise in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nEnclos.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 3, 1942.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI desire to refer to purchase order No. 10355 of December 12, 1941, ordering 100' of fire hose 3\" and 100' of fire hose 1\u00bd\" for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. In a letter just received from the Principal of this school he states that he has only received 3-50' lengths of hose.\n\nI realize that it is difficult to obtain this hose at the present time but I would like to know if it is your intention to ship the other 50' later or does 150' constitute the total amount that you can supply at present?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCharles Niedner's Sons,\nCoaticook, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the hose ordered for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. In your letter of December 5 you requested 100' of 2\" cotton hose and 100' of 1\u00bd\" cotton hose. An order for this amount was placed with Charles Niedner's Sons, Gatineau, Que. Apparently they have only shipped 150'. I am writing to the firm with a view to ascertaining if it is their intention to supply the other 50'. I might point out that the demand for hose for overseas is extremely heavy and as a consequence it is very difficult to obtain this article. You will, therefore, realize that if the additional 50' is not forwarded to the Sandy Bay School it is due to circumstances beyond our control.\n\nYou may arrange for fitting the old nozzles and couplings to the new hose. The cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.

He has performed his work conscientiously, he is a careful driver. Ruest has married last June, and his $40.00 a month is not enough. With the scarcity of men, due to military service, our truck driver can earn more by working for farmers. A raise of $10.00 a month would satisfy him. I wish you allow the raise, if possible.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO. Chagnon\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 11, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant requesting an increase in the allowance made toward the salary of the man hauling water at the Sandy Bay School.\n\nThe amount allowed is all that is provided in the current year's appropriation and consequently cannot be increased. As a matter of fact, it was never intended that we should pay a salary for this work but simply make an allowance toward its cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hesey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev.

Chagnon, O.M.I., Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School and makes request for a set of new batteries at the school.\n\nThe remark in the third paragraph refers to your letter to this office of December 1st 1941, file 126-9-5.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nEnclos.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant enclosing communication from the Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School with reference to his request for a new set of batteries. In regard to this request I would again refer you to my letter of December 1, 1941. I expect considerable difficulty in securing approval for the purchase of a new set of batteries for this school, in view of the fact that the present batteries have only been in use for three years. It appears from the Principal's letters that the batteries have been overworked and no doubt this is the reason for the necessity for new batteries at the present time.\n\nBefore submitting the matter to the Purchasing Branch, I will require a definite statement from the Principal showing in what manner he intends to handle the services at the school in future in order to avoid such rapid deterioration of the batteries. It is increasingly difficult to even obtain batteries at the present time and this condition may exist for some years. Even in the best of times it is impossible for the Department to consider replacing batteries every three years.\n\nIn his last letter the Principal states that he has received a quotation from the Globalite Batteries Limited of Winnipeg in which they state that set No. 17 is the most suitable for the Sandy Bay School. This information is not sufficiently clear for our purposes. We will have to have detailed information regarding\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nthe size of battery that is needed and in supplying this it should be distinctly understood that in the event of the Department purchasing new batteries they will only be used for lighting purposes.\n\nAs the end of the fiscal year is rapidly approaching, an immediate reply to this letter is expected.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMarch 28, 1942.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe had a brief visit yesterday from the Priest in charge of Sandy Lake Residential School at Marius, Manitoba, and we supplied this gentleman with certain information which he desired concerning one of our 56-cell type W-17 batteries which they would like to purchase.\n\nWhen one of our service men during his regular travels called at this school last fall, he found that our battery which was in service there was practically ruined due to it being extremely overworked. The battery in question was one of type W-11, 210 A.H. capacity, 3 years old. On checking the load at this installation, our representative found that they should have a battery of more than double this capacity, namely our type W-21 of 450 A.H. On further investigation, our representative found that their present plant will not properly charge a battery of a greater capacity than our type W-17, 560 A.H. There was no doubt but that the installation in the first place was too small, even before the 2 new wings were added to the building.\n\nAfter thorough investigation, we find that the only suitable and correct recommendation for this school is that they purchase our 56-cell, type W-17, 560 A.H. battery. The Priest in charge of this school, as well as the mechanic who looks after the plant, have definitely assured us that they can and will, discontinue taking service from the new battery for the operation of 2 pumps. These 2 pumps had a drain of about 80 amperes per day from the battery and we are greatly surprised that they even got 3 year's service out of their present battery which is only of 210 A.H. capacity. With the elimination of these 2 pumps, we are quite prepared to guarantee our 56 cell, type W-17, 560 A.H. battery for a period of 7 years.\n\nWe trust you will not object to us writing you as above, as we felt it was our duty to give you this information. Any further information you desire will be gladly supplied upon request, and assuring you of our best cooperation at all times, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED,\n\nThos.W.Wells,\nVice-Pres. & Gen.

P. O. MAN.\n\nMarch 27th 1942.\n\nMr. J. Waite.\nIndian Agent.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nConsidering our IO H. P. Diesel engine and 6 Kilowatt Generator, Mr. Thom. W. Wells, Manager of the Globelite Batteries Limited of Winnipeg, suggests Batteries No. WI7, as described on his letter, would be suitable for our school. No. WI7 generates 360 ampere hour, while our used battery generator only 210.\n\nTo the question \"in what manner the Principal intends to handle the service at the school, in the event of the Department supplying new batteries?\" my answer is: I will use new batteries only for lighting purposes. By eliminating the 1\u00bd H. P. motor returning water to the heating boiler and the \u00be H. P. motor pumping the daily supply of water, the batteries will be greatly relieved.\n\nBut as the IO H. P. Diesel is at one end of the school and the pumps at the other end, we will have to provide a new source of power. A 3 H. P. gas engine with the usual paraphernalia of pulleys, belts, counter-shafts, brackets will have to be supplied.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nO.

Subsequent to that time the building was enlarged and the supplying of additional lighting was an extra drain on the batteries. In addition, it appears that the batteries have been used to operate the motor returning the water to the heating boiler.\n\nSince first receiving the request for a new set of batteries we have had considerable correspondence with the Principal of the school. In the meantime, he has also interviewed the Globelite Batteries Limited. For your information I attach copy of a letter received from the Globelite Batteries. I also enclose a copy of a letter dated March 27 received from the Principal of the Sandy Bay School in which he indicates that the new batteries will only be used for lighting purposes. Consequently, if they are properly looked after, we should be assured of a reasonably long life for them.\n\nR.A.

The covering should be AA quality.\n\nIf funds are available, I would recommend this expenditure as it will lessen greatly the work now necessary to keep the school clean.\n\nBattleship linoleum is difficult to get but Robinson, Little & Co. have the AA quality in brown at $2.03 per sq yd., and in green at $2.27 per sq. yd.

The desks then in use were certainly most antiquated and hardly suitable for the purpose. The fact that the former Principal was satisfied with peaks well in his favor, but does not solve the needs of this up-to-date school. A new desk could be had, I understand for about $45.00.\n\nMay I expect your favorable consideration of this modest request,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Marius, Man.\nMarch 6th, 1943\n\nDear Mr Phelan;\n\nReceived yesterday yours of the 27th February, with invoices attached to it. The invoices are not for the ice-house lumber, but for the poultry-house built last fall, in which I have now 150 hens, and the children are eating eggs....without this new poultry-house I would not have been able to supply them with eggs, at least once in a while.\n\nMost of the expenses were paid by the School, at the exception though of the wages paid lately, and one set of invoices paid to Toupin Lumber in St Boniface.\n\nTherefore these two sets of invoices are re:poultry-house (one of $121.55 and the other of $160.58). A third one was returned to me by Rev. Father Plourde O.M.I. towards the end of January ($282.13).\n\nIn reference now of the letter of the 1st February with the purchase order re: ice-house.\n\nI have put in the order to Mr Kippan as soon as I got the permission from your Department, but received no word yet from Mr. Kippan. Last Fall he had promised me that he would supply me the lumber for the said ice-house. But at this time of the year, it is impossible to get in the lumber because of the roads closed, it will take yet a few weeks or so before we can managed to get out or in with a truck and even with the car.\n\nAs soon as I get a reply from Mr Kippan, I'll write again to let you know.\n\nI am attaching these invoices again, hoping that the Department will reconsider them again.\n\nI remain yours very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFather J.

I note that these were incurred in connection with the erection of the poultry house. You will recall that the Department has already allowed an amount of $380.50 toward the cost of the labour in erecting this building and when we paid that account it was understood that the material was being supplied by the school. However, I am recommending to the Departmental Purchasing Agent that the account of $121.55 be paid and I trust that the necessary approval will be obtained. It will not be possible to consider payment of the attached account amounting to $160.55.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.

Mr. O. Cahill on his way to Winnipeg has stopped at your Office asking to have the truck repaired...it was really impossible to wait any longer, otherwise great damage would have probably happened to it. It was not in a good shape at all, and it couldn't be otherwise with the roads we had last winter.\n\nI firmly hope that the Department of Indian Affairs will accept to pay the repairs of the TRUCK.\n\nI remain yours very Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFather J. Lemire, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nDear Sir,\n\nI would like very much to put in a request for paint...because our hen-house and ice-house have no paint on yet...and also many places also should be refreshed....\n\nTherefore I would be very obliged if you could put in to the Department of Indian Affairs:\n\nLinseed-Oil ............ 45 gallons\nWhite lead ............. 400 lbs\nTurpentine.............. 10 gallons.\n\nI remain yours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFather J. Lemire, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nDear Sir;\n\nLast winter we had lot of trouble for hauling water...practically no road...our grade going from School to the lake is far too low. That grade-road should be lifted up of atleast a foot and one half. Otherwise the Truck has to go through the snow...which is very hard on the truck itself,and we had to have it fixed last week in Winnipeg.\n\nMany of times after the beginning of the month of January we were out of water...and for this reason I had the boys and girls go to the outside toilets...which is unfare specially towards the girls....but it was impossible to do otherwise...But I believe possible to remediate to that by having the road lifted up...........the estimate is about $300.00 Of course calvets (3) are included in,on that amount.\n\nThe man,haling water,tried surely very hard to get in water....but simply it couldn't be done.\n\nI hope that the Department will consider favorably this urgent request,and that we could go on right away to the work,because now the time are proper now to go on....later it might and surely will cost lot more,I believe.\n\nI remain yours very truly,\n\nFather J.Lemire,U.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you know we have made little emergency repairs to our Diesel engine 600 RPM lately. But not later than Fall we will need to repair it again...it will be impossible to take another winter with this Diesel in the shape she is now. She has given service close to 5 years, with an average of 1/4 hours a day.\n\nWith the permission of Mr Russell I got a quotation which you will find on a separate sheet from Mumford Medland Limited.\n\nI hope that the Department will agree to that demand.\n\nOn the same letter you will find a quotation also on a Wisconsin air cooled engine to pump water from the Lake into the tank...Our engine is out of order and have been repaired many of times; she has given service over fifteen years in many different ways...\n\nI do believe that it will not be exaggerated to have a new one...and a air-cooled one is preferable because it is less exposed specially in winter with the cold weather.\n\nOf course I would ask to have the pump with it being about in the same condition as the engine, even in a worst condition....the quotation price would be between $30 or $35.00\n\nI remain yours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFather J. Lemire, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. J. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nReference to Department letter of March 13th 1942, I wish to report that considerable drain is effected on the batteries at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School by a small electric motor of \u00bc H.P. running a water system and a \u00bd H.P. motor running a furnace vacuum system. Both motors operate from the batteries which necessitates running of the Lister engine 15 to 18 hours per day during the winter months and 3 to 4 hours per day during the summer months. This continual drain on the batteries causes corrosion and sediment on the plates and the batteries will not last long under this pressure.\n\nI would recommend that a 3 H.P. engine be purchased for operating the two pump engines.\n\nI also enclose letters from the Principal asking for various repairs for the school.\n\nRepairs will also be necessary to the arch in the fire box of the laundry boiler and to the arch and heating system of the heating boiler. This will be covered in the boiler Inspector's report. As soon as this report is received an expert will be asked to give prices on the work necessary and the cost of same will be forwarded to the Department. These repairs cannot be carried out by the school staff.\n\nIndian Agent.\nJuly 21, 1943.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are making some repairs to a small Converter, used by\nthe Indian School, at Sandy Bay, Manitoba.\n\nThere are a few parts, which we find it necessary to order\nfrom Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.\n\nThe company we ordered the parts from, will not ship them\nto us unless we supply them with a Priority rating and number.\n\nWe hope you can supply us with a rating and number in order\nto obtain the parts we require.\n\nAny other information can be obtained from the School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nWILSON AUTO ELECTRIC\n\nBy: [Signature]\n\nDN/D\nOttawa,\nJuly 27, 1943.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, enclosing letters received from the Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School regarding the repairs and improvements that he considers are necessary this year. A review of these letters indicates that the Principal requests the following:\n\n1. Repairs to Diesel engine .................. $220.00\n2. 3 H.P. engine ..................... $75.00 to $100.00\n3. A.B. Wisconsin engine to pump water ...... $146.00\n4. Road repairs ................................ $300.00\n\nIn the current year's appropriation an amount of $500.00 was provided for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at this school. We have already spent approximately $48.00 of this amount -- see your voucher N 149 of May 28. I wish you would review these requests again with the Principal and ascertain which of them he really requires, keeping in mind that the total cost must be kept within the amount provided.\n\nIn connection with the quotation from Mumford Medland or $146.00 for an A.B. Wisconsin engine, they refer to an illustrated leaflet. This was not forwarded. In the event of our deciding to purchase the engine, it will be necessary for us to have the leaflet, in order that we can submit it to the Purchasing Branch.\nWe are also in receipt of a letter from the Wilson Auto Electric Company, 242 Main Street, Winnipeg, requesting a priority for repairs to a converter at the Sandy Bay Residential School. Our Purchasing Branch does not issue such priorities but, if a list of the repairs required is sent to this office, we will endeavour to have the order placed through the Purchasing Branch. It would be appreciated if you would inform both the Principal and the Wilson Auto Electric Company accordingly.\n\nI am returning herewith your voucher No. N 199. This was issued in favour of Dominion Motors Limited. The account which you attach to the voucher shows that payment has already been made to the firm by the Principal of the school and it would, therefore, appear that the voucher should have been issued in favour of the Principal.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nAugust 4, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Dept.

Repairs to Diesel engine $220.00\n2. 3 H.P. engine $75.00 to $100.00\n3. A.B. Wisconsin engine to pump water $146.00\n\nThe Medland A.B.

Wisconsin. We have lower quotations than Mumford Medland's price of $146.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg on this type of engine, but with a lower operating speed, namely, 800 R.P.M. We understand that the Wisconsin engine operates at a much higher rate. Could we have the leaflet describing it, asked for in my memorandum of the 19th ultimo, to compare with specifications of other engines quoted on.\n\n(b) Gasoline engine for pumping water from the lake:\n\nThe leaflet you sent us describes this engine as a 2.06 H.P. Lawson, air cooled, etc. The unit consists of this engine with London self priming centrifugal pump, complete with suction hose and strainer.\n\nPlease advise if the school authorities have a suitable pump, or if it is necessary to supply the complete unit, including the new pump which costs $41.00 extra.\n\nH. F. Davidson,\nDept. Purchasing Agent.\nOttawa, September 11, 1943.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn response to a letter received from Indian Agent Waite, we requested the Purchasing Branch to secure the repair parts for the Diesel engine and they placed an order with Mumford, Medland, Limited, of Winnipeg. A copy of this order was forwarded to you on August 25. I am now in receipt of a letter dated September 7, in which Mumford, Medland, Limited write as follows:\n\n\"We acknowledge and thank you for your order No. 12877 covering repairs for Lister Diesel engine in operation at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Man.\n\n\"We are sorry to advise, however, that we do not have these repairs in stock. We have, however, applied for Essentiality Certificate from Ottawa, in order that we may obtain them from our factory in England.\n\n\"We trust this will meet with your approval.\"\n\nIt would appear that it will be some time before these repair parts will be available. Are there any other parts that we can secure, locally, which would help you in the meantime?\n\nRegarding the two gasoline engines requested by you, I enclose a copy of a memorandum received from the Departmental Purchasing Agent.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou are sufficiently acquainted with the conditions that prevail at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School to be spared a long description of the trouble which we are having with the water supply.\n\nBut in case the officials of the department are not all as well informed as you are, I might say that the school is now obliged to haul all of the water necessary for various services by truck from the lake. Owing to the swampy lake approach directly opposite the school, we have to go two and a half miles for this supply. There is no regular road leading to the lake, and in rainy weather and in the winter when there are large snowdrifts, the work involved is not only very costly but is also very strenuous. In fact there are days during the winter when the school is without a sufficient quantity of water either for sanitary services or fire protection. It is true that the two wings of the school are fireproof, but the central section is of wood construction, and very inflammable on account of its age.\n\nWould it be possible to include in the forthcoming estimates a sum sufficient to insure a regular water supply. If, however, due to war conditions this is found impossible, I hope that you will at least provide for this essential service early in the postwar period.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

New storehouse\n2. New icehouse\n3. New chicken house\n\nAll these buildings are finished with spruce lumber and should be painted. Spruce lumber is bad to shrink and unless painted the boards will dry apart. I hope funds are available to provide the necessary paint.\n\nThe main barn is in bad condition. This barn is very old and past repairing. The frame is rotted and the upstairs floor is unsafe to walk on, as many of the boards have rotted through. A new barn should be allowed as soon as funds can be made available.\nNovember 5th, 1943.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nAttention: Mr. R.A. Hoey\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nThe present barn of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School was erected about thirty years ago, and is now in a very unsatisfactory condition; so much so, that the Principal is always in fear that the milk supplied to the children will be so contaminated that it will be a danger to their health. There is nothing modern in any sense of the word about the building, and the Principal has asked me to place before you a request for the building material necessary to erect a new barn.\n\nThe enclosed list was prepared by a competent builder, and is sufficient to erect a barn 120 feet long by 30 feet wide. I am informed that the lumber is available at the present time, and for prices quoted on the enclosed list. The total expenditure for this material would be $359. If the Department will supply the above, the Oblate Order will undertake to furnish all the labour free of charge.\n\nAs there has been some complaints in the past that these agreements were not always lived up to, that the amounts asked for were often insufficient, and that further demands had to be made on the Department, the Oblate Order is willing to give a formal undertaking to the Department to the effect that they will erect the barn complete, and not ask the Department for additional funds for materials or labour.\n\nWould you please advise me as soon as possible if this offer is acceptable, as the School may not be able to secure the necessary material if the order for it is not placed in the immediate future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We found, however, that this anti-freeze is put up in six-gallon containers. Consequently we ordered for the Principal of the school six gallons instead of five gallons. The unit price of this is $1.7189 and the total cost of six gallons is $10.26, plus sales tax. When the invoice covering the cost of the Prestone is received it will be forwarded to the Principal and it would be appreciated if he would make out the cheque direct to the company.\n\nR.A.

With the advent of the depression it was found impossible to appropriate any funds for this purpose.\n\nIf the Sandy Bay barn was unsatisfactory and unsanitary in 1926, you may judge for yourself what its condition now must be. Its replacement is considered by the Principal as absolutely necessary, especially in view of the fact that he cannot at the present time keep a sufficient number of milk cows to provide enough milk for the children of the school. As it is now recognized that milk is an essential part of the diet of children and that our Indian children particularly benefit by it, the Principal hopes that his request will be granted.\n\nTo provide milk and butter for the children, at least twenty cows in milk must be kept, and the necessary number of heifers must also be provided for replacement.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nJune 29, 1944.\n\nThe roofs of the two additions to the Sandy Bay Residential School require immediate repairs and some repairs will also have to be made to the plaster in the dormitories where plaster has been damaged by the leaking roofs. The annexes were built, I believe, in 1938, the roofs appear to be of cement, tar-paper and tar, sanded. Last year the chimney was struck by lightning and the roof of the north annex damaged. The roof was repaired by Mr. Davis of Portage la Prairie, but it seems that the damage was more extensive than at first seen. I was at the school during a very heavy rain on the 27th. Water came through the ceiling of the north annex causing serious damage to the plaster and seeping through the cement floor of the dormitory to the chapel below. The roof of the south annex also leaked, not to the same extent, but the roof will have to be repaired.\n\nThe Reverend Principal suggests that Mr. P. Desrosiers, 542 Dullard Blvd., St. Boniface, who built the annex be employed to do the repair as he would know more about the roof construction than any other person. It is impossible to estimate the cost of the repairs but there is no doubt they will be expensive and should be done without delay.\n\nJ.

The annexes were built, I believe, in 1926, the roofs appear to be of cement, tar-paper and tar, sanded. Last year the chimney was struck by lightning and the roof of the north annex damaged. The roof was repaired by Mr. Davis of Portage la Prairie, but it seems that the damage was more extensive than at first seen. I was at the school during a very heavy rain on the 27th. Water came through the ceiling of the north annex causing serious damage to the plaster and seeping through the cement floor of the dormitory to the chapel below. The roof of the south annex also leaked, not to the same extent, but the roof will have to be repaired.\"\n\nIt appears from the above that this roof should be repaired this summer and it would be appreciated if you would have one of your officials visit the Sandy Bay School, examine the roof and submit a report as soon as possible. I understand that the Sandy Bay School can be reached from Winnipeg, by car, in about three hours.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 10, 1944.\n\nMr. J. White, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding the roof of the Sandy Bay Residential School, the Surveys and Engineering Branch have been requested to have one of their officials visit this school in the near future and examine the roof and submit a report as soon as possible regarding the repairs he considers necessary.\n\nYou should so advise the Principal of the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPost Office Bldg.,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhile making an inspection of the Heating Boiler in the Indian School, Marius, the school principal informed me that it was proposed to install a gasoline motor to replace the 2 H.P. Electric motor which drives the Vacuum Pump.\n\nI do not think it is advisable to make this change because the Vacuum Pump requires to be automatic to keep a given vacuum on the return line of the heating system, and also to force condensate back into the boiler. It would be very difficult to operate a gasoline engine so that a steady vacuum could be maintained and condensate tank empty. Instead of making this change, I would recommend that an inspection be made of the return lines. It may be possible to make a few changes and convert the system to a gravity return, but if this change is made, it will increase the cost of heating the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nD. Carnegie.\nInspector.\n\nDG/DD\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJuly 11, 1944.\n\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to enclose a letter received from Mr. D. Carnegie, boiler Inspector of the Dept. of Labour, in connection with the heating system, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School. The letter is self explanatory, but the system at the school is so complicated that I cannot give the Department any further information than the letter contains. I would suggest that an engineer be authorized to give advice in this matter.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nCopy sent to Mr. Waite\n\nOttawa,\nJuly 17, 1944.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nIndian Agent Waite has forwarded the attached letter which he has received from the Boiler Inspector.\n\nIn view of the Inspector's recommendation I think it would be inadvisable to install the gasoline motor.\n\nMr. Waite has suggested that an engineer be authorized to examine the heating plant and give advice.

A chimney in this roof area was struck by lightning last year, at which time damage may have been caused to the roof deck below the roof covering. The extent of such damage cannot be determined until the existing roof covering is removed.\n\nOn the southerly wing Mr. Storsater considers that the roof could be made watertight by repairs to the existing felt and gravel roof covering, and by resetting and repairing metal flashings.\n\nMr. Storsater states that damage to the plaster in dormitory walls and ceilings is negligible except for some discolouration.\n\nFor materials and labour alone Mr. Storsater estimates an expenditure of approximately $854.00 will be required. This amount makes no allowance for contingencies, repairs to the roof decks if required, nor for supervision. To cover the whole work including the last named items, it is believed approximately $1000.00 will be required.\n\nIf the work is approved, competitive tenders should be invited from competent roofers in the area, to confirm Mr. Storsater's estimate.\n\nWith reference to your notation dated July 24th on Dr. McGill's memorandum of the 20th ultimo in (over)\n\nJ.

It is possible that such a bond was secured by Les Reverends Peres Oblats, Manitoba, and if so, the Bonding Company is responsible for making good any defects in the roof in the way of materials or workmanship and it should be required to do so. This would not apply to any damage to the roof that may have been caused by the chimney falling after having been struck by lightning.\n\nIf no such bond was secured we would recommend that the roof be repaired as soon as possible, and our Engineering and Construction Service will make the necessary arrangements if desired, in which case $1,000 should be transferred to that Service for the purpose.\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH DEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nOTTAWA ONT= 0430\n\nPRINCIPAL SANDY BAY SCHOOL PERTURBED CONCERNING ROOF CLAIMS\nREPAIRS SHOULD BE MADE IMMEDIATELY=\nJ WAITE INDIAN AGT=\nOttawa, August 23, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY,\n\nPlease transfer the amount of $1,000.00 to the Surveys & Engineering Branch, in order that they may carry out necessary repairs to the roof of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, August 23, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of August 17, with reference to the repairs required to the roof of the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.

Under these circumstances condensate could not be returned to the boiler by gravity and an electrically operated, automatically controlled vacuum pump was installed. The pump is operated by a 3 hp. motor on current supplied by the storage batteries of the school power plant. It is reported by Mr. Gow that during the heating period, or for eight months of the year, the vacuum pump imposes a heavy drain on the electrical system and that the school authorities had purchased, and proposed to install, a gasoline engine to operate the vacuum pump and remove the load from the power plant.\n\nAs no lag should be permitted in the ejection of condensate from the heating return lines, and since the construction of the heating system did not permit gravity action, automatic control is imperative. This could not be provided satisfactorily by engine operation of the vacuum pump and the school officers were so advised by Mr. D. Carnegie, Boiler Inspector for the Manitoba Department of Labour, on his last visit to the school. The Boiler Inspector suggested to the School Principal and the Indian Agent the alternative of converting the system to gravity return by means of changes to the radiators and return lines.\n\nIn a letter to this Service dated August 30, 1944 Mr. Gow advised that there was nothing wrong with the heating plant so far as heating the building was concerned; that it would be impractical to have a man giving constant attention to a gas engine on the vacuum pump; and that it would appear necessary to continue the use of the motor with the vacuum pump unless the system was changed to gravity return by\n\nJv.

(RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part II)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nraising all radiators and their return lines.\n\nWe have no drawings or specifications of the heating system at the school, and without a complete survey by a heating engineer we cannot offer an opinion as to whether the necessary changes are possible. The installation of a gravity return for condensate would demand dis-connection of all heating mains, radiators piping, the installation of wall or ceiling type radiators and possible complete remodelling of the boiler room to provide a pit for the boiler. The operation would be costly and very inconvenient.\n\nSince the cause for complaint is the load imposed on the electrical system, it appears to this Service more reasonable to increase the supply of electrical energy than to attempt to return condensate by gravity in a system designed for vacuum operation.\n\nWe have no information regarding how serious the drain on electrical equipment may be, but no break-down has been reported, and it is recommended that, before considering alterations to the heating system, an inspection of the power plant should be carried out and a report obtained covering the definite needs of the school, the capacity of the plant and the total connected load.\n\nT. B. MILLS,\nChief Engineer.\nOctober 10th, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Heating System, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Amaranth, Manitoba.\n\nWith reference to your memoranda of July 20th and September 8th last, regarding the efficiency of the returning lines of the above heating system, I am enclosing herewith, a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated October 4th, which outlines the present situation.\n\nYou will note that the return of the condensed steam to the boilers is obtained through the operation of a 2 H.P. motor, and which, during the heating period, imposes a heavy load on the electrical system. A possible remedy would be to increase the capacity of the electric plant, but action along these lines would not be advisable or possible until an inspection of the power plant had been made.\n\nThe suggestion that the return might be converted to a gravity system is not favoured by our engineers, since it would be costly and very inconvenient because of the location of the boilers and radiators.\n\nIt will be noted that according to Mr. Gow, the School authorities had purchased and propose to install a gasoline engine to operate the vacuum pump, but this would not be satisfactory since it would involve frequent attention to the operation of the gasoline engine.\n\n(over)........\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Heating system and power plant,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nAmiskwachewan, Manitoba.\n\nI desire to acknowledge, with thanks,\nreceipt of your report on the above noted subject.\n\nIt would be appreciated by this Branch\nif you could undertake an inspection of the power\nplant now installed at the school, as suggested by\nMr. Mills in his memorandum to you of October 4, 1944.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sept. 30 | To Allowance towards salary of man driving truck which transports water at the Sandy Bay School for the month of October 1944. | 40.00  |\n\n**Code:** 20-0101\n\n---\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

In this connection I would refer you to your memorandum of August 30, 1944. It would be appreciated if you would issue purchase order so that the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 584-76-09-613.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nNovember 21, 1944\n\nRE: SANDY BAY RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nAMARANTH, MANITOBA.\n\nWith reference to your Memorandum of October 17th last with which you forwarded a copy of Dr. McGill's Memorandum to you dated the 13th ultimo requesting an inspection of the electrical power plant at the above, you are advised that we are now in receipt of a report from Mr. Gow covering an inspection carried out by Mr. W.H.Wallace of his staff.\n\nIn previous memoranda on the matter, it has been pointed out that the heating system at the school is working satisfactorily and that the only cause for complaint appears to be the drain on the storage battery unit produced by the operation of the vacuum pump of the heating system. This pump maintains a partial vacuum on the heating return lines for heat distribution and also returns condensate to the boiler. Operation is automatically controlled.\n\nThe report has been examined and may be briefly summarized as follows:\n\nFrom the inspection of the electrical installation and information supplied by the school authorities, it is not considered possible to eliminate any portion of the total connected load. The capacity of the plant appears to be sufficient to meet existing requirements. The periods during which the generator is being operated, however, appear to have been irregular, and possibly the battery has been heavily discharged at times but, when inspected, seemed to be in good condition. It was purchased in May 1942 and was guaranteed for seven years. Mr. Wallace reports that more efficient operation, with less wear on the battery, could be obtained by continuous operation of the generator during the periods of high lighting loads necessary in the morning and evening with the battery floating and the generator continued on line for the length of time required to fully recharge the battery. The generator, under these circumstances, would be running from 8 to 12 hours daily during the winter, but this is not considered abnormal.\n\nJ.M.Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\nRegarding the effect of the vacuum pump motor on the electrical system, in maintaining vacuum the motor automatically cuts in about every hour and runs for ten minutes. In returning condensate to the boiler, it cuts in every two minutes and operates for one and one-half minutes. The intermittent starting loads thus produced can be taken care of by the generator while in operation, but at other times create a considerable load on the battery. In this connection the following excerpt from Mr. Wallace's report is quoted:\n\n\"This might be overcome, to some extent, by cutting out the vacuum control switch during the night, (battery operation period,) and allowing the pump to operate only on the float switch to return condensate from the accumulator tank to the boiler. If the heating system was installed for vacuum pump operation, the total elimination of the use of the pump for this purpose would seriously affect the efficiency of the system, and not be advisable. However, some consideration might be given to the elimination of the vacuum control during the night when the matter of uniform temperature might not be considered important and when weather conditions are not severe. It is essential that careful operation be maintained in order that the electrical plants with the available capacity function satisfactorily, and such operation, as pointed out above, would appreciably lessen drain upon the battery. If, however, it is desired to give more freedom as to operating times of the generator, another battery of the same type and capacity should be connected in parallel.\"\n\nWith regard to the suggestions advanced by Mr. Wallace in his report, our architect has discussed the matter of eliminating vacuum control during certain periods with the Ottawa representative of the Dunham Company who supplied the vacuum pump. We are advised that the pump, (Catalogue VR-10,) is designed for use as suggested by Mr. Wallace. The result would be slightly reduced temperatures at the extremes of the supply lines while the automatic vacuum control was not operating.\n\nIt is recommended, therefore, that until its effect can be observed, the Indian Affairs Branch arrange for operation of the power plant by the school authorities, as follows:\n\na. During the periods when high lighting loads are required, the generator be operated on line and the battery floating, while being re-charged. Careful observation will be necessary to ensure that the battery is not overcharged.\n\nb. That during the night, at such times as weather conditions permit, the vacuum control feature of the pump be switched off.\nIt is considered that the recommended procedure should eliminate the danger of exhausting the battery charge, but it is suggested that, after instructions have been issued, observations of the results obtained be reported to this office.\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\nNovember 23rd, 1944.\n\nDr. McGill\n\nAs requested in your memorandum of the 18th instant an inspection of the power plant now installed at Sandy Bay Indian Residential School has been made by Mr. W.H.Wallace, an Engineer on Mr. Gow's staff at Winnipeg, and I am forwarding herewith a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated November 21st, 1944, in which he summarizes Mr. Wallace's report and quotes certain sections of it.\n\nYou will note that there seems nothing seriously wrong with the power installation at this school provided steps are taken to reduce the load on the storage battery unit as much as possible. In this connection will you kindly note recommendations a. and b. that are made towards the end of Mr. Mills' memorandum. There would seem to be no difficulty in having these put into effect immediately.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nOttawa, November 21, 1944.\n\nRe: Roof Repairs, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, near Amaranth, Manitoba\n\nIn accordance with authority furnished by your notation dated October 5th last, in reply to our memorandum of the 2nd ultimo, you are advised that the repairs have been completed on the roof of the above, and the work has been accepted by Mr. Gow as satisfactory.\n\nFunds to the amount of $1,000 were provided by the Indian Affairs Branch for these repairs.

Je suppose toutefois que c'est exact.\nMarius, Manitoba,\nNovember 30, 1944.\n\nRev. Father Plourde, O.M.I.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Father Plourde,\n\nMr. Kippen has already transported half of the material for our stable. I mean, the wood only. The enclosed account shows that all the construction material is to be delivered at the expense of the vendor. However, the accounts for wood already delivered show a tax of 6\u00a2 and 8\u00a2 per thousand for transportation.\n\nMy calculation for the wood only is as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\$141.50 & \\quad \\text{tax} \\\\\n\\$240.00 & \\quad \\text{transportation} \\\\\n\\$381.50 & \n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nSupposing the wood were sold at a price lower than $50 per thousand, it remains, nevertheless, for Mr. Kippen to cover the $175 transportation. Which would mean that we must pay $205 out of our own pockets.\n\nSuch a large amount of material was not counted upon when the estimate was being made: paper, iron, troughs, water conduits, etc.\n\nRegarding the tax, I wonder if we should not be exempt.\n\nI should be very grateful if you would kindly give me the desired information and advise me about this matter.\n\nUp till the present all has been going well at Sandy Bay. I am certainly fortunate to have Father Chagnon and Father Brug\u00e8re here with me.\n\n(sgd.) Father Jean Lambert, O.M.I.\n\nKindly return account.\n\nIt seems to me there is a lack of proportion between the drop siding and the flooring. I suppose, however, that it is correct.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to: Rev. J.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nReverend Father Levigne, Provincial, called at this office on the 14th instant requesting a further $2000.00 - $2500.00 for the purchase of materials for the proposed new Sandy Bay Residential School. He claimed the Department had allowed $3500.00 for the purchase of material, but owing to the present high prices and the fact that the specifications for the barn were made by an amateur, and were inaccurate, further moneys were required.\n\nI visited the school on the 18th, went over the plan of the barn and obtained a list of materials purchased and paid for, materials ordered and not paid for, and a list of materials still required.\n\nThe barn to be built, will be 118 X 34. The studs will be 12 feet, hip roof shingled, cement floors and cow mangers, steel stanchions to be made of pipes by the school staff. All the work of construction and erection will be done by the school staff and paid labour, the approximate cost is estimated at between $5000.00 - $5500.00. The school is also prepared to pay for all extras that may occur after the amount of $6593.00 is paid by the Department for the materials listed on the attached forms. This will include paint, extra fittings etc. The labour of painting is included in the sum already shown.\n\nA number of blue prints of the barn are being prepared and I requested that a copy be sent to the Department. The blue print will be ready in about three weeks.\n\nThe barn will house 32 head of cows, breeding heifers and feeding steers. Stalls for 10 horses. I questioned this number of horses. It appears that the school farm of approximately 100 acres is to be worked by horse power, 2 - 4 horses to do the work to be done by the pupils under supervision. When the farm work is done, two teams are continually required for hauling feed from the other farms owned by the church, one team for hauling wood fuel, and two driving teams are necessary for mission and medical services on the Sandy Bay and Ebb and Flow Reserves. Four box stalls are shown in the original drawing. One is required for the bull, two for calving cows, one for calves.\n\nAt the present time the school herd consists of 21 cows (recently freshened) 12 cows still to calve and 44 head of young stock, also 12 horses.\nThe lists attached are as follows:\n\n1 Material purchased and paid for, $1983.40\n2 Ordered, not delivered and not paid for, $1486.00\n3 Additional requirements to complete the proposed barn, $3093.60\n\nTotal cost of material requirements $6562.00\n\nI would strongly recommend that the barn be constructed the size proposed. Costs are high due to war conditions and the shortage of materials. The material, lumber, seems to be much lower in price than it can be purchased here at Portage la Prairie. There is no doubt that a new barn is very necessary, the old barn seems in danger of collapse and to build a large barn now would most likely render the building of lean-to's at a later date to house additional stock, unnecessary.\n\n[Signature]\nJ.

This expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter, File No. 126-9-5 dated Nov. 6/39.\n\nVoucher No. P165\n\nDATE: July 9, 1945\n\nAgent\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI beg to advise the Department that there is now a drag-line in close proximity to the Sandy Bay Reserve, making dug-outs for farmers who wish to increase their supply of water.\n\nThe water situation at the Sandy Bay Residential School has always been a problem and I beg to suggest that while the drag-line is close to the reserve, a dug-out 100' X 200' be made at the school. The cost would be in the neighbourhood of $200.00. I also strongly recommend that two dug-outs be made for the Indians on the reserve. I would suggest that the two dug-outs be made in open areas in the bush; this would tend to make the Indians build away from the vicinity of Lake Manitoba where there is some congestion. In the winter some Indians are watering cattle at the lake which, in some cases, is one to one and a half miles from their buildings. The cost of the two dug-outs for the Indians use would be approximately $80.00 each, the size 60' X 150'. There would be slight additional costs for wooden pumps and fencing, amounting to $30.00.\n\nThe dug-out required for the school might not eliminate the use of the truck for hauling water, as it is doubtful if the water would be fit for human consumption, as it is intended to make the dug-out near a creek so that the spring freshets may be caught and retained.\n\nI strongly recommend that the dug-outs be made at this time. They are necessary and it is doubtful if the drag-line will again be in the district.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 27th, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, the Department approves the expenditure of $200.00 for making a dug-out 100' x 200' at the Sandy Bay Residential School.\n\nYour recommendation regarding two dug-outs for the Indians on the Reserve is being brought to the attention of the officials who handle this matter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines and Resources, Ottawa\n\nJuly 30, 1945\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the Rev. J. Lambert, Principal of the Sandy Bay School, regarding the redecoration of the boys dormitory before the commencement of the fall term. This damage was reported in my letter 40-39, June 24th last. The size of the dormitory is 34' x 80', and approximately 125 yards will have to be replastered and all of the dormitory walls and ceiling will have to be repainted.\n\nIt seems impossible to get a plasterer or painter to leave the city of Portage and give an estimate for this work. It will also be difficult to have the work done by day work as painters and plasterers claim to have all the work they can do until fall.\n\nWill you please advise if the Department will approve having this work done by day work if it is possible to procure a decorator?\n\nJ. Waite\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, August 2nd, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man.,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, you may arrange for the replastering required at the boy's dormitory at the Sandy Bay Residential School. You may also have the walls and ceiling of the dormitory repainted.\n\nThe Department will expect you to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| CONTAINERS | TOTAL GALLONS | TOTAL POUNDS | PRODUCT                | LIST PRICE | UNIT | DISC. | AMOUNT |\n|------------|---------------|--------------|------------------------|------------|------|-------|--------|\n| 1          | 5             | REGAL RED NEW PROCESS PAINT | 2.32 GAL. | 11.60 |\n\nTRIPLICATE FOR FILE\n\nVoucher in duplicate attached for Accountant to pay.\n\nBACK ORDERED\u2014BALANCE TO FOLLOW\n\nMERCANDISE RECEIVED\n\nGOOD ORDER PRICES PAYABLE\n\nVERRY POOR COPY\nFORM 8A\n\nPLEASE GIVE DATE OF THIS INVOICE IF CLAIM IS MADE FOR ERROR OR SHORTAGE.

Waite,\nIndian Agent,\nPortage, Man.\n\nDear Mr. Waite;\n\nRe 40-39 Dugout - amounting $920.50\n\nRecently a report was sent to your office concerning the above matter. Inferring that the said report was lost, details are as follows:\n\nFirst, when permission was received from your office, equipment had been moved further south thus moving expenses amounted to $90.00\n\nHad school land been in Langruth municipality, the excavating expenses of $561.00 would have been cut to approximately half that amount.\n\nConcerning levelling dump, $71.50 was definitely essential in order to have use of dugout.\n\nDigging of ditch amounting to $88.00 was for the purpose of pumping the water to the barn.\n\nAfter permission to have the dugout was received, a member of my staff, in my absence, had the digging of the ditch and the levelling of the dump completed while equipment was on the premises.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: 126-9-5, Ottawa, July 27, 1945.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of authority above noted, which was in answer to my report of the 24th, idem, I enclose herewith voucher No. P.355 in an amount of $920.50, forwarded by the Mid-West Engineering Co. Ltd., Winnipeg. This is for excavating a dug-out at the Sandy Bay School and certain extras which are shown on the invoice.\n\nOn July 24, I received a telephone call from the Rev. Principal of the Sandy Bay School, stating that reservoir digging outfit was in the vicinity of the reserve, and that a reservoir could be dug at the school for the sum of approximately $200.00, plus an additional cost on a mileage basis for moving the outfit. I immediately wrote the Department asking for approval of this amount, also asking for $160.00 for an additional two reservoirs on the Sandy Bay Reserve. Department authority was received July 30th, and the Reverend Principal was telephoned the same date, advised that a sum of $200.00 had been allocated for the digging of a dug-out at the school. On the 23rd ultimo the attached account was received from the Mid-west Engineering Co. Ltd. On receipt of this account, the dugouts authorized for the reserve were immediately cancelled and the Reverend Principal written to, asking for an explanation. The explanation was received this date and is attached hereto. From information received since, I have learned that the firm agreed with the Municipality of Lakeview to excavate dug-outs for farmers in the Municipality on a half share basis. This would not apply to the reserve. It is also apparent, that extra work...\non the dug-out was authorized by the school, amounting to $269.00.\n\nOn August 15th, the Reverend Principal was in the agency office in connection with supplies for a water line from the dug-out to the new barn. He brought in a report, furnished by the Engineering Branch, dated Winnipeg, August 13, 1932. There are two numbers on this report, one 124167W and F.15244 W. This report states that the cost of a dug-out 240' X 150' would be $6,050.00.\n\nJ.

Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 19, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Manitoba.\n\nIt has been brought to our attention that the salary allowed the man who drives the truck for transporting water is much lower than that at which a capable man can be secured. It has therefore been decided to allow $100.00 a month towards the salary of this man, and your monthly voucher in future should be made out for this amount.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, October 19, 1945.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to excavating a dug-out at the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware, the Principal had no authority to incur the expenditure that he did. We simply authorized $200.00 and this amount should not have been exceeded without further authority being obtained.\n\nWe have reviewed the accounts very carefully and it has been decided to pay an amount of $449.50. This is made up as follows:\n\n| Description                  | Amount |\n|------------------------------|--------|\n| Original authority           | $200.00|\n| Extra expense, moving        |        |\n| Equipment                    | $90.00 |\n| Levelling Dump               | $71.50 |\n| Digging ditch to pump water  | $88.00 |\n| Total                        | $449.50|\n\nThe balance of the account, amounting to $471.00, will have to be paid by the school management.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Rev.

Father states that the pump has a crack underneath the paint, but does not leak.\n\nThese pumps are all carefully tested at the factory before shipment and there is every possibility that what appears to be a crack may be only a hair line in the casting. If at a later date the pump does actually develop a leak and the part is sent to us, which we in turn would send to the factory for their examination, and it is found that the casting is actually defective, you can be assured that the part will be replaced free of charge.\n\nWe hope with this explanation and our assurance to stand behind the pump, you will be enabled to pass our invoices for payment. Same are being returned herewith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS-MORSE CO. LTD.\n\nA.

Lambert\nPrincipal\n\nSandy Bay Indian School\nMarquis, Man\nJan 10 - 1945\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nJanuary 8th,\n1946.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the\n18th ultimo, 127-1-5, I beg to enclose a report\non the fire protection facilities at the Sandy\nBay School submitted by Fire Chief George Spriggs,\nPortage la Prairie.\n\n\u2713 1 6 Soda acid type fire extinguishers are re-\nquired, 3 for each floor.\n\u2713 2 I agree with the fire chief that this building\ncontains electrical equipment, a forge and\nwelding equipment, is dangerous and a new shop\nshould be built away from the school proper.\n\u2713 3 only 1 quart vaporizing fire extinguishers for\nfighting electrical fires that might occur in\nlaundry workshop, engine room, etc.\n\u2014 5 Would suggest 6 axes, 2 on each floor including\nthe basement and workshop.\n\u2014 6 The concrete collar is in a partition between the\nbake shop and the laundry. A particularly hot\nfire is required for baking bread and the con-\ncrete collar should be enlarged 6 inches all\nround. This collar is in a wooden partition.\n\u2713 7 It seems impossible to obtain a yale or other\nself closing device for the doors to the furnace\nroom. One is also required for Portage School.\nThese may be purchased at Ottawa.\n\u2713 8 The fire escape at present from the upper class\nrooms is for the children to pass down one flight\nof wooden stairs to fireproof stairs in the two\nannex'. This would be necessary if fire broke\nout during the day while the children are in the\nclass rooms. The children sleep in the fireproof\nbuilding and under present conditions dispersal\nis made from inside fireproof stairs. The fire\nchief feels that a wide catwalk should be built\nacross\nPortage la Prairie,\nManitoba.\n\nJ. Waite.\nIndian Agent\nPortage la Prairie.\n\nInspection of Indian School.\nSandy Bay, Indian Reserve.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving inspected the above building on December 27th 1945, I would strongly recommend the following:\n\n(1) At least 3-2\u00bd gal. soda-acid type Fire Extinguishers be placed on each floor, as apparently the water supply available at present, is not sufficient to fight fire with effectively.\n\n(2) 2 nonfreezing type Fire Extinguishers for the workshop which is attached to the School. This building is of all frame construction heated with an old iron stove, contains electrical equipment, a blacksmith forge, and a welding outfit. I consider this building to be very dangerous, as a fire hazard and should be torn down, for if a fire did start in this shop it would surely spread to the School.\n\n(3) 6 - 1qt vaporizing liquid Fire Extinguishers to replace those that are unserviceable.\n\n(4) 6 - qts of Carbon Tet: to recharge above when necessary.\n\n(5) Several fire axes should be purchased, in order to get at concealed fires in partitions etc.\n\n(6) The concrete collar that protects the partition, between the kitchen and laundry, where the stove-pipe passes through it is too small, this should be enlarged.\n\n(7) The door from the furnace room should be made self closing, and metal covered.\n\n(8) There are no outside fire escapes on the school at all. Walks could be made from upper floor of class room, (which is on the 3rd floor or frame part of building) out onto roofs of fire proof annexes at each end of the School. This would necessitate a screened or fenced walk, (to prevent persons being crowded off the roof,) this walk would lead to fire escape from the roof of annex, to the ground.\n\nOr, fire escapes could be built from upper floors of class room.\ndirect to the ground.\n\n(9) I believe also that outside fire escapes should be provided for the dormitories, for if a fire occurred in the old building the smoke etc would, no doubt cause panic and confusion, and possibly loss of life.\n\n(10) Fire drills should be held at least once a month in order that the staff and pupils might become familiar with getting out of the building in an orderly manner, and learning the use of the fire fighting equipment.\n\nI was very much impressed with the neat and clean condition of the whole school, it is a credit to all concerned.\n\nI am,\nyours truly,\n\nGeo.

Your letter 127-1-5 dated January 29th states that an engineer will be making an official visit to the Portage la Prairie School in the near future. Would it be possible to have him directed to the Sandy Bay School for the purpose of giving an estimate of the work required in paragraphs 8 and 9 of the Fire Chief's report.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 11, 1946.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to Paragraph 8 of the December 27 report from the Fire Chief of Portage la Prairie, on the Sandy Bay School.\n\nI enclose, for your information, a copy of a memorandum being forwarded by the Director to the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR, SURVEYS & ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Sandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nPortage la Prairie Indian Agency, Manitoba.\n\nMr. J. Waite, Indian Agent, Portage la Prairie, Man., recently took the Fire Chief from Portage la Prairie to inspect this school, with a view to determining if reasonable precautions have been taken to prevent loss of life in case of fire. The Fire Chief reported as follows:\n\n\"There are no outside fire escapes on the school at all. Exits could be made from upper floor of classroom (which is on the third floor of frame part of building) out onto roofs of fireproof annexes at each end of the school. This would necessitate a screened or fenced walk, to prevent persons being crowded off the roof. This walk would lead to fire escapes from the roof of annex to the ground. Or, fire escapes could be built from upper floors of classroom direct to the ground.\n\n\"I believe also that outside fire escapes should be provided for the dormitory, for if a fire occurred in the old building the smoke, etc., would no doubt cause panic and confusion, and possibly loss of life.\"\n\nIn my memorandum of January 29, 1946, I requested you to arrange to have one of your officials visit the Portage la Prairie Residential School. When he is visiting that school, Mr. Waite would be willing to take him to Sandy Bay, where he could inspect the building, with a view to ascertaining what is the best manner of carrying out the Fire Chief's suggestions. I trust you can arrange this.\n\nIndian Affairs.

According to Mr Phelan's notice, a few months ago, the said salary was to enter into effect with the month of September.\n\nAlso, before the fiscal year is over, I wish to point out that; requisition was made several months ago for paint and water installation in the new barn. Would you kindly investigate if whether or not the matter was presented to the Department of Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe boys are doing good in the shop.

We are arranging to issue cheque shortly for the salary of the vocational instructor.\n\nWe have noted the estimate given to you by Iverson & Son for the erection of certain buildings at the Sandy Bay School.

It was requested that this material be purchased as soon as possible as it was the intention of the staff to install all piping before freeze up. The list of supplies was forwarded under cover of my letter 40-39 August 15th last.\n\nIt is requested that the equipment and supplies be forwarded at your earliest convenience. In a matter of a few weeks spring will break here and the work could be started immediately.\n\nIndian Agent.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, March 13, 1946.\n\nMr. J.

I understand that the school management has already secured some of the piping required and, consequently, I am returning the list which you forwarded with your letter of August 15, last. Please revise this list, stating exactly what is needed at the present time.\n\nIf the school has not already secured the automatic water system you should let me know the name of the manufacturer and, if possible, a catalogue number.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch - Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Chairs for Convalescent Patients.\n\nI have received the following request for chairs from Sister Raymond-Marie, R.N., of Sandy Bay School, Amaranth, she writes as follows:\n\n\"I wonder if it is possible to have three easy chairs of different sizes for convalescent children.

As understood the salary will be effective from last September.\n\nAs regards the requisition for paint and water installation I have referred this to Mr. Phelan who will, no doubt, communicate with you in the near future.\n\nAs regards the two estimates sent in for the construction of a new shop, I must say that new construction is definitely out for several years. You have, no doubt, read about this in the newspapers. It might be possible, however, to buy some material towards the construction of a small shop.

This order called for no discount on prices regarding tires whatsoever. The tubes, your order did state less 10% plus 10, which appeared to me out of order, however, we shipped the goods together with heavy duty Truck chains and submitted our bill to your Portage agent, in the amount of $414.48. We received your cheque No. 854 for $344.48.\n\nOn February 28th we wrote your Portage office submitting the statement of how this account was made up and asking that the cheque for the balance of $69.92 be forwarded. He replied under date of March 1st stating that to the price of tires there should be deductions of 10% plus 10 to this price which amounts to $65.72. I would point out to you that these arrangements were not on the purchasing order, as this simply means supplying goods absolutely wholesale, which appears in my opinion, a system of doing business which no dealer could exist under. Had these stipulations been made clear in your order, we can assure you, we would have made no effort to fill the order. Therefore we request a cheque in the amount of $69.92 being the balance which we feel is due us.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lambert, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 17, 1946.\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, please let me know the approximate cost of the labour to paint the new barn. When I have this information your request will receive further consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend J. Lambert, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSandy Bay Indian Residential School,\nMafius, Manitoba.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Fire Escapes,\nSandy Bay Residential School,\nAmaranth, Manitoba.\n\nYou will recall that following our request to Mr. Gow to carry out an investigation of the nature and approximate cost of changes required to comply with suggestions advanced by the Portage la Prairie fire chief, we were advised that the investigation would not be carried out until road conditions in the area improved.\n\nMr. Gow has now furnished us with a report on an investigation carried out by Mr. Rose of his staff, which is confined to methods of execution, and structural work involved, but furnishes no estimate of cost for metal stairs and balconies, which constitute the usual type of fire escape.\n\nComment on the report is furnished as follows:\n\n1. Description of Building - The central portion of the school building is of frame construction. The third floor of this portion contains a central corridor about 3'-0\" wide serving three classrooms. Interior stairways, about 21'-6\" wide, are located at each end of the floor area, one of which is in a classroom and enclosed by a partition and door; the other opens directly off the corridor and is not enclosed.\n\nAt each end of the frame structure are what the report calls \"fire proof\" annexes, the roofs of which are 3 inches below the finished third floor level; these annexes contain dormitories, chapel and a hospital ward.\n\nComment - The National Building Code requires a minimum width of 3'-0\" for interior stairways in buildings of this character, and both stairways should open directly off the corridor. As the requirements are not completely fulfilled, the proposal for additional exits may be considered reasonable.\n\n2. Additional Exits - The report suggests that an additional exit be formed in the north classroom by converting an existing window into a fire exit door to the annex roof and build a fire escape from that level to the ground. At the opposite end of the corridor and adjacent to the existing stairway, that a further exit door be constructed in the existing frame wall to give access to the annex roof at that end. It is suggested that an additional dormer would provide shelter for the new doorway at this point. The existing stairwell would be enclosed by a door and partition. Both exit doors to annex roofs would be equipped with panic bolt locking devices.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nComment - An objection to the proposed exits is their proximity to the existing stairs. As no other location seems feasible other than providing exits direct from the classrooms to outside stairways, the possible hazard of these new exits being rendered unusable by smoke or fire from the stairwells may, with reasonable security, be overcome by providing self-closing doors opening towards the stairwell landings.\n\n3. Electric Lighting Signs - The report further suggests a system of exit lighting be provided for all exits throughout the School building, to be controlled by a switch located in the first floor main office.\n\nComment - As the residents and occupants of a residential school would in all probability be quite familiar with stairways and exits, there seems to be some doubt as to the necessity of the suggested electric light exit signs. Painted \"Exit\" signs would seem to be sufficient, especially for day occupied classrooms.\n\n4. Protection Against Prowlers - The school principal desires that access from the ground to the annex roofs be prevented, and the suggestion is made that a covered or screened passageway be constructed from the new exit doors to the top landing of the proposed iron fire escape at the parapet wall of the annexes, and extended over the landing. It is stated that this method of egress would be better than erecting a fence around the entire 18 inch high parapet walls and would afford better protection against pupils falling off the roof.\n\nComment - The proposal of a covered passage over the annex roof, unless of fire-resisting construction, would seem to constitute an additional fire hazard, and the confined space of the passage might be productive of panic.\n\nA properly constructed guard railing around the parapet wall with no opening greater than 6 inches would seem sufficient to prevent accidents and would allow quick dispersal of pupils from the exit doors.\n\nThe lower flight of the fire escape would be held in an \"up\" position without a lock or locking device and would be fitted with an approved counterbalancing device that would permit it to be quickly and easily brought into position for use. It is felt that this arrangement should discourage possible prowlers.\n\n5. Alternative Proposal - The report explains that an alternative proposal by the Fire Chief, of erecting outside stairways from the classrooms direct to the ground, has certain objections.\n\n(a) The outside stairway would be longer.\n(b) It would be attached to frame construction.\n(c) Access to the outside stairway would be through intervening classroom desks.\n(d) A fire escape thus located would not serve the dormitories.\n\nComment - It is felt that Mr. Gow's objections are sufficient to condemn this proposal.\n\n6. Conclusion of Report - The report concludes with a recommendation that a small portion of the roof where shingles have been torn away by the wind, be repaired and small repairs be made to the conductor pipes and eavestroughing at this time, when the cost could be held to about $25.00. The report gives an estimate of cost as follows:\n\n| Description                          | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------|--------|\n| Install Fire Exit Doors & Dormer    | $223.50|\n| Install Exit Light System            | $110.00|\n| Total                                | $333.50|\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNo estimate of the cost of supplying and erecting remainder of equipment has been supplied.\n\nAfter a study of the sketch plan attached, and taking into consideration the factors described in the report, it is suggested that the following method of providing additional exits from the third storey be given consideration.\n\n(a) Form exit door from window in north classroom and on exit door in the corridor south wall to adjoining annex roofs. Exit doors to be equipped with panic bolts.\n\n(b) Enclose south stairwell with a door and partition. Doors to both stairwells to be hung to open upon stair landings and be self closing.\n\n(c) Erect iron fence 2'-6\" high above parapet walls of both annexes.

If the work is carried out, competitive tenders should be obtained in Winnipeg.\n\nIt is suggested, however, that this proposal and estimate be submitted to the Indian Affairs Branch for their consideration.\n\nAttached is the sketch plan which accompanied the report, on which we show in coloured crayon, the suggested location of the proposed iron fire escapes.

(RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nDuring a recent visit to the Sandy Bay Residential School the following repairs were brought to my attention.\n\nNew engine required. The present engine was installed to take care of the old school. Since installation two annexes have been added and the engine is not large enough to take care of the additional load. The engine is a 10 H.P. Lister, Serial No. G.S.26247, the motor 6 K.W., 110 D.C.\n\nIf it is the intention of the Department to build a Nursing Station at Little Saskatchewan Reserve, I would recommend the transfer of this engine to that point and the purchase of a new one of 20H.P., diesel, automatic, with a 12 or 15 K.W. generator. New batteries would be required in both cases; the new batteries at Sandy Bay School, - 550 A.P.H., - 56 - 2 volt jars, 110 volts. The present batteries are badly sedimented and will not hold a charge. This means almost continual running of the engine. No change in the wiring of the school would be required and the school staff would be prepared to make the conduit changes from the motor to the batteries etc. If the old engine were shipped to Little Saskatchewan Reserve, new batteries would be required. The engine is in first class running shape at present, but will not stand up under the present load and with care it would last for many years at the proposed nursing station.\n\nThe washing machine is worn out. It was purchased in 1938. Request was made for a \"Kleener\", H.26, Ashdowns' Catalogue 1937 and a \u00bc H.P. motor to run it. Request was also made for fans for the chapel and two dormitories. Fans of 10\" with automatic shutters would be required, and one 1/20th. motor. A new truck is also requisitioned. I beg to enclose herewith a list of requirements as set out by the Reverend Principal of the School.\n\nJ. Waite,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 24, 1946.\n\nDear Father Lambert:\n\nIndian Agent Waite has forwarded to this office your letter addressed to him dated June 28th, in which you requested a number of articles for the Sandy Bay Indian Residential School.\n\nThe funds at our disposal will not permit us giving favourable consideration to the very many requests that you have made.\n\nIn the first place we have a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch to the effect that we should provide fire escapes. The estimated cost of these is $2085.05. In order to minimize the danger by fire we feel that we should proceed with this work.\n\nMr. Waite has written at some length regarding your request for a new lighting plant. Would it not be possible to make the present lighting plant last for another year?\n\nIs it absolutely essential that the water truck should be replaced? Trucks are extremely hard to obtain at the present time. If we had the present one repaired would it not serve the purpose until next year?\n\nIt appears from this letter that a new set of batteries is necessary. We are prepared to order these but would like to know in what year the present set of batteries were supplied.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.

Diesel motor and a 6 Kilowatt generator. It was installed in 1938 to serve the old building only, that is, before the present two additions were built by which the school was tripled in size. It is readily understood that the plant has been overloaded, doing three times the work it was originally intended to do.\n\nThe set of batteries installed in May 1942 have been doing triple the job also, with a result that they are worn out. The school management feels that it cannot take up on itself the responsibility of starting a new school year with the lighting system in its present condition, and absorb the cost of emergency repairs on such equipment.\n\nThe present water truck supplied in 1941 has been doing very hard and rough work ever since, especially during the winter months. The reservoir or tank attached to this truck being too small, more tra-\nvelling was needed by the truck. The school management feels that even if the present truck were repaired, it would still be unable to furnish the work as it is too small to do the job properly and especially, economically. Since sending in our requisition of June 26th, we have had the opportunity of taking information on our trucking problem and a 3-ton Army truck with four wheel drive single wheel, capable of carrying a 2000 gallon reservoir with a 5-inch pump on a take-off was strongly recommended. The truck is available from War Assets through the Manitoba Federation of Agriculture. We hereby ask authorisation to make the purchase. This manner of proceeding is expedient and economical.\n\nWe enclose a copy of our requisition for the water system for the barn. This material is now urgently needed as the season is advancing and installation must be completed before fall. As things are now, we are unable to use the water in the dug-out, as we have no pump to bring it to the barn.\n\nMay we add that a ready supply of water is absolutely necessary in case of fire, and we have considered it in making our requisition for a larger truck. The other articles asked for are needed and were requested because they are needed.\n\nTrusting that these considerations will have a favorable response, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

The price of the truck is reasonable enough but it will be necessary to add the cost of batteries, spare tire, and a jack; it would also be advisable to purchase a tank of greater capacity than the one actually on hand at Sandy Bay which contains only 600 gallons, thus necessitating numerous trips; the Vulcan Iron Work could build a tank holding 1200 gallons; the price was not stated but they usually are reasonable.\n\nFinally it would be advisable to buy a pump operated by the truck engine which would fill the tank with water from the lake; the Fairbanks Co. and the Crane Co. sell this kind of pump. The engine used until now was very inadequate because during the colder days of winter it would freeze and result in numerous useless trips.\n\nTo sum up this truck would answer the need provided that the Dept. assumes the additional cost of batteries, spare tire, tank and mechanism for the pump; these would be required anyway with any kind of truck.\nOttawa, 2 October 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Your File 67167-15-11\n\nWith reference to our memorandum of September 25th and previous correspondence regarding the truck for the Sandy Bay Residential School, we are in receipt of a further letter from our representative in which he states:\n\n\"I sent a mechanic who could judge the value of the truck.

(RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIT'S EASILY READ BECAUSE IT'S\n\nPalmer \"Red-Reading-Mercury\"\n\nIt didn't take long for PALMER'S patented \"Red-Reading-Mercury\" thermometers to become famous all over the world. And the patent has been further improved by continued Palmer research. Thermometer users everywhere recognize and now demand the numerous advantages offered by this RED column.\n\nThe RED column is clear and distinct; easy to read under all conditions, even through smoke, steam or dust. Truly accurate readings are easier to obtain.\n\nFor years no improvement had been made in mercury thermometers until Palmer succeeded in producing a pure mercury tube\u2014adding nothing to harm the mercury's purity\u2014and yet having a vivid RED color in the reading column.\n\nThis is accomplished by reflection. Mercury is a natural mirror, so that by placing a strip of RED glass to the side of the bore or reading column, the RED glass is reflected upon the mercury.\n\nNOW! GET \"RED-READING-MERCURY\" with Palmer's New EXTRUDED BRASS CASE THERMOMETERS. These new thermometers are considered to be just as good an advance as \"Red-Reading-Mercury\" when it was first introduced by Palmer. These thermometer cases are fume-resistant and dust-proof with a durable nickel finish. V-shape design, with a much longer scale for quick, easy reading. Specify this new thermometer when ordering from your jobber or equipment manufacturer.\n\nWhen the mercury rises in the tube, only the bright RED color is seen. The mercury is not disturbed or harmed in any way. You retain all the valuable properties of pure mercury, with the added attraction of bringing the mercury column before your eyes, in a reflected RED column.\n\nWhen you buy a PALMER \"Red-Reading-Mercury\" thermometer, you get a selected tube, which has been thoroughly annealed to protect it from change in use or with age. Specify \"Red-Reading-Mercury\" on all orders\u2014furnished at no added expense.\n\nREPAIRS\n\n... To all makes of mercury thermometers, for a nominal charge, furnishing selected \"Red-Reading-Mercury\" tube, thoroughly annealed, and repairing all worn or broken parts, refinishing the thermometers so that they will be as good as new. New extruded brass case added at slight extra cost. This type of Repair Service pays for itself many times.\n\nThis circular illustrates a few of the many PALMER Thermometers made with \"Red-Reading-Mercury\". We manufacture Industrial Thermometers of all types, Laboratory Thermometers, A.S.T.M. Precision, Fractional-Division, Pocket, Wall and Cup Thermometers, Hand Thermometers, Hygrometers, Psychrometers, etc., all with the \"Red-Reading-Mercury\" feature on ranges net over 750 F.\n\nPALMER THERMOMETERS, INC.\nMfrs.

Each of these units have a load capacity of fifteen pounds of potatoes which they will peel in from one to three minutes, depending upon the condition of the potatoes. We can quote as follows:\n\nModel 6015 Bench Type Peeler \u2014 $257.00\n\" 6015 Pedestal \" \" \u2014 $291.00\n\nF.O.B. any Manitoba point.\n\nOn the subject of kitchen mixing machine, we are enclosing illustration of the Model A-200 - 20 qt. machine. This machine, with standard equipment - 20 qt. bowl, 20 qt. beater and 20 qt. wire whip - we can quote at $365.00. This machine is also available with 12 qt. auxiliary equipment as well as standard equipment, comprising 12 qt. bowl, beater and whip at $38.50. Meat Chopping Attachment for use with this unit - $40.00. Above prices are also f.o.b. any Manitoba point.\n\nCOMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION FOR ALL PURPOSES\nIn both cases capacity requirements would be more than adequate for the school of one hundred pupils.\n\nWe appreciate the opportunity of quoting and would be glad to have your order. In this instance however, please note that, while you show motors required would operate from a lighting plant unit, we are quoting units that would be standard 110 volt, 60 cycle, single phase. D.C. motors where required would carry special quotations.

Hamilton  \nInspector of Indian Agencies for Manitoba.\n\nEncs.\nOttawa, December 26, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. RONY,\n\nMechanical Equipment for Residential Schools\n\nWhile the problem of increased per capita grants for residential schools is being considered, I would like to bring to your attention the need for more mechanical equipment for the kitchens of our residential schools.\n\nThe dietary surveys of our residential schools by the nutritionists of the Department of National Health and Welfare point out the need for such equipment. The pressure also from Indian groups to have their children in residential schools spend more time in the classrooms could be alleviated by the introduction of such equipment.\n\nThe one item that would particularly do much to eliminate such drudgery would be the potato peeler. It requires neither great manual dexterity nor intelligence to peel potatoes and we cannot truthfully claim that the Indian children so employed are being taught \"cooking\".\n\nCertain schools with good farms have, by reason of the profits thus obtained, been able to buy such machines. The management of the majority of our schools have not been able to afford such equipment.\n\nI would recommend that consideration be given to a policy of providing a minimum of kitchen machines for our residential schools. Dr. Pett, Chief of the Nutrition Division of the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 12)\nDepartment of National Health and Welfare, could be approached to prepare a scale of issue for these schools depending upon their pupilage.\n\nI do not recommend the purchase of such elaborate equipment as dishwashers, slicers, etc.\n\nI do feel, however, that a 15 lb. potato peeler costing approximately $200.00 would do much to eliminate many child hours of drudgery and would enable the management to have these hours spent instead in the classroom. In fact we would insist that the school management have a definite increase in classroom hours in return for the provision of such equipment.\n\nI attach copies of letters recently received concerning the supply of such equipment. I have also received representations from Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the Indian and Eskimo Residential School Commission, Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, in this connection.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

(Supply and erection of fire escapes only)............. $ 3,325.00\n\nMr. Gow had expected tenders from other firms, but to expedite handling of the matter, before the arrival of bad weather, he forwarded those he had received by the end of October to this office for our consideration.\n\nThe above tenders were analysed and on November 8th our Purchasing Agent was requested to issue a Purchase Order to the Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal and Roofing Ltd., covering the whole installation at their quoted price. The Purchase Order was issued on November 20th last.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of the order the Canadian Rogers people wrote Mr. Gow advising that a serious error in their tender prevented them from accepting the order. This information, accompanied by the Company's letter, was forwarded to us under date of November 27th last. Mr. Gow was immediately requested to ascertain from the Canadian Rogers firm what adjustment would be necessary for a corrected tender.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\n(over)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6278, file 584-5, part 12)\nMr. Gow wrote us again on November 26th forwarding a third tender. This had been submitted by the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works Ltd., of Winnipeg, under date of November 27th, and stated that they would carry out the whole of the work for $5,209.00. In Mr. Gow's letter he advised that he was awaiting a revised tender from the Canadian Rogers Company.\n\nUnder date of the 26th instant Mr. Gow advised us further that the Canadian Rogers Sheet Metal and Roofing Ltd., were not interested in submitting a revised tender. Following this advice, the Purchase Order to that firm was cancelled.\n\nRegarding the tender submitted by the Dominion Bronze and Iron Ltd., the following extract from Mr. Gow's letter of the 20th instant is quoted:\n\n\"Mr. Burd advises by telephone that his Company are prepared to carry out the work in accordance with the price quoted in their quotation. However, some of the material necessary for the fabrication is not presently available and it might be necessary to substitute some other material which however, would be as satisfactory as that originally quoted upon. They would not, however, be prepared to carry out this work immediately. It might be pointed out that their quotation does not include the alterations necessary within the building itself to provide exits or does it include patching of plaster walls which might be damaged by the construction work. They are not willing to undertake this phase of the work at all. Their quotation, however, does include the sum of $80.00 for sending an engineer to the building to take necessary measurements.\"\n\nThe work which Mr. Gow advises has not been included in the Dominion Bronze and Iron Ltd., tender is essential to the use of the fire escape and must be carried out as one phase of the work at the same time as other operations. We estimate it would cost in the neighbourhood of $500.00, and in conjunction with work by the Dominion Bronze and Iron Ltd., would produce a total cost of approximately $5,225.00.\n\nThe tender submitted by the Manitoba Bridge and Iron Works Ltd., is considered too high.\n\nAfter considering the whole matter, it is felt that winter conditions having arrived before operations could be undertaken, and having no assurance that the work would receive early attention, the project should be deferred until the spring and the funds now transferred to us be returned to Indian Affairs. New tenders should be invited next spring to include both interior and exterior work, and at least $4,000. should be made available by Indian Affairs for the project.\n\nJ.T. Miller\nChief Engineer.\nJanuary 3, 1946.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nRe: Fire Escapes, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School, Amaranth, Manitoba.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of a memorandum from our Engineering and Construction Service outlining steps which have been taken to arrange for the erection of fire escapes at the above noted school.\n\nYou will note that it will not be possible to have the fire escapes erected during this fiscal year and that the job will ultimately cost approximately $4000.00. This is considerably more than was originally provided for.\n\nThe recommendation to defer this work until the next fiscal year is concurred in and if you agree, steps will be taken to return to your branch the $2100.00 already transferred for this purpose and to make arrangements for the work when it is undertaken next Spring.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, 6 January 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Fire Escapes, Sandy Bay Indian Residential School\n\nWe are in receipt of your memorandum of Jan. 3 advising that it will not be possible to have the fire escapes erected during the current fiscal year.\n\nPlease arrange to return the sum of $2100.00 to this branch.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, January 7, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Purchase Order # 14211.\n\nWe are aware of the difficulty encountered in completing the above order, due to the scarcity of soda ash used in the manufacture of glass jars but we would appreciate it if you could advise us of the date of shipment or the expected date of delivery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Globelite Batteries Ltd.,\n146 Alexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Rev.

The present arrangement for hauling water is proving very costly for the department and very unsatisfactory for the school. Our cistern is, at present, empty for the fourth time.
