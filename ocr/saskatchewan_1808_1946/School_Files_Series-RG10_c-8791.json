Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Fort Frances Indian Residential School for the Quarter ended September the 30th 19\u2014\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October the 1st 19\u2014\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Rainy Lake Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Fort Frances Indian Res.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will provision be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The totals of the Return should be correctly filled in and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry on in such a way, placing them in the proper order.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be completed and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the head \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of average grant due per quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of grant per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [School Name] School for the Quarter ended [Date].\n\nDated [Date]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it was correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 408\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Fort Providence Agency**\n\n**Report the Provincial Reserve School at Fort Providence on N.W.T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...FT.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...FT...RESOLUTION RESIDENTIAL...School for the Quarter ended...DECEMBER 31st...1952...\n\nPrincipal..............................................................\n\nDated...DEC. 31st...1952...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...[Signature]...this...Jan...5th...1953...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0218            | M.

File 150.000-21.\n\nThis is one point on which we have always been\nvery particular especially with the Indians, for they are\nnaturally negligent and filthy and need to be followed up\nclosely and taught the need of cleanliness.\n\nOne thing I would like very much to have and\nthat would be greatly appreciated in the North is bath\ntubs. The school being built on one of the bays of\nGreat Slave Lake offer the children every convenience\nin summer. During those months they go bathing three\ntimes a week when the weather permits, but in winter it\nis quite different. We are obliged to employ common\nwash tubs for this purpose.\n\nI remain\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nSister McQuillan\nOttawa, August 28th., 1911.\n\nMadam,-\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th. instant with reference to the teaching of Hygiene at the Fort Resolution Boarding School. In reply I beg to say that the Department is pleased that the introduction of this subject in the school is proving of interest to yourself and the Indian children. With reference to the bath tubs I regret to inform you that the Department cannot supply them. Under the new contract with Boarding Schools which went into effect on April 1st. last, the Church authorities are called upon to supply all the necessary equipment. As the grant to your school is now $135.00 per annum no doubt if you will communicate with the proper authorities they will be willing to supply you with the bath tubs, which would appear to be essential.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

C. Boarding School at Resolution.\n\nWe will supply F.O.B. Toronto, Ont., the following equipment:\n\n**GENERATOR**\n1-Style 1 Siche Gas Machine, capacity\n75 Burners, price $250.00 less 20% $200.00\n\n**PIPING**\n100-feet 3/4\" Black Iron Gas Tubing\nfor main service pipe\n300-feet 1/2\" Black Iron Gas Tubing\nfor feeders\n500-Feet of 3/8\" Black Iron Gas Tubing\nfor branches and pendants for ceilings\n\n**GAS FITTINGS**\nGas fittings for piping, 5.00\n\n**BURNER COCKS**\n45-3/8\" Brass burner cocks @ 40\u00a2 18.00\n\n**BURNERS**\n4-Dozen Burners @ $3.00 12.00\n\nTotal $277.00\n\nThe above supplies of piping and fittings will be more than sufficient to supply the 45-lights shown on the plans, but as the latter do not show the height of ceilings or the proposed location of the machine, we have deemed it necessary to include plenty of pipe and fittings. It would be well to advise us whether it is the intention to conceal the piping or leave it exposed, if the latter system is adopted we would send the necessary wing-back fittings and clips for exposed work. The specifications do not show whether the jets indicated are to be pendants from the ceiling or wall brackets.\n\nYou will note our specifications do not include any brass gas fixtures, we are presuming that the 3/8\" pipe will be used as pendants or brackets with brass burner cocks screwed on the end and painted to match the rooms. If brass fixtures are required in any of the rooms we can give close prices on same. For the outside light it will be necessary\nto have a suitable lamp. We have these at prices ranging from $2.25 up to $12.00, according to design and finish. We can supply globes and holders for the whole 45 lights at 15\u00a2 each for holders and 25\u00a2 to 75\u00a2 each for globes.\n\nx x x x\n\nTHE SICHE GAS CO. LIMITED.\nSgd. L.R.

You realize the difficulties of communication and I may say that they are partly responsible for the delay in the present work.\n\nHoping that you will find a satisfactory solution and bringing to your attention that the above missionaries are willing to have the work done provided the material is supplied by the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 916-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 11, 1926.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, concerning cold storage for the Ft.

As you have been informed, our funds are extremely limited this year and I have recently learned that the supplementary appropriation will not be as large as expected. I regret, therefore, that it will be impossible to comply with your request at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos.

McLean, Sec.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could send me by the first mail blanks for preparing the Indian report for the June quarter, as our supply is completely exhausted.\n\nWould the Department supply us also with two large tents for camping purposes? In the month of July we go camping at the mission Island with the children who do not go home for their vacation.\n\nNot having plastered walls in our school, the ordinary blackboard material does not present a smooth surface for writing purposes and wears out easily; we would therefore greatly appreciate it if you could renew them with Nylolite. For the two classes we would require lengths of 8 feet and one of 16 feet.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nSister J. Dussault.\nOttawa, June 16th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of April 28th, last, forwarding a requisition for school material and other supplies, and requesting that 2 large tents be also supplied.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the blank forms and the quantity of blackboard asked for have been ordered to be sent you.\n\nRelative to the tents, I beg to say that we have none of these on hand, and, as our funds during the present year are extremely limited, it is regretted that we will be unable to authorize the purchase of these tents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It may be possible to provide these desks at a later date. We will await the report of Rev. Father Guy, who is at present in the north country, and will, no doubt, visit your school this present summer. Your request for these desks will be kept in mind.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

At one time, the school management wanted a refrigerating plant; but the Department has explained that the best we could do would be the standard equipment for Indian residential schools. This will cost approximately $2,000. Father Lefebvre has had a chat with Mr. Orr regarding the matter, and I wish to recommend that a plan and a list of material be prepared at the present time. Most of the lumber can be secured in the North, but some of the material should be purchased in Edmonton in the near future. The activity could proceed if the Department would pay for the materials that have to be secured now from this year's Vote and then an item placed in the Estimates for the construction and other materials. I wish to recommend that this course be taken. The plan and list of material should be directed to Rev. J. C. Lefebvre, O.M.I., 1201 Visitation St., Montreal, Que.\n\nRussell P. Herring\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 28, 1927.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI wish to secure your authority to erect an ice-house and cold storage at the Resolution Indian Residential School, in the Northwest Territories. Fish is a very important item of diet at this institution and it is very necessary that they have adequate facilities for its storing. There is an item of $2,000 in the Main Estimates, 1927-28, for this purpose. The reason I seek your approval at this time is that some of the materials cannot be secured locally and should be purchased in the near future, in Edmonton.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJan. 29, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a blue print copy of a plan of a cold storage which I think will meet the requirements at the Indian Residential School at Resolution. The proposed sizes are marked in red. The following is a list of the articles that will be required to be purchased and shipped in:\n\n- Cement 60 bags,\n- Siding, 2000 sq. ft.\n- Shingles, 8000,\n- Two ply roofing paper, 60 squares,\n- Two sash 12 x 12.\n\nWith reference to the above items you may arrange to purchase these in Edmonton and have them shipped at the most convenient time to the school. Accounts for same should be forwarded to the Department in duplicate to be certified to by yourself.\n\nWith regard to the cash specified you will note that there are no frames as you can probably build these without difficulty at the School. There will also be required a quantity of hardware, including hinges, fastens and nails, and if you will show a copy of the plan to the firm in Edmonton from whom you are making the purchase they will be able to arrange this list for you.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of a circular issued by the Cold Storage Branch on this type of refrigerating plant which may be of interest to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Resolution, N.W.T.\nJuly 4th, 1927,\n\nHon. J.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRe. Your File No 139-1-5\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter of March 21st, ult., received together with copy of the order placed by the Department with the M.M. Moyer Company of Edmonton, for 50 single school desks, 1 teacher's desk and chair, for our school, and in reply wish to say that these goods were received in perfect order on the first boat, and are most satisfactory.\n\nWith most sincere thanks for your kindness in supplying us with the above,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nPrincipal,\nMemorandum for File:\n\nWith reference to the accounts for the refrigerator which has been erected under Father Lefebvre's supervision at the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School, it should be stated that accounts of Revillon Freres, now defunct, amounting to $623.68, were forwarded by Father Lefebvre in May last. These never reached the Department and, consequently, no cheque was issued. When Father Lefebvre returned from the Mackenzie River at the end of July, he paid the Revillon Freres by allowing them to draw on him and, accordingly, he has no receipt. It is possible that the liquidator will be able to give a receipt. This account of $623.68 included the freight as far as Waterways. ($474.56 plus freight $149.12).\n\nRevillon Freres drew on Father Lefebvre for four other accounts for material, as follows:\n\n- $114.64\n- $236.00\n- $98.31\n- $381.68\n\nFather Lefebvre will try to secure receipts for these also from the liquidator as the accounts have been paid.\n\nFather Lefebvre has paid the Edmonton Paint & Glass Co.'s account amounting to $474.77, and two accounts of the Ashdown Hardware $44.80 and $6.80. There is no freight on the last four accounts from Revillon's nor on the accounts from the Edmonton Paint & Glass and Ashdown Hardware. The accounts from the last two concerns will be receipted and forwarded to the Department.\n\nThese accounts, which Father Lefebvre will endeavour to have receipted, total $1,884.88. In addition to these, there have been heavy charges for freight and there is, also, an account for pipe clay. I told Father Lefebvre that the $1,884.88 would be re-imbursement to him and, also, the account for clay. There has been no promise that we will bear any more than $2,100. of the cost of the refrigerator.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 916-5, part 1)\nOttawa, January 12, 1928.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nRelative to your request for the purchase of two (2) belt drive washing machines, with swinging wringer, I beg to say that the Department will approve of providing the expenditure required for this purpose. We note that you can obtain these machines, complete, at a cost of approximately $65 each.\n\nIf you pay for these machines, you should obtain a receipted account, in duplicate. This you should certify and forward to the Department, when you will be reimbursed for the expenditure incurred. If, however, you desire that payment be made direct to the firm, you should forward their account after you have certified on same that the goods were received and the prices charged fair and just, and a cheque will be forwarded to the firm from whom the purchase is made.\n\nThe quotation which you left at the Department, together with a cut of the machine required, is returned herewith for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You have copies of the accounts for the material giving the weights, etc., and it should be possible to obtain receipted accounts from the above Company covering the amount charged for the freight. When you obtain these receipted accounts, in duplicate, if you will forward them to the Department, consideration will then be given to reimbursing you for the amount of the freight charges.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Special Electric Engine, direct connected through flexible coupling to a 3\u00bd k.w. 125 volt compound wound direct current generator.\n\nThe engine is the well known type \"Z\" four cycle, with Fairbanks-Morse self-driven high tension magneto-enclosed crank case, extra heavy flywheels and other refinements adapting it to electric lighting service. It is completely self contained, with built-in cooling fan and steam condensing radiator. There is a negative and constant cooling system, and consists of a capacious cast iron reservoir bolted to the cylinder, the evaporated steam from which passes to the radiator, where it is condensed by the action of an enclosed fan mounted inside of the flywheel, and thence returned to the engine jacket. Replacement of cooling water is seldom ever necessary, and the temperature is automatically maintained at the best point for efficient operation.\n\nThe fuel tank is enclosed in the engine base, but can, if desired, be installed outside of the building, a fuel pump being then provided. Engine operates on kerosene, but gasoline can be used if more conveniently procured.\n\nGenerator is a sturdy, slow speed machine\u2014operating at engine speed of 550 revolutions per minute. Being compound wound, the voltage will remain constant, regardless of the number of lights in use.\n\nThe regulation is such that the plant can be operated directly on the line, without battery, and there will be no flickering of the lights.\n\nThis is a very desirable plant for picture theatres, rinks, public halls, etc. In rinks, the cooling system will be found decidedly convenient, as only a pail or two of water is required to cool it, or an antifreezing mixture can be used quite as effectively, all evaporation being condensed and returned.\n\nThe Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited\nREGINA 300-310, PRINCESS STREET, WINNIPEG CALGARY\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have today received an order from Dr. C.

The special invoice sent from the Department asking for information relates to the switchboard, which was sent separately later.\n\nI beg to state that the goods were received and the plant new installed, but the service of shipping the goods from that firm was very unsatisfactory. The engine and generator was shipped and the switchboard sent only a month later, causing all kinds of inconvenience to us, having to wait for the installation, the rheostat the most important part of the switchboard not mounted as promised and received only at the beginning of September when we had wired for it. No instructions were sent until the 12th of September, the gasoline tank on the engine was leaking and had to be repaired, the rheostat started after many troubles, and finally the generator not working at all, caused by a wire in the generator winding altogether short, and this specially giving us trouble for days before the trouble could be found. This missing wire was either done before shipment or in transit, but the machine looked in perfect condition when received. Finally we had the troubles repaired and the plant is now working very satisfactory. The Mission is now installing their wiring for lights and quartz light.\n\nThe plant had to be installed at the Agency, at the request of Bishop Breymat due to better ground conditions for foundations, and care of the plant, and the service will be given from the Agency on a proportion basis, with the quartz light installed at the Convent until the hospital is erected.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC.

The engine and generator was shipped and the switchboard sent only a month later, causing all kinds of inconvenience to us, having to wait for the installation, the rheostat, the most important part of the switchboard not mounted as promised and received only at the beginning of September when we had wired for it. No instructions were sent until the 12th of September, the gasoline tank on the engine was leaking and had to be repaired, the rheostat mounted after many troubles, and finally the generator not working at all, caused by a wire in the generator missing altogether, and this specially giving us trouble for days before the trouble could be found. This missing wire was either done before shipment or in transit, but the machine looked in perfect condition when received. Finally we had the troubles repaired and the plant is now very satisfactory. The Mission is now installing their wiring for lights and quartz light.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst.

It is quite true that this shipment was not handled in the way in which we like to take care of these orders, a fact which we very sincerely regret, and which has been fully explained to Mr. Bourget both by Telegram and Letter. It seems to us only fair to ourselves to mention that the question of the leaking Gasoline Tank, and missing generator Wire, are two things for which we are not responsible. Since this plant was assembled and tested in our own shop in Winnipeg, we are quite confident that it was absolutely in first class shape when it left here and not only that but considerable time and expense was devoted to the making of a strong rugged crate, as we realized the transportation conditions in the far north would require this.\n\nNevertheless we very much regret that Mr. Bourget found it necessary to include an adverse report on the handling of this order and we can assure you that no effort will be spared to make certain that future orders from the Department of Indian Affairs will be handled in such a way that there will be no cause for complaint.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE CANADIAN FAIRBANKS MORSE COMPANY LTD.\n\nJ.

It is my opinion, however, that there must have been some error in making up the quotation, and I am writing you with a view to having the matter adjusted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C.

H. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA few days after I wired you from Lebret on the 17th of January, a letter from Fort Resolution informed me that our old St-Joseph's Residential School had nearly been destroyed by fire which was caused by the explosion of the acetylene plant in use satisfactorily for over twenty years.\n\nThe school was prevented from being a complete loss by the efforts of the priests, lay-brothers and the people of the settlement who were in the vicinity of the building at the time. This accident renders more urgent the necessity of installing an electric plant next spring, and I trust you will see your way clear to include the $6000 required for the plant in this year's estimates.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable reply at the above address and thanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Athabasca,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\nFebruary 6, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 31st ultimo, requesting that an amount of $6,000 be provided to install an electric light plant, next spring, in the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School.\n\nOwing to recent instructions of the Treasury Board for a drastic cut in our Estimates for the next fiscal year, I regret that I cannot hold out any hope of funds being available to meet the cost of installing the lighting plant.\n\nI am sorry to learn of the damage that was incurred by the explosion of the acetylene plant.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

It was simply miraculous that the whole building was not gutted by fire.\n\nAs this carbide is their only means of lighting the establishment, I suggested that electricity be installed all through the building. The Mission's answer was that they could not afford it, but possibly, if they had any help, they might do it early this spring.\n\nConsequently, my suggestion to the Department would be that one-half of the expenses be carried by the Department and I am told the Mission would carry the other half.\n\nKindly let me know at your earliest convenience what the Department is prepared to do in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 12, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, with reference to installing an electric light plant in the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School.\n\nRight Rev.

It was due to the energy and the courage of the Sisters and Brothers that the building was saved from complete destruction. For safety's sake it seems most desirable that an electrical plant be installed at once and ready for next winter.\n\nFrom an interview with the Minister of the Interior on May 29th, I am persuaded that, as you have suggested, authorization could easily be obtained for a grant to be taken from the funds for general expenses, without having recourse to any additional appropriation.\n\nI would highly appreciate it if a reply were sent without delay to Edmonton, 9916 --110th St., where I shall stop for a few days and have the opportunity of ordering the required material.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 916-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nJune 9, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the first instant, regarding the need of installing an electric lighting plant in the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School, to replace the present acetylene system.\n\nOur Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year was considerably reduced and no funds to pay the cost of a lighting plant were provided for this school. I am not able, at the present time, to state definitely whether funds for the purpose can be found in the appropriation. This will depend on the savings that can be effected during the year.

McGill,\nDeputy Supt. of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn my return from the North, I am forwarding you a photo of our electric plant as installed at our Fort Resolution school with the generous assistance of your Department. I am pleased to state that the plant is running perfectly and giving full satisfaction.\n\nMay I take this opportunity of asking you to be kind enough to include in the next estimates the required funds to have a similar plant installed in our Fort Providence Residential School where we still have to use gas lamps. You are aware of the fact that with such a large number of children in school, we must be provided with all available protection against fire. The sum of money required is approximately $3200.00 which is $200.00 over and above the cost of the plant at Fort Resolution because of the higher freight and the fare of the workers who come to install the plant.\n\nTrusting that you will see your way clear to have the required amount included in the estimates, I remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nGB/BL.\n\nBishop of Adramyte.\nNovember 12, 1936.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant, enclosing a photo of the electric light plant installed at the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School.

There were many demands for repairs and equipment at our residential schools, and no funds were included to cover the cost of installing a lighting plant at Providence Mission. I am not aware at the present time what funds will be available for next year. Your request was received after our Estimates for the current fiscal year were prepared and submitted to Treasury.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. McGill:\n\nYour letter of November 10th to hand.\n\nWith regard to my request for a grant to install an electric plant at our Providence Mission Indian Residential School, I note that my request reached you too late to be included in the estimates for the current fiscal year.\n\nMay I be allowed to state that I have never been notified of the proper time to present our demands for financial assistance. It is true that, owing to my continual travelling in the North, I might have been too late anyway. However, if it is too late to have provision made in the regular estimates for this year, may I hope that you will find your way clear to have such provision included in the next supplementary estimates?\n\nIndeed, it would be unfair to us should the four residential schools of my Vicariate be deprived of their share of the assistance regularly given by your Department for needy equipment, repairs and improvements. It is obvious that fire protection an electrical plant is badly needed in our Providence School, and the per capita grant is hardly sufficient to cover the current expenses of the year.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to ask you if the Department has taken into consideration my two previous demands:\n\n1 - An outright grant of $2500. for the building of our school at Chipewyan.\n\n2 - An adjustment of our per capita grant so as to have it on the same basis as that allowed for many years past at the Anglican school of Carcross and also at St-Paul's Hostel, the children of which attend the public school in Dawson.\n\nIt seems to me, as you acknowledged it when we discussed the matter in Ottawa, that the same treatment should be granted to us owing to the fact that we have to pay heavy freight rates. At any rate, the two above demands were made in time and thoroughly discussed with your Department for the last two years.\n\nMay I hope that your Department has not overlooked to have necessary provision made in the current year's estimates so as to meet our just request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Athabasca.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 916-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 19th, 1937.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat,\n\nI received your letter of November 30th last, requesting a grant of $2,500.00 towards the rebuilding of the Indian residential school at Fort Chipewyan, also an adjustment of the per capita grants allowed to the Indian residential schools in your diocese.\n\nAt the time your letter was received, the Estimates for the next fiscal year were under consideration and I delayed my reply until a final decision was made regarding the amount of money that would be placed at our disposal for the next fiscal year.\n\nOwing to the strict orders received to keep our next year's Estimates to the same amount as the current year's appropriation, I regret that it was not found possible to give favourable consideration to either of your requests.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\n\nRight Rev.

This last figure is only approximate, as I left at Fort McMurray the invoices regarding this Mower but there might be a difference of $2.00 or $3.00 only.\n\nWe have been somewhat surprised to see that no provision had been made for our Residential School at Aklavit, and we would appreciate very much if the Department could take in consideration the fact that we have been purchasing this year for that school a new equipment amounting to the sum of $795.00, and consisting of three reservoirs for water and an Electric Bread Mixer, same as the one purchased for Fort Resolution.\n\nIn any case, if the Department prefers to transfer to the school of Aklavit the amount granted for the school of Fort Resolution Providence, we would think that there should be some compensation for the expenses incurred by purchasing the equipment mentioned above.\n\nThanking you for past favors, I beg to remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

I regret that I did not advise you regarding the amount provided for the Aklavik School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the current fiscal year the following amounts were provided:\n\n- Aklavik - $500.00\n- Fort Resolution - $300.00\n- Fort Providence - $300.00\n\nTotal $900.00\n\nI understand from your letter that you have purchased the following equipment for the above mentioned three schools:\n\n- Fort Resolution - Bread Mixer - $394.25\n- Fort Providence - Mower - $106.00\n- Aklavik - Water reservoirs and Bread Mixer - $725.00\n\nTotal $1295.25\n\nYou may forward the accounts to the amount of $1295.25 for our consideration. It may be possible to pay the full amount, but at least we will allow the total amount provided in the current year's appropriation. All accounts submitted should be in triplicate and properly certified. If you have already paid the accounts, they should, of course, be resubmitted in order to permit us to make refund to the Diocese of Mackenzie.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Father J.

On the same trip I brought a few hundred pounds of flour from the I.D. supply at Resolution to Rocher River where the supply was running low.\n\nTo a few exceptions every pupil is or was sick, necessitating the closing of school on February 20th.\n\nAmong the pupils, mostly members of the Dog-Rib Band from Fort Rae, were more severely affected and of these, the girls seem to suffer more and have less resistance to the disease.\n\nThis epidemic of Flu came with the sudden change to cold weather after a comparatively mild spell.\n\nJ.

A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs per instructions received from Archbishop Breynat, I wrote to the Department on November 12th last in connection with the repairs and equipment proposed for the Indian Residential schools located in the MacKenzie diocese for the fiscal year 1940-1941.\n\nIn the above mentioned letter, I took for granted that the total amount which was supposed to be allotted in the estimates would be approximately $3500. At least, this was the figure given to me by Mr. Phelan in his office last October. This amount was detailed as follows:\n\n| SCHOOL       | EQUIPMENT |\n|--------------|-----------|\n| Fort Providence | 1,700.00 |\n| Fort Resolution | 1,000.00 |\n| Aklavik      | 800.00    |\n\nAt the same time, I wrote to the Department for the purchase of a laundry washer destined to the Indian School at Fort Resolution.\n\nIt seems that the time has now come to give you more details concerning other equipment, and I have been asked by Archbishop Breynat to submit the attached list covering repairs and equipment needed at the schools of Aklavik and Fort Providence.\n\nThe intention of the Archbishop is to repair the ceilings at both schools, as the Spring weather has deteriorated them badly. Therefore, we have prepared a list of the material needed in connection with these repairs, keeping in mind to cut down requirements to the minimum. A few other things needed for the equipment at Aklavik have been added to the list. We hope that the Department will give to it its favourable consideration.\n\nWhile we have no special recommendations to make as to the firms from which the material might be purchased, we think it advisable to mention that the ordinary spruce lumber could be advantageously purchased from the Mc Innes' Products Corporation at Waterways; the lumber while being of average quality, is much lower in price than that purchased in Edmonton.\nWe wish to mention that purchases should be made not later than June 15th in order to have the material delivered at Waterways early enough for transportation by the Hudson's Bay Company to Akleivik and Fort Providence.\n\nTrusting that the estimates voted will enable you to comply with this request, and with anticipated thanks, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

If so, our experience in the past indicates that such operation wears out the batteries and consequently for several years past we have been instructing Principals of residential schools that no machinery must be operated from the electric light plant. It should be used exclusively for lighting purposes.\n\nYou could, of course, operate the washer with a small gasoline engine.\n\nPlease let me hear from you in this regard at the earliest possible date in order that the purchase of the washer may not be unnecessarily delayed.\n\nThe attached report for the fiscal year ended March 31, 1940, has been received from the Principal of the Fort Resolution School. You will note that she answers very few of the questions on the form and as a result it is of very little practical use to us. Please arrange to have all questions on the form answered and returned to us as soon as convenient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nR.C. Missions of Mackenzie,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr Hoey,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 29th instant dealing with our request for a washer to be purchased in favour of the Fort Resolution Residential School, same to be equipped with a 1 H.P. electric motor direct current. It is noted from your letter that the Department is against the policy of operating any machinery from the electric light plant, for the reason that such operations wear out the batteries and necessitate their replacement earlier than in the normal course of operation.\n\nHowever, we wish to inform the Department that it has never been our intention, when using any machinery operated by electric power, to depend on our batteries for that. We then supply the necessary power by running the diesel motor connected with the dynamo, so that no extra current over the output of the batteries is ever used. We have this procedure followed in each of our missions, Fort Smith, Fort Resolution, Fort Providence, Aklavik, and from our experience during the past years, we cannot help but saying that our batteries set is lasting as long as any set under normal conditions.\n\nSpeaking of the economical viewpoint, we found that it was cheaper to operate thus than to buy small gasoline engine for such machinery. As the Department is aware, diesel crude oil is cheaper than gasoline and one uses less crude oil than gasoline for the same power. On the other hand, the washer contemplated is to be in service once every two weeks only. We therefore feel certain that, cost for cost, it would be more expensive for us to operate such a washer with a gasoline engine than with electric motor, provided the method we follow is applied. Unless the Department has serious objection against it, we insist on having the washer requested for Fort Resolution equipped with a 1 H.P. Electric motor, D.C.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, I thank you for forwarding me the report you had received from the Principal of the Fort Resolution School for fiscal year 1939-40. I am giving instructions to Sister Lapointe to complete her report and to have it returned to you as early as possible.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ.

Connor & Son, Ltd., Ottawa, - but apparently we have never as yet received any order # 2517, or any record of such an order. We were wondering if the order may have gone astray, or if by any chance the order may not have come to our company. It may have been awarded to some other firm. In which case it is possible that the Connor Company is supplying the washer, - so we have advised them of your change of address; and are forwarding the information to them regarding the Northern Transportation shipments on the Mackenzie River.\n\nIf it is not asking too much, - would you check up on Order 2517, and if by any chance it has been issued to Bruce Robinson Electric, will you mail us copy of the order, so stating; and would you mind telephoning the J. H. Connor Co., Ottawa, advising them regarding this change, as there has been already two weeks delay in the loss of the order, so it would be well to get going on it right away.

Indian Residential Schools of the Mackenzie District, we beg to submit herewith a detailed list of what we would require for the fiscal year 1941-42. This list for each of the four schools has been prepared according to instructions received from His Exc. Archbishop Breynat and it is his wish that the Department would give to it its favorable consideration pending the amount of money appropriated for that purpose.\n\nThe suggestions we have been making on these lists with regard to firms from which one or the other of the purchases could be made have no other aim than to give some specifications as to material or equipment requested, without desiring to interfere in any respect with the purchasing branch. It is immaterial for us that the order would be given to this or that firm, provided what we receive would be suitable for our purpose and would be delivered on time by next summer's boats.\n\nIn connection with transportation, we felt that the total paid last summer by the Department for freight charges from Waterways, Alta., to each school had the result to curtail to a considerable extent the amount appropriated for purchases. We were somewhat disappointed in seeing that so many hundreds of dollars allotted for repairs and equipment would in fact go to transportation companies operating from Waterways.\n\nTherefore Archbishop Breynat has requested me to point out to the Department that it would be more satisfactory to us if the Department would undertake to pay freight charges as far as Waterways only and would leave it up to us to have it delivered to destination. Such a policy has been followed until last summer and we hope that the Department will have no objection about it. Reason for our asking this is because we undertake every summer to carry ourselves in our own boats most of the freight consigned to our schools down the Mackenzie District, saving thus a valuable amount of money. This policy would enable us to have a larger share spent on the purchases only, instead of having a great proportion of the allotments devoted for paying freight charges to commercial Companies.\nMr Ph.

La batteuse Champion est vendue d\u2019ordinaire pour \u00eatre actionn\u00e9e par un pouvoir de 3 \u00e0 7 C.V. suivant les accessoires qu\u2019on y ajoute tels qu\u2019empacheur, \u00e9l\u00e9vateur et soufflet. Elle peut aussi \u00eatre mont\u00e9e sur un camion, \u00e0 un co\u00fbt additionnel raisonnable.\n\nLa batteuse Forano est la seule parmi les petits mod\u00e8les de batteuses poss\u00e9dant un chasse-paille sp\u00e9cial. Au lieu d\u2019une t\u00f4le perfor\u00e9e ordinaire, le fond du chasse-paille est form\u00e9 de petites feuilles d\u2019acier pli\u00e9es, tr\u00e8s rigides, pos\u00e9es sur le travers, entre lesquelles il y a assez d\u2019espace pour laisser passer toutes les balles et le grain. Il en r\u00e9sulte une s\u00e9paration plus rapide, \u00e9liminant la perte du grain et assurant une plus longue dur\u00e9e. Les barbillons d\u2019orge ne peuvent s\u2019accumuler sur le fond du chasse-paille, \u00e9vitant ainsi une perte consid\u00e9rable de bon grain.\n\nLe cylindre est compos\u00e9 de 9 barres ou supports de dents et chaque barre est faite d\u2019une partie de bois entre deux d\u2019acier, lui assurant une grande r\u00e9sistance et une grande souplesse.\n\nLes dents sont \u00e0 \u00e9paulement carr\u00e9.\n\nDes graisseurs \u00e0 pression sont fournis sur tous les coussinets.\n\nUne batteuse FORANO est toujours plus facile \u00e0 maintenir en parfaite condition; elle requiert moins de pouvoir, fait un meilleur travail et si vous faites du battage pour d\u2019autres, elle vous a vite cr\u00e9\u00e9 une bonne r\u00e9putation et un revenu assur\u00e9.\n\nR\u00e9f\u00e9rez \u00e0 la page 9 pour illustrations du cylindre, des tables, des dents et des parties du soufflet.\n\n**DIMENSIONS**\n\n- **Cylindre**: 24\" de largeur, 9 barres\n- **Arbre du cylindre**: diam\u00e8tre\n- **Coule**: 5\" x 5\" ou 7\" x 7\"\n- **R\u00e9solutions**: 1050 \u00e0 1100\n- **Poids**: 1380 lbs.\n- **Capacit\u00e9**: Avoine, 35 \u00e0 60 minots \u00e0 l\u2019heure\n- **Pouvoir requis, sans soufflet**: 3 \u00e0 5 C.V.\n- **Pouvoir requis, avec soufflet**: 6 \u00e0 7 C.V.\n- **rang\u00e9es de secoueurs de paille**: 4\n- **Chasse-paille int\u00e9rieur**: 33\" x 8'3\" de longueur\n\n**LA FONDERIE DE PLESSISVILLE**\n\n**Manufacturiers des produits depuis 1873**\n\n**FORANO**\nBATTEUSE FORANO - CL\u00c9MENT\n\n(BREVET\u00c9E)\n\nNo. 2053\n\nNous vous pr\u00e9sentons ici la batteuse Forano-Cl\u00e9ment, nouveau mod\u00e8le, unique dans son genre, et le principe est prot\u00e9g\u00e9 par brevets. L'inventeur est un praticien qui, avec la coop\u00e9ration de nos ing\u00e9nieurs, a r\u00e9ussi \u00e0 d\u00e9velopper une machine qui d\u00e9passe toute attente tant au point de vue qualit\u00e9 que quantit\u00e9.\n\nIl s'agit d'une batteuse relativement simple de construction, requ\u00e9rant peu de pouvoir et d'une capacit\u00e9 surprenante, consid\u00e9rant le pouvoir requis. Elle est de 4 pieds plus courte que les autres batteuses en bois parce que le chasse-paille est plac\u00e9 au-dessous du crible et le secouage ou la s\u00e9paration du grain d'avec la paille commence sous le cylindre. Cet item diminue la longueur de 2 pieds comparativement aux autres mod\u00e8les en bois dont le dessous du cylindre est inutilis\u00e9; aussi, la construction du soufflet est-elle extr\u00eamement plate. Le soufflet est pos\u00e9 de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00eatre au-dessus de la longueur du moulin, est fix\u00e9 en sens contraire, c'est-\u00e0-dire en travers de la batteuse. Il n'est pas n\u00e9cessaire d'avoir un talon pour conduire la balle du crible au soufflet car la partie ext\u00e9rieure du crible et du chasse-paille est en ligne avec l'arri\u00e8re du moulin. De cette fa\u00e7on, tout le mat\u00e9riel tombe directement dans le soufflet, except\u00e9 le grain, bien entendu. Ce dernier a pris une autre direction et nous en parlerons plus loin.\n\nLe soufflet est tr\u00e8s solidement fix\u00e9 \u00e0 la batteuse au moyen de pentures. Pour avoir acc\u00e8s \u00e0 l'int\u00e9rieur du moulin, pour changer les passes ou pour tout autre ajustement, vous n'avez qu'\u00e0 d\u00e9placer un taquet \u00e0 main dispos\u00e9 \u00e0 cette fin. Nous tenons aussi \u00e0 attirer l'attention sur la table d'alimentation qui est situ\u00e9e au-dessus des essieux. La table d'alimentation est peu \u00e9troite, chose appr\u00e9ciable surtout pour une batteuse sans empocheur automatique. C'est donc un mod\u00e8le pratique pour le battant ambulant qui d\u00e9sire un moulin requ\u00e9rant peu d'espace pour se placer n'importe o\u00f9, m\u00eame dans les plus petites granges.\n\nLe fond du chasse-paille est form\u00e9 de petites feuilles d'acier, pli\u00e9es, tr\u00e8s rigides, entre lesquelles il y a suffisamment d'espace pour laisser passer toutes les balles, les graines ou le grain. Il y a aussi des listi\u00e8res de bois dentel\u00e9es, qui soul\u00e8vent le foin ou la paille et permettent aux graines ou aux grains de s'\u00e9chapper plus facilement.\n\nCONCLUSIONS DES CONNAISSANTS: La batteuse Forano-Cl\u00e9ment est simple et courte, elle fait un travail sup\u00e9rieur \u00e0 toutes machines jusqu'ici connues et elle devrait \u00eatre la favorite de tous ceux qui veulent une bonne batteuse, \u00e0 un prix moyen.\n\nLe crible \u00e9tant plac\u00e9 au-dessus du chasse-paille, la balle, les graines ou les grains qui ont \u00e9t\u00e9 s\u00e9par\u00e9s du foin ou de la paille, sont conduits au crible au moyen d'un \u00e9l\u00e9vateur qui est compos\u00e9 d'une cha\u00eene double sans fin avec palettes, faisant le tour de la batteuse. Le mouvement donn\u00e9 \u00e0 ce dernier \u00e9limine tout danger de congestion, m\u00eame si le grain est humide.\n\nLa fabrication du crible et du chasse-paille est la m\u00eame que la batteuse Qu\u00e9bec except\u00e9 que ces derniers sont chang\u00e9s de position. L'empocheur consiste en une petite bo\u00eete en-dessous du crible et de la hauteur voulue pour les sacs.\n\nCe mod\u00e8le est toujours vendu complet avec soufflet, camion, empocheur et \u00e9l\u00e9vateur.\n\nLa batteuse Forano-Cl\u00e9ment est aussi vendue avec appareil \u00e0 tr\u00e9fle, lorsque d\u00e9sir\u00e9.\n\nLA FONDERIE DE PLESSISVILLE\nPLESSISVILLE, P.

The wooden tank which has been in use for several years has rotted away and is beyond repair. It has to be replaced or three or four smaller tanks could be installed so as to store a larger quantity of water.\n\nPreviously the water level in the bay was high and water was easily available but now due to low water and the danger of it being contaminated if taken too close to the shores, it has to be pumped or carried from a long distance.\n\nI mentioned the installation of smaller tanks because the exit from the basement of the School is too narrow to allow a larger tank and small ones could be put in more convenient places, and the water used for drinking purposes will have to be treated with Chlorinated Lime and one or two tanks could be used for that purpose.\n\nI enquired in Edmonton regarding these tanks and the tinsmith at the Western Steel Co; whom I met through Mr. Wright from the Ashtown Hardware Ltd., recommended corrugated galvanized iron.\n\nGauge 22 for the sides and Gauge 20 for the bottoms. Each tank, capacity of 1000 gallons, would be six feet in diameter and 5 feet high, made up of two sections. The bottom section would be shipped made up at the shop and the upper section could be riveted and soldered.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 9, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to water tanks for the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School. Mr. Phelan has taken a note of your recommendation and the tanks will be ordered in time to reach Waterways before the opening of navigation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Indian residential schools in the MacKenzie Diocese during the fiscal year 1940-41, and you advised me that you could not at that time let us know definitely what amount would be available as you had to wait until the appropriations would be voted by Parliament.\n\nI presume that you are at present in possession of sufficient information regarding this matter, and it would be appreciated if you would kindly let us know what amount has been appropriated for our schools.\n\nAttached to our letter of October 31st last were lists, showing in detail what we were asking the Department to purchase for schools at Fort Chipewyan, Fort Resolution, Fort Providence and Aklavik.\n\nIf it would not cause you too much inconvenience, we would be pleased to know whether we could hope that repairs and equipment listed for each place will be provided during this coming summer.\n\nThanking you for past favours, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

We can arrange for these purchases immediately after the first of April and that will ensure their reaching Waterways soon after, if not before, navigation opens.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.

Indian Residential Schools of the MacKenzie Diocese.\n\nWhile we appreciate very much your endeavours in trying to have the usual amount appropriated for repairs and equipment, we are under the impression that there is some confusion between specifications mentioned in your letter and demands made by us to the Department on October 31st last.\n\nWe detailed repairs and equipment that we wished for the year 1941 and we attached these lists to our letter of the above mentioned date. If you would kindly refer to these lists, you will undoubtedly see what we are expecting of the Department in connection with the amounts to be appropriated for repairs and equipment.\n\nSince these lists were proposed according to the decision of Archbishop Breynat, we would indeed be very glad if the Department could make purchases as specified thereon.\n\nIn case you would like another copy of these lists, I shall be very pleased to have one forwarded to you immediately.\n\nAs mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter, we feel sure that if purchases are made in April, it will be early enough since it gives time for the material to be delivered at the various schools during the navigation season.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFOR THE R.C.

It would also facilitate the visits of the children whose parents live along the shores of Great Slave Lake.\n\nI had previously mentioned an outboard because on this lake, it is much easier to get about, than with a boat equipped with an inboard engine.

However, in view of the report of the Indian Agent, I feel that it would be desirable to secure the new water jacket for this motor also and I am requesting Indian Commissioner to secure this in Vancouver.

Johnson Motor, which is surplus to the West Coast Agency\nrequirements, to Fort Resolution Indian Residential School, it\nbeing noted that it would require a new water jacket.\n\nIn this connection, I would advise that it was necessary\nto get in touch with Mr. Ashbridge and ascertain the serial\nnumber and model of this motor in order to find out if repair\nparts were available, and I am informed by Hoffars Limited,\nVancouver, the Agents, that the water jacket and cylinder block\nassembly, which is cast integral with the cylinder blocks,\ncosts $15.00, but that the labour and the other sundry items\nwould probably bring the cost to $20.00 mentioned in your\nletter. Consequently, I have asked Mr. Ashbridge to forward\nthe motor to the Company.\n\nI would recommend that I be given authority to have any\nadditional small repairs necessary carried out before shipping\nthe machine up to Fort Resolution.\n\nFor D.M.

It might be well, however, to have your Edmonton representative check on this shipment to see that there is no undue delay in re-routing from Edmonton to Waterways.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited,\n146 Alexander Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nFort Resolution, July 29th 1943\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training\nOttawa\n\nRe: 159-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI don't like to importune anybody, but I need badly the Johnson 4 H.P. motor. Here the Indian children don't go home for the vacations; I like to give them some pleasure on the islands; because they like to go on the water. Since your last letter April 28th, I did not hear about that motor.\n\nMuch obliged\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. L.

It will be necessary to have this item in a more detailed manner showing the number of hours the men were employed and the rate per hour.\n\nI received a letter today from the Rev. Principal of the Fort Resolution School dated July 29, in which he states that the motor has not yet reached him. I presume from the attached account that the repairs were not completed until about the middle of July and I should appreciate your advising Rev. J.L. Riou, Principal, Indian Residential School, Fort Resolution, N.W.T., regarding the date on which the motor was shipped.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, with reference to the motor which the Department promised to obtain for you. Before shipping it to Fort Resolution it was decided to make some repairs and these were not completed until about the middle of July. I presume that Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., has arranged for shipment of this and the motor is probably in transit at the present time. However, I am today writing to Major MacKay requesting him to advise you the exact date on which the motor left Vancouver.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.L.

We are very grateful\nto you for securing these batteries, and we\nassure you that they will be satisfactory in\nevery way.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nCharles Gilles O.M.I.\n(Charles Gilles O.M.I.)\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 25-32 thrust washer          | 1        | .20        |       |\n| 13-409 thrust disc           | 1        | .06        |       |\n| 13-570 propeller nut         | 1        | .05        |       |\n| 25-52 thrust socket bolt     | 1        | .75        |       |\n| set gaskets                  | 1        | .80        |       |\n| 14-291 propeller shaft       | 1        | 4.50       |       |\n\nLabor: 10 hours @ $1.75 per hour\n\nTotal: 62.31\n| Item Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price |\n|----------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| 3-40 screen                      | 1        | .00        |\n| 14-306 rubber grip               | 1        | .50        |\n| 72-875 coil                      | 1        | 7.20       |\n| 72-736 breaker blades            | 2        | 1.00       |\n| 71-1146 breaker point screws     | 2        | .50        |\n| Ignition leads                   | 2        | .50        |\n| Stop wires                       | 2        | .25        |\n| 25-2 muffler                     | 1        | 6.40       |\n| 26-11 cylinder block             | 1        | 15.00      |\n| 25-25 piston rings               | 4        | .40        |\n| 25-17 con rod locks              | 4        | .04        |\n| 25-30 muffler to cyl. studs (S) | 2        | .08        |\n| 25-23 muffler to cyl. studs (L) | 2        | .08        |\n| 1/8 pipe plug 51-13              | 1        | .30        |\n| 13-405 screws                    | 2        | .06        |\n| 13-405 thrust bearing            | 1        | .06        |\n| 13-158 propeller shaft bushing   | 1        | .03        |\n| 13-40 shear pin                  | 1        | .02        |\n| 13-332 cotter pin                | 1        |            |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 916-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\n**TREASURY ONLY**\n\nPay to: Hoffars Limited,\n\nAddress: 1790 Georgia St., West,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| July 14 | For repairs to the Johnson outboard motor and labour on same, as per attached account. | $62.31 |\n\n(Said motor is surplus to the requirements of West Coast Agency and is being transferred to the Fort Resolution Indian Residential School, Fort Resolution, N.W.T.)\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MGD\nAugust 9, 1947.\n\nRe - Fort Resolution Roman Catholic Residential School\n\nI inspected the above mentioned school on June 7th and 8th, examined the building and observed the instruction given by the staff.\n\nRepresentatives of the Mission informed me that the school building is quite inadequate and should be replaced as soon as possible. After checking the building carefully I concur in this view. The building presents a real fire hazard. The foundation is decayed and heaved. The class rooms are small and unhealthy. It is therefore recommended that the replacement of this building be an item on the Educational Building Program for the Northwest Territories.\n\nI encountered considerable criticism of the school on the part of residents of the Settlement. Many complained that the children were not learning very much by attendance. While such statements are not uncommon wherever a school is functioning, I do feel that a good deal of such criticism could be mitigated by making the instruction in each class more practical and vocational. For example, the instructional program in every school ought to include some training in sewing, home economics, woodworking, leather craft, motor mechanics and machine shop practice. I have endeavoured to make an immediate start in this direction, and instructions have been issued to Mr. L.E. Drummond, Departmental Agent, to send forward to the various Residential schools in the Territories a bundle of mixed woods together with a kit of tools to be used in working same.\n\nThe members of the teaching staff are as follows:\n\nSister Edna Gagnon - holds a Model Diploma for the Province of Quebec, and has 18 years teaching experience. She teaches Grades 1 to 8, and has 23 Residential pupils and 18 Day school pupils, making a total enrolment of 41. Attendance at the time of the visit was 23, most of whom were beginners. The teacher is conscientious and interested in her work. The reading is very good, the writing is excellent, and the pupils are making good progress in their number work.\n\nSister Marguerite Bourlai - holds no teaching certificate but has fifteen years experience. She teaches Grades 1 and 2,\nhas 25 Residential pupils and 16 day school pupils, making a total enrolment of 41. There were 29 pupils in attendance at the time of the visit. I examined some of the hand work being done by the pupils, listened to their reading, and enjoyed the singing.\n\nSister Oliva Lavoie - holds a second class permanent Alberta Certificate and has taught for 19 years. She has Grades 1 to 7. The total pupilage is 125, made up of 78 Residential and 47 day school pupils. The school is equipped with a silent film projector. It does not receive Radio Broadcasts. The children received a medical examination and are X-rayed for T.B. on their arrival at school. They also received Dental and Eye examinations. This teacher is very industrious. The children's notebooks were exceptionally good.\n\nThe teachers in the Territories quite understandably are not familiar with the enterprize method of education now being used so successfully in the Provinces. Its most valuable feature is that it encourages and trains the children in self expression. On subsequent visits I hope that there will be an opportunity to discuss this method fully with the teachers at the various settlements.\n\nI would suggest that this school be furnished with a good set of Basic Readers. These are required in order that the native children may learn to read by the use of the most modern technique. The teachers have requested readers, knitting wool, prints for making aprons and dresses, and a sound film projector.\n\nThe teachers at these schools complain of the poor attendance and feel that some measures should be taken to remedy the condition. They feel that some authority other than the church should impress upon the parents the importance of sending a child to school. The teachers feel that school attendance is an important means of fighting the spread of T.B. They say housing conditions are very poor and that in many cases families are living on a starvation level.\n\nJ. W.

Bills of Lading in the said form will be signed on presentation of and in exchange for this advice.\nExtract from Annual Report on Fort Resolution Northwest Territories Agency dated 1947-1948.\n\nEducation\n\nThe great majority of Treaty Indian children who go to school attend St. Joseph's Residential School in Fort Resolution. A handful are to be educated at the new school in Hay River but none attend school at Yellowknife.\n\nResidential school is the most effective means at our disposal to improve the health of the children. They can be assured of adequate diet and complete medical care. All new pupils on entering the Fort Resolution school are given a complete medical check up, including X-Ray. They are inoculated against Diptheria and Whooping Cough and are vaccinated against Smallpox. Each fall this procedure is repeated as indicated. Each child is examined at monthly intervals by a hospital nurse and any lack of progress, for example, if there is no gain in weight, is brought to the attention of the Medical Superintendent and appropriate steps are taken.\n\nThe school building in Fort Resolution is outdated, dilapidated and a potential fire hazard. But the school, being filled with pupils, is serving its purpose. The building, however, should be replaced as soon as possible.\n\nDay schools would be feasible propositions in Fort Resolution and Hay River. A day school in Fort Resolution would take some of the burden off the residential school and allow it to function far better in its capacity as a boarding school. A day school does not afford provisions for proper medical care of the pupils. Their segregation from open cases of Tuberculosis cannot be assured, and even if free from disease on admission, can contact Tuberculosis at any time. There can be very little control over their hygiene and none at all over their diet. In my opinion the outstanding need for a school is to assist in raising the health standards of the children and a day school cannot do this. These points apply particularly to Fort Rae where a residential school is badly needed.\n\nGame Regulations and the Indians\n\nIf the caribou are becoming so scarce that they cannot be used in Indian hospitals and schools, why can any white man obtain a license to kill five animals a year? Why should Mr. Leo Lirette of Fort Resolution, who is a hotel and restaurant keeper, a trucker and a mink farmer, be allowed to kill as many caribou as he wishes and one of the brothers on the Mission staff, who like Mr. Lirette...\nhas a trapping license, was told that he could kill only five and must eat them all himself? Why should I, or any of the white population be allowed to buy caribou meat while the Mission cannot buy caribou meat to serve to the Indian patients who do not like beef? The Mission would be willing to buy their caribou meat and the purchase of this would mean a slight addition to the income of the Indians of this area.\n\nMalnutrition is a welfare problem; if the Indians depended more on their original diet, the state of their nutrition should improve. One person died this winter from Beri-Beri. There are not a few cases of minimal scurvy, more noticeable at this time of the year.\n\nThe population of Fort Resolution consists of 12 white families, about 200 Half-breeds, the Mission personnel and D.O.T. employees. It is the headquarters for 48 Indian families, all Chipewyans, totalling 116 people.\n\nDue to a complete lack of recreational facilities and to the Indian disinclination to discipline children, there is a high rate of juvenile delinquency. Since the young adults lack financial security there are few marriages and many illegitimate births.\n\nThe future for a young man growing up in Fort Resolution is uncertain. The building of a community hall would help to solve the recreational problem and a small sawmill might, by increasing employment, raise the standard of living.\n\nThe capacity of the Fort Resolution hospital will be doubled by this autumn; for this reason the Medical Superintendent of this agency will have to maintain his headquarters in this settlement.\nNote for File.\n\nFort Resolution Res.

Trocellier, O.M.I.,\nFort Smith,\nN.W.T.\n\nCher Seigneur et Excellence,\n\nLes \u00e9coles d'Aklavik de Fort R\u00e9solution et de Providence ont chacune droit pour l'ann\u00e9e courante, c'est-\u00e0-dire de janvier \u00e0 la fin d\u00e9cembre 1948 \u00e0 une augmentation de $30,00 par enfant. Celle de Chipewyan est de $20,05. Mais, on a mis \u00e0 l'obtention de cette augmentation une condition que votre \u00e9conomie n'a pas encore remplie. Il faut que les livres de comptes des \u00e9coles soient v\u00e9rifi\u00e9s par un comptable du D\u00e9partement. Il semble bien entendu que si vous ne consentez pas \u00e0 vous soumettre \u00e0 cette exigence, on ne paiera pas l'augmentation. Comme il s'agit dans l'occurrence d'une somme de plus de $7,000,00, vous voudrez peut-\u00eatre prendre les moyens n\u00e9cessaires pour obtenir une aide si pr\u00e9cieuse. Un autre point de vue qui devrait nous porter \u00e0 accepter ce r\u00e8glement du D\u00e9partement des Affaires Indiennes c'est que les \u00e9coles catholiques sont les seules qui ne s'y soient pas soumises.\n\nLe fr\u00e8re Michel Dabrowski \u00e9tait de passage ici hier. Je l'ai accompagn\u00e9 au D\u00e9partement de l'Immigration pour obtenir une d\u00e9claration qui lui permettra de revenir au pays une fois que son voyage aura \u00e9t\u00e9 termin\u00e9. Le Commissaire de l'Immigration lui a conseill\u00e9 de ne pas aller en Pologne imm\u00e9diatement, mais d'attendre plut\u00f4t l'ann\u00e9e prochaine lorsqu'il aura obtenu son certificat de naturalisation, car il court bien des risques d'\u00eatre retenu ind\u00e9finiment en Pologne. Je suis de l'avis du Commissaire et j'ai endoss\u00e9 le conseil qu'on lui avait donn\u00e9. Il va donc retourner \u00e0 Fort R\u00e9solution le plus t\u00f4t possible et attendre \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e prochaine sinon \u00e0 plus tard pour faire son voyage.\n\nAffectueusement v\u00f4tre en N.-S. et M.

As this trip was made just after the opening of the school term I believe it worthwhile to report on my observations at each point.\n\nOn September 12th, I flew with C.P.Airlines from Yellowknife to Fort Resolution. I visited the Residential School and they seemed to be anxious to do as much for the children as was possible. I had only visited the school once before just before the close of the term and I am not able to say whether there is any change in routine carried out or not. The principal of this school has just taken over, having been at Aklavik for some time. This Sister seemed very anxious to get additional equipment for certain types of Vocational training.\n\nA request was received for three sewing machines and two typewriters. This request is being forwarded on a requisition form attached to this report.\n\nA check was made of Attendance returns and Applications for Admission to school. These will be going forward at the end of the month as it has been found that the Indian children, as a rule, return during almost any period of this month and it was felt that it would be better to send all applications in at one time.\n\nI have seen enormous progress at all the schools since last term and I believe we can look forward with confidence to the results that will be obtained from the new type of school in the Northwest Territories.\n\n(Sgd.)

Neary\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe; Ft. Resolution Indian Residential School. Your file 916-5 (B1)\n\nFurther to my letter of Sept. 27th, the mission school have indicated that they would like a typewriter with a long carriage of 18\" if possible. This seems long to me for the type of work that should be undertaken for the training of typists in this country. At the present time I am using a 13\" carriage Remington typewriter in my office and have found it adequate for all my work. The long carriage typewriter is heavy to operate and for training I would favor the 15\".\n\nOn my requisition sheet for both sewings and the typewriter I had given the date required as June 1st. 1950, it being my intention that the shipment should be in Waterways Alberta on that date for shipment via. N.T.C.L. during the first of the season when shipments are easier to route into places like Resolution which, though on the lake are a few miles off the down river route, and boats do not like to stop unless they have full loads.\n\nIt is very desirable to have shipments at Waterways early otherwise we are often forced to make special trips to out-of-the-way places and can have costly delays as we had at Ft. Rae this past summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nI.F. Kirkby,\nSupt. of Indian Agencies.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 27th, 1949.\n\nMr. I.F. Kirkby,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nRe.

These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nForm No. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? August 5th.\n\n2. At what time of day?\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? Dr. Armstrong.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? The patient took bed rest and was given cough syrup.\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? Cough syrup.\n\n6. When was the doctor called? August 5th.\n\n7. If the pupil was removed to hospital, at what time was this done and by what means of transport?\n\n8. If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school?\n\n9. Add any other useful information here.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nNote: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Ernestine Boghin from August 5th to November 26th. The immediate cause of death was Pulmonary Tuberculosis.\n\nThe contributory cause of death was Measles.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\nThis patient has been well looked after, from every point of view.\n\nM.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of ...............................................\n\n.................................................. Ernestine Boghin .................................................\n\nhave been recorded?

In this space record any recommendations which the Board consider should be made to the Department in relation to the health or safety of the pupils of this School.\n\nIf we had a hospital handy, special treatment might have been instituted in order to lengthen her life, as in many other cases. I am keeping an eye opened on two other similar cases, and I might decide to send them to Smith's Hospital.\n\nThis girl was an orphan.\n\n..................................................................................................................................................................................................\n\nChairman\u2014Indian Agent.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6475)\n\nFile 916-5, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts - General Administration. 1908 - 1937\n\nFile 916-5, part 2\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts. 1937 - 1945\n\nFile 916-5, part 3\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Supplies-Accounts. 1945 - 1949\n\nFile 916-23, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Death of Pupils. 1935 -\n\nFile 917-8, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Architectural plan (Blueprint). 1948\n\nFile 918-1, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - General Administration. 1902 - 1929\n\nFile 918-2, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - Quarterly Returns. 1938 - 1952\n\nFile 918-5, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies-Accounts. 1912 - 1938\n\nFile 918-5, part 2\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies-Accounts. 1938 - 1949\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6475)\n\nFile 916-5, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts - General Administration. 1908 - 1937\n\nFile 916-5, part 2\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Building Maintenance-Supplies-Accounts. 1937 - 1945\n\nFile 916-5, part 3\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Supplies-Accounts. 1945 - 1949\n\nFile 916-23, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Death of Pupils. 1935 -\n\nFile 917-8, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Fort Resolution Residential School - Architectural plan (Blueprint). 1948\n\nFile 918-1, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - General Administration. 1902 - 1929\n\nFile 918-2, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - Quarterly Returns. 1938 - 1952\n\nFile 918-5, part 1\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies-Accounts. 1912 - 1938\n\nFile 918-5, part 2\nFort Resolution Agency - Providence Mission Residential School - Building Maintenance - Supplies-Accounts. 1938 - 1949\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 918-1 VOLUME 1\n\nSUBJECT PROVIDENCE MISSION\nRESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nGENERAL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM JULY 1902 TO MARCH 1929\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE TO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\n\nFILE ........................................

Sisters of Charity at Providence, MacKenzie Dr., and also taking into consideration their devotedness to these poor northern wards, with whom they have passed some forty years, and, in spite of great difficulties and poor living, have given every satisfaction.\n\nWe have much pleasure in giving our support to the application made in their favour, to the Government by His Lordship Right Rev.

On account of the wandering life of all the Indians, we are obliged to keep their children in a school, to lodge, to board and clothe them the whole year. Some are coming from a very great distance, even from Good Hope and Peel River. At the present time there are over sixty children in that school.\n\nIt is the first school established in the north, some forty years ago. Then the reindeer, covering the whole country, were largely providing for the greatest part of the food necessary for so many mouths. Now, for many years, they have been keeping far away in the north and east. The only food to be found all around, besides a few vegetables, is fish, often poor, when eatable at all, for we have to keep it from September to the end of July. The freight on provisions from outside is too high for our means.\n\nIt would seem but right if the Government would take a step to improve the situation of that well deserving school.\n\nYou have witnessed yourself the good done by our schools at Athabasca and on Peace River. You could not help\npraising publicly and highly the teachers and the mission-\naries. Let me tell you that if you ever go to Providence,\nyou will be no less surprised. Mr. Conroy, the inspector of\ntreaty No.8, went there last July and had an opportunity\nof seeing by himself the good done by the school. He greatly\nencouraged me in presenting you this request with the\nherewith enclosed petition signed by the white people of\nMackenzie Dt., many of them belonging to Protestant denomina-\ntions.\n\nIt is true the school itself is not within the limits\nof the treaty. But the government's generosity is not bound by\nthose limits. The Indians of the north are under its care and\nresponsibility. And it would not be the first example of a\nboarding school grant allowed by it to a school, even\nCatholic, out of the treaty. Such was the case at Lesser\nSlave Lake, before the treaty was made with the Indians;\nso it is yet, I believe, at Ile a la Crosse.\n\nDepending upon you for obtaining from the government\nthis grant so necessary, I remain\n\nYours truly\n\n(sgd.) X F.Breynat\nO.M.I.\nBishop of Adamayth\nApostolic Vicar of Mackenzie\n& Yukon.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose a copy of a letter from His Lordship Bishop Breynat, Apostolic Vicar of Mackenzie, supported by a petition signed by a number of gentlemen engaged in business or otherwise in the North Western regions, asking that the Boarding School at Fort Providence be recognized and supported by the Department.\n\nThese two documents explain themselves. As Fort Providence is not within treaty limits, I feel that I should not recommend the granting of the request. However, I beg to forward these documents not wishing to be at all in the way. It is quite true that the Isle a la Crosse school is not within treaty limits and thus creates a precedent as did the Lesser Slave Lake two Boarding Schools some years ago.\n\nThe institution such as it is can be described by Mr. Conroy who visited it during the year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 7th November, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nThe Indian Commissioner under date of the 31st ultimo forwards a copy of a letter from His Lordship Bishop Breynat, Apostolic Vicar of Mackenzie, supported by a petition signed by a number of business men of the north-western regions asking that the boarding school at Fort Providence be recognized and supported by the Department.\n\nFort Providence as you are aware, is just outside of Treaty 8 but the Department is making the usual allowance to it of the amount paid outside treaty day schools, namely $200.00 a year. This is one of the schools referred to in Mr Inspector Macrae's report of 7th December 1900 on the subject of education in Treaty 8, and for which recognition as a boarding school was recommended.\n\nRev. Father Husson, who has charge of the finances connected with the Roman Catholic schools outside treaty limits, brought this matter before the Department in March 1901, stating that they had 70 boarders supported by the mission, which was established 40 years ago.\n\nIn a marginal note on my memorandum on education matters in this district Mr McKenna states that Father Husson's application is to stand over until after Mr Conroy returns. On the 11th Nov. of that year I find that Mr Conroy recommends that the R.C. schools at Fort Vermillion and Wahuscow be recognized as boarding schools, which recommendation\nwas approved of and provision made for 15 pupils at each of these schools, which are however, within the limits of Treaty 8. No action was taken however, with regard to Fort Providence, which is, as I before stated outside treaty.\n\nOn a recent memorandum which I prepared regarding an application by the Methodists for a boarding school on Vancouver Island, both the Superintendent General and the Deputy were unfavorable to increasing the number of boarding schools for some time.\n\nHis Lordship, Bishop Breynat, refers to Mr Conroy, stating he greatly encouraged him in making this request and the Indian Commissioner states that the institution, such as it is, can be described by Mr Conroy, who visited it during the year. It might therefore, be well to ask Mr Conroy for a report.\n\nI forward file 134658, which deals with the requirements of Roman Catholic schools in the neighborhood of Treaty 8.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, 8th November, 1902.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reference to your letter No. 174,214, I would say that I visited Fort Providence last July and was asked by Bishop Brunet to visit the school at that point, and found it a very efficient school and, to my mind, was doing as good work as any school in the districts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector, Treaty No. 8.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTake up with Conroy the question of Boarding schools at Ponypoint & Extension of School work at Wanaseka & day school at Ringwood Lake\nOttawa, 20th Oct., 1902.\n\nMemorandum: Mr. Pedley,\n\nWith reference to the school at Providence, which I visited in the summer of 1902, I may say that I found it to be a very efficient boarding school. It was established many years ago by the Roman Catholic mission. The buildings are beautifully situated on the banks of the McKenzie river. While there Bishop Brezant asked me to visit the school and wanted me to recommend it to the Department for assistance, as they had about 70 pupils in attendance. I remember accurately telling the Bishop that as the school was outside treaty limits I could not see what could be done in the way of obtaining assistance; but told him he might write to the Commissioner and find out what could be done. As for the work done I do not think there is a better or more efficient school in the district.\n\nLast when at Wabuscaw I visited the school at that place and found that a new building had been erected for the purposes of a convent, with a staff of four Sisters as teachers. The building is very well arranged for boarding school purposes. They had at the time of my visit about 35 treaty children attending. This school is apparently doing good work, and it is well situated.\n\nAs for the day school at Sturgeon Lake, no building had been put up when I was there last summer.\nbut Bishop Guirard told me he contemplated building this last summer, and I have no doubt he has done so.\n\nI have my doubts as to the efficiency of a day school, as the Indians, in my opinion, do not take the same interest in sending their children to a day school as they do in sending them to a boarding school; and I am told by the traders and others living in the country that the Indian children will not attend regularly. When their parents take a notion to break camp they take all their family with them.\n\nInspector, Treaty 8.\nIt is stated that a number of the Treaty Indians attend the school at Providence. Is this the case, and if so, how many? How far from here is the nearest school house in existence? And how far are any Treaty Indians suffering from lack of school facilities near this place in regard to this?\nSir:\n\nIn reference to your memorandum asking how many Treaty Indian children were attending the school at Providence, I beg to say that there were none that I know of. I do not remember being told by Bishop Breazant how many, or if any.\n\nThe distance from Hay River to Providence is about 120 miles. Hay River has a good boarding-school run by the Anglican Church Mission Society. Last summer when at Resolution the R.C. Mission was building a convent for the purpose of a boarding-school with a staff of five Sisters, and I have no doubt that this school is now doing good work.\n\nThe distance from Resolution to Providence is 250 miles or thereabouts. This school is pretty central, as the Indians, as a rule, all trade at Resolution, in fact some from beyond the treaty limit come there to trade.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector, Treaty No. 8.\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 19th November, 1903\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application for the recognition of Fort Providence boarding school by the Department, I beg to say that this school is outside Treaty limits and as you will see from Mr Conroy's letter to you, it is not, as far as he is aware, attended by any Treaty children. The Roman Catholics who are applying for a grant, have lately established a boarding school at Fort Resolution, which is in receipt of a per capita grant of $72 for 25 children. Mr Conroy says that Ft. Resolution is centrally situated and all the Indians, as a rule, trade there, and in fact some of the Indians beyond treaty limits make that place their headquarters. Ft. Providence is about 250 miles distant from Ft. Resolution and it would be a long way to bring children, even if they had accommodation for them. The school at Ft. Providence has been long established and is, Mr Conroy says, doing good work. If the Department decides to recognize a non-treaty school it would appear to be worthy of recognition.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\nOTTAWA, 20th November, 1903\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 31st October, 1903, forwarding a communication from His Lordship, Bishop Breynat, Apostolic Vicar of Mackenzie, supported by a petition from a number of business men of the north-western regions, asking that the boarding school at Fort Providence be recognized and supported by the Department, I beg to say that after careful consideration, the Department is unable to do anything at present in this matter.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.:\nChurch of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary\n\nIn charge of the Oblate Fathers.\n\nVancouver, B.C. 25 March 1904\n\nTo the Deputy Minister\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir,\n\nRev. Father Macdonald, my agent, has called on you last fall on his way to Montreal, and though him you were presented with a request to the object of obtaining the usual grant allowed to Boarding School in favor of our establishment at Providence, McKenzie River. I have heard that you have been very kind to the Rev. Father, but at the said time, after listening to his exposition of the whole matter, have asked him to be allowed to study carefully the whole correspondence on the subject.\n\nThere are documents more than enough militating in favor of this grant and I am confident that we cannot but benefit by the result of your view.\n\nOur school at Providence numbers over 100 Indian pupils; it is kept by the Grey Nuns in as good a footing as any other north of Edmonton. It has been standing for 16 years and the country has benefited by it to such an extent that a request was presented by the majority of the Protestant community in order to obtain the usual grant for Boarding Schools in favor of our establishment at Providence. The only apparent good reason for refusing the grant is that appears that the location of our school is outside of treaty limits. But allow me to remark that there have been many instances of schools supported by the Government although not inside of treaty limits. We at the Cross also is outside of treaty limits and yet gets a Boarding School Grant.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOn the other hand there is a boarding school at Hay River which has received the name \"grand\" for 20 boarders. It is true the establishment is in need of great funds but I am told on good authority that the majority of the children do not belong to Great Britain. In fact there are perhaps only two pupils that are required in Great Britain. Now if the Dept is really impartial, it will at once acknowledge the good done by the Reverend Sisters, founders of the first establishment in the North of the Kenzie and favor us with a grant for all the pupils now on the roll. We can easily increase their number if we only get some encouragement from the Dept. and the necessary help in order to secure better accommodation.\n\nI hope that you will have my request filed up this year with the other estimates and that you will impress the commission with the justice of my application when the school question is brought up.\n\nMeanwhile I have the honor,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nto remain respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOTTAWA, 5th April, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Breynat, Vicar-Apostolic of Mackenzie, writing under date the 23rd ultimo from Victoria B.C., renews the application already made for the recognition of the Roman Catholic boarding school at Fort Providence on the North side of Great Slave Lake, outside treaty, by providing the usual per capita grant for 40 pupils, the number now in attendance. His Lordship makes a strong appeal for Government aid to this school which has been carried on by the Roman Catholics for nearly forty years. If it is the intention of the Department to recognize any more boarding schools outside treaty limits, this application is deserving of favorable consideration.\n\nI may add that similar applications made on behalf of this school have been refused on the ground that the Department was unable to do anything at the time. The last refusal was as late as 20th Nov. 1903.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to a memorandum from Mr Inspector Conroy dated 30th Oct. last and turned out on this file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\nHon. Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Interior.\n\nSir:\n\nMay I take the liberty of placing at your disposal my support of the application of the authorities of the Roman Catholic diocese of McKenzie River, to have the Indian boarding-school maintained at Providence placed on the same footing for assistance from the Indian Department as similar schools within treaty limits. I do not understand that any obligation is assumed by the Government to provide or maintain such schools when treaty is made with the Indians; if I understand the matter aright it is an act of grace on the part of the Government, believed to be in the general interest. There is no question as to the character of the work done by the school at Providence, or that if such schools are of value or are desirable anywhere that school is. I would therefore ask that the fact that it was not within treaty limits be not longer considered as a bar to its receiving the advantage of the Government grant.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nFrank Oliver.\n(Copy)\n\n(Received in Winnipeg 29th March 1904.)\n\nHon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou must have found it very strange not to receive even the slightest acknowledgement on my part of your success in bringing to a good end the request I had the honor of addressing you in order to obtain the usual Grant for a Boarding School at Fort Resolution. The fact of my not receiving any communication on this matter I had so much at heart, ever since I saw you last in Winnipeg, will explain my long silence.\n\nPlease accept, although late, my congratulations and my thanks. The school is doing very well, and if we have only a very limited number of pupils at present, it is only due to the want of accommodation. In the near future we hope to bring that number to fifty.\n\nI am sorry to hear that you were not so successful in forwarding the interest of our school at Providence. This establishment has to its credit 38 years of good standing and is very flourishing to-day. It seems that the only objection brought against us in refusing the Boarding School grant is that the location of this school is beyond the limits of Treaty 8. Now you know better than I do that many a school receives the Government Grant although outside of treaty limits. Ile a la Crosse is one to name only this one. I know also on good authority that the Hay River Protestant Mission has of late a grant for 20 pupils. It is true Hay River has its location inside of treaty limits, but what does it matter if the children brought to that school are not treaty Indians. It appears that out of the pupils on the Roll two or three only belong to the tribe. In fact this tribe number only about 100 Indians all told. Now this school has only a few years standing to its\nits credit, when on the other hand our establishment at Providence is the oldest school in the Athabasca and MacKenzie River Districts. The Grey Nuns have established it 38 years ago, and today it stands as good as any other with about 40 pupils on the Roll.\n\nYou are aware also that last year there was sent to the Department a petition in favor of this school. It was signed mostly by Protestants. Finally Mr. Conroy has reported, we know, very favorably on the said school, after having been an eye witness to what it could achieve.\n\nI place again today before you all these reasons pleading so strongly in favor of our establishment with the hope that you will insist on the propriety of adding this school to the number of those which receive the annual grant allowed to institutions of the same description.\n\nI have meanwhile the honor\n\nDear, Sir, to remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd.) x T. Breynat\n\nRev. Adiamyth\n\nVic Apost.of MacKenzie.\nSir,\n\nOn the 20th November last I received a letter from you in reply to an application from the Right Rev. the Roman Catholic Bishop of Mackenzie River, accompanied by a petition of a number of business men of the North-western regions asking that the Boarding School at Providence be recognized and supported by the Department, in which reply you state that the Department is unable to do anything at present in this matter. The purport of your answer was communicated to His Lordship, and in March last I received a letter from him (a copy of which is enclosed), in which he strongly urges that his application in favor of this School be reconsidered.\n\nIt is for the Department to say as a matter of policy whether they will extend the system of giving a per capita grant to Boarding Schools outside of treaty limits. They are beyond the range of visits and inspection of the officials of the Department, hence we have little opportunity of ascertaining the precise nature of their work. If the\n\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDepartment gives them a grant, in my opinion, it should require them to teach English. On this condition I would favour giving the Providence Boarding School a grant of $60.00 or $72.00 per pupil for forty pupils, the number which Bishop Breynat says is now on the roll.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa 14th May, 1904.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant, with enclosure, I have to inform you that question of making a grant to the P.C. Indian Boarding School at Providence will receive consideration, as will the other points raised in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe Hon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOTTAWA, 2nd August, 1904:\n\nSir,\n\nIn connection with previous correspondence relative to the application for a grant to the Roman Catholic boarding school at Providence, I beg to say that no provision has been made in this year's estimates for this school.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nHon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.:\nOttawa, 14th October, 1904.\n\nTo the Accountant: -\n\nRev. Father Husson called this morning to renew an application for a grant to School at Providence. He suggested that the surplus of the grant to the Fort Resolution School be utilized for part of the grant to the School at Providence.\n\nSo far as the application proper is concerned, a note of it might be made for next year's Estimates; but regarding the proposition to divide the Fort Resolution grant, that is, of course, another matter, and I should like a report upon this.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\nThe Estimate for 1903-04 provided $800.00 for the Fort Resolution school. Of this amount the sum of $793.80 was paid to the school on per capita grant.\n\nThe Estimate for the current year provides $800.00 per capita grant and no returns have yet been received.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMB\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 3rd November, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nWith reference to the application of Rev. Father Husson to be allowed the unexpended balance of the grant to the Fort Resolution school for the school at Providence, I beg to say that the amount provided in the estimates for Fort Resolution is $1800.00, being at the rate of $72 for each of 25 pupils. Their earnings for last year amounted to $793.80, and the unexpended balance of over $1000.00 for that year lapsed on the 30th June last. No returns have been received for the current year and I am unable to state what their probable earnings will be. There will, however, most likely be an unexpended balance but until all the returns are in, no definite amount can be arrived at, and by the time the June quarter return reaches the Department, it would be too late to apply the unexpended balance to the school at Providence. A rough estimate might be made after the returns for the first three quarters of the year are in, but not before that time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI can arrange to place the arm's required in the steamer.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nI shall be glad to know whether we should request the Indian Commissioner to provide in his Estimates for 1905-06 for a grant for the Boarding School at Providence, in order that the question of allowing the same may receive consideration when the Estimates are being dealt with.

I have, therefore, to request that you will kindly provide for the same in your Estimates (allowing for forty pupils) in order that the question of making the grant may be considered. I note that you state in your letter above quoted that you would favor giving a grant of $60.00 or $75.00 per pupil. Kindly make provision for the rate per capita which you think advisable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nHon. D. Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA, 16th December, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nFort Providence........... The Commissioner has applied to have the Sacred Heart boarding school at Fort Providence on Mackenzie River recognized. The Department has been paying $200.00 a year for the salary of a teacher at this school. It is outside treaty limits and although the Grey Nuns have been carrying on a boarding school there for the last forty years, it has never yet received any per capita grant towards its support from the Government. An application was made by the Bishop in 1902 in which he stated that they had over sixty children in the school. In March 1904 His Lordship renewed his application which was endorsed by Mr Oliver, P.E., who pointed out that the fact of the school being situated outside treaty limits should not debar it from assistance, as there was no question as to the character of the work done there.\n\nMr Inspector Conroy, who visited the school in the summer of 1902, says that at the time of his visit the school was apparently doing good work, and was well situated.\n\nA day school is of little or no use to these Indians as the parents take their children with them on their hunting trips. Fort Resolution, which is the nearest Roman Catholic boarding school is about 250 miles from Ft. Providence and it would not be possible to send the children who are attending the latter school to that place.\n\nOn the 10th Nov. last the Indian Commissioner\nwas directed to make application for 40 children at this school at the usual per capita rate.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, November 30, 1905.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRe application for grant for the Roman Catholic boarding school at Providence Mission.\n\nThis mission has been established for many years, and they have carried on a school at this point, which is on the Mackenzie river, a short distance inland from Great Slave lake, for the past thirty-four years, and all they have received from the government is a grant of $200 per annum, which is the day-school grant allowed outside treaty limits.\n\nFather Husson called at the Department today to urge the recognition of this school. Similar applications have been before the Department for the last seven years, but as yet it has never been in receipt of a boarding school grant. He says the church authorities would be satisfied in the meantime if the usual allowance were made for 25 pupils. The returns show that they have an actual resident attendance of about 75 pupils, and they have ample accommodation for even a larger number.\n\nThe school is as well equipped for the purpose as the ordinary boarding school in the West, and the pupils receive similar teaching and training to that afforded in other schools of this class. They have permanent staff of twelve Sisters of the Grey Nun Order, and the school is immediately under the control of Bishop Breynet, of the Mackenzie diocese.\n\nThe support of such a large number of Indian children by the diocese has been a heavy drain on its\nresources, and Father Husson thinks it is only fair that\nthe government should relieve the mission, which finds\nitself in straitened circumstances owing to the difficulty\nof obtaining contributions to carry on this work and the excessive cost of laying down the provisions necessary\nto feed the inmates, the freight charges being about\nten cents a pound from Edmonton. Providence Mission is\nabout 200 miles outside the treaty limits.\n\nFor confirmation of Father Husson's statements\nI beg to refer you to Mr. Inspector Conroy, who has a\npersonal knowledge of the school and its work, and has\ntold me repeatedly that he considers it one of the best\nschools of this class that he has seen and well worthy\nof the Department's favourable consideration.\n\nThe file relating to these previous applications\nis, I am told, now before the Minister.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nProcure\nLes Missions Catholiques,\nD'Amabasca and McKenzie,\nEdmonton, January 16, 1908.\n\nJ.

It is proposed in the near future to raise the entire main building one storey and add a wing to the building on the east side.\n\nThe system of ventilation is very complete and the heating system by furnace in the basement. Water is supplied to the school by force pump from the Mackenzie river.\n\nI was not able to attend the usual classes at this school but the children appeared to be particularly bright and clean. Facilities are provided for swimming and bathing in the summer time, a large swimming shed being erected on the shore of the river.\n\nThe health of the pupils has been good for the past year, but at the time of my visit an epidemic of grippe had been running through the school and many of the children had contracted this in a mild form.\n\nThree children had been transferred from Fort Good Hope to the school in the spring by an order of the Indian agent at Simpson without having the necessary health certificate, the plea being put forward that they were orphans and had to be provided for in some way.\n\nAll of these children developed sickness after being at the school a short time and in consequence two of them died just prior to my arrival.\n\nI would suggest that the regulation covering the admission of children to these boarding schools should be more rigidly enforced.\n\nSgd.

Some of them accepted the latter and it is inferred, that it is the children of these to whom His Lordship refers. Possibly, some of them refused both Treaty and Scrip; but as far as my information goes, they all had the privilege of accepting or rejecting one of them.\n\nThe Government are under no obligation to those who did not accept Treaty and are not responsible for their education. Many of them have substantial revenues from their labor and trapping and can well afford to pay for the education of their children. If the Department subsidizes one sectarian school, it might be necessary to subsidize others.\n\nI hardly think the question is one which can be considered just now.\n\nIf you think it advisable, the matter might be referred to the Director-General of Indian affairs.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

What his Lordship wrote is evidently true, except at the time Treaty was made these people were given the option of either taking script or treaty, some took script, and these or their children form the class to which the letter refers.\n\nHis Lordship's letter evidently refers to the Fort Smith Day School, attended both by Treaty Indians and half breeds, and receiving a grant from the Indian Department, the education of the former. This school has not been open for some time, as there are practically no children to attend.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG. Card,\nIndian Agent.\nFort Smith, N.W.T. Aug. 8th, '21.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter dated the 30th June last, from His Lordship, Bishop Breynat. He refers to a grant of $400.00, a year given by the Government for one school. Can you give me any information on this subject, what schools are subsidized by the Government both for Day and Boarding Schools? I presume half-breeds are not included in the grants from your Department.\n\nPerhaps also, you can give me some information on the second paragraph of His Lordship's letter. The Bishop has been absent ever since writing this communication and I have been unable to secure any further data from him. Before returning to Ottawa, I wish to have all possible information concerning this subject.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Sgd.) O.S.F.\n\nO.S.

Ninnie,\nActing Secretary, N.W.T.,\nDepartment of the Interior.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like to draw your attention to the number of half-breeds we have in our schools at Fort Providence and here - especially here - that we have to maintain and educate without any help from the parents.\n\nAs you see for yourself many of the half-breeds are living like Indians, and should be included in the Treaty, they claim having been refused this favour.\n\nThe only grant we receive from the Government is four hundred dollars ($400.00) a year for a day school. Day schools have proved a failure in the North, as many of those half-breeds spend several months in the year in the bush, hunting for a living, thus in order to have an education the children must remain as Boarders.\n\nI wish dear sir, you would consider the matter during your stay here, and intercede near the Government for an increase in Grant for those poor people.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nX. G. Breynat,\nBishop of Mackenzie,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\n23rd September, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI enclose for your information copies of letters received by this office relative to the schooling of Half-breeds in the Provisional District of Mackenzie, Northwest Territories:\n\n1.

Resolution Big. - Grant for 60 pupils at $145 P.C.,\nFt. Providence - \" \" 65 \" \" $145 P.C.,\nFt. Smith Day - Salary $900,\nFt. Simpson Day - \" \" $800.\n\nBesides the above, there is a grant provided for 25 pupils at $145 per capita at Fort McMurray. No returns have yet been received from this point.\n\nThe day school at Fort Smith has been closed since June 30, 1920. The Agent states there is practically no Indian children to attend.\n\nThe returns which we receive from these schools contain the names of the children of Indian parents only. Frequently returns showing attendance of half-breed children are sent us, but they are immediately forwarded to Mr. George D. Pope, Controller of Northwest Territories. I called up Mr. Pope's office today and they tell me that they also receive returns showing attendance of half-breed children at schools in the Territories and that they pay grant for such schools. They send their cheques to Rev. Father Lefebvre, who is the treasurer of the Diocese, and to whom all grants for our Indian Schools are also sent.\n\nThe education of half-breed children does not come under the jurisdiction of our Department, unless, under a ruling of the Department, they reside on an Indian Reserve and live the Indian mode of life thereon.\n\nMr. Agent Card reports that at the time treaty was made these people were given the option of either taking script or treaty. Some took script and these are the children from the class to which the Bishop refers. This Department is not under any obligation to those who did not accept treaty, and is not responsible for their education.\n\nI think the question of the education of half-breeds in the Northwest Territories is a matter for the Department of the Interior, Northwest Territories Branch, to deal with. We have no funds provided for the purpose.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSeptember 30th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, enclosing copies of communications which you received relative to the request of His Lordship Bishop Breynat to provide educational facilities for the half-breed children in the Provisional District of Mackenzie, Northwest Territories.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say the education of half-breed children does not come under the jurisdiction of our Department. In the older settled portions where half-breeds reside on an Indian Reserve and live the Indian mode of life thereon we admit them to our residential schools and allow the usual per capita grant.\n\nBy conversation over the telephone with the office of the Controller, Northwest Territories, Mr. Geo. D. Pope, it was learned that returns are received covering the attendance of half-breed children at schools in the Mackenzie River District and that grants are paid for them.\n\nWe have no funds provided for the education of half-breed children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nJ.

The remainder of the time is spent in the sewing room where they are taught needle-work. The reason of this is due to the complaints of some pupils' parents.

It can be done, once the land would be cleared, even fifteen to twenty acres at each place devoted to that purpose, and we intend to do that ourselves when we can clear that twenty acres patch of the agency, and have our Indians work at it themselves. We believe it would be a life saver to them. They like vegetables and are very fond of potatoes.\n\nC.

Sister Lapointe\nProvidence Mission - Rev. Sister Sauka\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nWINNIPEG, October 21, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just received a very distressing letter from Rev. Father Michel, who is in charge of the Fort Providence Catholic Mission and Indian Residential School.\n\nYou are aware that this School is authorized to receive 100 pupils. Last year its enrolment was never over 65 and this year there are only 45 pupils enrolled. General conditions being as they are, you will readily understand that it is well-nigh impossible for the School authorities to carry on with such a reduced pupilage. I am informed that everything has been done by the missionaries to bolster the attendance, but without substantial results. In order to bring the attendance to normalcy, it would seem recourse must be had to compulsion.\n\nThe Indian Act provides for compulsory attendance of Indian children either in Residential or Day Schools. To allow these children to roam the wilderness with their parents, is contrary to the spirit of the Act, and if this practice were allowed to take root, untold harm would likely be the result.\n\nAs I see it, there are three agencies that should take particular interest in the school attendance of our Indian children, the Mounted Police, the Indian Affairs Branch, through its Agents and the Church authorities in charge of each particular school. In the case of Fort Providence it appears that there has not been sufficient cooperation between these agencies with the result mentioned above. Would it not be possible to induce the Agent to use his influence to the utmost in a matter of this importance. Would it not be possible also for the Mounted Police to cooperate with the Indian Agent without, as far as possible, it being known that the Police is acting on orders from your Agent or from the School Principal.\nIf the above course were followed, it is likely that, as far as Fort Providence is concerned, the attendance would again reach its normal figure and the School would be in a position to carry out the work that it has done so successfully since its establishment.\n\nThere is one category of children whose attendance at School is imperative. I refer to orphans and abandoned children. At the present time these unfortunate waifs wander from one camp to another eking out a most miserable existence. Their place until at least they are 14 or 15 years of age, is in a Residential School.\n\nI appeal to you in a very special manner for this Northern School. I hope that you will take immediate steps to increase its attendance, and especially to do all you can to place within its walls all the orphans and derelict children of the district.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st ultimo with reference to the difficulty of obtaining pupils for the Providence Mission Residential School. I am communicating with the Indian Agent regarding this matter but as he is located 7 miles from the school I doubt if he will be able to assist in a very effective manner.\n\nI find you are mistaken when you state that this school is authorized to accept 100 pupils. As a matter of fact the authorized pupilage at this school is 65 and at the present time is only allowed grant for 92.24% of this number.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa,\nNovember 3, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am advised that while the Providence Mission Residential School is allowed grant for approximately 60 pupils it has only been found possible to enroll 45 pupils this year. The Principal advises that everything possible has been done by the missionaries to encourage the children to attend the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would co-operate fully with the Principal in securing additional pupils. There must be several orphan and abandoned children for whom institutional care is desirable. No doubt you can arrange to have the R.C.M.P. co-operate with you in this regard. As you know, Subsection 6 of Section 10 of the Indian Act provides that every member of the R.C.M.P. is a truant officer for the purpose of enforcing the compulsory clause of the Indian Act as regards the obligation of Indians to have the children between the ages of 7 and 16 attend school. Please let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nDr. J.H.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of November 3, 1941, in connection with the Providence Mission Residential School and the deficiency in the enrolment of pupils this year.\n\nI have no jurisdiction over that territory as it belongs to Simpson Agency. However I shall communicated with the Officer of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at Providence regarding this matter and advise him to corroborate in enforcing the compulsory clause of the Indian Act as regards the obligation of natives to have their children between the ages of 7 and 16 attend school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.H.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., January 15, 1942\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith regard to your letter of December 17, file 139-3-1, re Indian children attending Fort Providence Indian Residential School, let me say that I am glad that this matter has come up, and we will now be able to control the attendance of the Indian pupils at the Providence School.\n\nIn the past the Bishop always brought a number of children from the Providence School to Fort Simpson and Fort Wrigley to visit with their parents while the Bishop's boat went on down river to Aklavik, and they were supposed to go back with him on his return to Fort Providence School. However, a number always persuaded their parents to keep them with them rather than send them back to school, and there was always a small loss of pupils to the school in this way, who had not completed their education at the school. This usually happened when I was away on my treaty trips, and happened year after year, so that a number of pupils were missing from the school each year. The same situation prevails at Providence where the Sister in Charge allows the pupils to live with their parents for a few weeks each Summer on their promise to return to school on its reopening in the Fall. As a result a number of pupils have got back into the bush with their parents too far away to be compelled to return.\n\nI am sure that with the co-operation of the police we will now be able to keep a full attendance of pupils at the school, and I am writing to the Corporal in charge at Fort Providence, asking him to see that all pupils are returned to the school by their parents in time for the Fall re-opening. I am following the same procedure in Fort Simpson and will proceed along the same lines, wherever families have sent their children to Fort Providence School. In future, I do not expect any difficulty in keeping the attendance at school up to its full quota.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt.

As you were advised in official letter of November 3, the Indian Agent was written and I enclose, for your information, a copy of his reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

It was brought to the attention of this detachment in the early part of the 29-7-42 that three brothers (ages from 5 to 9 yrs.) had run away from the local residential school and could not be located by the school and mission staff assisted by older children and a few local residents, as well as the shore being patrolled in canoes by Capt. Bouvier, Theodore Bouvier and Rev. Father Litz.\n\n2. A more extensive search was therefore organized and Capt. Temple, in company with Lieut. Bouvier and his son traveled down stream, later followed by others with private cars, motors and canoes, as two Indians coming to the Fort reported that they had seen three objects, thought to be children, on the river bank in the distance, but had disappeared at their approach. Members went ashore and spread out along the bank, and the children were finally sighted by Capt. Temple who circled and approached them in long grass near a sandy island, approximately 6 miles from Providence, waiting there with them a short while until other parties arrived, when they were taken back by canoe and returned to the mission approximately 10:30 p.m.\n\n3. Rev. Father Michel, in charge of the Mission, advises that these boys i.e., Isidore 5 yrs., Alfred 7 yrs., and Napoleon 9 yrs., are sons of MacDonald, halfbreeds, married to an Indian, and recently convicted and serving sentence for non-support at Norman, N.B. The three boys, with 2 younger children of the same family, were brought to Providence 29-7-42 to be kept at the school, with the understanding that the father pays the school $1.00 per child per month. The children, not realizing the distance, decided to run away and walk home; it is understood they made a previous attempt while enroute here.\n\n4. Parties using private motors and canoes were reimbursed gasoline and oil by local purchase from the H.C.O., on order from this detachment. Certified account dated 1-8-42, to amount of $9.20, is being forwarded herewith in quadruplicate, and made chargeable to the Dept. of Mines & Resources. No other expense was incurred, and it is respectfully requested the account be approved.\n\n5. As no further action appears necessary by this detachment the matter is being considered concluded.\n\nConcluded.\n\nExtra Copies - X\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nProvidence Residential School,\nLost Providence, N.W.T.,\nJune 2nd, 1942.\n\nMr. Harold W.

Since that time the yearly cost of maintenance has averaged about $21,000. The following are the official figures for the past four years:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Amount   |\n|-------------|----------|\n| 1940-41     | $16,387.25 |\n| 1941-42     | 20,075.22  |\n| 1942-43     | 28,209.98  |\n| 1943-44     | 23,656.17  |\n\n(This item is subject to adjustment when final figures available)\n\nRevenue - Departmental receipts in respect of the reindeer industry consist of the proceeds of meat and hides sold from the main herd. These are surplus products after providing for direct relief, donations to missions and meat for the local mission, offices and camp purposes. The funds are used to provide for the division native and white, who are in a position to pay for these products. The proceeds of meat disposed of in lieu of wages are included in the sales. The following are the revenue returns for the past four years:\n\n| Fiscal Year | Amount   |\n|-------------|----------|\n| 1940-41     | $574.15  |\n| 1941-42     | 1,924.90 |\n| 1942-43     | 3,469.70 |\n| 1943-44     | 6,707.60 |\n\n(This item is subject to adjustment when final figures available)\n\nUtilization of Reindeer Products - The original stock of 2,370 reindeer from Alaska delivered to the Canadian range east of the Mackenzie delta in March, 1935, had increased by the summer of 1943 to more than 9,000 head, in three herds - 6,570 deer in the main herd on the reserve and 3,174 animals in two herds under native management near the Anderson and Horton Rivers. During the development of the reindeer herds, meat and hides are provided for the use of those directly engaged or connected with the herding work. In addition meat is available for direct relief and large quantities are supplied each year to the mission hospitals and residential schools in the Akivik area as a contribution toward the maintenance of these institutions. For the benefit of the natives, more than $20,000 carcasses from the main herd have been supplied free to the missions. These represent a value at local prices of about $23,000. The hides are used for local purposes with a number of surplus hides being made available for shipment to needy Eskimos in the Eastern Arctic.\n\nIn the case of native herds the natives in charge are allowed to take meat, hides, sinews, etc., from surplus stock for their own use or to sell or exchange for necessary cash, furs, supplies or services. Any cases of destitution in the vicinity of the herds are to be supplied with reindeer products on a basis of replacement from the main herd.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\nGrants - aid -\n\nThe N.W.T. Administration pays the following annual grants in support of the various schools:\n\n- Residential schools - $400 per annum,\n- Some day schools in Mackenzie District - $200 \" \"\n- Day schools in Eskimo territory - $250 \" \"\n- Fort Smith Day School - $500 \" \"\n- \"Public\" - $700 \" \"\n- Yellowknife - $1,600 \" \"\n\nIn addition to the regular grants the N.W.T. Administration also furnishes school supplies.\n\nThe Northwest Territories Council has approved payment from the Territorial Liquor Fund of the cost of correcting examination papers of the Fort Smith and Yellowknife Public Schools.\n\nCurriculum taught -\n\nThe Alberta Curriculum is taught in most of the schools of the Mackenzie District. In the Eastern Arctic where the population is almost exclusively Eskimo the Missionaries teach a few elementary subjects including reading, writing, drawing, etc.\n\nMaintenance of children in residential schools -\n\nThe Northwest Territories Administration pays $200 per annum for each of the destitute or orphan children maintained in the residential schools. These children are admitted under special application form certified by the parent or guardian, the local representative of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and the District Agent. A certificate of health is given by the resident Medical Officer.\n\nSchools in Eskimo Territory of Quebec -\n\nAs the Administration of Eskimo Affairs has been vested in the Northwest Territories Administration provision has been made for the payment of grants (on the same basis as those of the N.W.T.) toward the maintenance of residential and day schools operated within Eskimo Territory of the Province of Quebec.\n\nAt the present time there are two residential schools at Fort George, P.Q., one operated by the Anglican and the other by the R.C.M. Mission. Provision has been made for the maintenance of 10 pupils in each school @ $200 per annum, each, and in addition the schools will receive the regular grant for residential schools of $400 per annum.\n\nAnglican residential school at Fort George, P.Q., destroyed by fire. Until now school constructed pupils are maintained in the residential school at Moose Factory.\n\nBiscuits for Eskimo children attending day schools in Eastern Arctic -\n\nWith the approval of Dr. L. B. Pott, Director, Nutritional Services, Department of Pensions and National Health, arrangements have been made to supply the Mission schools of the Eastern Arctic with a special brand of biscuits for distribution as circumstances permit, to the pupils enrolled.\nThe Northwest Territories Council\n\nSchools in the N.W.T.\n\nAuthority - The schools of the Northwest Territories are operated and assistance given under authority of:\n\n(a) Northwest Territories Act.\n(b) The School Ordinance.\n(c) The School Assessment Ordinance.\n(d) The School Grants Ordinance.\n(e) Local Administrative District Ordinance.\n\nSection 6 of the School Grants Ordinance authorizes the payment of special grants to any school whether organized according to law or not.\n\nSection 14 (sub-section 17) of the Local Administrative District Ordinance authorizes the Local Trustee Board to pass by-laws granting sums of money from time to time in aid of schools within the district. As the School Ordinances were passed prior to 1905 and designed to meet conditions within the provinces it has been suggested that these be consolidated and amended in order to meet present day conditions within the Territories. This work is receiving attention.\n\nIt has been suggested that a qualified school inspector inspect the schools of the Mackenzie District and afterward assist in the consolidation and amendment of the Ordinances as he would have first-hand knowledge of conditions and requirements.\n\nTypes of schools -\n\nThere are three classes of schools in operation within the N.W.T.\n\n(1) Residential schools - operated by the Missions.\n(2) Day schools -\n(3) Public day schools - \" \" School Boards.\n\nSchools in operation during 1943-44 -\n\n(a) Residential schools -\n\n(1) Resolution - operated by R.C.

Administration does not contribute towards its support.\n\nPublic Schools -\n\n(1) Fort Smith - operated by Fort Smith Public School Board.\n(2) Yellowknife - \" \" Yellowknife School Board.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nA good many of the above statements are made on hearsay evidence, but I am persuaded that the records of your Department will amply prove and justify them, and the Department of Pensions medical authorities will be glad to further collaborate and assist your Department in working out some of your most perplexing problems.\n\nArrangements for frankly insane cases will be more difficult because it would appear that there are not sufficient of those cases occurring in the North to warrant the setting up of a special insane institution. It is possible that you might consider an observation ward at each one of the three points suggested above for troublesome or border-line cases, and if observation substantiates the insanity the patient would then be transferred south.\n\n(sgd.) Ross Millar,\nRoss Millar, M.D.,\nMedical Aest. to Deputy Minister.\nSir:\n\nThe gardens at both missions, Hay River and Providence, were fair this fall, an average of potatoes and vegetables being harvested, but it seems to us that if a certain amount of money could be spent in making land and clearing a large tract and help these missions in making much more extensive gardens, with the help of artificial watering or more by pumping water on the gardens, splendid crops could be raised and give a good to these children that can not be substituted by imported goods. It can be done, once the land would be cleared, even fifteen to twenty acres at each place devoted to that purpose, and we intend to do that ourselves when we can clear that twenty acres patch of the agency, and have our Indians work at it themselves. We believe it would be a life saver to them. They like vegetables and are very fond of potatoes.\n\nC.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................193......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................193......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at.................................................................October 19, 1934.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1939.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: December 31st, 1939.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Mission School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nthis 5th April 1940\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Providence Residential School] School for the Quarter ended [June 30th, 1940].\n\nPrincipal [Signature]\n\nDated [June 30th, 1940]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [Place]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**REPORT of the [Name of Residential School] at [Location]** on [River Name] Reserve for Quarter ended June 30th, 1941.\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| No 0615         | Elizabeth Salmon      | 10* | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 1928        | No. 0176 + 0247 attained age limit.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Mary MacKillop\n\nDated: March 31st, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nW.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 15th, 1941\n\nI

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Sister Mary Mackey\n\nDated April 1st 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Simpson, N.W.T.\n\nMay 14th 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Providence Residential School] for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30th 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 2nd, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: February 10th, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 2nd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated January 2nd, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

residence during Quarter:**\n\n**AVERAGE attendance of pupils during quarter:**\n\n**AMOUNT of per capita grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 2nd 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2nd 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 2nd, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Jan 2nd 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRep.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1947.\n\nPrincipal Dr. Cecile Casson, M.D.\n\nDated July 2nd 1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis .................................................. 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 103\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 3rd, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Providence, N.W.T.\nNovember 7th, 1948.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI am very, very grateful to you for your kindness in returning the September Quarterly Returns for revision.\n\nMay I call your attention to the fact that the School Calendar in the Indian Bulletin had set the 25th of June as the last day of the school year 1947-48 and we were to re-open on September 7th, which we did.\n\nOn the Returns for the June Quarter I cancelled the number of days pupils were absent from the school in June. The majority of the pupils left for vacation on the 25th of June.\n\nIn the case of Patrice Nadli, No. 248 instead of 91 days in June Quarter, he was entitled to 86. In this Quarter he is entitled to 62 days holiday plus 17 days in September, as he returned on September 14th, thus 79 days in the Quarter. I did likewise with all the other pupils.\nThe note I had put opposite his name on the Return was not meant for him. It was to notify that the class rooms had been closed for four days to take in the crops.\n\nTrusting you find the Returns satisfactory and I wish to thank you once again, Mr. Phelan.\n\nYours most sincerely,\n\nSister Mary Mack, s.g.m.\n\nPrincipal.\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 12th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 10th\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Providence Residential School] School for the Quarter ended [June 30th, 19__].\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: [January 12th, 19__]\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at [_________________________]\n\nthis [_________________________] 19__\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: October 3rd, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Providence Residential School] for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 3rd, 1948.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this ........................................... 19......\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1st, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nthis\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1950.\n\nPrincipal, Sister Mary Mackay\n\nDated April 11th 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nthis January 13th

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Residential School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 11th, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: June 13th, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | RANG OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1957.\n\nPrincipal: Sister E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1957.\n\nPrincipal: Sister E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paying it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart School School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Sister E. Krieff\n\nDated: June 30, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Yellowknife, July 30, 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Report of the Sacred Heart Residential School at St. Anne's on Mackenzie River Reserve for Quarter ended June 30, 1957**\n\n| Register Number | Name of Pupil | Age | Boy/Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|---------------|-----|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0331            | Margaret Tom  | 11  | 1        | Treaty No       | 2             | Good             |                       | Sept 16/48                | 91/59      |\n| 0332            | Mary Antoinette | 16  | 1        | Wright          | 1             | Good             |                       | July 17/49                | 91/59      |\n| 0333            | Jane T.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: Sister E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, shall any grant be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sacred Heart Residential School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 2nd, 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTrident Agent\n\nDated at Yellowknife, N.W.T., this January 10th, 1952.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## Indian Residential School Quarterly Return\n\n**Report of the Sacred Heart Residential School at Fort Providence on Mackenzie River Reserve for Quarter ended December 31, 1957**\n\n| Register Number | Names of Pupils       | Age | Boy | Girl | Band or Reserve | Class or Study | Standing in Class | Trade or Other Industry | Date of Entrance to School | Attendance |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n|                 | Brought Forward       |     |     |      |                |               |                  |                        | April 1/50                   | 2,382      |\n|                 | Theresa Lomax         | 8   |     |      |                |               |                  |                        | Aug 22/50                    |            |\n|                 | Mary Dunn             | 8   |     |      |                |               |                  |                        | Sept 1/50                    |            |\n|                 | Roseanne Johnson      | 12  |     |      |                |               |                  |                        | Oct 12/50                    |            |\n|                 | Makina Kargan         | 10  |     |      |                |               |                  |                        | Nov 1/50                     |            |\n|                 | M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars of the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginat No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Mission School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 2nd, 1953\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at:

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita paid for quarter is determined by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Providence Mission School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 2nd, 1953.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 10th February, 1953.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. L.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Yellowknife-At Providence Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the Providence Mission School at At Providence**\n\n**Reserve for Quarter ended December 31st, 1952**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------|\n| 270            | William Bonnycastle | 15  | 54  | Slave | 1966 13 2 4 5 | Woodwork          | 10-10-44               | Discharged                |\n| 271            | Joseph Cayen    | 14  |     | E    |               |                   | 1-9-45                 | Has not returned         |\n| 273            | Joachim Bonnycastle | 11 |     | E    |               |                   | 2-4-46                 | 92/56                    |\n| 274            | Moise Canadian  | 15  |     | E    |               |                   | 1-9-57                 | Discharged               |\n| 279            | Freddie Hardisty | 10  |     | E    |               |                   | 26-8-47                | Sick                     |\n| 282            | J-Bap.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Register, ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Dated December 18/11. Original on File 160370-18E\n\nPROVIDENCE...\n\nThe most northerly school in the Mackenzie District is the one under the Roman Catholic Church, at Providence.\n\nThe foundations are blocks of wood. The walls are logs, covered on the outside with tar paper and planks. Their thickness is about ten inches.\n\nThere is a new wing under construction which will add greatly to the school. It will be a three story addition 30 x 30, and will contain several class rooms and dormitories.\n\nThe accommodation at present is just about sufficient for the grant from the Department. There are five large dormitories, whose cubic space is 27,246 cubic feet, sufficient for 64 pupils. The class rooms, three in number, whose floor space is sufficient for over one hundred pupils, but whose cubic space, 15,375 feet, accommodates only 61.\n\nA small dormitory is kept ready for cases of sickness.\n\nThe foundations of the main buildings are blocks of wood; the walls are logs covered outside with tar paper and planks, bringing them up to 10\" thickness. The lighting and ventilation are good.\n\nFrom both the boys and girls dormitories there are outside staircases in case of fire. In almost all the missions economy of space has been detrimented to the inside...\nProvidence cont.\n\nstairways, and there should be at least a ladder from dormitory windows in case of emergency. There are no fire extinguishers at Providence, but pails are kept ready. I would recommend that the Department send in some fire extinguishers.\n\nThe water supply is obtained from the river. The Mission is situated some 30 or 90 feet above the water. A small tramway is built to the water's edge to overcome the difficulty of hauling pails of water up a very steep bank. A force pump is also in use during the summer. The water is stored in barrels near the kitchen, and distributed throughout the building in pails. If the Department could see their way clear to send in some sheets of galvanized iron, the mission would construct a tank that would give water to the whole building.\n\nThere is no furnace; six stoves are used which seem to give satisfaction.\n\nThe class work follows the requirements of the Department. Besides this, the boys are taught the use of axe and saw, and the girls receive instruction in cooking and sewing. General manual training has been found unpractical in this district. General use of ordinary tools however, is essential, and it is dealt with in every boarding school.

The last are a decided necessity in any school.\n\nThe mission owns 28 head of cattle.

However, before we can place an order, it will be necessary to have full information as to whether single or double desks should be supplied, and the number required.

In this connection I beg to say that we communicated with Mr. Agent Harris on March 2, 1923, requesting him to give full particulars as to the requirements and full shipping directions. As no reply was received, we were unable to place an order.\n\nIt will be too late this season to have the desks forwarded, but I shall be pleased if you will supply full particulars as to the type and sizes required. I am enclosing two pages from the catalogue of a manufacturer of school desks. You will see that they are made in different sizes to suit children of different ages. Please consult the enclosed pages and prepare a list of the desks needed, stating the numbers for the various ages and whether the single or double type is preferred. I shall also be pleased if you will supply full shipping directions, stating definitely the nearest point of rail communication from which the shipment could go forward by boat. As soon as this information is received, an order can be placed in time to have the desks forwarded by the first boat going north next spring.\n\nWe regret that there has been delay in furnishing these desks, but we had not sufficient information as to the number and sizes needed, to place an order. Only the number absolutely necessary to provide seating accommodation should be requested. It is considered that a number of the desks at present in use would be satisfactory and that it will not be necessary to supply new ones for the full enrolment of pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have noted that this equipment was misdirected, and the Department relies on you to purchase another and have it sent to Providence Mission at the first opportunity. A cheque is being directed to the Northern Trading Company.\n\nI have also your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing Revillon Freres' bill for rifles. I am returning this account to you, as the Department has given no authority and cannot be responsible. Mr. Indian Agent Harris, at Fort Simpson, was requested to correspond with the Officer in charge of Cadet Services for Military District No. 13, at Calgary, in this connection; and I regret that we cannot pay the bill for the air rifles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nRev. J. C. Lefebvre, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joachim's Church,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOctober 6th, 1923.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nFor the last few years I have been advocating the reconstruction of our Indian Boarding School at Providence, and have consequently made formal requests to the Department. The latter has not seemed to be favorable to such requests as no action has followed.\n\nThe time has come, in my humble opinion, for the Department to determine a policy concerning educational problems in favor of the Indians of the North West Territories. I must say immediately that the very large majority of those Indians are Catholics, and, therefore under my spiritual jurisdiction. I necessarily have their interests at heart and would be grateful to the Department for assisting us more intensively in the work we have been carrying on in the North for the last 75 years.\n\nAfter mature consideration of present conditions and requirements I take the liberty of making a proposal to the Department for the construction of a new school at some point in the lower McKenzie. Presently, some children have to go about 900 miles up the McKenzie to attend school, which is almost incredible. It is a known fact that the Indians of the lower McKenzie are far more intelligent than those of the upper portion and a school in that district would certainly be a boon (not to say an absolute necessity) to the Hare Skins, the Loucheux and occasionally to the Eskimos.\n\nTherefore, instead of asking for the reconstruction of Providence School at the Government's expense I hereby request a grant of about $30,000.00 for the construction in the Lower McKenzie District, of a boarding school to accommodate about 30 children. The condition would be that full liberty be given me for the construction of said school. The Department is conversant with the fact that in the N.W.T. on account of difficul-\nties of transportation there would be no possibility of constructing such a building at a reasonable price if the procedure (calling for tenders, etc.) is followed. Our experience in construction, the number of expert carpenters and mechanics at our disposal would highly facilitate the work, bring the expense to a minimum and guarantee perfect work. I would therefore be prepared for the sum above mentioned ($30,000.00) to erect a school according to the plans and specifications of the Departmental architect, to accommodate 30 children. Such plans and specifications could be prepared with a view of extending the building at a later date. All accounts for material, freight and work would be submitted to the Department and work would be considered satisfactory only after an inspection from an Officer of the Department. Said construction could be started and completed in the course of next year.\n\nMoreover, I would pledge myself to erect in a very few years, at my own expense, another school at Providence. The Department authorities must admit that I am more than reasonable in my requests and generous in my promises. As practically nothing has been done (outside of the per capita grant) in favor of the education of our Indian children of the N.W.T. I am positive that the Government will look favorably upon my present proposition.\n\nThanking you for your personal interest in this matter, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Western School Supply Company\n\nThe Preston Ball-Bearing Adjustable Box\nSingle Desk with Lifting Lid\n\nTHE LATEST IN SCHOOL DESK MANUFACTURE\nClosed box and lifting lid.\n\nThis is the most important innovation and improvement of recent years in connection with school desks, doing away as it does with the dust catching possibilities of the older and more ornate designs.\n\nStandards are perfectly plain and smooth, offering no receptacles or harbours for dust and dirt, and cleaning is made comparatively easy.\n\nBoth seat and desk can be adjusted to any required height.\n\nComplete\nTop, Hors Fronts\nNo. 1, for Normal or High Schools, Adults .......... $14.00 $16.00 $11.50\nNo. 2, for ages 10 to 15 years ...................... 13.50 10.00 11.50\nNo. 3, for ages 5 to 10 years ....................... 13.00 10.00 11.50\n\nThe ideal Adjustable Desk with the modern design of lifting lid book box.\nThe Patton Ball-Bearing Double Desk with Divided Seat\n\nEnables one pupil to stand up without disturbing the other.\n\nComplete Desks Rears Fronts\n\nNo. 1\u2014Double Desk, divided seat for adults ........ $14.40 $11.40 $10.40\nNo. 2\u2014ages 15 to 18 years 14.40 11.40 10.40\nNo. 3\u2014ages 12 to 15 years 13.90 11.40 10.40\nNo. 4\u2014ages 10 to 12 years 13.90 11.40 10.40\nNo. 5\u2014ages 7 to 9 years 13.40 11.40 10.40\nNo. 6\u2014ages 5 to 7 years 13.40 11.40 10.40\n\nInkwells with all Desks\n\nTHE BEST CANADIAN DESKS MADE\nFort Providence Boarding School,\nFort Providence N.W.T.\nJanuary 7, 1924.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th of October regarding the furnishing of desks for the use of our school.

N. Moyer Co., Ltd., Edmonton, Alta., to ship addressed to you, c/o Northern Trading Co., Waterways, Alta., A. & G. W.

They will be shipped in a knocked down condition, all parts complete, ready to assemble and set up in the classroom. They should be arranged in three rows, with the smaller size in front and the larger in the rear. There should be two rows complete of the No. 3 desks, and one row of the No. 4. These desks will provide seating accommodation for 42 pupils. It is hoped that, when the desks arrive, they will be satisfactory. I shall be pleased if you will inform me later of the arrival of these desks.\n\nSister St. Rose of Lima,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nPROVIDENCE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nAt Providence Boarding School they had an outbreak of typhoid this fall, as reported previously, in September, but as it was impossible for me at that time to procure the lease of a boat (being all engaged in fishing for the winter) I could not go at that time and attend to these cases. Five of the children died, and a few of the convalescents are so badly affected that their complete recovery is problematic.\n\nI examined the buildings and surroundings to discover the probable cause of the typhoid being more or less endemic in that locality. There is not apparently one cause alone but a few defects here and there in drainage and surface water which give very much trouble and are without doubt causing the sickness, although all the first cases are always some children coming from the lower part of the MacKenzie, starting the epidemic. We have advised correcting all the possible dangers and risks of further outbreak. The buildings are getting old and it is very difficult for the buildings to have any cellars as the water penetrates in spite of all kinds of devices and will stay in these cellars until pumped out.\nEXTRACT FROM MONTHLY REPORT OF C. BOURGET, M.D.,\nINDIAN AGENT, RESOLUTION, N.W.T., Dated Feb. 12, 1924.\n\nPROVIDENCE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nAt Providence I was greatly impressed with their success in raising poultry and their supply of fresh eggs this winter with good healthy hens shows the possibilities that can be encouraged in this country. They have at the R.C. Mission at this time over one hundred and fifty hens, getting now three dozen eggs daily. Last summer the number of chickens reached four hundred. As their land is not yet cleared sufficiently large enough to raise all feed for these hens, they will have to import from outside about twenty-four bags of wheat for next winter. I promised to ask the Department for help in obtaining this wheat shipped from Edmonton, in order to encourage the other institutions to raise more poultry, and when the Indians around the Forts see this success, they may have a tendency to clear a small tract of land to do the same, in time.\nPROVIDENCE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\nAt Providence I examined the school children and was astonished with their progress and talents in various subjects - English and French languages; sewing and knitting, etc., all these practical subjects being also of great value to these children. Especially the industry of socks knitting I would like to encourage as much as possible in young girls, but the knitting wool is beyond reach of the average purse in the Indians as it costs from eight dollars a pound to ten. With your approval I would ask a little supply next year in the Estimates to develop this work by the women.\nOttawa, March 26th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your monthly report dated the 12th ultimo on your inspection of the Providence Mission Indian Residential School, I beg to say it is considered that the wool for sewing and knitting should be supplied by the school from the per capita grant.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that this school is meeting with success in the raising of poultry. Your remarks regarding the condition of the buildings and the work being performed in the classrooms have been noted. I beg to thank you for the report which you forwarded regarding the general conditions at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nC.

In fact, we are celebrating this very year, in our humble sphere, a jubilee coinciding with that of our dear Dominion: a diamond jubilee.\n\nDuring the sixty years of its existence I can state that this institution has wrought wonders for our Northern population and has shown the way to establishments of a similar nature. It will of interest for you to note that we have never received nor asked for help in the way of capital expenditure for our institutions of the North West Territories which, outside of day-schools at almost every mission point, include three residential schools and three hospitals. I may add that for forty years we have not received the least grant for our children, a small salary of $300 to $400 being given after many years to one teaching sister.\n\nOur residential school at Providence, after sixty years of wear and tear, has come to the point where repairs and alterations are an utter impossibility. We are thinking upon the erection of a new and modern building. As we realize that the Department would probably not consider the construction of such a building at its own expense in so remote a country we are ready to assume the cost of said construction but feel the the Department should favor\nus with a very substantial grant, same to be fixed after discussion with myself or my representative.\n\nI hope that my request will be found in order and most opportune at this juncture. I therefore leave the whole matter to your kind attention and judicious consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of [Name]\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nJuly 8, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you ask for a grant towards the reconstruction of the Providence Indian Residential School. I should be glad if you could let me have an estimate of the cost of the new building and indicate what financial help is required from the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Scott Esq.\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs,\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your kind letter of July the 8th, No. 129-3-5, I beg to explain that before completing our plans for the reconstruction of our Providence Indian Residential school we are awaiting to know what financial help we may expect from the generosity of your Department.\n\nWe are contemplating the building of a school as modern in its plan as the conditions in the North will permit, cement basement included. On account of the high rate of freight for the necessary material as well as of the high wages generally asked in the North, I am figuring that the total amount of expenses for the building would run between fifty or sixty thousand dollars. Would it be exaggerated to expect from the Department a financial help large enough to cover half of that amount?\n\nI may state again that so far, we never have received any help from the Department for any of the five large establishments we actually possess, in the District of Mackenzie. In particular our Providence school which was established the very year of the Confederation, not only has been, as others, created at our own expenses, but it has been kept working and doing good work for the period of nearly forty years, without any grant from the Department.\n\nWith the hope of an early favorable reply to our demand,\n\nI remain,\n\nwith anticipations,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSeptember 30, 1927.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, urging the Department to provide a grant toward the rebuilding of the Providence Indian Residential School.

But now? We beg leave to make application for one to help our dear boys to earn their bread.\n\nI trust you will not refuse in that favor, as we greatly need it.\n\nWith renewed, cordial thanks for the great interest you take in the welfare of our Indian Pupils.\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSister St. Anne of Lourdes\nPrincipal\nOttawa, October 3, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th ultimo, requesting the Department to supply one Alamo engine Lunt Moss sawing outfit complete, 7 horse power, 28\" screw, for the sawing of wood at the Providence Indian Residential School.

The written application of the Bishop came too late for consideration in the Estimates, but he had mentioned it to me when I was in the west, and we discussed it when we were dealing with the question of our responsibility for northern residential schools. The Roman Catholic Church has had a school at Fort Providence for some time. They bore the cost of the building and we have contributed a per capita grant. It would be quite impossible to provide anything in the Estimates for the next fiscal year, as our programme is quite complete; in fact if everything is allowed, the building grants will be larger than usual.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJanuary 13, 1928.\n\nNOTE FOR FYLE\nCopy to Dr. Scott\n\nRev.

I had His Lordship's request in mind when considering the Supplementary Estimates for Indian Education for the current year; but I regret I cannot ask for an appropriation at the present time. My Deputy for Indian Affairs is having the proposal for the new building considered and he will make a report in due course.\n\nYou refer also to Father Lefebvre's request for the construction of an Indian school at Resolution. It is the school building at Providence that has become unfit for occupation, and the Reverend Principal, on behalf of His Lordship Bishop Breynat, has asked that I arrange for an appropriation to meet approximately half the costs of rebuilding. I regret that I was not able to place an item in the Supplementary Estimates for this request either; but I have promised to take the matter into consideration when next year's programme is being prepared.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonourable F. E. Lessard,\nThe Senate,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nHis Lordship Bishop Breynat visited the Department this morning and explained their programme and wishes in connection with the reconstruction of the Providence Indian Residential School. This past summer, a good-sized barn with galvanized iron roofing was erected. Next year, they hope to purchase and freight in most of the material required for the new main building, and by the fall they expect to have the foundation ready. The expense next year will be $25,000 or $30,000. His Lordship is asking the Department to meet half the expense, and I have noted, for the attention of the Hon. Mr. Stewart and Dr. Scott, an item of $15,000 for 1929-30 estimates. In the summer of 1930, His Lordship will make a special effort to complete the building, so that they can get in by November or December. He expects that the total cost will be approximately $60,000, and he is requesting that a second item of $15,000 be granted by the Department that year.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo D.

The whole building has to be rebuilt, the cost of same we estimate at 60,000 dollars, outbuildings included.\n\nI would like to know if the Department is prepared to meet half-expenses, in two years time; if so, we would immediately start the cement basements and prepare all material during the summer 1929, and on spring 1930, as soon as the snow is gone, we would put up the whole building, so as to have the children in the new school, before winter 1930.\n\nNeedless to say that the work is urgent, as the report of Inspector Parker will show.\n\nHoping to get a favorable answer, so that we may start the work immediately, I beg to remain,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Adramyte,\nVic. Apost. Mackenzie.\nI beg to forward a letter from Bishop Breynat asking for assistance to rebuild the Indian residential school at Providence. Inspector Parker reports to me that it is necessary that a new building should be provided. The Bishop is prepared to meet half the expense and I intend to include in the Estimates for the next two fiscal years say $30,000.00 in all to meet one moiety of the cost. This will be in the nature of a grant to be paid on proper and sufficient evidence that the work has been performed satisfactorily. It would not be advisable for us to attempt to build the school in that district by contract, and as the diocese is interested equally financially there is I think not the slightest objection to our making such an arrangement. As a matter of fact we have carried out like arrangements in other localities. May I ask for your approval of the proposed action.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent-General.\nOctober 3rd, 1928.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th September drawing my attention to the necessity of rebuilding the school at Providence and requesting financial assistance.\n\nI submitted the matter to the Honorable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and I am directed to say that he will approve of items in the estimates for the next two years aggregating $30,000.00, one-half of the cost of erecting the building. This assistance will be in the nature of grants to be paid on proper and sufficient evidence that the work has been performed satisfactorily.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRt. Rev. G.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI presume you will be pleased to hear that we have begun our work of complete reconstruction of our Providence School.\n\nAs was intended, we are first replacing the outbuildings. The new barn is nearly completed, the measurements of which are 75'x 34', and is covered with galvanized iron as a fire protection.\n\nWe now have to gather as much material as possible in order to proceed towards the erection of the main building according to the plans so kindly supplied by your Department. We hope to have everything on hand before the close of the navigation season this summer. By that time the cement foundations we expect, will be completed and we will then be able to resume and continue our work as long as the weather will permit.\n\nAs we cannot afford to borrow all the money from a Bank at the prevailing high rate of interest which would have to run for at least two years, I would appreciate it very much if you could advance us, out of the generous contribution you promised, the sum of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00).

Bishop Breynat, representing the Oblate Order, under whose auspices this school is conducted, has agreed to erect a new school at an approximate cost of $60,000, provided the Department undertakes one-half the expense. In view of the location of this school, it is considered more economical to arrange for reconstruction on a day labour basis, under the supervision of the Church. $15,000 is provided in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the Department's share of this year's building costs, and it is proposed to vote a similar amount for the next fiscal year.\n\nDr. Scott is desirous of securing an Order in Council, authorizing this activity.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMay 15, 1929.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nPlans have been prepared for the proposed new Indian Residential School at Providence. The building contemplated is of frame construction on a concrete foundation, and will provide accommodation for 60 pupils. It will be heated by a low pressure steam system and will be equipped with all modern plumbing fixtures, and a septic tank and sewerage system will be installed.\n\nOwing to the isolated location of this building I would recommend that the work be carried out by day labour under the supervision of His Lordship, Bishop Breymat, as he is in a position to provide economical labour and can handle the freighting of the materials required at minimum cost. Owing to the high freight charges it is difficult to make an accurate estimate of the cost of this building, but I would place the minimum cost at $75,000.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, May 21, 1939.\n\n139-3-5\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to report that the main building at the Providence Indian Residential School, in the North West Territories, is more than sixty years old, and is now entirely unsuitable for the purposes of educating Indian children. The Oblate Order under whose auspices this school is conducted, has agreed to erect a new school building, at an approximate cost of $60,000.00, provided the department will undertake one-half the expense.\n\nAn amount of $15,000.00 has been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1939/30, and it is proposed to include a similar amount in the Estimates for 1930/31, for this purpose.\n\nPlans and specifications for the proposed building have been prepared by the department. Accommodation for eighty pupils is provided.\n\nThe building is to be of frame construction on a concrete foundation and heated by a low pressure steam system. A septic tank and sewerage system is to be installed and all modern plumbing fixtures throughout the building.\n\nIn the opinion of the Architect of the department the cost would probably exceed the sum of $60,000.00 by a considerable amount. It follows, therefore, that the proposed expenditure by the department of $30,000 does not represent more than one moiety of the total cost.\n\nIn view of the remote location of Providence, which is some seven hundred miles distant from the railway line at Waterways it would appear to be inexpedient to call for tenders. It is considered that the most economical way of having the building constructed is by lay labour under the supervision of the Church authorities, as they are in a position to provide economical labour and can handle the freighting of the materials required at minimum cost.\nThe undersigned has the honour to recommend that the proposed grant to be expended in the manner aforesaid be approved.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMay 21, 1929.\n\nTo approve a grant of $30,000.00 towards the cost of the erection of a new building at the Providence Indian Residential School, N.W.T., to replace the old one which is more than sixty years old, and now unsuitable for the purposes of educating Indian children.\n\nAn amount of $15,000.00 has been included in the Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1929/30, and it is proposed to include a similar amount in the Estimates for 1930/31.\n\nPlans and specifications have been prepared by the department.

More than ever, since I am here, I incite my pupils to appreciate the unsurpassed devotedness of our dear benefactors, especially of those who co-operated in the construction of our new School, and you may trust that they understand it will ever be impossible for them to repay what they owe.\n\nNext year, I intend to send you a few pieces of their class-works, if you just allow me to do so. You will then have a proof that they succeed quite well and really take advantage of their studies.\n\nI may say I have all that I am in need of for my pupils and I am using everything as economically as possible. The only thing missing now is a teacher's desk and chair for each of the two classes. I wanted to show Mr. Parker the miserable old desks we have and unfortunately I did not see him, so I thought I would address myself directly to you, hoping you will be able to get it for us. I know it is an expensive furniture, but it lasts for years, and besides it adds to the appearance of the class.\n\nI most deeply appreciate, dear and kind Sir, all you have done for me since I am in this School. Please accept my most sincere thanks and good wishes.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSister Sarrasin\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 17, 1930.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to forward, addressed to Rev.

Waterways, Alta., and this equipment should be supplied at your lowest possible price. Please forward your account, in duplicate, with copy of Bill of Lading attached, direct to the Department, when payment will be made.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange early shipment in order that this equipment can go forward before navigation closes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.

Words fail me to thank you and all the Members of the Department for the great interest you and they take in our welfare.\n\nIf you happen to pass in this district I cordially invite you to come and see our new class-rooms. You would be most welcomed and both teachers and pupils would be glad to prove you that your devotedness is deeply appreciated and that your efforts to improve our condition are not in vain.\n\nPlease accept, dear and kind Sir,\n\nthe expression of my most sincere gratitude.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nSister Sarrasin\nPrincipal\nFORT RESOLUTION, Dec. 15/1929.\n\nPROVIDENCE'S SCHOOL BUILDING,\n\nIn Account with M.C.R.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of the Indian Education Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI regret that the unexpected illness of Archbishop Grouard prevented me entertaining you during my last visit at Ottawa.\n\nRegarding the construction of our Providence school, I am sending you presently the accounts of expenses up to August 2nd, which amount to $59,876.85. We have done our utmost to keep expenses low. I must remark that the digging of the sewers for the water system has been quite expensive on account of the very hard ground.\n\nYou will notice that the cost price of the heating system and its installation are not included in this account. It will be sent later on and I hope that the Government will come to our help to pay this extra amount. There is also about from $3000.00 to $4000.00 worth of inside finishing work to be done in order to complete everything.\n\nIn the meantime, if you find that the account are satisfactory, I would be grateful if you would send me as soon as possible to Father Lefebvre the balance of $5000.00 dol., which remains due as a part of the contribution of the Government. Times are so hard that the cheque would be all the more welcome.\n\nInspector Parker, having visited our school, will give you his appreciation of the work that has been done.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of MacKenzie\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1930 Nov. 3 | To Final Grant towards the Expenses of Reconstruction of the Providence Indian Residential School, authority P.C. 934, dated May 30, 1929. | $5,000.00\n\nAttached will be found a statement, with receipts, showing expenditure that the Church has undertaken, of over $60,000.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor:\n\nI have regretted very much that the illness of Mr. Grouard forced me to leave Ottawa in a hurry, depriving me of the pleasure of the second visit to which you had kindly invited me.\n\nAmong the various affairs I intended to see you about, was the one of our Residential school at Providence. As usually happens, the building expenses have somewhat exceeded our estimates, the high transportation rates being the main cause to this. Besides, to have our school fitted with an up-to-date equipment which would be a real credit to both your Department and ourselves, we decided the installation of a steam heating plant with running water on all stories, to insure a better protection against fire danger.\n\nWhen last May I had the honor to lay those plans before you, you were kind enough to invite me to send in a complete report, after the completion of the work, and you promised to do all in your power to have the supplementary contribution granted.\n\nThe building was sufficiently advanced this Fall to allow the children to move in; the news received lately show the contentment of all. The heating and water system is giving good satisfaction. The children are in the best of health.\n\nAs will be seen by the report already submitted, we had, to date, spent $60,000. And we have received with real gratitude the full amount of the agreed contribution.\n\nSince then, a well was sunk; the first attempt was not successful; the water being unsatisfactory; and we had to use dynamite to dig another one. A large poultry-house, 75 x 16, has been completed. There's quite an amount of finishing work to do, inside.\n\nThe lighting and fire escape system has not been put up yet. The estimates for these we figure at about $3,000.

The articles that you mention are quite expensive and, in addition, there would be the transportation costs.\n\nOn the occasion of his next visit to your school, you should consult the Indian Agent with a view to ascertaining if some local carpenter could be obtained who would erect swings at a reasonable cost. When you have done this, you might submit, through Dr. Amyot's office, an estimate of the cost of erecting swings in this manner. The Department is prepared, if you so desire, to forward footballs and playground balls.\n\nYour request for assistance for two ex-pupils should also be submitted to the Indian Agent. With regard to the suggestion that a sewing machine be supplied for one of the girls, reports reaching the Department indicate that, in many cases where sewing machines have been supplied, the recipients have not made proper use of them. Consequently, before considering the supplying of a sewing machine to any ex-pupil, the Department will require very definite assurance that the machine will be properly cared for by the recipient.\n\nKindergarten wool is not usually supplied to Indian residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This last figure is only approximate, as I left at Fort McMurray the invoices regarding this lower but there might be a difference of $2.00 or $3.00 only.\n\nWe have been somewhat surprised to see that no provision had been made for our Residential School at Aklavik, and we would appreciate very much if the Department could take in consideration the fact that we have been purchasing this year for that school a new equipment amounting to the sum of $750.00 consisting of three reservoirs for water and an Electric Bread Mixer, same as the one purchased for Fort Resolution.\n\nIn any case, if the Department prefers to transfer to the school of Aklavik the amount granted for the school of Fort Providence, we would think that there should be some compensation for the expenses incurred by purchasing the equipment mentioned above.\n\nThanking you for past favors, I beg to remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.)

In the event of our purchasing the articles mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter it should be understood that their cost will reduce the amount available. Consequently, I am communicating with you before proceeding with the purchase in order that you may advise me if you consider these articles are more urgent than other repairs or equipment that might be required.\n\nIn the event of your urging the purchase of the articles mentioned above you should let me know the ages of the children for which the 36 desks, 6 fronts and 6 rears are required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Lock,\nHead of Welfare and Training Service,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRev. Father Dobin, in charge of our residential school at Fort Providence has referred to me your circular letter in regard to precautions against fire.\n\nI think that so far as this Juvenile School is concerned there is but little danger from furnaces or cookstoves. According to the plan which was submitted to the Department when the building was being erected two sets of stairs are provided and I think they answer the purpose for the number of pupils and the staff.\n\nBut there is a real danger of fire from the lighting system which consists of kerosene lamps. A large number of these is required owing to the size of the building and although great care is taken by the Sisters to watch, it is a real nightmare for us as some of the small children may play with them upset them or do something alike.\n\nFor the last two years I have insisted upon the Indian Department that an appropriation be granted for the installation of an electric lighting plant, so far the demand has received no favorable reply. The pupilage grant is too small to permit us to deduct the price of such a plant as it barely covers the maintenance of the pupils.\n\nIt is to be regretted that the Department takes on himself such a responsibility by overlooking the provision of this plant. Several visitors of the school were daily surprised of this dangerous kerosene lamp system and could hardly realize that the Government has declined to supply an electric plant.\n\nMay I hope, dear Sir, that the terrible accidents lately reported in the press will induce the Department to avoid any further delay and to provide funds for this lighting plant for the residential school of Fort Providence.\n\nTrusting that this will be given the most favorable consideration, I remain, dear Sir,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Miramichi,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\n9416-110 St., Edmonton, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo requesting the Department to install a lighting plant in the Providence Mission Residential School.\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1938-39 the following provision was made for the schools in which you are particularly interested: Atikokan R.C., general repairs $500.00, classroom and other equipment $500.00; Fort Resolution, general repairs $500.00, additional laundry equipment $500.00; Providence Mission, general repairs $500.00, classroom material $300.00, electrical equipment $2,000.00.\n\nWe have already received the following requests: Fort Resolution School\u20141 school desk, 6 chairs and 2 folding tables; Providence Mission\u201436 new desks, 1 teacher's desk and 1 teacher's chair. We have not yet ordered the articles requested by the Principals of the Fort Resolution and Providence Mission Schools but have written them advising the amount available for their schools and asked them to state definitely if the articles they have already requested are more necessary than other repairs and equipment that might be required.\n\nThe point to be kept in mind is that the above amounts represent the total that can be allowed during the current fiscal year and in addition present regulations require that all purchases be made by our Purchasing Division.\n\nRt. Rev. G. Breynat, C.M.I.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nI would therefore appreciate if you would let me have full details regarding the lighting plant which you consider is necessary at the Providence Mission School. If possible you should state the name of the manufacturer of the lighting plant which you recommend\u2014Catalogue number or other distinctive matter to assist our Purchasing Branch\u2014and approximate cost.\n\nIf the cost of this lighting plant exceeds the amount provided, namely $2,000.00, it should be understood that any amount over and above this sum will be taken from the amount provided for general repairs and equipment which totals $800.00.\n\nIn order that the purchase of the lighting equipment may receive early consideration I would appreciate hearing from you at as early a date as possible. I presume that any equipment purchased can be shipped by boat from Waterways during the coming summer.\n\nIn order to make certain that this letter reaches you at the earliest possible date one copy is being sent to Edmonton and the other to Fort Smith.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nExtract from Rev. J. Serruriot's letter of March 31, 1936.\n\n\"When checking lately all payments received from the Department for night watchmen at the I. R. School of Fort-Providence, N.W.T., I found that up to the present time, no payment has been received through our Bank for the above-named night watchmen since the beginning of the present fiscal year, that is last October, 1937. So, I was wondering whether you have received no reports for that school, or whether the cheques have been mailed directly to the Principal at Fort-Providence.

Many thanks! I very much appreciate your kind consideration of our needs and for your provision for same, as manifested by the allocations. Among the allocations, you have $2000. for the lighting plant. This is not sufficient to cover the expenditure that the installation will call for so I advise that the allocation of $500. for Fort Resolution for general repairs and the allocation of $500. for Providence for general repairs, be allotted for the installation of the lighting plant and, if necessary, even the allocation of $300. for class-room material for Providence be used for this purpose.\n\nThere is no mail service for the North now and it will be June before we will have regular communication. Hence it is impossible to obtain details of requisites for the installation of the Plant but the engine could be ordered now.\n\nWe have the Lister Diesel engine at Resolution and Simpson and they are very satisfactory. If you approve of this engine, we could place the order.\n\nPlease do not place the order for new desks and chairs for Providence until further word from me in spite of whatever they may petition you to do from Providence.\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your kind co-operation.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop of Adramyte,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie.\nOttawa,\nApril 22, 1938.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th instant regarding the lighting plant required for the Providence Mission Residential School. I note that until this lighting plant is installed and we are aware of its cost no other repairs, improvements or equipment should be supplied to either Fort Resolution or Providence Mission.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of the 4th instant all purchases must now be made through our Purchasing Branch and I, therefore, regret that it is not possible to give you the authority to purchase the Diesel engine for Providence Mission. I note, however, from your letter that the engine now used at Fort Resolution is satisfactory and I find that we paid for the following installation at that school in the fall of 1936:\n\n1 Type 52, 4\u00bd Kilowatt, 110 Volt Lister Diesel Lighting Plant Complete\n\n1 Set 160 Ampere Hour Exide \"Ironclad\" Batteries\n\nPlease let me know at once if the above will be satisfactory for Providence Mission and, if so, I will forward the information to our Purchasing Branch in order to arrange for early purchase and shipment.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been directed by the Rt Reverend Bishop G. Breynat, who is actually visiting his missions up-North, to write you on his behalf regarding the lighting plant and electrical installation for the Indian Res. School at Fort-Providence, N.W.T.\n\nIn his letter to you of last April 15th, Bishop Breynat was asking that the allocations of $500. for Fort-Resolution school - general repairs-, also $500. for Fort-Providence school -general repairs-, and even the allocation of $300. for class-room material for Providence school, be allotted for the installation of this lighting plant. All of these allocations were mentioned in your letter of last April 4th.\n\nWhen replying to Bishop Breynat, you agreed in your letter of the 22nd of April to his proposal, and in the last paragraph of this letter, you requested His Lordship to give you full details regarding other requisites required in connection with the installation of the lighting plant as soon as he would have received necessary informations from Providence.\n\nThese informations from Providence were received early this month. Then we had to give plans of the school to an electrician who is thoroughly acquainted with the various missions posts in the North, in order to have him figuring the material which would be necessary and to have quotations for same.\n\nQuotations have been asked both from the Canadian General Electric Co., - from which firm you purchased the plant-, and from the Bruce-Robinson Electric Co., of Edmonton. It may be well to inform you that the quotation from the Can. General Electric amounts to $681.78, while the quotation from the Bruce-Robinson Electric amounts to $673.51 only, prices being quoted f.o.b. Waterways. These quotations have been given us on the 24th instant.\n\nWe know that your Department has decided that all purchases made by your purchasing Agent and we were ready to hand these quotations over to you. Nevertheless, you will\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDept of Mines & Resources........\n\nundoubtedly realize our position in this occurrence for the following reasons:\n\nThe last boat leaving Ft-Smith for Providence is scheduled for August 20th, and freight for this boat should arrive at Waterways three weeks before the boat leaves Ft-Smith; otherwise, one is not entitled to have the freight going through from Waterways to Ft-Smith for sure. Then, if this material for Providence is not shipped from Edmonton at least by the train of August 2nd, it means that the installation would have to be postponed until next summer. And you are aware that we have only one train a week between Edmonton and Waterways.\n\nConsequently, we could not help but giving immediately the order for the material to the Bruce-Robinson Electric Co., so that everything would be ready and crated carefully for shipment by the train of August 2nd. By waiting longer until we would get a definite reply from Ottawa, we would have simply lost all chance to have this material delivered at Providence this fall.\n\nAlong with the list of material needed for the installation, we have requested the electrician to give us an estimate of the price that he would charge us for the installing of everything. His prices are as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Price   |\n|-------------------------------|---------|\n| Wiring                        | $336.75 |\n| Installing of the plant        | $100.00 |\n| Transportation of electrician  |         |\n| from Edmonton to Providence & back | $200.00 |\n\nTotal $636.75\n\nSo, the total of both material and work will amount to $1,310.26\n\nWe have not included in this estimation the freight of the plant and material from Waterways to Providence, which would amount to some $400., to $450., nor the charges for boarding the electrician at Providence, nor any expenses in connection with the erection of the power house.\n\nThe electrician to whom we refer in this letter is Mr Stanley Sunley, electrical contractor of Edmonton, who has been making in the past our installations at the Indian School of Fort Resolution, at the Hospital of Fort Simpson and the Hospital of Ft-McMurray.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nDept of Mines & Resources........\n\nHis ability as well as his low prices are well known here. For reference, we might mention you that, among other contracts, he has awarded this year the contract for wiring the new store of the Hudson's Bay Company and the new hangar for the Trans-Canada Air Lines in Edmonton. We trust him as the most reliable man we could choose for doing our installations up-North and we always found his work highly recommendable.\n\nTrusting all these informations will enable you to give a fair consideration to this matter,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nFather J. Serrurot, O.M.I.\nBursar.\nOttawa,\nAugust 6, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the action you have taken in connection with the Fort Providence Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Missions of Mackenzie,\n9916 - 110 St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nHis Excellency Bishop Breynat,\n9018 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton.\n\nYour Lordship:\n\nWe were very disappointed in not receiving the order for the Plant at Providence, and in view of the fact that there was some difference in price I think that we should point out to you that the Plant which is being supplied at a lower price is not a direct-connected Plant or radiator cooled, and it is not being supplied with Ironclad Batteries.\n\nThe Plant being supplied is a belt driven Plant, is tank cooled, and is being supplied with a plated plate type of Battery.\n\nAlthough our price for our equipment was only approximately $200.00 higher, we could have supplied a belt driven Plant at a much lower figure than the figure quoted. However, we hope that this Plant will be satisfactory and if there is anything we can do to assist you in any way we will be glad to do it.\n\nYour washer for Smith is now on the way. I believe it will leave Edmonton on Tuesday's freight addressed to M.C.R. Smith, C/o Hudson's Bay Company, Watersays.\n\nWe brought this washer by carload to Winnipeg, but had to ship it local freight to Edmonton and to Watersays as they would not accept this large shipment in a pool car.\n\nWe hope this piece of equipment arrives in good order, and we might say that we will have a man in Fort Smith early in August and he will inspect this machine and adjust it if it needs it.\nWe trust that you will have a restful and enjoyable trip to Europe this summer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBRUCE ROBINSON ELECTRIC LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

One set one hundred and sixty ampere hour exide ironclad batteries. All f.o.b., Waterways, Alberta.\"\n\nThe Bruce Robinson Electric Company replied in accordance with copy of their letter enclosed, from which you will see that they did not submit any alternative price. They had the same opportunity as the successful tenderer of quoting on the cheaper plant, if they so desired. The tenders were all discussed with officers of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, who advised that the cheaper plant quoted on by the Canadian General Electric would be quite satisfactory for this department's requirements. Several of these same plants have been supplied to the Department of Transport. Surely, if the plant satisfies their requirements it should meet the requirements of the Providence Mission Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., Sept. 26, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your circular 503-606 re the danger of fire in Indian Residential Schools and the same has been brought to the attention of the Principal of the Fort Providence Residential School on my Treaty Paying trip of this Summer, and further action will be taken by myself on my trip to Fort Providence this Fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nH.W.

Since then a representative of the company, at Ottawa, has called on me in regard to the care of the battery.\n\nMy understanding is that this battery, unless it is stored in a warm place during the winter, would deteriorate very greatly. Would it be possible for your officer to see that it is properly stored? If there is already an old lighting plant in use at that point, possibly the new battery could be hooked up to this plant and in this manner kept charged; otherwise, it will take a very long time to bring it up to full charge when the rest of the plant arrives at Fort Providence next year.\n\nI should be pleased to have a reply just as quickly as possible.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nOctober 6, 1938.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nOn July 11th last we mailed to you Purchase Order No. 6088, for one electric lighting plant required by the Indian Affairs Residential School at Fort Providence.

If at all possible it should reach that point by the time navigation opens.\"\n\nIn a memorandum to the Purchasing Agent on June 10 we directed his attention to the necessity of securing this lighting equipment as soon as possible in order that it could be shipped to the school before navigation closed. Representations having been received from His Lordship Rt. Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., the Purchasing Agent's office was phoned on two or three occasions following our memorandum of June 10.\n\nOn July 8 the order was finally placed (Order No. 6088) with the Canadian General Electric Company.\n\nWe were under the impression that the Purchasing Agent had arranged with the Company for immediate shipment of this lighting equipment but from correspondence now received from the Purchasing Agent's office it is apparent that the Company only shipped the batteries.\nAs a result this Branch is placed in a rather awkward position. Bishop Breynat has been urging the installation of this lighting equipment for some years past and following the placing of the order on July 8 we definitely informed him that the equipment would go forward this year. In addition funds for the payment of the lighting equipment were provided in the current year's appropriation. As the equipment has not been forwarded it will be necessary to re-vote this amount.\n\nIf it is the intention to permit the Canadian General Electric Company to supply the equipment next year it is our opinion that the Company should be obliged to supply new batteries as it is not likely that the batteries which they have sent to the school this year will be 100% perfect next year.\n\nDirector.\nLarger price $3 \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\frac{1}{2} \\times 6$\n\nTrunked price $200$ lbs.\n\n$(4 \\times 5 \\times 5)$\n\nA.

W. McGill,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of the 15th instant, relative to the new lighting equipment at the Providence Mission Residential School.\n\nThe following facts in the case have been furnished me by the Departmental Purchasing Agent:\n\nYour requisition of May 5th, with covering memorandum, was received in the office of the Purchasing Agent on May 10th.\n\nThe principle of the purchase was approved by the Minister on your memorandum of May 5th.\n\nAs your requisition did not give sufficient details, it was necessary for the Purchasing Agent to consult officials of the Engineering and Construction Service as to the specifications to be embodied in the request for quotations.\n\nQuotations were requested by telegram on June 17 from four Edmonton firms.\n\nYour memorandum of June 10 is not on record with the Purchasing Agent.\n\nQuotations were received as follows:\n- Bruce Robinson Electric, Ltd., June 27;\n- Northern Electric Co., Ltd., June 28;\n- Canadian General Electric, Ltd., June 30.\n\nThe quotations were opened and the officials of the Engineering and Construction Service were again consulted as to the most suitable equipment. A memorandum recommending the purchase from the Canadian General Electric Company, Ltd., was submitted for the approval of the Minister on July 4. The local office of the company was immediately advised by phone of\nacceptance of their tender.\n\nPurchase Order issued July 8, and forwarded the Treasury Office for encumbrance, and the original was mailed the Company on July 11.\n\nThe Company stated on their tender that complete shipment could be made about three weeks, from Ottawa.\n\nIt is utterly impossible for the officials of the Purchasing Section to follow all shipments for which purchase orders have issued, through to their destinations. It is, therefore, the duty of the Receiving Officer, or of the branch concerned, to see that shipments are received at their destinations promptly. In this particular case the Purchasing Agent was not aware that the equipment had not been delivered until October 5th, when a representative of the Canadian General Electric Company called on him and advised that the batteries had been shipped and had arrived at Fort Providence, but that the rest of the equipment had missed connections with the boat at Waterways.\n\nNotwithstanding that the Company is to blame for delay in making shipment, the order should have been followed up by officials of your branch, and an endeavour made to secure early delivery.\n\nAs you are aware, officials of the company at Ottawa are endeavouring to secure information as to the present whereabouts of the batteries. You will be further advised when the information is secured and what arrangements have been made for storage.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, October 22, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER:\n\nRe: Purchase of lighting system for Providence Mission Residential School\n\nMay I refer to my memorandum to you of October 15 and Mr. Jackson's reply thereto dated October 19, 1938?\n\nIn my memorandum of October 15, an attempt was made to summarize correspondence that had taken place between this Branch and your office, with respect to the purchase of a lighting plant for the Providence Mission Residential School. I felt that you should have before you this information when protests with respect to the delay in making this particular purchase reached you from the church authorities. I also felt that the Canadian General Electric Company should be called upon to replace the batteries next year. I had no thought in mind at that time of either attaching blame or focusing responsibility for the regrettable delay that has occurred. I realize that with central purchasing in force delays such as this, particularly in the early stages, are almost inevitable. There does not appear to be any dispute with respect to the procedure as outlined in my memorandum. Mr. Jackson does state, however, that our requisition did not give sufficient details. The officials inform me that this purchase was discussed on more than one occasion with His Lordship Bishop Breynat, who was of the opinion that the lighting system should be similar to the one supplied the Fort Resolution School in 1936. This plant, since the date of its installation, has given complete satisfaction.\n\nMay I refer, therefore, to the third paragraph of my memorandum -\nmemorandum to you dated May 5, 1938, copy of which I attach?\n\nI feel that, in justice to the officials of the Training Division, I should refer to the paragraph in your memorandum in which you state: \"Notwithstanding that the Company is to blame for delay in making shipment, the order should have been followed up by officials of your Branch and an endeavour made to secure early delivery\".\n\nI am enclosing herewith copy of a telegram dated Ottawa, July 7, 1938, prepared by the Chief of the Training Division, signed by myself and forwarded to Bishop Breynat. This telegram was prepared and sent forward just as soon as the Chief of the Training Division had secured, by phone, the necessary information from the Purchasing Agent.\n\nI feel that Mr. Jackson, in making this comment, has overlooked the position in which the Chief of the Training Division found himself during the summer months. You may remember that from May 18 until August 3 Mr. Phelan was the sole official in the Training Division. During these months he was responsible for the preparation of our summer building programme, the repair of Indian day and residential schools, the engagement and re-engagement of teachers at the end of the academic year. In addition to this, he had to deal with thousands of applications for tuition grants during the month of July and had to prepare and send forward to the Purchasing Division all the memoranda relating to purchases in his Division. To ask a man placed in this position to follow up any particular order and see that delivery was made is asking, in my humble judgment, our officials to undertake and accomplish what is wholly impossible.\n\nI have been informed that at no time during the conferences that have been held by the officials of our Branch with the Purchasing Agent has the suggestion been made that the officials of our Branch were responsible for the prompt delivery of the supplies. In this connection you will be interested to know that, when our officials did attempt to expedite the delivery of school desks at the Oneida School, the company responsible for delivery did not even have the courtesy to acknowledge receipt of our letter. In other words -\nwords, companies supplying orders received from the Purchasing Agent of the Department of Mines and Resources do not feel under any obligation to acknowledge receipt of letters from officials of the Indian Affairs Branch. I am of the opinion that to have the Purchasing Agent place the orders and have our officials communicate with the companies with respect to deliveries and time of deliveries will lead in the end to delay and confusion.\n\nIt has been our practice to send forward to the Purchasing Agent, from time to time, a list of the requisitions that had been placed with him and the dates when these requisitions were sent forward. The Purchasing Agent was also reminded on such occasions that deliveries had not been made. The officials inform me that, when they did this, they were of the opinion that such action was all that was expected from them.\n\nI am attaching hereto copy of the memorandum sent forward on June 10, the original of which, Mr. Jackson states, is not on record at the office of the Purchasing Agent.\n\nMay I suggest that it might be advisable to bring together again in conference the officials of this Branch interested in purchasing, with the Purchasing Agent and with Mr. Jackson. I am of the opinion that in the purchase and delivery of departmental supplies, greater use might be made of our field officials, particularly our inspectors. In respect to the particular purchase now under review, it is difficult for me to overlook the fact that we have a senior official at Calgary and no less than three Indian agents close to the city of Edmonton, any one or all of whom might have been asked to see that delivery of this particular lighting plant was made and that it reached Waterways prior to the close of navigation.\n\nDirector.\nRA228 50 DL\n\nEDMONTON ALTA 22 1231P\n\nR A HOEY\n\nDOMINION GOVERNMENT OTTAWA ONT\n\nRETEL AIR FREIGHT ON LIGHTNING PLANT STOP CHARTER RATE FOR MACKENZIE AIR SERVICE FIFTEEN HUNDRED SEVENTY DOLLARS CANADIAN AIRWAYS SIXTEEN HUNDRED EIGHTY DOLLARS IF CANADIAN AIRWAYS CAN USE PLANE ON RETURN TRIP PRICE TWELVE HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE STOP BOTH COMPANIES WOULD BE ABLE DELIVER PROVIDENCE BY DECEMBER FIFTEENTH CONDITIONS PERMITTING\n\nNORTHERN TRANSPORTATION CO LTD A M BERRY.\nOttawa, October 24, 1938.\n\nEX'D.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Sister Mack - Principal, Indian Residential School, Fort Providence, N.W.T. Due to some delay this order comprising two shipments arrived at Waterways too late to catch the boat for Fort Providence, and we will therefore be unable to make delivery to the ultimate destination until the Spring season.\n\nWe understand that you have been kind enough to accept one shipment consisting of the Engine Generator Set, Switchboard and sundries, and have indicated your willingness to store this equipment in a suitably heated building until transportation can be arranged to Fort Providence.\n\nWe would also very much appreciate you also accepting the second shipment consisting of the battery for storage for the same length of time, but would ask you to observe the following precautions:\n\nThis shipment should be stored in a room, the temperature of which should range between 0\u00b0F and 40\u00b0F. The temperature of the room should not be allowed to go beyond these limits, since any higher or lower temperature will damage the battery. If it is at all possible, a constant temperature of say 20\u00b0F might be maintained.\n\nIn order that this equipment might be delivered to Fort Providence in the spring in good condition, we would appreciate your cooperation in observing these conditions.\n\nFinally, we would like to express our sincere thanks for the kind service\nyou will render us by holding this equipment at the Mission.\n\nWe would like to hear from you in this connection at your convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nContract Service Dept., Head Office.\n\nRD Mawhood:46\nRMPrendergast\nHS Ryan Edmonton\nMr. Wilkes Excise Batteries\n\nP.S.

It is in the McMurray Warehouse of the Northern Transportation Company Limited.\n\nThe Engine Generator Set is at the Mission at Fort McMurray and we are trying to make arrangements for storing the battery there too. We attach a copy of a letter we have written from our Head Office in Toronto to the Roman Catholic Mission at Fort McMurray about the storage of this equipment. We will advise you later what has been done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCANADIAN GENERAL ELECTRIC COMPANY LTD.,\nAPPARATUS SALES DIVISION.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 28, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H.W.

I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would concur in my advising the Canadian General Electric Company that this Branch is not prepared to accept the batteries at present being stored at Fort McMurray but that we expect them to supply new batteries next year. The Canadian General Electric Company can arrange for having the batteries at present at McMurray returned.\n\nFunds for payment of the lighting plant for the Providence Mission school were provided in the current year's appropriation. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would approve our paying for the lighting plant from the current year's appropriation provided the Canadian General Electric Company assure us that new batteries will be supplied to replace those stored at McMurray.\n\nDirector.\nOctober 26, 1938.\n\nPh.

J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar, R.C. Missions of Mackenzie,\nFort McMurray, Alta.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. H. W. McGill,\n\nReplying to your memorandum of the 5th instant, respecting the lighting plant for Fort Providence, it is most unfortunate that the company supplying this plant did not make shipment as promised, so that the plant could have been shipped from Waterways this fall. As it is, the batteries and other portions of the plant are now stored at McMurray. You have, of course, not accepted delivery of this equipment, and I agree with you that it would be inadvisable to accept delivery of the batteries as these would be practically a year old when they reach Providence Mission School, and, in addition, it is doubtful as to what condition they would be in.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion that the equipment might be paid for out of this year's appropriation, on the understanding that the batteries now at McMurray would be replaced next spring on the opening of navigation, I would direct your attention to Section 30 of the Consolidated Revenue and Audit Act, which provides, among other things, as follows:\n\n\"The Deputy Minister, or other officer charged with the administration of the particular Service, certifies that such work has been performed, or such materials supplied, as the case may be, and that the price charged is according to contract; or, if not, covered by contract, is fair and just.\"\n\nI think it would be very difficult to give such a certificate covering the receipt of the batteries forming a part of the equipment in question.\n\nThere does not seem to be any reason why progress accounts should not be paid covering all of the equipment except the batteries, or it might be possible for you to arrange to have a new set of batteries accepted before the 1st April next by one of your officers in Ontario, and still have the account properly certified, and paid, out of this year's appropriation.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR OPERATION OF DIESEL ENGINE DRIVEN BATTERY CHARGER\n\nThese instructions cover a diesel engine driven 4\u00bd kilowatt, direct current, battery charging generator set, arranged for V belt drive and mounted on a common cast iron base plate.\n\nThis assembly is indicated on drawing #5-2 attached hereto.\n\nEngine\n\nDetailed instructions covering the engine are enclosed in a tin packing case with the unit.\n\nThe engine is a Model \"IDE\", serial number 46967, full diesel, of the 4 stroke cycle type, suitable for operating on fuel oil having a B.T.U. value of not less than 19,000 B.T.U's per pound, with a viscosity not exceeding 50 Seconds Redwood No. 1 at 100 degrees F.\n\nThe engine is fitted with full pressure lubrication, utilizing a gear driven lubricating oil pump, and means for adjusting this pressure are fully described in the engine operating instructions.\n\nThe engine will develop 8\u00bd h.p. continuously for 12 hours at 1000 r.p.m., and 9\u00bd h.p. for a period of 1 hour. It is of the single cylinder type having a cylinder bore of 4-1/8\", and a stroke of 6\", giving a mean piston speed of 1000 ft. per minute. The engine has a compression ratio of 16\u00bd to 1, with a mean effective pressure of 84 lbs. per square inch. The guaranteed fuel oil consumption will not exceed .45 pounds per b.h.p. hour, and the lubricating oil consumption is approximately .034 pints per hour.\n\nThe engine is fitted with a sensitive fly-ball type governor mounted on the crank shaft, and has a special fly-wheel to provide for close speed and voltage regulation.\n\nMeans for starting and stopping this engine manually are clearly indicated in the instruction book accompanying the engine.\n\nA price parts list is attached hereto.\n\nGenerator\n\nThe generator has a rating of 5 kilowatts, direct-current, compound wound, for 1750 r.p.m., 125 volts, 40 amperes.\nIt is of the British Thomson-Houston type DY, Frame No. 2816, descriptive list 2252-1, and as per outline diagram ED-7288, all of which are attached hereto.\n\nA field rheostat is provided and mounted on the switchboard to maintain the unit at proper operating conditions and to prevent overload being put on the engine. Under no condition is the amperage rating of the generator to be exceeded, and the rheostat must be adjusted to maintain the output of the generator within this rating, otherwise the generator and engine will become overloaded.\n\nThe generator is mounted on slide rails which form an integral part of the cast iron base plate. Adjustment is provided to permit removal of the V belt and the maintaining of same at the correct tension. The slide rails must be set so that there is approximately a total movement of 1\" of the V belt when the unit is stationary.\n\nV Belt Drive\n\nV Belt Drive consists of 4 D42 texropes driving a 5.7\" pitch diameter sheave on the generator and being driven by a 10\" pitch diameter sheave on the engine flywheel.\n\nSwitchboard\n\nThe switchboard consists of an ebony asbestos panel mounted on pipe supports and designed for a maximum capacity of 5 kilowatts, 125 volts, 40 amperes.\n\nOn the switchboard there is provided the following equipment:\n\n2 - Ground detector lamp receptacles\n1 - Miniature style, 150 volt, D.C. Indicating Voltmeter\n1 - 60 amp D.C. Indicating Ammeter, miniature style\n1 - 60 amp. 250 volt, D.P.S.T. open knife switch with fuse clips\n1 - 50 amp., 140 volt, type V-1 Hartman Cutout for battery charging.\n\nThere is also provided a starting rheostat so that the engine can be cranked from the batteries and thus obviate the necessity of hand cranking. This battery starting is accomplished by, first of all, turning the generator field rheostat counterclockwise as far as it will go in order that the generator will not take an excessive quantity of current from the battery. Next, make sure that the engine injection system is solid, as described in the engine manual, and that the exhaust valve is lifted off its\nseat by means of the decompression lever, as described in the engine manual. The engine is now ready to be cranked and this is accomplished by gradually lifting the lever on the cranking rheostat until the engine begins to turn over. Once the engine is turning over the cranking rheostat lever must be dropped to its original position and the compression lever lowered to the stop, which will then permit of the engine starting to fire. Once the engine starts to fire and comes up to speed, the generator field rheostat must be adjusted to the proper position for charging. This is accomplished by turning the rheostat in a clockwise rotation.\n\nCooling\n\nCooling is accomplished by the thermo siphon principle and the cooling tank should be set up as indicated in drawing F-2 attached hereto. Sufficient piping is provided to make the necessary connections to suit the actual location.\n\nExhaust Line\n\nThis should be run in as straight a line as possible and with as few turns as is possible. A suitable muffler is provided for the engine exhaust.\n\nBatteries\n\nThe batteries are shipped in an uncharged condition and consist of 56 cells containing 13 plates, having a capacity of 177 ampere hours at the 72 hour rating and a voltage drop to 1.85 volts per cell.\n\nThe Exide type KXHS battery which has been provided is specially designed for lighting plant service.

All the machines may be made suitable for operating horizontally, vertically, or at any desired angle: Types D and DY machines have feet\u2014Type DVY has no feet, but can be mounted in an overhung position, or a circular skirt-base can be provided to support the frame with the shaft vertical, if required.\n\nOVERLOADS.\n\nIn accordance with B.S.S. 168, the motors are capable of carrying, without injury, the following overloads. The sustained overloads will only apply when the ambient temperature does not exceed 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F).\n\n| RATING OF MOTOR | SUSTAINED OVERLOADS | MOMENTARY OVERLOADS |\n|-----------------|---------------------|---------------------|\n|                 | Torque | Duration | Torque | Duration |\n| Below 4 h.p. per 1000 r.p.m. down to 1 h.p. per 1000 r.p.m. | 25% | 15 min. | 50% | 1 min. |\n| Below 10 h.p. per 1000 r.p.m. down to 4 h.p. per 1000 r.p.m. | 25% | 30 min. | 100% | 15 sec. |\n| 10 h.p. and upwards per 1000 r.p.m. | 25% | 2 hours |\n\nAs efforts are made constantly to improve both designs and methods of manufacture, the apparatus supplied may differ in details from the illustrations.\n\nTHE BRITISH THOMSON-HOUSTON CO., LTD.,\nRUGBY, ENGLAND.\nCONSTRUCTIONAL DETAILS.\n\nThe constructional features are generally similar throughout the range, with the exception of the endshields of the two smaller sizes (see illustrations). The constructional differences and those sizes which are suitable for the different enclosures are indicated separately in the table given on page 5.\n\nPOLES. Laminations of steel punchings are used for the main poles; the commutating poles are solid of high-grade magnetic iron; the poles are each secured to the frame by two bolts.\n\nFIELD WINDINGS. The field coils are former wound and completely taped up and water-proofed. Any coil can readily be taken off the pole piece after the latter has been removed from the frame. The commutating pole windings are wound direct on the pole with a layer of insulating material between the winding and the core; and finally completely taped.\n\nARMATURE (see Fig. 4). The core consists of laminations of sheet iron of high permeability, slotted on the periphery to receive the windings and clamped under pressure between substantial end flanges. The laminations are coated with insulating compound before assembly to minimize eddy currents. The armature coils are adequately secured in place by strong binding bands.\n\nThe commutator is composed of hard drawn copper segments and mica, and has ample cooling surface. In the larger sizes cooling is assisted by ventilating slots in the shell.\n\nThe complete armature is vacuum dried and then treated with special moisture-proof compound to render it immune from the effects of damp when put into service.\n\nPage 2\nBRUSHGEAR. The mica insulated brushgear is of substantial construction, and designed with particular regard to the ease and rapidity with which renewals and adjustments can be made. The brush pigtails and machine leads are attached to the same terminals on the brush box, so that the pressure finger and the brush box are not required to carry current. The pressure of any brush is practically uniform throughout the life of the brush, and is readily adjustable without the use of tools.\n\nENDSHIELDS AND ENCLOSURES. The endshields are of strong construction, provided with ample ventilating openings. They are spigoted to the frame and the bearing housing is bored and accurately ground to size to take the ball or roller bearings. The endshield facings are machined so that the various covers fit closely.\n\nIt should be noted that the ratings of the machine are based on certain definite types of enclosure. If, therefore, one type of enclosure is changed for another type, the rating, or temperature rise, or both, may be modified by such a change. Furthermore, totally-enclosing covers must not be fitted to machines designed for other types of enclosure without modifications to the field windings.\n\nBEARINGS. Roller bearings are fitted at the driving end and ball bearings at the commutator end. The ball bearing at the non-driving end serves to take a limited amount of endthrust. The outer races of the bearings are clamped between heavy cast-iron bearing caps. Grease lubrication is used and wide-faced sealing glands effectively retain the grease and prevent the entry of dirt.\n\nHIGH POTENTIAL TESTS. Before the machine is dispatched from the Works it is required to pass the high potential tests as laid down in British Standard Specification No. 168/1936.\nFig. 5. Type D1815 Screen-Protected Machine. Covers fit closely over machined endshields at both ends. Terminal box suitable for conduit connections.\n\nFig. 6. Type D2820 Screen-Protected Machine with vertical perforated covers and standard pulley.\n\nFig. 7. Type D4432 Screen-Protected Motor. Air-ducts for pipe-ventilation can be brought to the machined openings in place of the perforated covers, when required. Terminal box cover is adjustable to suit connections.\n\nFig. 8. Type DY 1514 with close-fitting endshields.\n\nFig. 9. Type DY 2820 with steel covers fitted to frame.\nENCLOSURES.\n\nThis line of direct current machines consists of the following types:\n\n- **Type D**\u2014Stock motors.\n- **Type DY**\u2014Non-stock motors and generators.\n- **Type DVY**\u2014Vertical or overhung motors.\n\nThe complete range of these machines is shown in the table given below, in which the slight variations in the frame and endshields between the large and small sizes are indicated. The different forms of enclosing covers which can be fitted to the various frame sizes are also given.\n\n### FRAME\n\n| Type D | No. of Main Poles | Frame and Endshields | Screen Protected | Drip-Proof | Totally Enclosed | Totally Enclosed Weatherproof | Pipe-Ventilated | Totally Enclosed Fan-Cooled |\n|--------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1514   | 2                 | Cast-iron frame with cast-iron circular endshields (see Fig. 3) | Tight-fitting perforated sheet steel bands around endshields (see Fig. 5) | Tight-fitting perforated sheet steel bands around endshields; cold air driving out (see Fig. 13) | Tight-fitting sheet steel bands around endshields; axial openings similarly covered (see Fig. 8) | Subject to special enquiry | Not supplied | Not supplied |\n\n### ENCLOSURE\n\n| Type DY | No. of Main Poles | Frame and Endshields | Screen Protected | Drip-Proof | Totally Enclosed | Totally Enclosed Weatherproof | Pipe-Ventilated | Totally Enclosed Fan-Cooled |\n|---------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------|\n| 2215    | 2                 |                      |                  |            |                  |                               |                |                             |\n| 2223    | 2                 |                      |                  |            |                  |                               |                |                             |\n| 2816    | 4                 | Steel frame side openings fitted by cast-iron perforated sheet steel covers (see Fig. 6) | Side openings fitted with cast-iron louvred covers (see Fig. 7) | Side openings closed by plain sheet steel covers (see Fig. 9) | Side openings closed by cast-iron machined joints packed (see Fig. 10) | Side openings left uncovered for air ducts attached (see Fig. 11) | Same as for Totally Enclosed Machine (vertical excluded) (see Fig. 11) |\n\nScreen-Protected Motor.

Type DY 3420 Totally-Enclosed Weatherproof Motor, Endshield openings closed by cast-iron plates; joints are packed.\n\nPage 5\nTOTALLY-ENCLOSED FAN-COOLED MOTORS.\n\nTotally-enclosed motors, especially the larger sizes, are considerably reduced in output (as compared with ventilated motors) when running continuously at standard temperature rises.\n\nTo obviate this they can be supplied fitted with an external fan protected by an outer hood which deflects the air drawn in by the fan over the outer surface of the machines.\n\nBy this means the motor is cooled without losing its totally-enclosed feature, and this results in a greatly increased output, particularly at the higher speeds. The passage of air to the fan should not be restricted by a solid pulley or coupling.\n\nTYPE DVY MOTORS FOR VERTICAL AND OVERHUNG OPERATION.\n\nAs indicated on page 1, the construction of these motors is identical with that of the ordinary motors provided with feet, except that a modified type of endshield is fitted at the lower, or driving, end by means of which the motor can be attached to the frame of the driven machine. Bolt holes are drilled in the endshield for this purpose, and the machined spigot ensures correct location of the motors.\n\nThese motors can be supplied with any form of enclosure referred to on page 5, except totally-enclosed fan-cooled. A drip-proof cowl is fitted to vertical ventilated motors, when necessary.\n\nFig. 11. Type DV2820 Totally-Enclosed Fan-cooled Motor, with hood cut away to show external fan.\n\nFig. 12.

Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRef.: Your File I39-3-5.\n\nDear Mr Phelan,\n\nWith reference to my letter of the last July 26th regarding the lighting plant for the Indian Residential school of Fort Providence, I am enclosing herewith vouchers in triplicate together with invoices in triplicate covering purchases made by us, as was mentioned in my letter referred above.\n\nAs this amount has not been paid by us to the Bruce-Robinson Electric Ltd., we would appreciate it if you would have the cheque mailed direct to that firm in Edmonton.\n\nWe may say that we have been greatly disappointed to learn that the plant itself which the Dept of Mines and Resources purchased from the General Electric Co. arrived at Waterways much too late to be shipped to Fort Providence by the Transportation Company. We have been informed that the batteries arrived at Waterways on last September 14th, while the engine, dynamo, switchboard and all the power house equipment arrived on September 22nd.\n\nIn his telegram to Bishop Breynat of the last July 7th, Dr H. McGill said that the General Electric Co. had been requested to rush delivery of this material. We feel that, in this instance, the General Electric Co. has been exceptionally slow in delivering it. The consequence for us is that the installation of the electric lighting plant for Providence has to be postponed until next summer, the first transportation boat that reaches Providence after the break-up arriving there usually around June 20th. The plant and batteries cannot be there before that time. We think it is useless to send the electrician for the installation, as he could only make half of the job, moreover the school would have no electric lighting at all, even though the wiring would have been done this fall.\n\nAfter Bishop Breynat called at your office last August on his way to Europe, he wrote me and informed me that, even after everything would have been paid for the electric lighting plant and installation at Ft-Providence, there would still\n\n........... 2)\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 2)\nPhilip Phelan, Esq.,\nChief, Training Division .......\nOctober 25, 1938.\n\nremain a balance of some $200.00 or more which had been voted\nthis year for the equipment of schools in the R.C. Mackenzie\nDiocese, and he advised me to let you know what other material\npurchased for our schools on which this balance could be applied.\nIn this view, I am enclosing invoices in triplicate covering\npurchase of a bread mixer shipped to the same Providence' school\nand already paid by us.\n\nOn the other hand, from my letter of last July 26, you\nwill notice that we were figuring a total of $1,310.26 for the\nwiring and cost of the necessary material at Providence, outside\nof what your Department has already paid. But, as it is useless\nnow to consider the installing of this plant for this fall on\naccount of the plant being still at Waterways, we find that our\nprevious figure of $1,310.26 has to be reduced to $672.99, this\nbeing the total of invoices from Bruce-Robinson Electric Ltd.\nConsequently there is a difference of $637.27, of which we suggest\nthat $441.79 be applied to the bread mixer and the remaining\n$195.48 or whatever other balance left be applied for the pur-\nchase of material needed for the erection of the power house at\nthe same Providence's school.\n\nIn fact, I have here invoices not paid yet to the\namount of $248.75 for the power house erection, and also an\ninvoice of $92.20 for the Aklavik school. The total which we\nwould then submit for payment would be made up as follows:\n\n| Item                                      | Amount   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Electric material for Providence          | $672.99  |\n| Bread mixer                               | $441.79  |\n| Lumber and similar material for the       |          |\n| erection of the power house at Providence | $248.75  |\n| Material for general repairs at Aklavik    | $92.20   |\n\nThis gives a total of $1,455.73 as against $1,310.26\nmentioned in my letter of July, the difference being only $145.47.\nAccording to Bishop Breynat's letter referred above, the total\namount voted for the different schools was covering more than\nthis balance. If you would kindly let me know whether the Depart-\nment will consider the two invoices for Aklavik and Providence\namounting to $92.20 and $248.75 respectively, I will gladly have\nthem forwarded to you also, though I have them in duplicate only.\n\nTrusting these explanations will help you to straig-\nten up everything and thanking you for all past favors, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n(Father J.

As the season was advancing the school management advised us that acting on instructions of Rt. Rev. Bishop Breynat they arranged for the purchase of the material required to wire the building. Purchase was made from the Bruce Robinson Electric Company at a cost of $672.99. This material has already reached the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Honourable the Minister would approve of our paying the above account. Funds are available in the current year's appropriation. P.C. 621 of April 25, 1938, gives us the requisite authority to expend the money to this Church-owned school.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nOttawa,\nMarch 4, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe attached requisition has just been received from the Principal of the Providence Mission residential school.\n\nBefore considering the placing of orders for the articles that she requests I thought it advisable to communicate with you and advise you what amount will be available for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the schools in the Diocese of Mackenzie during the fiscal year 1938-40. These amounts are as follows:\n\n| SCHOOL            | EQUIPMENT | REPAIRS |\n|-------------------|-----------|---------|\n| Aklavik           | $200.00   | $500.00 |\n| Providence Mission| $2,100.00 | $500.00 |\n| Fort Resolution   | $200.00   | $500.00 |\n\nI should appreciate your advising in what manner you desire the above amount expended. I think you will agree that the first consideration is to complete the electrical installation at Providence Mission.\n\nIn the event of your requiring any equipment you should let me have full details in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch.\n\nRev. J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar, R.C. Missions of Mackenzie,\nFort McMurray, Alta.\nWhen your reply is received it will have very careful consideration. You understand, of course, that the total amount expended at the three schools must not exceed the amounts mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

As the season was advancing the school management advised us that acting on instructions of Rt. Rev. Bishop Breynat they arranged for the purchase of the material required to wire the building. Purchase was made from the Bruce Robinson Electric Company at a cost of $672.99. This material has already reached the school.\n\nIt would be appreciated if the Honourable the Minister would approve of our paying the above account. Funds are available in the current year's appropriation. P.C. 821 of April 25, 1938, gives us the requisite authority to expend the money to this Church-owned school.\n\nDirector.\nFebruary 17, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson,\n\nWith reference to the attached memorandum from the Director of Indian Affairs, we purchased last July from the Canadian General Electric Company, of Edmonton, a lighting plant valued at $2,094.00. However, due to the fault of the company, the equipment arrived at Waterways too late for shipment to Providence, and, I understand, is being held there for shipment on the first boat in the spring.\n\nThe original requisition did not call for any wiring, or other equipment. This is the first intimation I have had that wiring was required, or that the same had been already purchased by Indian Affairs.\n\nThe lighting plant, in so far as I know, has not been paid for yet, and cannot be paid for until it has actually been receipted for by the officials at Providence, but, as the Director's memorandum of the 15th instant indicates that the wire and other materials have already been received, there would seem to be no objection to authorizing this and paying for the same immediately.\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMarch 14, 1939.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of March 4 with the attached requisition from the Principal of the Providence Mission Residential School.\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Breynat is still abroad and may not return for several weeks. So I am forwarding a copy of your letter to Bishop Pallaize, his coadjutor, and submitting to him the fact that the money available for the Providence school although over $2,000.00, will nearly all be required for the installation of the electrical plant. On his visit to Providence, which is in the near future, he will talk the matter of this requisition list over with the Principal of the Providence Residential School.\n\nAs soon as I hear from him, I will write again.\n\nWith every kind wish,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.

No. 824 -- $2,094.00\n\nThe above amount was encumbered to cover the cost of the electric plant and batteries for the Providence Mission Indian residential school.\n\nThis equipment did not reach Waterways until after the last boat had left for the North in the late summer of 1938 and as a consequence it will not be possible to ship it from Waterways until some time in June, 1939.\n\nIt is evident, therefore, that the cost of this equipment will have to be paid from the appropriation for 1939-40 in which appropriation funds are provided for that purpose.\n\nIn view of the above it is considered that the amount of $2,094.00 should be released and again placed in Vote 77.\n\nDirector.\nTO SHOW IT MAY CONCERN\n\nThis is to certify that all material listed on attached invoices - Ott 5437-1 has been received completely and in good condition at the Indian Residential school of Fort Providence, N.W.T., on June 20, 1939.\n\nEDMONTON, Alta.

We are however disappointed in the electrical switchboard, as we cannot tell from the Ammeter the amount of load being delivered to the line. The Ammeter and Voltmeter being connected to charging current only.\n\nThe batteries are not of the Pilot Cell type, it being necessary to test with hydrometer to see condition of cells. While there is no mention of pilot cells in specification, it would have been much more convenient from a maintainee point of view to have had them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sig'd:) Sister Mack, Principal,\n\nPer: A.

Indian Residential school of Fort Providence, N.W.T. From the letter dated from Fort Providence on the 3rd instant, you will be undoubtedly pleased to know that at last this installation has been performed satisfactorily and that the plant is now working.\n\nAs we did not pay the Sunley Electric Co., it would be appreciated if you would kindly arrange to have check in payment of the submitted quotation mailed directly to the Sunley Electric Co., at 9307 - 112th Street, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nYou will notice also that no charge has been made for the expenses of the electricians' trip to Providence. This trip has been made by plane both ways from Edmonton, and we have to stand for the expenses connected with that return trip. May we expect that, out of the amounts appropriated for the three schools located in the Mackenzie Diocese which are totalling $4,000.00 for the current fiscal year, the sum of $100.00 be granted to us for part of the expenses re transportation of the electricians? You will probably recall that, according to my letters of last November 11th and 18th ultimo, the only voucher for repair or equipment for our schools, outside of the amount to be spent for Fort Providence, was for Aklavik and amounted to $1,024.00. The action of your Department authorizing the appropriations to be applied to either of the schools would be greatly appreciated, since all monies are handled through the R.C.

As you are aware the gyproc wool was purchased from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1940-41 and is now at Waterways awaiting the opening of navigation.\n\nThe Rev.

C. MISSIONS OF MACKENZIE,\nper\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar,\nR.C. Missions of Mackenzie,\n9918 - 110 St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nJune 10, 1941.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe thank you very much for the information contained in your letter of the 6th inst., advising us that it is not customary for the Department to supply farm machinery to Residential Schools and, therefore, that you cannot secure the threshing machine requested in our letter of October 31st, 1940 for the Fort Resolution Residential School.\n\nHowever, in the last paragraph of the above mentioned letter, you intimate that we should let you know what equipment or repairs are required for the additional funds available for the Fort Providence School. In this connection, we take pleasure in attaching hereto a quotation just received from the Bruce-Robinson Electric Ltd.\n\nOn reading the attached letter, you will see that we have asked for a refrigerating unit which would enable us to keep meat at the Fort Providence School during the spring and summer. After listening to various proposals, we found out that this refrigerating unit would fill our requirements for this place. It will be much less costly than an ordinary ice-house and we do not need more cubic feet to store the average quantity of meat that we need.\n\nUp to the present time we have not had any refrigerating system for the Fort Providence School and we feel that if the Department would have funds available for the purchase of this type of refrigerator, it will greatly assist us in having meat for the children of the school at any time of the year.\n\nWe feel confident that you will take our suggestion into consideration and, if so, we anticipate hearing favorably from you in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe R.

Without being requested to do so he obtained a quotation from Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd.

Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant regarding requisition forwarded from the Providence Mission Residential school. In this letter, you advise that in the appropriation for the fiscal year of 1942-1943 there is an amount of $1,200.00 for repairs, improvements and new equipment for that school and that of this amount $1,000 is especially marked for new laundry equipment.\n\nWe do not recall having asked the Department for new laundry equipment at Providence unless demand for it came directly from the School without our knowledge, therefore I think there is no objection on our part for the Department furnishing the School at Providence with the requisition mentioned in your letter.\n\nI am taking this opportunity to ask you to be kind enough to let me know what amount has been appropriated during the current fiscal year for repairs, improvements and new equipment at the other Indian Residential Schools located in the Mackenzie Diocese, viz., Fort Chipewyan (Holy Angels), Fort Resolution and Aklavik. Some time ago, Archbishop Breynat had intimated to me that if the Department would have no serious objection to it he would not ask anything this year for Providence and Resolution but that he would submit to the Department a list of what he would require for Fort Chipewyan and Aklavik.\n\nHowever, since the requisition forwarded from the Fort Providence School does not amount to a great sum, we would advise you to have it filled and shipped to that place. If so, kindly have it shipped directly to Fort Providence, c/o NORTHERN TRANSPORTATION COMPANY, Waterways.\n\nIt would be very much appreciated if you could let me know as soon as possible whether the Department is ready to appropriate the funds voted for each School in favour of the two schools at Fort Chipewyan and Aklavik, as mentioned above. Without specifying more fully, we may inform you at the present time that these funds would serve for purchasing an electric power plant for Fort Chipewyan and repairs for the roof at Aklavik.\n\nWith thanks and best regards, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRef.: Your File 139-3-5.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI am directed by Archbishop Breynat to answer your letter of the 17 ultimo which was in reference to a letter written to him on June 2 by Honourable Mr. Crerar, Minister of Mines and Resources.\n\nIn his letter of May 24 to Honourable Mr. Crerar, Archbishop Breynat was referring to your letter addressed to the writer under the date of April 28 in reply to mine of April 25 sent to you. Pursuant to our previous correspondence, His Excellency was asking the Honourable Minister to have funds allotted for repairs and equipment at the four schools located within the MacKenzie Diocese especially earmarked for the two schools at Fort Chipewyan (Holy Angels) and Akleivik; and in my letter of April 25 referred above I was informing you that this would be for the purpose of purchasing an electric power plant for the new school being actually rebuilt at Fort Chipewyan also for repairs urgently needed for the roof at the Akleivik school.\n\nIn your letter of the 17 ultimo you are asking the Archbishop to forward you at the earliest possible date detailed information regarding the materials that he may require, as all purchases have to be made through your Purchasing Branch. In this view, I am directed by Archbishop Breynat to inform you that the necessity in which we have found ourselves to secure the materials without fail coupled with the absolute need of having them delivered on time to their ultimate destination during the summer season had given us no other option than to purchase these materials ourselves instead of complying with the usual practice to have same purchases made through your Purchasing Branch.\n\nYou will indeed recall that on April 28 you were not in a position yet to give us definite information regarding total amount that may be available this year for each school and it would have been too late to wait for your letter of June 17 before placing these orders. Naturally, in ordinary times there would have been no difficulty in securing necessary materials, but anyone who has to make purchases this year is aware of new and more drastic regulations being constantly enforced day by day regarding purchases in hardware, electrical supplies and lumber. Being confronted by such a dilemma, Archbishop Breynat decided that he could not take the risk of being unable to secure the materials which he would have, in normal times, purchased through your Purchasing Branch and he feels certain that, in all fairness, you will understand these circumstances.\n\n.............. 2/\nConsequently we have ordered the necessary materials for repairing the roof at Aklavik also equipment for the electric power plant at Fort Chipewyan. Both these orders have already shipped by the suppliers and delivered to their respective ultimate destination and we have in hand invoices of May 21 for Fort Chipewyan also of June 9 and 17 for Aklavik covering these orders.\n\nOrder for the electric power plant at Fort Chipewyan amounts to TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS AND EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS ($2,658.88), while order for Aklavik amounts to SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY EIGHT DOLLARS AND EIGHTY EIGHT CENTS ($678.88), total for both places being TWENTY SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS AND SEVENTY SIX CENTS ($2,744.76). We wish to mention that, up to the present time, none of these amounts has been paid by us and that above amounts represent price of the materials FOB Waterways. Order for Chipewyan has been given to the Bruce-Robinson Electric Co., Ltd., of Edmonton, while order for Aklavik has been given to the McInnes Products Corporation Ltd., of Waterways and to the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Ltd., of Edmonton, for the lumber and hardware respectively. We submit the above total of $2,744.76 to the Department for his favourable consideration.\n\nCould you let us know whether you would like to have five copies of each invoice corresponding to the various amounts listed above certified by us and forwarded to you or if we should act in some other manner that you may prefer. As soon as your reply will have been received, we shall be pleased to comply with your wishes.\n\nWith thanks for all past favors, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE R.C. EPISCOPAL CORPORATION OF MACKENZIE\n\nPer:\n\nFather J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBurser.\n\nP.S. Kindly address your reply to FORT CHIPEWAN, Alberta, where the writer will be stationed for a few more weeks before returning to our Edmonton Office.\n\nJ.S.\nOttawa,\nJuly 28, 1942.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Father Serrurot:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to purchases made in connection with the Aklavik R.C. and the Holy Angels Residential Schools. I regret very much that Department regulations were not followed, as the procedure that you have adopted always means a great deal of extra work for this Branch, due to the fact that we have to give very explicit reasons why the purchasing regulations were not followed.\n\nPlease forward the accounts and I will submit them to the Purchasing Branch with a recommendation that purchase orders be issued. I would like to have these accounts reach this office before August 10.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar,\nR.C. Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie,\nFort Chipewyan, Alta.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. C.W. Jackson\n\nMr. Hoey has forwarded for our attention, without written comment, the three attached files, with invoices and correspondence in connection with the placing by the R.C. Church authorities of three orders for equipment and supplies for two church-owned Indian Residential Schools at a total cost of $2,744.56, f.o.b., Waterways, Alta.\n\nFort Chipewyan (Holy Angels):\n\nFrom Bruce Robinson Electric Ltd. $2,065.88\n\nAklavik:\n\nFrom J.M. Ashdown Hardware Co. Ltd. $354.88\nFrom Holmes Products Corporation Ltd. $324.06\n\nTotal...........$2,744.56\n\nThe following is a summary of information gleaned from these files:\n\n(a) Letter June 2nd, 1942, signed by Mr. Crerar, authorizing transfer of funds provided for four church-owned northern Indian Residential Schools to be used exclusively for repairs to the Fort Chipewyan and Aklavik Schools.\n\n(b) June 17th, 1942, letter from Mr. Hoey to Bishop Breynat requesting bill of material so that orders could be placed through the Purchasing Division.\n\n(c) June 20, 1942, letter from Father Serrurier to Mr. Hoey advising that orders for the required material had already been placed by the R.C. church authorities with their reason for so doing.\n\n(d) July 26, 1942, letter from Mr. Hoey to Father Serrurier requesting invoices and expressing regret that Departmental purchasing regulations were not followed.\nMy comment is as follows:\n\n(1) The unit prices charged by J.H. Ashdown Hardware Co., Edmonton, for the roofing material, and by McInnes Products Corporation, Waterways, Alberta, for dimension lumber are fair and reasonable. This material was for use in repairing the Klavik school.\n\n(2) The chief item of expenditure for the Holy Angels School at Fort Chipewyan was an electric lighting plant consisting of a Lister Diesel engine, generator, steel base, switch board, etc., at $1,452.00. The balance $613.89 was spent in electric fixtures and supplies for wiring. The money was voted for necessary repair work, but was spent on new equipment of non-essential classification.\n\n(3) No convincing reasons are given for placing the orders contrary to Mr. Hoey's instructions, and without reference to this office.\n\nIn view of the above, will you please advise if you wish us to arrange for payment of the accounts in question.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nWill you please note the attached memorandum I have received from the Purchasing Agent in reference to the purchase of certain electric lighting equipment for the Holy Angels School at Fort Chipewyan at a cost of $2,065.68. I have had an opportunity of going over your file and it would seem quite clear that the Church authorities proceeded to purchase this equipment without receiving any authority from your Branch to do so. It is noted in Father Serrurot's letter of the 20th July that the purchase was made at least prior to May 21st for he stated in this letter that he had invoices of this date in his possession. While it is true that Father Serrurot advised you in his letter of the 25th April that some of these funds would serve for purchasing an electric power plant for Fort Chipewyan, he was never advised that the Department would approve of the purchase being made. If the requisition had been forwarded to this office as is the usual procedure, I am sure the Minister would not have approved of it without first ascertaining the reason why this substantial purchase was being made in war-time. There is no information on file to show why the existing equipment could not have been repaired and used until the war was over.\n\nUnder the circumstances, therefore, in view of the fact that no authority was given to the Church to make the purchase, the Minister suggests they should be advised that they will have to look after the account themselves.\n\nIt is to be regretted that in answering Father Serrurot's letter of the 25th April, you did not advise him that you would not approve of any of the money being spent in the purchase of electric lighting equipment until you were furnished with the reasons why it was needed at this time.\n\nover ......\nThe Minister approves of the expenditures that are made for the School at Aklavik amounting to $678.88.\n\nYour file and other papers are returned herewith.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nChief Executive Assistant.\nOttawa, September 21, 1945.\n\nRe: Purchase of Supplies and Equipment,\nFort Chipewyan and Aklavit Residential Schools\n\nDear Father Serrurrot:\n\nInvoices and vouchers amounting to a total of $6,744.56, sent forward by you and representing supplies and equipment purchased for the above-noted schools, were submitted by this Branch to the Purchasing Division for the issuance of the usual purchase order. It is unnecessary to add that before these invoices can be accepted for payment by the Treasury they must be accompanied by the purchase order.\n\nThe Director is in receipt of a memorandum from Mr. C. T. Jackson, Chief Executive Assistant, dated September 18, 1945, in which Mr. Jackson states:\n\nWill you please note the attached memorandum I have received from the Purchasing Agent, in reference to the purchase of certain electric lighting equipment for the Holy Angels School at Fort Chipewyan at a cost of $6,685.68. I have had an opportunity of going over your file and it would seem quite clear that the church authorities proceeded to purchase this equipment without receiving any authority from your branch to do so.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn August 5th last, we forwarded you at your request accounts for the Indian Residential Schools at Fort Chipewyan and Aklavik amounting respectively to $2,065.68 and to $678.88.\n\nLately we had a call from the Bruce-Robinson Electric Co. of Edmonton in connection with the account mentioned above for the Fort Chipewyan (Holy Angels') School. This firm wanted to inquire from us whether we had been informed by the Department of the approximate date on which payment could be expected. We stated that we had not heard anything since accounts had been forwarded to the Department but that we would send a note to you regarding this matter.\n\nWe would therefore greatly appreciate your kindness in giving us the information desired.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFor the R.C.

In this connection I would refer you to my letter of the 21st ultimo, which has no doubt reached you by this time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.

The order had been placed with the Ashdown Hardware Company, Edmonton, who had been instructed to forward the account to you. As yet we have not received the account. I should, therefore, appreciate your advising if the paint has reached the school and, if so, you should certify the account and forward it immediately for payment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt., Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nUpon checking our records lately we noticed that no grant had been received for the June 1942 quarter at the Fort Providence Indian Residential School. While it may be that our records are not correct or that our Bank has failed to notify us of this payment, we would however appreciate your kindness in advising us regarding this matter and naturally would gladly receive this grant if you find out that it has not been paid yet.\n\nWe also noticed that allowance for the night watchman at the Fort Providence Indian Residential School for the 1942 February month has not been received yet. If so, may we expect this payment at an early date?\n\nThanking you for all past favors, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE R.C. EPISCOPAL CORPORATION OF MACKENZIE\n\nPer: [Signature]\nFather J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar.\nOttawa,\nOctober 26, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, the June quarter return of the Providence Mission Residential School, also the September quarter return, have not yet reached this office. This accounts for the delay in paying the grant. However, I am arranging to have an amount of $1500.00, as part payment of the June quarter grant, sent to your bank. The balance due for that quarter, also the grant for September, will be paid when the June and September returns reach us.\n\nOn reviewing our files I do not find that any voucher was forwarded to us for the services of the night watchman for the month of February, 1942. If you forward a voucher payment will be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. Serrurot, O.M.I.,\nBursar,\nR.C.

The order was placed on May 1 last with the Ashdown Hardware Company Limited and a copy of the purchase order was sent to the Principal on May 5. The Company was directed to forward the account to the Superior, but apparently they have not done so previously, as we have not received the account from her. I, therefore, enclose two copies of the account and, if the goods have been received, it would be appreciated if you would certify the accounts and return them immediately in order that payment can be made out of the current year's appropriation.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Missions of Mackenzie,\n9916 - 110 St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1942.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI am in receipt of your invoice No. 15424, our file No. 12507, covering the cost of supplies forwarded to the Providence Mission Residential School. As directed on the purchase order, the account should have been forwarded to the Principal of the school in order that she could certify the account. However, I am sending the account to the Principal and as soon as it is returned payment will be made. On our purchase order we requested that you prepay freight charges to Waterways and attach prepaid shipping invoice to regular invoice. No receipt from the railway company has been forwarded by you and consequently it will not be possible to pay this charge until such receipt is received.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The order was placed with Stanley Brock, Limited, Winnipeg, Man., on July 8, 1944, and they were requested to make certain that this washer would reach Waterways before the close of navigation. They were also instructed to forward their account to you, so that you could certify it and return for payment as soon as the washer arrived.\n\nAs yet we have not received the account, and as the end of the fiscal year is approaching we are extremely anxious to have the account immediately, if the washer has been delivered, in order that payment may be made from this year's appropriation.\n\nIf you have received the washer but have not received the account, you should advise me at once to that effect, and we can then adjust the matter with the Stanley Brock Company, as it may take too long to write the firm and have them send the account to you and have it returned before the end of March.\n\nOn the other hand, if you have not received the washer, you should immediately advise this office, as in that case, too, we will have to take up the matter with the company. Your immediate reply is requested.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

As we had not received the account, we wrote to Stanley Brock, Limited, Winnipeg, to ascertain if the washer had been shipped. Their reply states that the washer was shipped on October 31, and as the instructions were that it should be shipped in care of the Northern Transportation Company, Waterways, Alberta, I presume this washer is at Waterways, in charge of the Company mentioned. I enclose a copy of the account, and it would be appreciated if you would ascertain if the washer is at Waterways. If so, you should certify the account and return it, at the earliest possible date, as we wish to pay for it from the current year's appropriation, and the present fiscal year ends on March 31.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nEncl.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

It is possible that you have done so, and forwarded the accounts to Bishop Trocellier.\n\nThe Bishop is in the East at present, and we have not yet received the accounts. If you have shipped any or all of the items ordered on the above two purchase orders, it would be appreciated if you would issue other accounts, in duplicate, for the items that you have supplied and forward same by Air Mail to this office, we would like to have these accounts by April 24.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Hayward Lumber Company,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n**DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES**\n\n**INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH**\n\nPay to the Indian Residential School\n\nAddress of Fort Providence\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| March 1st | For night watchmen's service during February 1946 | $40.00 |\n| March 1st | For night watchmen's service during March 1946 | $40.00 |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 506\n\nAgent\n\nVoucher No.\n\nDATE\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6475, file 918-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nApril 21, 1945.\n\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAttention Mr. Philip Phelan\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nWe have your favor of the 19th inst., with regard to Purchase Orders No. 1570 and No. 1572. At this point we would like to mention that Orders No. 1571 and No. 1970 were also received from the Department of Mines and Resources for shipment to the Bishop.\n\nWe are sorry to advise that none of these goods have been shipped as yet. We do not think it advisable to make part shipments, as it involves extra bookwork on your part as well as our own, and if we make all one shipment it would be much better all the way around.\n\nAs we have not yet received our car of Donnacoma wallboard, we were unable to make shipment at the end of March. However, you may rest assured that this material will go down the River on the first boat, and as the goods are only going to Providence and Resolution, there will not be any tie-up on delivery. We do not expect our car of Donnacoma until the end of April, but the first boats will not run until at least May 10th. There would be really no necessity of getting this material down to Waterways in March, as there is the danger of flood conditions, which would definitely spoil the material. We have been shipping material to the North for a great number of years, and we have always had to watch this point.\n\nWe hope we have not put you to any great inconvenience, and you may rest assured that just as soon as shipment has been made, we will get the invoice in to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHAYWARD LUMBER CO.

We might say that it will no longer be necessary to consider the purchase of the 50 pieces of lumber. In this case, might we add to the list the 2 tents, 2 camp stoves and 2 clocks, which were included in our original letter of June 25th, 1946, but which were not included in the list contained in your letter of October 17th?\n\nWe shall be pleased to hear from you in due course, so that we may be able to forward any accounts in this connection before March 31st.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\nCharles Gilbee Oriel\nBursar,\nR.C. Missions of Mackenzie.\nMarch 1, 1947.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYour letter of February 25th has been received, and we thank you for the permission accorded us to purchase in Edmonton the articles listed in your letter of October 17, 1946. The order will go forward today, to our suppliers, Marshall Wells and Company, Ltd., with the request that the account be made out at once, so that we may forward it to you well before the end of the present month.\n\nWe appreciate also the exception you have made in our favor regarding the two tents, two stoves and two clocks. Personally we believe the two clocks are not absolutely required, and the two tents (size 14 x 18 was requested) are practically out of the question at the present time, considering the difficulty of procuring good tents of any kind at reasonable prices. Therefore, we will leave out the tents and the clocks.\n\nA few days ago, we learned that it will be possible to purchase two good portable camp stoves right here in Fort Smith, for a total of $37.50, which included the necessary stove pipes. Since your permission has been granted for this purchase - in Edmonton - we are having these two stoves and pipes held over for us, until we hear that we may purchase them here in Fort Smith. The two stoves are perfectly new, and we consider the price reasonable.\n\nAs for the goods being ordered from Marshall Wells, these will be kept in their warehouse until navigation opens in May.\n\nThanking you for your kind consideration of these requisitions, we remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\nR.C. Missions of Mackenzie,\nper Charles Miller, Bursar.\nOttawa, March 5th, 1947.\n\nDear Father Gilles:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant and have carefully noted its contents.\n\nApproval is granted for the purchase of the two camp stoves which you can obtain in Fort Smith.\n\nI intended my previous letter to read that any articles authorized could be purchased either in Fort Smith or in Edmonton or wherever you can secure them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend Charles Gilles,\nR.C. Missions of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nMarch 17, 1947.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWe have at length secured the articles you permitted us to purchase for Sacred Heart School, Fort Providence, and we are immediately returning the accounts covering cost of same.\n\nAt Marshall-Wells Ltd., in Edmonton, we were able to get the various articles originally requested, and approved by Mr. Neary in his letter to Father Mansoz, Fort Smith, Oct. 17, 1946.\n\nAt the local Hudson's Bay Company post we procured the two camp stoves along with 5 lengths of pipe for each stove, so that both would be ready for installation upon delivery. We should explain the date on the H.B.C. account. Actually the purchase was made on March 1, the clerk explaining that March 1, which was a Saturday, was included in the last week of February, as far as their books were concerned. Almost immediately after we had written you on March 1, we learned that someone in the Fort was looking for camp stoves in view of the spring hunt, and to offset the possibility that another clerk might sell the two stoves being held for us, we thought best to make the purchase at once. It was perhaps best that we did, as we found, upon returning, that these two stoves were the only ones left.\n\nThanking you again for your consideration in assisting us to obtain these items during the fiscal year about to close, we remain,\n\nvery truly yours,\n\nR.C.

I am returning this account herewith as it is possible that it has been passed for payment by the Superintendent of the Fort Simpson Agency by this time and if passed by this office would possibly cause duplication. The original copies of the invoices covering the extinguishers for the Providence School were not received at this office.\"\n| DATE   | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 21 Jan | To freight on fire extinguishers sent to the Providence Mission Residential School and ordered on P.O. 31030.

Please let me know why it was necessary to send these children by aeroplane. Could not arrangements have been made to keep them at their home until some cheaper method of transportation was available? Due to a reduction in our appropriation the Department cannot consider payment of aeroplane transportation for Indian children unless there are some extremely exceptional circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., June 1, 1940.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 30, file 139-3-10, I beg to say that the three children mentioned as having been transported to Fort Providence by aeroplane were the children of Mrs. George Wrigley, who was frozen to death during the month of December, and they had no living relative able to support them in Fort Simpson.

I learned this during my short trip to Fort Providence in the winter to see patients at the school and in the village, and, of course, it was too late then to insist that they return to school. I have been opposed to children being allowed to go home from the school any considerable distance for the summertime as we always have the same trouble in getting them back to school in the fall.

Sept.28.1942.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing with this letter Applications for admission to the Providence Mission Residential School of eight children examined by me on my recent visit to the school and hope that you will approve of these.\n\nThere were many Indians absent from the settlement when I arrived in Providence and I had thus not much of an opportunity to secure more children for the school, and they are below their quota at present. I took the matter up with the Chief and two of the Head Men and they promised to urge others to have their children admitted to the school. I hope we will soon have the number up to the requisite quota.\n\nAlso while in Providence I took the matter of the over-age girl, Elizabeth Sabourin, No. 0165, up with the school principal, Sister Mary Mack, and she stated she would write you immediately, and I trust has done so ere now.\n\nYours very truly\n\nW.A.M.

Truesdell,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\nDear Sister:\n\nI understand from Indian Agent Truesdell that he has already spoken to you regarding Elizabeth Sabourin, No. 0165. This girl has been shown on the quarterly return as 16 years of age for the past five quarters. It would, therefore, appear that she is now between 16 and 17 years of age. As you are aware, the age for discharge is 16, unless there are some very strong reasons to the contrary. When it is desired to keep children over the age of 16 an application should be forwarded to the Department, through the local Indian Agent, giving the reasons for desiring her to remain. I should appreciate hearing from you regarding this girl immediately.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nThe Principal,\nProvidence Mission Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\nProvidence Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.,\nNovember 29th, 1942.\n\nMr. Philip Beland,\nChief Training Officer.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter regarding the discharge of Elizabeth Sabourin No. 2165.\n\nThe pupil was 14 years of age in June, born in the year 1926.

She lives off the nation given by the government and through the kindness of her neighbours.\n\nSo, for these reasons we ask to the Department the permission to keep them longer.\n\nThanking you, we remain,\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nSister St. Adjutor.\n\nThe Principal being absent temporarily.\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Discharge | PERIODS IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in It | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n|     |               |                   | Years Months Days     | On Admission       | On Discharge                                  |                                        |\n| 117 | Willie Jake   | June 3rd 14       | 8 3                  | Nil                | Grade VI                                      | Attained age limit                     |\n| 212 | Willie Nodde  |                   | 6 10                 |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 225 | Pierre Petseye|                   | 3 6                  |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 0198| Adeline Tomes |                   | 11 1                 |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 0200| Sarah & twins |                   | 16 10 11             |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 0225| Madeleine Josee|                  | 7 10                 |                    |                                               |                                        |\n| 0229| Celine Josee  |                   | 7 10                 |                    |                                               |                                        |\n\n**NOTE**\u2014One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nFORM 33\nOttawa,\nAugust 4, 1943.\n\nDear Sister:\n\nWith reference to the June quarter return of the Providence Mission Residential School, the Department approves the discharge of the pupils numbered as follows:\n\nNO.   199\n\"     212\n\"     235\n\"     0198\n\"     0205\n\"     0228\n\"     0229\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter of June 26, we approve pupils numbered 0198, 0228 and 0229 remaining in the school for another year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nSister St. Adjutor,\nProvidence Mission Indian Residential School,\nFort Providence, N.W.T.\n| No. | Name          | Year | Grade | Vocational Work |\n|-----|---------------|------|-------|-----------------|\n| 0208| Sarah Padda   | 1952 | 5th   | All vocational work |\n| 17  | Willie Padda  | 1936 | 5th   | \"                |\n| 212 | Willie Padda  | 1936 | 3rd   | \"                |\n| 235 | Pierre Metcalf| 1940 | 3rd   | \"                |\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6476, file 918-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nProvidence Residential School\nSept 19th 1943\n\nTo Mr Philip Phelan\nChief, Training Division\n\nKind Sir,\n\nYou have been notified that Sr Mack left Providence in May to visit her family.
