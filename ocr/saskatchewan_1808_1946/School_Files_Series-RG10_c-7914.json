Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nRe-Eldridge McNahey,\n\nEldridge McNahey was returned to his home from the Shingwauk home, owing to a bad habit which he practiced on himself as well as other boys.\n\nSince his return home he has been attending No. 2 school. The teacher Mrs. Athel George would say that this boy did not come to school. Eldridge is now 15 years old, Eldridge in the fourth form. Mrs. George had thought that if he done well she might have his entrance June next. He does not seem to be trying very hard, Mrs. George feel that the school would be better without his attendance.\n\nWould the department think it advisable to compel his attendance at school, or allow him to discontinue?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. John's Rectory\nWALPOLE ISLAND\n\nR.R. 3, Wallaceburg, Ont., Nov. 2, 193\u2014\n\nMr. Highfield,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island.\n\nDear Mr. Highfield:\n\nIn calling at the schools on the Island I find the number of children attending school is very small. Sunday School attendance is also very low at the United Church.\n\nI was wondering if I could get permission to hold a Sunday School class at the school from 3:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon on Sundays. The children would be able to attend the school classes after 4:00.\n\nIt seems to me to be a pity that these children should be neglected & I am willing to give instruction in Bible classes.\nOttawa, November 27, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing letter received from Rev. Mr. Hall requesting permission to give instruction on biblical lines at the Walpole Island No. 2 School.\n\nAt the present time the Department is not prepared to approve religious teaching at this school before the regular closing hour. It is noted from your letter that approximately 75% of the parents of the children attending this school are members of the United Church, and it is just possible that the United Church missionary might object to Mr. Hall conducting religious services on the Reserve.\n\nI believe that the best course to take would be for you to arrange to have Rev. Mr. Hall and the United Church missionary meet and discuss the situation, and allow them to decide whatever action will be mutually satisfactory. In the event of it being decided to give certain religious instructions at the Walpole Island No. 2 School, it should be understood that this will only be given after the regular hour of closing, viz., 4 P.M.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose letter from Rev. Wm. Hall Rector of the Anglican Church of Walpole Island.\n\nThis letter is self-explanatory.\n\nFor your information I might say that I estimate that 75 per cent of the people in the No. 2 school section are United Church adherents. There is no resident minister of the United Church living on the reserve just now. The minister from the Sarnia Reserve preaches here once each Sunday. It appears that they do not have any Sunday school just now. In the past they did have.\n\nI suggested this to Rev. Hall that he try and have his Sunday school Sunday afternoon and not interfere with the day school. But he was afraid that the United Church people might feel that he was trying to interfere with their work. It is Mr. Hall's intention to have these lessons in the school room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSt. John's Rectory\n\nR.R. 3, Wallaceburg, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten text not legible]\nOttawa, March 4, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, informing the Department that, owing to the death of her father, Mrs. George closed the No. 2 School, Walpole Island, for a period of four days; also that Mrs. James Daley, teacher of the junior room at the No. 1 School, would not be able to teach for a period of over a week owing to illness.\n\nWhen it is necessary for a teacher to be absent for a few days on account of illness or for family reasons, school will have to remain closed. Should it be necessary for a teacher to be absent for any lengthy period, the matter should immediately be reported to the Department, stating the probable length of such absence. When, if considered necessary, authority will be given to obtaining the services of a substitute. When a teacher is absent for a period of over five days on account of illness, a doctor's certificate should be forwarded, in order that salary can be paid.\n\nAs Mrs. Daley will, no doubt, be able to resume duties at an early date, it will not be necessary to obtain a substitute. If Mr. Daley cannot arrange to take a number of the junior pupils into his room, the junior room will have to remain closed until Mrs. Daley is able to resume duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nRe-Schools.\n\nFor your information I would beg to say that owing to the death of Mrs. Ethel George father there was no school at No.2 school from Tuesday Feb.24 to Monday Feb.27 being closed 4 days the 21,22,23,24.\n\nMrs. James only teacher in the junior room at No.2 school, owing to illness was not able to teach Thursday or Friday the 23 and 24. This morning Dr. Rowland said it would be necessary for Mrs. Daley to remain in bed another two day and that she should not teach again this week. What are the regulations on the reserves in respect to day allowed teacher under pay for time lost for illness. There are qualified teacher available here but I understand that he has been unable of these teacher to take charge of Mrs. Daley room for a week. Mrs. Daley did not care to do so and become responsible for there pay, and I felt that the Department would not care to pay two teacher for the same room.\n\nWhat would be the Department wish if Mrs. Daley sickness should be extended for a longer time or in the future if a similar case should arise.\n\nSection 165 sub-section(4) of the provincial school act said in part:- Every teacher shall be entitled to his salary notwithstanding his absence from duty on account of sickness for a period not exceeding four weeks in any one year of his employment if the sickness is certified to by a Physician.\n\nThe Secretary,\nYour obedient servant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, February 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Mrs. George, teacher in the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School, regarding a pupil, George Isaac, son of Mr. and Mrs. Allan Isaac. The Department has noted the trouble this boy has occasioned and the difficulty the teacher has had with him and his father.\n\nIt is considered that action should be taken to prevent Allan Isaac interfering with the classroom work and discipline of the school. You may, therefore, in conjunction with the R.C.W.P., lay a charge against Allan Isaac, provided that, after due warning, he does not cease his interference with the work of the school and annoying the teacher. He should be made to understand that his son is to be amenable to the discipline of the school and is to conduct himself properly in the classroom. It is necessary that Mrs. George be protected in her duties as teacher and that all pupils comply with the discipline of the classroom.\n\nThe Department does not consider it advisable to have the boy placed in a reform school. We regret that at the present time there is no vacancy in any of our residential schools in which he could be placed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nOttawa, December 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a further communication from Allan Isaac, relative to the complaints made by him regarding the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School. He states that she continues to show discrimination against his children, and that she has reported them as being absent from school when they were in attendance. He also states that the teacher sends his children home at three o'clock, while she keeps the other children in school until the regular closing period.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange at your earliest convenience to interview both Allan Isaac and the teacher with a view to straightening out any difficulty there may be between them. This man should understand that it is expected that children will attend school regularly and comply in all respects with the regular discipline. You should also inform the teacher that it is expected she will see that no discrimination is exercised by her against any of the pupils who attend. The Department desires that the frequent complaints of Allan Isaac will cease, and you should use every endeavour to smooth out any difficulties there may be between the teacher and himself.\n\nPlease inform the Department of the result of any action taken by you in the matter; also inform Allan Isaac that his communication has been received by the Department and that you have been instructed to deal with the matter of the complaints made by him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\n40\u00b0 Wapole Island\nDec. 14th 1930\n\nTo A.J. McKenzie Esq.,\nRec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter Oct. 20th No. 40-2-1 I beg to say that the Indian Agent did not inquire into all complaints as I asked some of the Complainants who informed me that he has not inquired of them.\n\nHe told the teacher of the Complaints and while she tried to make improvements still showed discrimination against my children and is still doing so.\n\nShe also thinks some nasty remarks about us before the children, who invariably tell us about said remarks.\n\nWalter Wright showed me a report of the attendance of the children showing that my boy R. George Isaac attended only 5 days during the month of November and thirty only in December. Now as we live 10 miles from the road (about one hundred steps) I am all that is going on, and also I have sent his children to school every day, so this is some mistake or misunderstanding, showing my children do not attend school.\nShe does send my children home at 3 o'clock every day while she keeps the other children till 4 o'clock.\n\nIf there is no improvement in the treatment of my children I am inclined to keep them at home till there is a change & teacher.\n\nAnd I am not the only parent who's children are discriminated against and they have to attend this school, so we as parents of the said children feel it a necessity of a change of teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAllan Isaac\nLaura Isaac.\nshipman (whom I consider quite a reliable Indian) at that when Mr. Sampson first began spending evenings at the school and at various times since, he has been very kind to pay particular attention owing to various matters that would persist in coming up, that he has never appeared to be in any way interested in the welfare of the pupils.\n\nI have always found Mr. Sampson living around the school grounds and attending to his own business. He has never been seen doing anything that might be considered suspicious or dangerous.\n\nOn the contrary, Mr. Sampson has always been very attentive to the needs of the pupils and has always been willing to assist them in any way possible.\n\nI am quite provoked at the thought of Mr. Sampson being involved in any such matter. It is not likely that he would be able to do anything to help the pupils. No action was taken against Mr. Sampson because there was no evidence of ill will.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nHyman Smith - one boy\nSolomon Sword - one boy\nPeyton Vincatary - one girl\nJames Williams - two boys and one girl\n\nJesse Shipman - two boys\nJune Shipman - two boys\nLucian - three one girl\n\nEd Robertson\n\nSam Johnson - three girls\nE.

Agency.\n\nNo. 8 school is in charge of Mrs. Edith E. George who has only a commercial certificate but has twenty-five years' teaching experience. There are thirty-eight pupils on the roll. Attendance is reported as very good and progress fair. Besides the regular curriculum the pupils are taught knitting, sewing, mending, dressmaking and manual training. The classroom was clean and well ventilated. The teacher's residence attached was very tidy and well kept and reflects great credit upon Mrs. George.\n\nThos. McCookin.\nInspector.\nE.

Bishop of Huron, Bishop's, London, Ont., to read for the church while teaching.\n\nAm employed as book keeper accountant, but owing to the fact that my little boy has been injured in an automobile accident and must have perfect quietness I am anxious of securing a position in an Indian day school.\nMy wife, who is a professional artist, would be willing to take charge of the musical education in the school.\n\nShould my application be accepted, I shall do all in my power to make a success of the work.\n\nSincerely,\n\nW. Fraser MacDougall.\nOttawa, June 12th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nIn further reference to the complaint which was made by yourself and Andrew Isaac regarding the conduct of Mrs. Ethel George, teacher of the No. 2 School on Walpole Island Reserve, I have now to inform you that, after enquiry, it was found that there is no foundation for the complaint made by you and Andrew Isaac. The parties whom you report as visiting the teacher at night are her relatives. The neighbors who have been interviewed in the matter state that there is nothing wrong in these visits.\n\nI need not point out to you the seriousness of making unfounded reports, or the situation in which you place yourselves if action were to be taken by the teacher or others in having you prove the charges. The Department does not desire to have any further unfounded charges, and is taking no action to have a change made in the teacher at this school for the next school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The following is an extract from the letter received:\n\n\"Teacher has had men often playing cards late in the night at her apartments in the school building. Men have been seen to go see her in the school occasionally. Teacher keeping some of her relatives or men folks till 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning is certainly showing a bad example.

She is willing to take either room in No. 1 School or the No. 2 School.

If Mrs. Savage wishes to transfer to the junior room at Walpole Island No. 1 at the same salary she is now receiving, this action can be taken. If Mrs. Savage wishes to transfer to the No. 2 School because of the better residence facilities, such action would be approved.\n\nPlease give this question your careful and earliest consideration and discuss the matter with Mr. Indian Agent and as well as with both Mrs. Savage and Mrs. George.

In view of your years of experience, however, we are favourably disposed to continue your services at the Walpole Island No. 8 School. You must bend every energy towards securing a good attendance, the interest of the pupils and a satisfactory progress.\n\nIt has been brought to the Department's attention that considerable time of the school day is devoted to Art.

Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Abraham, while in the Department last week, recommended that the salary of Harold D. Watts, teacher of the No. 2 School, Walpole Island Reserve, be increased by $50.00, which would give him the same rate of salary as is paid the teacher of the No. 1 School. He is at present receiving a salary of $600.00 and the bonus, while the teacher of the No. 1 School receives $650.00 salary and bonus. There is an enrolment of 49 pupils at the No. 2 School and 53 at the No. 1 School.\n\nMr. Watts was trained in England and had thirteen years teaching experience there, and has had five years experience in Canada. The Public School Inspector states that \"the success he met with is reasonably good. The pupils can all speak English. They are making fairly good progress. I believe the work that is being done in agriculture has considerable value. Hygiene and physical culture are receiving proper attention.\"\n\nMrs. McDonald, teacher of the No. 1 School, has only a Third Class certificate but has had twenty-one years experience.\n\nI would recommend that Mr. Watts' salary be increased by $50.00, which would allow him the same salary as is paid Mrs. McDonald and would place them on an equal footing for the same amount of work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgree with,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 24, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Gom, in a report to the Department on his recent inspection of the No. 2 School on the Walpole Island Reserve, states that there are two defects in the management of the school, namely: a failure to teach methods and a certain laxness in discipline. He states that the conduct of the pupils both in school and out of school led him to believe that they were getting out of control.\n\nYou will be good enough to draw this matter to the attention of the teacher and inform him with regard to the conduct of the pupils, that it is expected that he will exercise proper discipline over them, and that his methods of teaching should be improved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't, Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR GOWE ON WALPOLE ISLAND NO.2 SCHOOL.\n\nThere are two defects in the management of the school, antiquated teaching methods and a certain laxness in discipline.

Cork, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 2 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nYour letter of Jan 23rd, no. 152943-1 received. I could not reply sooner as I wished to see the agent Mr. McMillan before I wrote. I went down to see him last Sunday but he was not at home; then followed a big thaw and the roads were a mass of slush and mud. The round trip from the school house to the agent's residence at the front and back to my place is nearly six miles so could not go down till last evening.\n\nNow I wish to say here that if my remarks are a little vigorous it is without prejudice toward the Indian Department as I appreciate the courteous consideration you have given me during the past seven years.\n\nMore respectfully, but emphatically, I say to say that any report you may have that states that my health is not of the best is an absolute falsehood. My age I can't deny and don't\nI have never had better health in my life than I have at present and I have always had good health. I could show you the amount of work I have done during the past autumn in gathering a small load in the woods and carrying it in bundles about a quarter of a mile to my house for my winter's supply of fuel.\n\nIn regard to school work I have received compliments indirectly from those most interested, on my efforts to teach the children the English language which has not been done by previous teachers, at least not for a few years past. I don't know how many are in the plot against me but I do know the instigator of the whole thing, \"and thereby hangs a tale.\" I am the victim of a vile plot. I could tell the whole story but I am not\npleading to stay here only as I shall state shortly on. I don't mind the dismissal so much as I do the manner in which it has been brought about by an \"enemy in the camp.\"\n\nNow I would respectfully ask for one last favor from the Department: I live alone in a rented log house about 15 miles from the schoolhouse. It is difficult to get supplies as it is about seven (or six) miles to Wallaceburg and I have to drive a rig when I go there. It is difficult to get a conveyance and when one does so the Indians consider a white man as their lawful prey so far as money is concerned. Because of these difficulties I have laid in my winter's stock of eatables such as potatoes, bacon, apples (that grow on the place), sugar, tea, coffee, flour, etc. I have also a big pile of wood referred to above.\nwhich is admirable but which serves me well as it is dry and small for my little store.\n\nNow because of these facts I esteem it a great favor if you could, or rather would, let me stay on till the summer holidays when I shall bid the schoolhouse farewell forever.\n\nIn the spring this place is a sea of mud. Then there are some things I must dispose of\u2014a stone table, bedstead and mattress, tools, nails etc.\n\nAnother reason I have is, I may stay here awhile after the school closes, and have some of my family come up from Toronto to stay awhile.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nGeo.

SCHOOL.\n\nOn the occasion of my last visit\u2014a number of pupils who were infected with body lice were sent home. A number of these have not returned to school. It is quite probable that the conditions in their homes are such as to prevent them from freeing themselves from vermin. This accounts to a large extent for the decrease in attendance.\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMay 15th, 1914\n\nSir,\n\nI am writing to you in regard to the matter at hand. It seems that there is a misunderstanding between ourselves and the school board regarding the issue of the school's budget. We have been informed that the school board has approved an increase in the school's budget, but we believe that this increase is not necessary.\n\nWe urge you to reconsider this decision and to take into account the current financial situation of the school. We believe that the school should be able to operate within its current budget without any additional funding.\n\nWe look forward to your prompt response.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nSir,\n\nRegarding your request regarding telegrams, they may be in the mail or missing. I will not be able to assist you further.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 10, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you have stated in your letters of the 11th and 26th ultimo that Miss Mayne Warnock, teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 school, is a Roman Catholic I beg to inform you that she states most emphatically that she is a Presbyterian and that you are aware of this fact, as her application for the position of teacher, in which she gave her religion as Presbyterian, was written out in your presence and handed to you for transmission to the Department. Her explanation is satisfactory to the Department and should the question of her religion be brought up again you will be good enough to inform any busybodies that she is a Presbyterian.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, May 10, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant I have to say that your explanations in regard to your religious belief are satisfactory and Mr. Agent McCallum is being instructed to inform any busybodies on the reserve that you are not a Roman Catholic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

No. 3,\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 152473 dated April 29th, I beg to state that you have been misinformed in regard to my religion. When I came to Manitou Island I stated clearly to Indian Agent my religious denomination, wrote out my application in his presence and handed it to said Agent. At no time have I stated to any Indians on the Island that I was a Roman Catholic or for any reason to believe that they conducted the religious exercises instead of the same as I have in public schools for six years. I have had no trouble with any Indian parents with regard to my religious denomination, nor have any of the natives of Manitou Island, evidently to know the teachers' business better than the teachers themselves.\n\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\n\nMay 10th, 1905\nOttawa, April 29, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nI beg to inform you that some trouble has arisen in regard to the religious denomination to which you belong. The Department is advised that you are a Roman Catholic and you state in your report on the Walpole Island No. 2 School for the year ended December 31st, last, that you are a Presbyterian.\n\nKindly advise the Department at once as to whether you belong to the Roman Catholic or the Presbyterian Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI am writing in reply to the letter which was received by the Secretary in which it is stated that there is a Roman Catholic School at Wolfville Island. It is time that the Roman Catholic Church should take a hand in the education of the children of the island. I have heard no complaints about the religion taught in the school.\n\nIt may be well to note that when I visited the schools last year I requested the teachers at each school to send me a list of the students so that I could see how many attended. I have been informed that the attendance has been very good except for the last few weeks.\n\nP.S. I do not know who wrote this letter but to the right I will try to find out.\n\nApril 11th, 1914\nWallaceburg Ont.\nMay 29th 1916\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to ask what shall be done with regard to modern methods of examination and promotion in No. 21 Walpole Island School. These children are not fit for the standards they are set at present. It would be impossible to ask them to answer questions in writing; hence they tested orally some little satisfaction might be gained. If I have their answers the questions in writing and deduct one mark for mistakes.\nin getting themmen etc.\nI have been around the co\nworks right for promotion.\nMy idea was to leave them\nas they are in it and its\nstandards and whatever\nother promotions to do as\nI thought fit. Then next\nsummer public school\nstandards would be able\nto write a question set\nby Inspector Corn. How they\nhave done in regard to\npromoting and learning\nin previous years so one\nmystery here. Just a few\nmy T and T standards are\nlearning short lesson\nand are practically done\nthe work that I taught\nmy first class in the\nwhite schools.\n\nWill you kindly inform\nme with regard to this\nmatter.\n\nFurther, stop to state that\nCouncillor Mr. Carlson has taken\nno steps to get to improve\nthe unsanitary and unhygienic\ncondition of the toilets,\ntrusting a favorable reply.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nMartha Warnock,\nTeacher of #2 School.\nOttawa, April 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you herewith an anonymous letter which was received by the Department, in which it is stated that the teacher of one of the schools on Walpole Island is a Roman Catholic and that unless she is discharged and a Protestant engaged to replace her the parents will not send their children to school.\n\nThe Department would like you to find out, if possible, who is the author of this letter. The statement as to the religion of one of the teachers on the island is not correct, as they are both Protestants.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Indians accordingly and that they are to send their children regularly to school and in case of their failure to do so the Department will look to you to have the regulations enforced.\n\nThe teachers should be required to furnish you with a list of the absentees from time to time and you should instruct the truant officer to carry out sections 6 and 7 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. A. McCollum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, December 9, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant I beg to say that on the 14th of October last, you were informed that if Miss Warnock wished to remain on as teacher at the Walpole Island No. 2 school she would be paid at the rate of $650.00 per annum, but that she would have to make her own arrangements for board and transport. If she was advised by you to this effect the question of transport is disposed of so far as the Department is concerned and any claim against her for this service will have to be settled by her, as the Department has no authority to withhold her cheque.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that there has been more correspondence in regard to the teachers of the two schools on Walpole Island than is necessary and, as the Department has no intention of dispensing with their services without better reasons than you put forth, it would be as well to let the matter drop for the present.\n\nIt is noted that you addressed your letter to Mr. Benson of this Department. If you will refer to the head of this letter you will see that all correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary Dept. of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nAsst.

If they are not prepared to send in their resignations the Department thinks it would be well to keep them on for a time, provided they will interest themselves in their school work, as it would be a difficult matter to find other teachers at this season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Should they decide to leave then they should give you timely notice in writing of their intention to do so, so that you may be in a position to consult with the Public School Inspector with a view to obtaining the services of suitable teachers to succeed them.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

She is not a common teacher, she is very willing to help me. I don't think she intends buying my property from her quarter except a little. But let me say to a school there was one brought out here in most cases. Regarding Miss Wilson, she is very nice, she was not going to try to work, I do not think either of them will be interested in the move. I would prefer that we go to work and pay our own expenses. Do not like to come to change teachers often because it is not at all our wish of the children's thoughts. Would you find time to discuss this good question our school? You can help us in regard to new teachers or new school, correct.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, October 16, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you state that it would cost eighty cents a day for a conveyance for the teacher of the No. 2 Walpole Island School, I beg to say that some cheaper arrangement will have to be made, as it would be virtually bringing Miss Warnock's salary up to $760.00 a year, which is more than we are paying to any teacher in the province of Ontario where we have 82 day schools and only four of the teachers are in receipt of more than $600.00. Miss Warnock is only the holder of a limited third class certificate and the Department has not been furnished with any testimonials as to her previous success in teaching.\n\nIf Miss Warnock wishes to remain on she will be paid at the rate of $650.00 per annum, but she will have to make her own arrangements for board or transport.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThos.

They thought up to go at once from beginning this teacher to give them an opportunity to show how much he had done. But I was afraid it let me go away without ever the next teacher's presence.

He should not allow the Indian language to be used in school at all.

I wrote a note to the agent saying he could not be present again going to school because they do not go school if they had more teachers and the system worked in the same manner having any thing about imaginary quality with the common school funds in having any thing except my request some of the custom house to keep him in school not give him an absent in the future.\n\n[Signature]\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nWalpole Island\nDec 1st 1914\n\nSir,\n\nRegarding land\nfor a school for No. 2 inables\nabout two miles from the main\nland they could get land there\nor on the front line the land\nwould from there about 3 miles to\ngo three number of children\ncoming out of No. 2 Section to go\nthat coming a greater distance\nthan that.\n\nmuch obliged\n\nH.S.A.

The Department would like to know what accommodation could be found for a qualified teacher, should one be appointed in the near future.\n\nIn your report on the letter from Joseph Sampson, a copy of which was sent you on the 27th ultimo, you failed to deal with the points made by Mr. Sampson in regard to his claim that some of the signers of the petition have no children of school age and that only four out of the eight have children attending the school and also to his claim that Chomse, the instigator of the petition, was actuated more by ill will against the teacher than in the interests of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nValpole Island, Ont.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the petition sent in by some of the Valpole Island Indians asking for the appointment of a qualified teacher to replace Mr. Joseph Sampson I beg to say that Mr. Agent McCallum was asked to report fully on this petition and Mr. Sampson's letter in regard thereto. Mr. McCallum has replied stating that he has known for sometime that a change of teachers in the No. 2 School would be advantageous. He has, however, failed to deal with the points made by Mr. Sampson in his letter, in which he claims that Chomee, who is the instigator of this petition, is actuated by spite and that some of the signers of the petition have no children of school age, only four out of the eight having children attending the school.\n\nMr. Sampson has been teaching this school for the past fourteen years. The Department is aware that he has no special qualifications and possibly a change would be advantageous. Mr. Conn, Public School Inspector, who visited...\nvisited this school on the 1st of October, last, in his report in speaking of Sampson states \"success only fair, but I think his work is improving and the pupils are making somewhat better progress in their studies\".\n\nIt would be a difficult matter to obtain a qualified, white teacher for this school, as in the No. 1 School they have had seven teachers in the last four years and the present teacher has sent in her resignation. As Sampson has been so long in the employ of the Department I do not think it would be just to him to dismiss him summarily. Mr. McCollum will have to take steps to secure a qualified teacher for the No. 1 School and I think before doing anything with the No. 2 School we might wait to see what success he has. At any rate I would not advocate dispensing with Mr. Sampson's services till the end of the school year.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMr. Sampson should not be moved at present, it may be necessary from what is to accommodate for a qualified white teacher.\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date]\n\nMr. J.

We have brought this matter to the attention of the council and they are working on a solution. We are confident that we will find a way to resolve this issue.\n\nPlease keep me informed of any developments.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 27, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose copy of a communication received from Joseph Sampson, Teacher, No. 2 School, Walpole Island, complaining of the conduct of Peace Officer Dan Chosee; also copy of a petition signed by eight Indians, asking that a qualified teacher be employed in place of Sampson.\n\nI am to request that you will be good enough to report fully on the letter and petition referred to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI wish to call the attention to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs to the conduct of our police officer Dan Thorne who has been annoying me for several years past causing trouble in our school section and I strongly urge that the case be stepped up to give me trouble instead of helping the teacher to do any good in our School Section. To be in brief, on April 3rd, 1912 Thorne came into the school room in a bad humor insulted me while the pupils were leaving for home at 4 o'clock again on June 3rd, 1913. Thorne came (with Charlie Reid a constable) to the school house at 9:15 A.M., he was angry and spoke unpleasantly before the School. I got him a summons to serve and convicted on June 11th, fine $10 and cost $12. Total $13.00 I had somewhat a difficult task to have the matter settled until I wrote to you with evidence papers year ago this month Dept. Sheriff Thorne to pay his fine and costs since the trial two cases\nhave occurred similar to the paper enclosed, our Indian Agent seem to be in favour with Thomas and I want to say a word regarding to our agent in connection with my school in the next letter. I have the school pretty well under control, the daily attendance is very good. The school house have been built by the Potowatomies without any help from the Department; the expenses in connection with them is paid out of the funds of the Potowatomi Band. In the case of Dan Thomas a member of the Chippewa Band do not look good to interfere in our school section and you will notice his name not signed on the petition, he has no child but a step daughter age fifteen who is not at School. We as Potowatomies should have the right to the interests of the school with the help of our own council. The Chippewa children have the same privilege as our children have in attending the said school because the school is done for them than the No. 1 School so is the same way with the other school if any of the Potowatomi children are at School.\n\nSupposing any of the Potowatomies interfere in\nNo. 1. Chippewa School the result would be a calling down, they would say that the Potawatomies have no business in their school. If I am correct should this be understood, so that in future, that members or members of the Chippewa Band interfere in our School Section.\n\nNames signed on this petition:\nJames P. Keyworth 2 girls attendance bad and are not looked after at home.\nJoseph M. Sword 1 girl age 15 not on the school roll.\nMrs. Dan.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nI have a petition to have a qualified teacher in this No. 2 School. It is to come before the Council next meeting.

With regard to his letter herewith, I think from what I saw of conditions there last summer that if Mr. Sampson would conduct a garden next year, as he claims to be competent to do, the Department would be quite justified in granting him an increase. He is Chief of the Pottawattamies and is a very fair type of Indian. It will be at least sometime before the scheme for a consolidated school can be carried to completion, if the Department decides to undertake it, and I think it would be well to give Mr. Sampson some encouragement.\n\nC.F. MacKenzie\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOct. 20th 1913.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wrote last summer to write to you I would like through your kind influence to lay the matter to the Department of Indian Affairs for an increase of my salary. $300 per year is not enough to support a family. I have completed the III Fifth course in the High School of Ontario taught in the School last ten years and three years in the other School here missed a day because of sickness. Salaries of teachers have been raised and why should I not have the same chance? I could have had a larger salary elsewhere but for the sake of helping my own people I remain at my post and your station I was elected chief for the next three years you see my services are needed.\n\nI am taking the Professional Teachers Course instruction by correspondence with two special courses namely Agriculture and Domestic Science from the Carnegie College Rogers, Ohio, if the Dept. desires me to teach the subject of agriculture providing my salary raised I will do so.\n\nI am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJoseph Sampson\nOttawa, March 13, 1903.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you apply for an increase in salary I beg to say that the reports received on your work at this school would not justify the Department in granting any increase.\n\nWith regard to the Agent's reports he should be required to fill them up himself and in reference to the supplies in future if the quantities asked for do not reach you be good enough to advise the Department and inquiry will be made. It is presumed that the Agent hands the material over to you as he receives it and if there is any shortage the fault probably lies elsewhere else.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJoseph Sampson, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nWalpole Island No. 2 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReceived the letter no. 404811 dated February 25th, 1913. In reply I beg to say that I shall be ready to attend the summer course at the Agricultural College, Guelph, and make necessary arrangements with someone to look after my place while I am gone. July and August being the busiest time of the season will certainly put me back in the work at home. The proposition made by the Department is very good, now I wish to explain my case. Having a family of three depending on me, I wrote to the Department sometime ago asking a raise on my salary as per year is not sufficient. Salaries for teachers have been raised and I feel competent that I can do as good work to my own advantage as any second class teacher. Miss A. Beaton teacher of No. 1 School, Watford Island, receives salary $85.00 per year. I have taught school at Watford Island since the year Oct. 1st, 1900. My qualifications from High School of Ont., my school is doing splendidly. The attendance is very good. I earnestly ask through you to lay the matter with Department.\nI raise my salary at least $50 more in addition to my present salary. The other $60 will also be added making the total $400 a year's salary providing that if I make a success in completing the course next summer I do not wish to leave my home at any time though refused two good positions in the States offering a better salary. We have a good farming country and the climate is splendid. Person who has any ambition can do just as well at home than elsewhere.\n\nRegarding the Agent's monthly School reports should the Indian Agent fill out the reports and send them giving the Agent time to fill out the case of ten weeks. Has he given the Agent time at the office and do not go out at all to visit the school then he does visit the schools. Has not even once taken classes to know how the school is doing his last visit was on March 5th 1913 which means his visit is for the month of February. A new supply of School Books etc are sometimes delivered less than what my order calls for. When broken pencils run short I usually buy the need for the pupils and few supply for the teacher.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJoseph Sampson\nTeacher\nOttawa, June 14, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has not of late received any complaints with reference to your work as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 school.\n\nWith regard to your return for the June quarter it should be made out in the usual way. Payment at the rate of two hundred teaching days in the year has only reference to broken periods. You will be paid a full quarter's salary as usual. School may be closed at the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJoseph Sampson, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSecretary of the\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nJune 15th, 1912\n\nWalpole Island\n\nSir,\n\nAny alleged complaint should come or has been made against me to the Department in connection with the school, etc., kindly return a copy of their letter. A chance should be given to me to explain the matter as well as the other facts. The party have annoyed the school in the past instead of promoting the interests of the parents & school children. A child will imitate the parents and show manners worse to the teacher. My duty is to uplift the young as well as the old in any way that I can help. No parent has ever visited the children while at school. I am sure that the Public School Inspector is satisfied with my work.\n\nWhen term quarters, school returns are made out may I make the returns in proportions to the number of teaching days with the last month quarter, no pay in accordance to the instructions of the Department so that a teacher is to be paid a salary according to the number of teaching days in the year (20 teaching days).\nPlease send a copy Revised Statutes of the Indian Act also a copy of the School Act Respecting the Indian Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJoseph Sampson\nTeacher.\nMEMORANDUM:\u2014\n\nFor correspondence re purchase of lot No. 237, Pottawatimie Island from Mr. Joseph Isaac for school ground purposes in connection with the No. 2 Walpole Island school see 152943/5.\nOttawa, May 18, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th instant I have to say that you are hereby authorised to expend a sum not exceeding $6.00 for each of the schools on Walpole Island in the purchase of prizes. The accounts should be kept separate and should show in detail the articles purchased with prices. If possible the teachers should arrange to have the presentation of these prizes made in the presence of the parents and should prepare some programme for their entertainment. I would ask you to request each of the teachers to submit a short report on this to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. B.

The Department is prepared to carry out this suggestion and will also allow a small grant at both the No. 1 and No. 2 schools for prizes to be distributed at the end of the June quarter. The scholars should be informed that these prizes will be given as rewards for punctuality and regularity of attendance and diligence in their studies. You will be good enough to bring the matter to the attention of the Department about the month of May and obtain authority for the purchases.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

This school as well as the former school was very clean and tidy and the teacher appeared to be a rather superior class of Indian. He has however no particular qualifications for his duties. He does take considerable interest in the scholars and would like if some prizes could be awarded to those who attend the most regularly. It would appear to me that these two school districts are both worthy of having as good teachers as the Dept can secure. The equipment in this school appeared quite complete.\n\nJ.G. Ramsden\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nOTTAWA, 31st December, 1920.\n\nMR:\n\nIn your \"Teacher's Report\" for the year just ending, recently received by the Department, it is noted that you devote time to assistance on only Tuesdays and Thursdays of each week. You will note in the Manual sent you in August last that the movements described as Group I, are to be given the pupils daily. I have to state, therefore, that the Department expects you to carry out such instructions accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

McLaughlin. I saw the Indian Agent and instructed me to write direct to the Indian Department. My salary is $300 per year. This is not enough to depend on for my living. I have been teaching school on Walpole Island last ten years to the first of Oct. 1910. I keep my situation steadily while the other was.

He interviewed the local agent at Walpole Island, Mr. McDougal who advises him that no complaint had gone through him. If any complaint has been made we should be pleased if you would forward a copy of it to us so that we may let Mr. Sampson have it. Mr. Sampson would be pleased to have any complaint that may be laid against him thoroughly investigated as it is only the whim of a couple of the Indians resident on the Island and there is really no foundation to it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. This man is of a rather fine appearance & intelligent.\nDear Sir:\n\nThere was a fight between two school boys on March 11/10. If any complaints made against me kindly let me know I wasn't fair play.\n\nDon't neglect to let one of the smaller pupils do the whipping when a child does too much talking who will not listen when spoken to be quiet; especially young ones are apt to talk. I cannot bear to whip a child and see it cry. In case of fighting or slitting I do the whipping myself. Pupils are hard to manage when parents are not interested in the work. A child will tell a story to save his skin instead of telling the truth at home. Few neighbors are against me and to do things on the sly makes me feel uneasy. You should know how it is from world experience.

I wish to explain my situation somewhat. It was a matter for discussion with the Inspector of Public Schools back in January, so it seemed it would be uncertain for me to pass the examination because time was short. He spoke and asked me what to do in the matter, after much thought decided to work next summer 1905. Told the Inspector that I can study and teach some time this summer, but accepted my word but did not promise to write on the examination until July of this year. You will see by the above that one of the School Inspectors spoke to me about going to the examination last June and I did. The School Inspectors have never shown themselves to my school but once since being in office. Now I am willing to take any chance should be given to me I will pass the examination for obtaining the District Certificate. My standing is in the 7th Form of the High School when I left the last point of learning.\n\nYours very Truly,\n\nJoseph Simpson\nTeacher No. 2\nWarpole Island\nOTTAWA, 8th January, 1963\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo relative to the attendance at No. 3 Walpole Island school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion that the teacher of this school exchange places with Arthur Niskokoson, who has charge of No.2 school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLarn\nSecretary\n\nJ.B. McDowall, Fag.\nIndian Agent\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nWallaceburg Dec 30th\n\nSecretary Dept. Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nThe attendance at No. 8 school is very small and the majority that are there in the winter time are members of the Chippawa Band and attend to the preaching as well as the teacher. Some of them are members of the Potawatomi Band and the Indians are so numerous and have a Chippawa teacher written in their name but have no complaint on that account.\n\nI think it would be advisable to change the teachers and see if this will make any difference in the attendance at No. 8 school both teachers are willing to make the change if the department is willing as it would be more convenient in length of time I think it advisable to change the teacher at once and then it will be better attendance the only way will be to enforce compulsory attendance.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of July 21st enclosing copy of a letter from the Indian Agent in Nelson proposing to transfer Arthur Kiyokshonan from No. 2 School on Wolfpole Island to School No. 3 and to appoint Cornelia Kiyokshonan to School No. 2.\n\nI have written with the view of ascertaining more definitely the qualification of Kiyokshonan for this work and should the report be favorable I do not see that there is any serious hindrance in the way of making the change that is proposed. As soon as I receive a reply from Wolfpole Island I will communicate further with the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

Sutherland, D.D.,\nSecretary\nMethodist Mission Room,\nToronto,\nThe Methodist Church,\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\n25th July, 1890.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit for your consideration a slight increase of salary to Mr. Arthur Niskokomon, teacher of one of the schools on Walpole Island. He receives at the present time $275 per annum, and it is suggested that this be increased to $300 for the following reasons:\n\n1. He is reported to be a hardworking conscientious teacher, making good time.\n\n2. He is a married man with a family, and finds it very hard to live on the present allowance.\n\n3. The teachers in the Church of England and Government schools each receive $300, although the latter has a much smaller number in attendance than Niskokomon.\n\nIf the Department approves of this suggestion, the Missionary Society will bear its share of the proposed increase.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA.

The amount received is $68.45 which is the full amount paid by the teacher for supplies for the school.\n\nEnclosed is the receipt.\n\nNow in order to get the two teachers appointed, I have had to go down to the school board and explain why this teacher should not be paid. The reason given is that there are no funds available. In fact there are funds available but they are not being used. We have a pretty good time making from the school and in bad times we have to take a little while the other side of the road. We can borrow money and dinner and as many other things as they do, and take as much from the school as they do, and take as much from the school as they do.\n\nIndian Affairs Office\nI beg to enclose inclosed\nletter No. 1, mentioned therein\nshould be sent by mail for kept\nin my office.

I have written to the Secretary twice inquiring why it has not been sent, and I have not received any answer to my letters. I think it is very unfair for I need this money and should be sent promptly. The teachers of No. 1 School informed me that they always receive their immediate payments. Why is this report so late? Why is the deduction made? The report was supposed to be completed at the end of the quarter, and the Inspector informed me that my work equals any of the other schools. There is much to be said in favor of my work, and nothing can be said against it. I am sure that my work is good, and that I am entitled to the same pay as others who work equally hard.\n\nI am writing to you in hopes of an increase in my salary in view of the fact that my attendance is excellent, and I can show the average for September as 8.15. Hoping for an early reply.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nElsie E. Heagge\n#3 Main Street\nOnt.\nOttawa, October 29th, 1929.\n\nMadam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant, I beg to say that the Department regrets any inconvenience that might have been caused you in not receiving your cheque earlier in the month. In explanation, I may say that your quarterly return did not reach here until the 24th instant and, as you are aware, salaries are not paid until the quarterly returns are received. You might point out, however, that on receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, your cheque was forwarded, even though the return had not arrived at that time.\n\nSalary at the rate of $900 a teaching year is provided for the Walpole Island No. 3 Indian Day School and the Department is unable to increase this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell F.

A third voucher rendered at $3.00 has been sent in by you in Shipman's favour. The first item is $2.00 for hauling shingles and the second $1.00 for hauling seized piles.

I found everything in this school, which is under the management of H.D. Watts, teacher quite orderly. The school outside is in need of some repair work. This school will require some new siding, possibly 50 ft. I would estimate the cost of this outside repair work to the No.2 School, Walpole Island at about $6.00. I also found one of the closets at this school in need of some repair which would probably cost about $4.00. I would recommend that those repairs be made at the No.2 School, Walpole Island.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, April 11, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant regarding a few slight repairs which you consider should be performed at the No. 2 School on Walpole Island.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may purchase the siding required and have the outside repair work mentioned by you done at a cost not to exceed your estimate, namely $6.00. You may also arrange to have the chairs ordered done to the closets at this school and the cost of this work should not exceed the estimate furnished by you, namely $4.00. As soon as the repairs have been completed you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Mclean\nAsst.

There were 14 boys and 14 girls, with 11 absentees the day I was there. There were 4 of the pupils sitting on chairs with no desks. The teacher stated that he has had as high as 25 at school at one time. There is room for 4 more double desks. I believe it would be advisable to install them. Although he has only 39 on the roll at present, there are quite a number of others within the three mile radius who will, when they start, swell the attendance considerably.\n\nI beg to recommend that six double seats be secured.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nDuncan G.

You should also state the ages of the pupils for whom these desks are required, in order that the proper sizes can be ordered. The teacher will, no doubt, be able to give you this information.\n\nAn early reply will oblige.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

Paul is being written and requested to state the make of desks at present in use, in order that if new desks are supplied they can be of the same type as those at present in the school.\n\nAs soon as particulars are received regarding the desks, and the ages of the children for whom they are required, in order that the right size of desk can be ordered, the matter will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\nWe have completed the erection of the No. 1 school at Walpole Island, and we will be in a position now to proceed with No. 2 School.\n\nNo. 2 school has a capacity at the present time for 16 pupils. There are 85 pupils of school age at the present time who should attend this school. 30 seats are crowded into this small school, and sometimes the teacher has to put them three in a seat. This building is old and very much out of date, and I would recommend that a new school be built.\n\nThe material for this building could be obtained from the public bush and made into lumber at the Indian saw mill which is only a few hundred yards from the proposed school. I would suggest that a school with a teacher's residence combined be built. The present teacher, Mr. D. White lives in an old log shack about a mile and a half from the school. We have a certain amount of material left from the erection of the No. 1 School and this could be utilized in connection with the construction of the new school.\n\nThe only time material can be got out of the woods is during the winter, and if it is your intention to proceed with the building next year, the material should be taken out this winter. The cost of erecting this building should be, approximately, between three and four thousand dollars.\n\n[Signature]\n\n(R.H.

As you may, no doubt, aware, there are two first-class saw-mills on Walpole Island where the dimension timber and all rough lumber for the new school can be sawed. Mr. Smith owns a wood comprising 275 acres of material suitable for the construction. It would require approximately $500.00 to get this timber cut. I beg to recommend that this sum be made available, as the timber should be taken out immediately. I estimate the cost of the proposed new school and teacher's residence at $3500.00.\n\nAgricultural Representative.\nOttawa, January 4, 1923.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to the erection of the new school No. 2 on Walpole Island, I beg to say that I am sending you under separate cover two blue print copies of a plan which has been used in other locations for a combined day school and teachers' residence which, with the same as discussed with you while in the Department, it is thought will meet the requirements on Walpole Island.\n\nIn your memorandum addressed to the Deputy Minister, it is noted that the timber required should be taken out this winter, and that the cost would be approximately $300.00.

During the past winter the Indians themselves have cut the lumber from their supply on the reserve and have drawn it to a mill belonging to one of the band, where it will be sawn into the required sizes.\n\nThe present school building is very old, beyond repair, and is unsuitable for school purposes. It is proposed to erect this new building by Indian labour, under the supervision of a competent foreman. This was the arrangement that was carried out in the erection of a combined 2-roomed school and teacher's residence at the No. 1 school. All arrangements for carrying out the building operations and the cutting and sawing of the lumber will be under the direct oversight of our agricultural representative, Mr. R. H. Abraham, who will arrange for the payment of the labour employed, sawing and hauling the timber, etc. It is intended to proceed with the work of erecting the building as soon as possible, and Mr. Abraham has requested that advances be sent him from time to time to pay for the labour, etc.\n\nIt is considered that we can erect this building by utilizing Indian labour under a competent foreman, at least cost than if we called for public tenders. The estimated cost will be $3,500.00, and I would request your approval for having the work done, as stated above, and for the expenditure required.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMemorandum\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart:\n\nFunds to the amount of $3,500 have been provided in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the present fiscal year, to erect a combined school and teacher's living quarters at the No. E school on the Walpole Island Indian Reserve, Lambton County.

The items on the voucher covering the pay sheets amounts to $1874.00, a difference of $43. This is owing to the fact that in writing Mr. Tom he knocked off an item which I will also note that there was a contract let to Frank Milburn for plastering odd yards \"41\". I might say that in this connection that there were two tenders both at 4\u00bd per yard, and I awarded it to Milburn as I knew he was a good man.

You should also arrange to have the woodshed moved from its present position to a suitable site.\n\nAs the old school building will not be further required, you should arrange to sell the same to the person making the highest offer. The money received for this old building should be forwarded to the Department for credit to the funds of the Potawatomi Band.\n\nNo unnecessary expenditure should be incurred in the fencing, building of the walk and moving of the woodshed. In the purchase of any material required, competitive prices should, if possible, be obtained. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept by the labor employed.

Another thing badly needed is separate toilets; this was recommended by the Inspector, Mr. Cowan. These toilets are very inconvenient and insanitary.

I also think the storm porch would be a great benefit and saving on wood and would recommend favorable consideration.\n\nThe toilets are much the same conditions as No. 1 school which I spoke about a few weeks ago.

You may also arrange to have a small porch erected at the back door of the residence. The estimate which you forwarded from Messrs. Ready & Cain, Contractors, for the performing of this work has been noted. It is considered, however, that a porch of smaller dimensions than those mentioned would be satisfactory. This porch should be finished to correspond with the rest of the building.\n\nThe Department is not prepared at the present time to authorise the building of an outside toilet. If the present toilets require cleaning, you may arrange to have this work done and have them placed in a sanitary condition.\n\nIt is expected that you will see that all costs in the installing of a register and the building of a porch are kept down to the lowest possible cost, having in view the performance of a satisfactory job.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

An unexpected happened, and I have a small car. Would you please have the door of the wood shed made wider and fixed so that I can keep the car in there? School starts on Sept 3rd.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nEvelyn E. George\nI have enclosed a request from Mrs Ethel E George, Teacher at No.2 school. Mrs George states that she has purchased a car and asks that a larger door be made in the shed that is located on the school grounds so that she might be able to drive her car in.\n\nThis job would not be expensive; there would need to be enough new lumber to make a new door and a track for it to run on, and the labor would probably be about $20.00.\n\nI think what Mrs George is asking for is not unreasonable; the No.2 school is situated at the lower end of the Island and her principal way of travel was to walk. She will find her car very convenient and she can hardly be expected to keep it outside in all kinds of weather. For these reasons I would ask that this request be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\nOttawa, September 4th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication from Mrs. Ethel H. George, teacher of the Mulpole Island No. 5 Indian Day School, requesting that a larger door be made in the shed in order that she can have space for the storing of her car. In reply I beg to say that you will arrange to have the extension required made to the door. It is noted that you estimate the cost to be, approximately, $20.00. If possible, you should keep the cost of the material and labour below this estimate and, when the work is completed, you should furnish certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

You should arrange for the purchase of the same and for the work in having it put on. After the work has been completed, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the oil and the labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

April 3rd 19--\n\nI beg to enclose the quarterly report from No. 1 and No. 2 Walpole Island Indian day school quarter ending March 31, 1935.\n\nIn reference to the requisition from Ethel M., teacher of No. 2 school I might say that no doubt the floor in the garage would be a great convenience as two rooms do not suit at all times of year. If flooring the whole garage was too much expense there could be two 10 or 12 inch plank placed for the wheels two run on this would keep the tire of the ground and out of the mud and would be serviceable for several years.\n\nI will have to make another report on this. I had arranged to have the toilets cleaned (this has not been done as yet) but at that time I discovered that the cement cistern basin had cavied in in the floor quite sure they had not, it may be possible that they have cavied in since the frost has come out of the ground. In the spring they are still very desirable to have the water seep in from the rain and till this water gets away some and the ground dry up it would be more expensive to have them cleaned. Both toilets are in the one building but there is a room between that was original used for the teacher toilet. If at any time the Department was building new toilets it would probably be better to build the boys and girls separate I am of the opinion that this toilet is still financial conditions improve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nArchie Macphail,\nIndian agent,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, April 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, with reference to the requisition from the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School. In this connection I have to say that the Department has no funds to provide for a floor in the garage. It is considered that, if the teacher requires planking for her car to rest on, in order to keep the tires off the ground, she should be in a position to supply this material herself.\n\nIt is noted that you will arrange to have the toilets cleaned and the cement catch basin repaired. Any costs in connection with the cleaning and repairing of the toilets should be kept to the lowest possible point. Our funds during the present fiscal year will be extremely limited, and requests should be made for only the absolutely urgent repairs, etc. After the repairs and the cleaning of the closets have been completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nMay 13th\n\nTo Highfield Land Agent\nI want to see that job at school house to ring about\nputting the toilet in there that George\nthe school teacher wish the bricks be cut\nin two she claims it would be easy\nto keep them clean if it would\nI know you could not fix that\nbut very much it all to finish an\nit would be alright to me to\nan ... fine.\n\nFor forms\nLabor\n\nshiplops 100 ft\n$25.00\nOttawa, August 24, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, regarding the condition of the toilets at the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School. It is noted the teacher requests that the present toilets be divided and placed on different locations. The Department has considered the estimate which you have sent from the Indian mason covering the cost of material and labour to separate the double toilets, dig holes, and erect two separate toilets with concrete catch basins and also the quotation from Ready & Cain, which covers the cost of materials and labour if the toilets were cut in half and moved to other locations.\n\nIt is considered that it would be advisable to have these toilets divided and moved to a new location and to have proper catch basins installed. You may arrange to have this work carried out by the Indian mason mentioned by you, if you believe that he would perform the work satisfactorily. I enclose an endorsement certificate authorizing an expenditure to the amount of $55.00, covering the cost of materials and labour. I would request that you see to it that the toilets at this school placed in satisfactory condition as mentioned above, and that the work is completed at an early date. After same is finished to your satisfaction, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and for the labour. Please state on each copy of the vouchers that the expenditure was authorized by R. R. No. 877. The total amount expended in connection with this work should not exceed $55.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

George, teacher at No. 2 School, asking that a heater be supplied for the residence.\n\nI have priced the heaters at Wallaceburg and an iron wood burner costs from $11.00 from $14.00, depending on the size. I think a small one would be satisfactory. The stove and pipe would probably cost $12.00 to $15.00. A tin chimney and pipe can be purchased from six to seven dollars depending on size. A small one of these with pipes can be furnished for eight dollars or less. Mrs. George would be quite satisfied with one of these air tight heaters.\n\nI might say that while this may not be an actual necessity it no doubt would be a great convenience as the only way Mrs. George has of heating her living room and sleeping quarters is from the open stove in the kitchen. This winter Mrs. George has a lady living with her to assist in the house work. This lady has a small girl and they find it rather cold for the child.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 6, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School, asking that a heater be supplied for use in the residence.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and installation of an air-tight, galvanized iron heater and the necessary stove pipe. It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $8.00. After the purchase has been made, you should obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost.

May 15th 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nEnclosed find letter from Mrs. Ethel H. George teacher No.2 school. In reference to flag pole I would refer the Department to official letter dated Oct. 15th 1936 file 40-2-5 they have no flag pole here and think they should have one at each school. It could be either a wooden pole or iron pipe. A few years ago we erected an iron pipe at No.1 school, this was set in cement. A high step ladder is needed at this school, for cleaning stove pipes and other work on the wall or ceiling; it should be a 7 or 8 foot step ladder. The stove pipe in this class room go the whole length of the room, every time the pipe are taken apart or put together we have to erect a platform of some kind.\n\nMrs. George paid a truck to move a few load of rock from the Anglican church basement to the school last winter and intended to start a rock garden at the school herself with the help of the children, she found securing the dirt to large an undertaking for herself and the children. I do not consider it would take as much dirt as she is asking for. If the Department can see their way clear to approve this, I would recommend that the necessary dirt be secured and a few plants or flowers be purchased to start a rock garden.\n\nIn reference to the back steps at residence and screen for porch has not come to my attention while at the school, therefor I can not report fully on these at the present time.\n\nSince the highwater none of the surface wells are very good, during the present week we raised the pump at No.1 school one foot, which seemed to help considerably. Mr. Daley informs me the water is much better now. I will have the one at the back school the first of the week. This is only temporary measure, but there is so much water in the ground now that it is practically impossible to pump them dry by hand.\nI would refer the Department to there letter of October 15th 1936 file 40-1-1 in reference to driving steel points for a water supply at both schools; I did not get this work done last year, so attempt was made at No.1 school. At No.2 school there was start made, it turned very cold and not completed, and the men doing the work were not experienced in this line of work. I think we are quite certain of securing water with a steel point at No.1 school, with fair prospect at No.2 school. I was talking to a man recently who has put down quite a number of well of this kind, he advises against doing this work now while the ground is so full of water, as one would secure water most any place, but would not be successful when it became drier.\n\nIf the approval that the Department gave last year remain good for the present fiscal year I will try this plan later on. At No.2 school there will have to be a new well of some kind or the bricks curbing in the old well removed as the brick are falling in, it is quite evident that if the bricks wall in removed it may cave in. It might be possible to drive a point in the bottom of this old well and fill with several feet of gravel. The gravel would prevent the wall from falling in and help purify the water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, May 19, 1937.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, you may arrange for the erection of a flag-pole at the Walpole Island #2 Indian Day School. The cost should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYou may, also, purchase a step-ladder and arrange for the drawing of the earth for the garden. A few seeds may also be secured and, if you consider that a new platform and steps at the back door are necessary, you may have this work done. The front porch may also be repaired. The cost of all these improvements should be kept as low as possible.\n\nIt is noted that you were not able to do any work last fall in regard to the walls at both schools.

The bridge is only six rods from the gravel road; if she came out with her car on the other side of school yard she would have 10 or 12 rods to cross the school yard which would probably be worst than the old road bed when wet and would cut the school yard up when the ground was soft. It would be less cost to gravel the road some time when we had gravel to spare.

It is true that you were given authority in the year 1939 but that only covered the academic year 1939-40. Instructions have repeatedly been issued to all Indian Agents that new authority must be obtained in every fiscal year.\n\nIf you consider the serving of a midday lunch necessary at these two schools, the Department has no objection to allowing the same monthly amount as previously; namely, $15.00 a month for a period of four months at the No. 1 School and $8.00 a month for a period of four months at the No. 2 School.\n\nWe are not prepared to approve the resolution of the Council with reference to expending an additional $10.00 a month from band funds. The Department does not see any necessity for this extra expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Jas. H. Daley,\nIndian Agent,\nValpole Island, Ont.\n\nR.A.

Daley,\nIndian Agent.\nWapole Island, Ontario\nDecember 4, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis Resolution was past in spite of the fact it is identical to a former Resolution passed in a Council Meeting held Nov. 3, 1931, Resolution 7 which was not approved by your Department. The Council feel that the health of the school children would be greatly improved by them getting a small quantity of bread each day at noon. They feel that this vote of $4 per month and the former vote of $10 per month is a very small item when it is for the health of their children. They asked me to explain to you that they are not passing this resolution in a spirit of rebellion but are asking you to kindly reconsider Resolution 7 on November 3, 1941, Council and to deal favorably with this.\n\nI understand that the other grant comes from Government appropriation funds. This, of course, would be from Band funds. I regret that I had authorized the other expenditure for noon lunches without getting this authority this year in writing from your department. I understood from the teachers that at the last teacher's convention held at Moreviantown that this was more or less discussed and verbally consented by Mr. Phelan. I do not recall having heard him make the statement myself.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nJames W. Daley\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nDecember 18, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant the Department is not prepared to approve Resolution No. 2 passed at a meeting of the Walpole Island Council held on December 1.

This is especially noticeable on days that the wind blows from the southwest.\n\nThis incessant smoke in the school is harmful to the health of the children. It would be desirable to have a white tradesman come and place an exhaust pipe on the roof.

Our eyes are affected by the smoke, and the walls and ceiling are blackened. The fireplaces have not been cleaned recently. The chimney flue has not been cleaned for years.\n\nThe residence needs re-decorating. The wall paper is faded and darkened by smoke from the school rooms. If cold water paint is supplied, we will do the painting without pay. Cold water paint is cheap and clean.\n\nThe following are the sizes of the rooms:\n\nOne bedroom approx. 300 sq. ft.

First re the chimney and the smoke, this condition has existed in No. 2 School for the past 14 years, and the only way that I can see it can be corrected is by the building of a new chimney, and I recommend that this be done during the coming year.\n\nRe the redecorating of wall paper in the living quarters as very little expense has been put on the living quarters at No. 2 School, and as Mrs. George is willing to do the work herself I would recommend that materials and brushes be supplied for the same.

It is hoped that these can be repaired during the summer holidays. The teacher reports that the roof is leaking badly in several spots. A new door is needed for the boys' toilet as well as minor repairs to the building. No toilet paper was in evidence the day of this visit.\n\nThe outside of the building needs repainting badly. If it is let go much longer it will be very costly when the job is undertaken. The fence needs painting. An extra pair of paint rollers does not appear or taste very good. Both walls should be tested and the better one used. I note that the seats are not fastened as a result of concerts in the school. It would be well to fasten the seats on strips, about three seats to a strip. They could then be moved wherever desired and very easily.\nOttawa, July 20, 1946.\n\nMr. James F.

Farrett's report on the Walpole Island No. 2 School, dated June 13th, 1947. Original on 40-2-6\n\n\"The school building and surroundings need attention badly. The outside of the building is bad & paint in spots should be attended to this summer. The interior needs redecorating although it might be postponed another year. The boys' toilet should be repaired and toilet paper and lime placed in both toilet buildings. As well, the caretaker should be instructed to scrub the toilets regularly. This is not the teacher's job.\n\nIt is noted that there is no fire protection for the building. A good fire extinguisher should be provided as well as a ladder which would reach the roof.\n\nThe blackboards are so dirty the chalk will scarcely make a mark. If they were given a coat of the proper preparation for hypoplate board this condition could be overcome. Sometimes it would be wise to start and replace the present board with new ones changing one or two panels a year.\n\nThe roof has still not been checked nor the drinking water tested.\"\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Ethel K.

He further complains that the sum of $200 is very insufficient compensation for the trouble which the teaching of such a large school demands. With reference to the teacher's situation, I would respectfully recommend that an increase of $30 be made to the present salary, as the First Bay Indian School is the largest next to St. Ignatius Bay, in this Superintendentery.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCaptain General Officer,\nOttawa.\nSarah Bernard has been teaching since Sept. the beginning of the Sep't Quarter 1854.\n\nNo. Boys: 31\n\" Girls: 19\n\" Total: 50\n\nAverage attend = 16\n\nTwo Standards given in Art History.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOTTAWA 20th May 1915\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant in which you state that Miss Sarah Bernard, teacher of the West End School has applied for an increase of $30 per annum in her salary.

I quote from a letter of Father Richard dated May 19, 1876:\n\n\"The Indians of Wabigoon (Mr. Sarah Bernard) had been troublesome. The village was in a state of confusion. The Indians were insubordinate in every way. They had spent considerable time in the school house with Father Richard. He has often complained of their conduct during school hours. However, the Chiefs are under the command of the religious authorities, who have been very strict. Mr. Sarah Bernard has been several times subjected to discipline by Father Richard and Father Richard has had a very exemplary life. However, he could not be disciplined. He is considered a good Indian, a good Catholic. He has always been obedient and respectful. It appears that we cannot discipline him further, and that he is a trouble to the rest of the Indians here.\"\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\ntake in this matter.\n\nLaw School Board\n\nK.W.

One day they came and wanted me to lend them some money. They said they needed it for something important. I lent them the money, but then they disappeared without paying me back. It was a bad experience.\n\nI thought it would be easier to deal with them in the future.\nTo Mr. B. W. Ross\n\nSir,\n\nThis is to inform you about being dismissed from the N. E. 13th school. We are obliged to do this because of bad conduct by Indians. This school was made up by Mr. Ross. Before the war was over, I did not want to leave this school year. I went to teach, and that is the reason that he and I will Father Richard come here about our time. I am going to be discharged by Father Richard. This school before all things, and Father Richard is the best. I was surprised at how my character had been so low; I always kept my word. I am sure that I will not ever forget the Indians say, for every Indian knows they are talkative and insolent. The other people in West Bay has very little against me except Father Richard. They have told it away to other people in this place, but it was no secret. I was requested by Father Richard to make a Xmas tree for the people. He said it was not mine. I was very much hurt by what he said. I am doing them all I could in several other things, and that is the way they are doing now.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The Indians\nwere very anxious to have an education\nfrom Mr. Bernard and would be willing\nto come at once if they could be\nassured that the matter was with the\nChief and other Indians\u2014all of whom\nhave been instructed that Mr. Bernard\n(whom Mr. Bernard promised to\nteach in the teaching school)\ncirculated before his return to\nthis country assure us that he will\nsend in a small class at the end of\nthe school term. In this Chief's eyes\nthere was no reason for such distrust\nof the Deputy Superintendent.\n\nIndian Affairs.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nTo attract their opinions, he further says, that the children all promised will come here. And also, that he is very desirous, with the exception of Corbin's and a few of his friends children - and that he would like to see them return to the school in nothing to mind. Father Richards this morning as said Miss Bernard might be returned to the school again if she kept within it so, but that she should come near the walls of the church and be more satisfied. Many of the Indians would be glad the children to school, as to have them stay with in the town and to be a good example and I believe that Father Rigaud of the fact, which he now admits, has been disappointed in his children by the circumstances I could not become that Miss Bernard be permitted to bring any of the children would not attend to attend school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.M.

In view of this fact, the Department would be very glad if you have not made other arrangements, to have you take charge of this school as soon as possible. I should also be glad if you would call at the Department when convenient.\n\nJ. D.

Mr. Smith, Father Superior at Wikwemikong, under date 15th inst., respecting vacancy of the South Bay or Lower Bay Indian School.\n\nMiss Bogan who had been appointed to teach at South Bay wrote to me when I thought that she was abroad in the place, that she had accepted another school and could not come, so the school at South Bay was vacant again and to satisfy the people I appointed Miss Anna Ashby. Until another one may be found she is married to Charles King brother of the other Charles King who is married to the teacher of Wikwemikong.\nof the Riverina Company. Since Mr. White passed and he was Miss Sarah Bernard at Willawong and told her in my name to go again to South Bay. Consequently Mrs. Chas. Gray, alias Madeleine Adolpheus (a former teacher of South Bay) has the interim and she will give up as soon as Miss Sarah Bernard will come. She may have come already.\n\nFor the West Bay school I appointed Miss Philomena de Lamoindiere whom I consider to be fit both intellectually and morally to fill the position in a satisfactory manner. It is however also a trial.\n\nPlease dear sir inform the department in order that there may be no difficulty for the salaries when the time will come.\n\nYours,\n\nB.M.

He included two applications, since all of them would have proper qualifications to obtain this position. Could you tell me if they would have proper qualifications to obtain this position?

I had many applications but, and in account of the distance and above all the absence of the communications with the main land, I lost them all, leaving me hope for better.

Father Belanger in which he nominates Miss Mary Gushieh as Teacher of the Port Hope Indian School. In reply I beg to say that in view of your recommendation, and as it is desirable that the school should be re-opened without further delay, you are hereby authorized to engage Miss Gushieh at a salary of $200.00 per annum. It must be understood that this engagement is temporary; her retention in the position to be dependent upon the success with which she meets in the work.\n\nYou will be good enough to forward monthly reports of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nR. Thorburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Hope, Ont.\nI have the honor to enclose accounts for making school supplies and caretaker also short report of teacher.\n\nIn regard to the remuneration of the teacher of West Bay school the salary is not sufficient to secure comfortably proper substitute teachers to hold back so that we pay their teachers from $400 to $500 per annum in the rural school district, in fact the provincial school regulations according to the assessment, and in any event the salary should not be less than $400.\n\nIn looking over the amounts paid to the present teacher, the September term was not taught in full and it appears that the rate paid for that term was at the rate of $180 per day; the rate of salary was to be $300 per annum. The amount the teacher received was $251.39 that is the teacher is paid $48.61 less than the full amount. I suppose because she did not teach some 20 odd days in September. I would suggest that the work days in which no teacher was employed be deducted from the total and the balance be returned to the teacher. This teacher came to the assistance of the department at a rate of pay that is given to any school that has been $50 per year in the district and to charge back at the rate of $25 per day for the time not taught seems unreasonable. We do not agree to pay her salary because she did not teach.\n\nOttawa\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The separate school inspector visited her school during the fall term shortly after she commenced her duties and his report is favourable.\n\nI think that Miss Cushing might be allowed a present increase of $50.00 with a promise of a further increase to $400.00 provided the next report received from the Inspector is entirely satisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOK Bcl\nOttawa, July 29, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th instant I beg to say that the Department is prepared to grant Miss Cushing, teacher of the West Bay school, an increase in salary from $300.00 to $350.00 from the first of the current quarter and you will be good enough to advise her accordingly.\n\nIt must be remembered that Miss Cushing has no professional training whatever, but should she prove to be an apt and successful teacher the Department would be prepared another year to consider a further increase.\n\nA cheque for $48.61, being the amount withheld from the September quarter, has been sent you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

There does not appear to be any record of Miss Laferriere's appointment nor any information as to her qualifications, experience, etc. Presuming that Miss Laferriere is a regularly certified teacher the Department will make payment of the salary due her for the time she taught during the September quarter at the rate of $400.00 per annum, but the Department cannot decide finally as to the salary to be paid until aware of her qualifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Miss Laferriere further states that on Saturday, May 10th, you were on the reserve, but you did not go to the school nor make any inquiries in reference to the garden work to be done.\n\nThe Department did not receive any communication from you respecting this work and the fact that you did not visit the school at all, although you knew that some action was necessary, shows that you were not much interested in it. The teacher has had to go to the expense of having the work done herself and you must see that vouchers for the expenditure incurred are forwarded without any delay.\n\nThere have been no vouchers forwarded for the caretaking of this school since the June quarter, last. This also should be immediately forwarded for payment.\n\nThe Department must insist on more attention being given to matters pertaining to the schools in your charge.\n\nF. V.

The teacher states that this was promised her last spring, but nothing was done. The Department must insist on its being done without any further delay. She also states that she purchased some fertilizers and that she has not yet been paid for them. The account for these should be forwarded.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to obtain an estimate of the cost of a suitable woodshed and let the Department have a description of the shed.

In this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of May 20th last, in which you were asked to forward vouchers for the fertilizers. It is understood that these accounts were given to you by the teacher and it would appear that they have lacked attention on your part. If all these matters are not promptly attended to serious notice will have to be taken of your neglect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

This will make your salary $450.00 from the first of April, last, less $25.00 which was advanced you; re-payment of this amount will be made by deducting $6.25 from the quarterly payments.

As you are professionally qualified in their employment, Miss Miller might be placed in charge of the East Bay school at a salary of $1500 per annum and Miss Miller might be an assistant teacher at Wawaikong at a salary of $1200 per annum.\n\nWith regard to the employment of Miss Morrell I may say that the Department does not approve of the employment of aliens, but, as you are again located in her case,\n\nRev. J. H. Thomas, B.A.,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe new law allows the South Sea Islander to be considered under the same conditions as those applied to Miss Matilda's engagement at Cape Breton in 1905, which were that she be possessed of the required qualifications and be a British subject. The Department will require Miss Murray at the first available opportunity to take out her naturalization papers and secure a provincial certificate as the same by Miss Murray. Miss Murray will be paid at the rate of $400.00 per month.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 21, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has approved of the appointment of Miss Mary Burke as teacher of the West Bay Indian School and she will be allowed a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

As you will notice by a letter written to you yesterday, we had hopes of sending Miss Zoe St. James, one of the Sisters, to replace Sister Mary Ann.\n\nThe West Bay School has been directed by the Sisters for a long time (since 1701) and we would be very sorry to see them lose that West Bay School they have in there all the provisions for a year, clothes, preserves, meats etc. The Indians would also be disappointed to lose the Sisters. Miss Zoe St. James could leave as soon as you give us authorization. May I propose to you, to have Miss Annie Grimes teach at Wikwemikong, where everything will be so much more comfortable for her, and send over Zoe St. James.\n\nSt. James\nat West Bay. Miss has not yet gone to Wikwemikong, she was to get there only next Monday; and she would not be wanted in the least, if she did not go to Wikwemikong. She would have taken charge of school gladly to oblige and accommodate us. Hoping you will accept our request,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, January 26, 1917.\n\nRev.

You should consult her in this matter and, if she consents, she may take charge as assistant teacher at Wikwemikong and you can appoint Miss St. James as teacher of the West Bay School.\n\nThe salary of Miss Grimes, if she consents to take charge as assistant at Wikwemikong, will be $450.00 a year and you may appoint Miss St. James at this same amount. Kindly inform the Department of the arrangements you have been able to make regarding these teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Rig. A. Papineau, S.J.,\nAsst.

Sir,\n\nThe Indians at West Bay have asked for a change of teacher. They claim that under Miss Fagan, who is at present in charge, their children are not making the same progress as they did under former teachers and they would like a younger and more up-to-date teacher.\n\nThe West Bay School has a large attendance and it is considered that a change should be made there. The Department would be pleased if you could arrange to have Miss Fagan transferred to a smaller school.\n\nThe school at Goulais Bay is now in charge of Miss Agnes Kelly and it is thought that, if she were sent to West Bay, Miss Fagan could be placed in charge of the school at Goulais Bay, which would be a more satisfactory arrangement than the present one.\n\nI should be glad if you would give this letter your early attention and advise the Department of the action you take.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Eus. A.

In answer I beg to say that I will be pleased to give my most prompt and devoted attention to the question of the change of Miss Fagan as teacher of the West Bay School\u2014Miss Fagan has already taken possession of her school. After your approval, she being sent there depends upon the superior at Spanish. I am writing to her instantly and forward her your letter. There may not be accommodation for the two companions at Spanish Bay\u2014Probably the Director of the Teachers, at Spanish, will find one more suitable to the great needs of West Bay School\u2014as soon as an arrangement has been made...? I will be glad to notify you, and obtain your approval.\n\nAUG 27 1918\nIn the mean time, rest assured that I will do my utmost to be worthy of the confidence you place in me, for this settlement.\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nEug A.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. E. A. Papineau, S.J.,\nLittle Current,\nOnt.\nLittle Current, September 25th 1918\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI must beg your pardon for my delay in giving you information concerning the transfer of Miss Hogan, as teacher, on the West Bay Indian Reserve; I was waiting my permission into Charing and Whitfield Lake.\n\nI am sorry to say that after being warned previously there, Miss Hogan, the former of these teachers, has not succeeded in making arrangements for a change. Moreover, after investigation, I find that most of the criticisms against Miss Hogan are unjustly inspired by Miss Henry Conklin, who does not happen to be on good terms with Miss Hogan. I spoke to Chief Michel Roy; he has no complaint against the present teacher, and he declares that the majority of the children are well satisfied with her work. Mr. Thompson, at West Bay, says that Miss Hogan's pupils are progressing very well.\nNotwithstanding all this, Miss Kitty would have been glad to fulfill your desire, merely because you wished so, if I had not been so late. The teachers had already all gone to their distant schools, when that complaint was to the Superintendent.\n\nI earnestly urge you to delay until next year, to make a change. It would be just immensely... you are so kind in telling us about the teachers for your school, that we could not want even to offer resisting you. Your wishes are orders for us, but at present we are greatly embarrassed, and would urge you not to insist. I may add that I expect to have charge of the West Bay Reserve, and I feel confident that I will be able to satisfy the minds \u2014 hopefully yours.\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOntario\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that I have a request under date of Sept 5th, from Miss Rose Faxon, Teacher of West Bay School for $100.00 per year increase in salary, claiming that owing to the increased cost of living she is unable to make ends meet, and I consider that it must be a hardship at the present time to live at her present salary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Indian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 11, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant, in which you state that you have a request from Miss Rose Yasan, teacher of the West Bay Indian School, for an increase of $100.00 in her salary.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to increase Miss Yasan's salary at the present time. She is, however, being granted a bonus of $150.00 for the current fiscal year and a cheque for $75.00, being the amount of the bonus for the June and September quarters, last, will be sent herein a few days. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ.

The text books and studies should conform as closely as possible to those of the separate schools in the neighborhood.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. Russell Hodgson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nExtract from letter received from J. M. Bennett, Inspector of Separate Schools in Northern Ontario, dated Toronto, May 16, 1921. Original no 49585.\n\nPlease note the following. West Bay attendance is the worst I have met with anywhere. As a result no teacher can accomplish much. An enrolled attendance of 31 where 60 should be enrolled is a terrible situation. Of these 31 the average attendance is only around 17. If our reports could be made in triplicate and a copy sent the local Indian Council would it help? Is there any way of getting the Indians themselves to interest themselves in the attendance at school.\n\nP.S. There seems to be some trouble at West Bay. Please note my report. There seems to be a peculiar local element here. They show very little respect for authority. My rule I follow with our own schools when such trouble comes is this, uphold the authority of the teacher. Someone seems to have caused trouble with the last three teachers here.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInspector of Separate Schools\nNorthern Ontario.\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the West Bay Day School\n\nMay 11, 1921.\n\nI am enclosing a letter re complaints.\n\nI intended to enclose a letter but will write a statement here. Miss Fox received a letter from Mr. McGregor, Agent, telling her to carry out the course of study as outlined on back of register. He must have done this as a result of complaints. Naturally I do not disbelieve the teacher, I, as Inspector, can certify that so far as the case of study is concerned she is conscientious and earnest. From my experience at West Bay I judge it to be a place peculiarly disposed to criticise every teacher they have had. This situation is not true of other places. Criticism here, if given encouragement, will lead to more trouble. What is wanted in this situation is to uphold the authority of the teacher. Unless this is done the current trend is always to hear of trouble here. My experience tells me that if all, including inspector, Indian agent and others in authority, will uphold the teacher in all matters and let the Indians here know of it in no uncertain terms, then trouble will subside. Teachers have changed here very frequently just because of this. If the authority of the teacher is not upheld, no matter where, then all authority is gone and respect for authority and obedience with it.\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInsp.\nJune 1, 1921.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMy attention has been drawn to the very poor attendance at the West Bay school, and to a lack of harmony between the Teacher and the Indians.\n\nMr. Bennett, the Separate School Inspector, speaks very highly of the work which Miss Fox is endeavouring to perform among these Indians, but it would appear that some of them are opposed to her, and are not sending their children to school.\n\nThe Indians cannot hope for any progress in their children if they do not send them regularly to school, and it might be well to consider the appointment of a truant officer.\n\nI am writing this letter to ask you to take a personal interest in the matter, and, on the next occasion on which you visit West Bay, to discuss the question of education with the Council, and at the same time you may inform them that if the children are not sent regularly to school, the Department will have to consider enforcing the amendment to the Indian Act, passed at the last session, whereby we are empowered to place children who are not being sent to a day school in the residential schools, without the consent of their parents.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you, after you have had an opportunity of interviewing the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. M. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay,\nOnt.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of last instant, I beg to say that owing to the absence of half of the members of Council of the West Bay band I was unable to get them together for consultation re the school matter; and on 29th instant at a meeting of the whole band I took up the matter and found a very small percentage of them that were opposed to the present teacher, and for reasons that had nothing to do with school matters.\n\nThey are universally opposed to so much time being spent in teaching catechism and religion in the school, but I told them that it was a church school and it would be the same if they were sent to Spanish Industrial school and they finally all agreed to send their children to the day school there.\n\nI would suggest that the question of a Truant Officer be left in abeyance until the end of a full quarter, say at Xmas, and if the attendance is not what it should be action could be taken, in that way they would be left to themselves to make good.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOTTAWA, July 5th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo with reference to the attitude of the Indians of the West Bay Band to the present teacher, and informing the Department as to the results of the meeting which you held with the Indians to discuss this matter.\n\nIt is hoped that, as a result, when the school reopens after the holidays there will be a good and regular attendance, and that it will not be necessary to invoke the Compulsory Regulations and have the children of those parents who refuse to send them to school placed in an Industrial School.\n\nYour suggestion as to the appointment of a truant officer is approved, and this matter may remain in abeyance until the end of the December quarter, when it will then be ascertained whether such an appointment is necessary or not.\n\nI wish to thank you for the personal interest in educational matters taken by you at West Bay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The salary allowed her as teacher at Sheshagaming will be at the same rate as she received while teacher at Sheshagaming, viz., $350 per annum and bonus at the rate of $150 per annum during the present fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Should reports be favourable regarding her work, consideration will then be given to granting her an increase equal to that paid Miss Leusch.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. J. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay,\nOnt.\nOctober 3rd, 1921,\n\nGore Bay,\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of June last, I beg to advise that there are still some of the children at West Bay, who are near enough to the school to attend, who are not in attendance, also some who do not attend regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, Oct. 7th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, recounting the attendance of Indian children at the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it might be advisable to carry out the suggestion contained in official letter of June 1st, last, and consider the appointment of a truant officer. If the services of such an officer were obtained it would, no doubt, greatly assist in the enforcement of a more regular attendance of the children of school age.\n\nI will, therefore, be pleased if you will recommend the name of an Indian whom you consider would be competent to perform the duties of a truant officer, and whether you would advise that such an appointment be made, and if so, the salary to be paid.\n\nIn the case of the worst offenders, arrangements could be made to have the children sent to the Spanish Industrial School, but it is thought that if the services of the right man could be obtained for truant officer it would overcome the difficulty now experienced in obtaining a regular attendance.\n\nAs there has been a change in the teacher at this school, it is hoped that Miss Leusch will be more successful in obtaining the confidence of the Indians and in encouraging them to send their children to school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCove Bay, Ont.\nReferring to your letter of 7th instant, re Truant Officer for West Bay School, I beg to say that when we had one before we found that little was done as he was influenced to do practically nothing, and I don't know of any one that would make a determined effort but the present Constable, Louis Pheasant, and would suggest that he might do this with his own duties for $25.00 per year; but I have not seen him lately to ask him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOTTAWA, October 17th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant regarding the appointment of a truant officer for the West Bay Indian Day School, and suggesting that the services of the constable, Louis Pheasant, be engaged for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say if you consider that the constable would also attend to the duties of truant officer at this school, and will see that the parents send their children to school, the Department will approve of his selection. The salary allowed him for the work will be at the rate of $25.00 per annum. You should take this matter up with the constable, and if he will undertake the duties of truant officer, and it will not interfere with his duties as constable, you may engage his services. You should impress upon him that it is expected that he will perform the duties of truant officer satisfactorily, and will see that all children of school age and in good health attend regularly each day school is open.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you as to whether he accepts the position or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Department is allowing him an extra salary for this work at the rate of $25.00 per annum. The agent suggests that we notify you of his appointment.\n\nI will be pleased if you will inform Louis Pheasant of his appointment and that it is expected that he will carry out his duties as truant officer faithfully. He is to see that all children of school age and in good health attend school regularly each day it is open unless a good and sufficient reason is provided. He should consult you frequently as to the absences and enquire in each case for the reason for such absence.\n\nIt is hoped that as a result of his appointment that there will be a good and regular attendance of all the Indian children of school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

He is to consult her at frequent intervals and see that all children of school age, who are in good health, attend regularly unless a satisfactory reason is given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. R. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received notice of the 26th instant No. 12-4-1 regarding the request for West Bay School.\n\nMr. Pleasant came to me to get the names of those absent from school on the 21st, and returned on the 22nd to tell me that he had seen several of them and that he expected them to be in school the following Monday. Only 2 of 14 names were known. Mr. Pleasant called again Tuesday but none have come.\n\nAs I do not know what instructions he has received from Mr. the Judge, I could not instruct him to bring more than he is. He is supposed to follow the Indian Act - Section 10 and 3?\n\nIf so, he would likely have to give them a written notice before going further.\nI pity the children, for in one case, that of George Curtin's, they are anxious to come to school, but the father is just stubborn... It seems for the past few years most teachers and Indians agree that he was trying to get them and his children back, he will not just let them go that he can do as he likes and that no one can make him do otherwise.\n\nI have not spoken to him at all, so I have no much of a clue that I could not give him the satisfaction of refusing. I would very much like to see him convinced to send his children to school here or have them sent to the Spanish Industrial School. The children are growing up like animals. We do not like further than some of the other families sending their children.\n\nOne father wants to send two children for his two girls. This is only an excuse, but I thought that perhaps arrangements could be made to get closer for those claiming to have none and\nThe price taken out of their interest money. I do not believe in giving them the store free as this would then be a necessity looking for stores & clothing. But if they are to make to understand that the expense of one store is worthless, which they seem well if they have to pay for them from their interest money, they will soon give it up.\n\nI'm attending now to 72 men, all very regular but I would like to see all that should be here come.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nWawa.\nOttawa, November 5, 1921.\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 8th ultimo, referring to the activities of the truant officer on West Bay reserve. I have noted that as an excuse for the non-attendance of the children some parents have given the reason that the children have no shoes. This, of course, cannot be taken as a valid cause for being absent.\n\nThe other matter of George Corbiere demands rather drastic action. A form to be handed to this man by the truant officer is being forwarded, with instructions to Mr. J. R. McGregor, the Indian agent at Gore Bay, and he will give orders to Mr. Pheasant, the truant officer.\n\nI trust, if we make an example of this man, that the attendance at the school will materially increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nsup't. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nTeacher, West Bay Indian Day school,\nExcelsior, Ont.\nOttawa, 8th November, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Miss Elizabeth Lawson, Teacher at the West Bay school, informing us of the continued refusal on the part of George Corbiere to send his children to school. Enclosed you will find a formal notice which you will be good enough to have signed by the Truant Officer and served by him on George Corbiere. After a lapse of three days from the date of the service of said notice the Truant Officer should ascertain whether Mr. Corbiere has complied with said notice, and if he has not the Truant Officer should lay an information before you against Mr. Corbiere charging him with failure to send his child to school after being notified. You will then issue a summons to Mr. Corbiere to appear before you to answer the charge. If the facts of the case it is certain that the children in question are not being sent to school and if so, it in the exceptions set forth in A, B, C, D, E, F of Sub-Section 2 of Section 11 of the Indian Act, the penalties set forth in the section shall be imposed.\n\nThis might have a salutary effect upon other Indians of the West Bay reserve, who are careless about the attendance of their children at the Day School. After this action has been taken, would you be good enough to write the Department informing us of the success that has met with your efforts in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.R.

As the attendance has been scant, I wished to avoid missing a vote or communicating with the President of our Association so as to get a substitute to replace me before I would leave.\nShe arranged to send his wagon who arrived today morning.\n\nI left Saturday morning and met her in Regina at Lake Bay. She had not arrived that evening as I expected, in order to have her husband, but she arrived here by this time.\n\nLast June, when I was teaching at Shilo, coming to school, I was obliged to work for a time of absence to secure treatment for my throat. The Department was kind enough to allow me to continue to draw my salary and from that arrangement to try very reluctantly.\n\nWill it be satisfactory to the Department to allow me to get the same arrange-\n\nment now?\n\nWhen my health insufficiently improved, I have been in my position.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nElizabeth Lewis\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Education, Regina.\nSir,\n\nAfter my personal interview with Mr. Ferrier re illness of Miss E. Leusch, teacher of West Bay School, you will not be surprised to learn that she has had to give up and has furnished a substitute in Miss Rose Fagan, who taught in the same school a couple of years ago.\n\nMiss Leusch would like to still retain the school through her substitute, if it is favorable to the Department, and would send in the reports &c., and possibly she may be able to resume her duties after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, February 17th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant, informing the Department that Miss E. Leusch, teacher of the West Bay Indian Day School, has, on account of illness, given up duties and that Miss Rose Fagan has taken charge as substitute teacher.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a communication has also been received from Miss Leusch informing the Department to the above effect. The Department will approve of the arrangements made with Miss Fagan to carry on the work until the end of the present school year, at least. It may be that Miss Leusch will be able to resume duties after the summer holidays. Salary and bonus will be paid to Miss Leusch, who will arrange to pay Miss Fagan for her services.\n\nThe quarterly returns should be prepared by Miss Fagan, and forwarded to Miss Leusch for signature, in order that we can pay the salary and bonus as above mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ. R. McGregor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nOTTAWA, February 17th, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, informing the Department that on account of ill health you are unable to perform your duties for a time as teacher of the West Bay Indian Day School. In fact you have obtained the services of Miss Anna Fagan to act as substitute during your absence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is regretted that your condition of health has necessitated your relinquishing your duties. It is hoped that the rest from work will be of benefit, and that your health will recover and you will be able to resume duties as teacher in our school service.\n\nThe Department will approve of Miss Fagan carrying on the work. She should prepare the return and forward them to you for signature, and the salary and bonus will be sent you, and you can then arrange for the payment of Miss Fagan. This arrangement is the same as was made with you under similar circumstances when you were teaching the Shingwauk (R.C.) Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Asent McGregor will be informed that leave of absence has been granted you, but the services of Miss Fagan, to act as substitute, are approved, and that the salary and bonus to be sent to you will be arranged for the payment of Miss Fagan.\n\nWe hope that you will be able to resume duties, if not before the end of the present school year, at least, after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nc/o Girls' Industrial School,\nSpanish, Ont.\nI am very sorry that I am obliged again to give up my work for a time. My health has been failing for some months but I thought it would gradually improve again. But lately I saw that it was useless to try to keep on even till the holidays. The doctor tells me that I need a complete rest.\n\nLast week I had a very severe spell and was obliged to go to bed for a month. Mr. McGregor was away so I could not...\nTo Mr. Smith,\n\nI have been informed that you are interested in purchasing a house in our area. We are currently listing a property that may be suitable for your needs.\n\nThe house is located at 123 Main Street and has a total of four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and a large living room. It also features a garage and a fenced yard.\n\nThe current owner is willing to sell the property for $250,000. However, we can negotiate a lower price if you are interested.\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to schedule a viewing of the property.\n\nBest regards,\n\nA. T. McKenzie\nSecretary to the Deputy\nDept. of Landscapes\n12-4-1\n\n68874\n\nApril 27, 1942\n\nI would be most willing to submit a teacher's report for Miss.

We will be very pleased to have you back at West Bay, and hope that by September, if not earlier, you will be restored to good health.\n\nRegarding the cement tank for water storage purposes, in which to collect the water coming from the coves-troughs, I beg to say that I find your communication of the 2nd ultimo received. The Department and this matter was taken up with Mr. Agent McGregor, who requested me to furnish a report as to the best means of having this tank installed, in order to prevent freezing, and also, if made of cement, whether labour could be obtained locally to do the work. We have had no reply from the Agent as yet. It may be difficult to install this tank in order to prevent freezing, but, however, when the Agent's report is received, our School's Branch will deal with this matter. I hope it will be possible to make arrangements to overcome the necessity of carrying the water required for school, laundry and household purposes from the spring, up the steep hill.\n\nRegarding the library books, I would suggest that you forward a list of the books that you consider should be supplied for this purpose. The titles, name of publisher and the name of the firm from whom they can be obtained should be stated, and we will then place the order through the Government Stationery Office here; this is the usual procedure in cases of this kind, and would, I think, save you considerable trouble.\n\nAssuring you of my best wishes for your speedy restoration to health, and with kind regards, I am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Elizabeth Leusch,\nSacred Heart Hospital,\nOughnawaga, P.Q.\nOttawa, August 5, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, informing your resignation, on account of ill health, as teacher at the East Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I am obliged to say that the Department regrets to learn that your health has not sufficiently improved to enable you to again take duties as Teacher of this school. We hope that after a year's rest, you will have entirely recovered and will be able to again enter our service in one of our Indian schools. I may add that your services in the past have been entirely satisfactory.\n\nIt is presumed that Miss Rose Fagan, who has been acting as substitute during your absence, will remain for the next school year. Would you kindly inform us if such is the arrangement that has been made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We hope that you will be able to obtain the services of a competent teacher as substitute during your absence. You should make all arrangements with her regarding payment of salary. The same amount will be allowed as you received, but I prefer that you will still be nominally the teacher and that all cheques be drawn in your favour and sent you. You can then settle with the substitute teacher for her services.\n\nIt is hoped that after the new year you will be able to resume duties, and, if not, the above arrangement could be continued. I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department as to the name of the teacher whom you secure to carry on the work at West Bay, and also furnish particulars regarding the experience, qualifications, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He claims that he had Miss Jessie Fox, who is now at Wikwemikong, dismissed by writing to the Department and claims that he can have the same treatment meted out to Miss Lavallie because she will not spurn his attentions. I am sure that all the influence comes from him. He advised me some time ago to close the school, as Father Papineau did not the children to have an education.\n\nTo me, it seems, as if Miss Lavallie has done good work the best since Miss Joan MacDonald was teacher there, she has good discipline, has large school and the pupils seem to like her, and would recommend that Miss Lavallie be retained, if it is her desire to continue.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 15, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nIn checking up the monthly reports on the schools in your Agency, it is noted that no report has been received from you on your inspection of the Gore Bay Indian Day School since September 1, 1926. We understand that the attendance at this school has fallen off to a large extent, and that, with an enrolment of 48 pupils, the average attendance during the past three months has been about 13.\n\nIt is the duty of the Agent to see that all Indian children of school age and in good health attend regularly, and he should assist the truant officer and the teacher to that end. You will be good enough to inform the Indian parents that it is expected their children will attend regularly. If they do not do so, you should take the necessary action under Sub Sections 2 and 3 of Section 10 of the Indian Act to enforce the attendance. It may be that if an example were made in the case of one or two of the parents, it would have a good effect.\n\nWe understand that the children of George Corbiere have never attended school. If they are in good health, and of school age, you should see that the father sends them to school, or take steps as mentioned above to compel him to do so.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear at a later date that, as a result of your efforts, the attendance at this school has appreciably increased.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. H. McGregor,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAust. Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed that you will allow me to teach during the cold weather. I have heard that the children's parents have no objection whatever. If they prefer it, I shall be glad because I am eager to work with them. I will work towards making it possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\n[Signature]\nOttawa, April 6th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, requesting permission to touch the West Bay Indian Day School during the coming Easter holidays and close earlier in June.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department prefers that the usual holiday period be taken at Easter and that the school be continued in operation until the end of June. As there is but a week's holiday at Easter, it would only entail the school being closed one week earlier in June, and it is not thought that at that period of the year the children would be required to assist with the seeding.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Priscilla Lavallo,\nEngelsior,\nOnt.\nOttawa, April 12th, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department in March, last, drew the attention of the late Agent to the attendance at the West Bay Indian Day School. We understand that the attendance during the present quarter has fallen off to a large extent, and that, when an enrolment of 45 pupils, the average attendance was only about 13. I have to request that you will assist the truant officer and teacher to the fullest possible extent in seeing that all Indian children of school age, and in good health, attend school regularly each day it is open. You should take the earliest opportunity of informing the Indian parents that it is expected their children of school age will attend regularly.\n\nWe understand that the children of George Corbiere have never attended school. If they are in good health, and of school age, you should see that the father sends them to school, and if he refuses to carry out your instructions, you must consider taking the necessary action to compel him to do so under Sub Sections F and J of Section 26 of the Indian Act.\n\nIt is hoped that now the spring weather is approaching there will be a more regular attendance during the balance of the present school year. I shall be pleased to hear later regarding the attendance at this school and what steps, if any, were taken by the truant officer and yourself towards that end.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Jackson, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n12-4-1\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 12th, No. 12-4-1, I might say I have investigated the matter of school attendance. I got a list from the teacher and took the town office with me and made a careful canvass of those who were staying away, and I have got promises from most of them that they will send the children more regularly. In some cases I can readily understand why the children could not attend during the winter months as they live five or six miles from the school, but now that the weather is warming up they will be able to go.\n\nGeorge Corbin has promised me that he will send his children. Mr. Corbin makes the excuse that she has not the money to buy them clothes fit to go to school in. She says they have not had any annuity money for past six years and asked me to write her to see if she could not get $100 off the loan to buy clothes.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJackson\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, reporting the action taken by yourself and the truant officer regarding the attendance of the Indian children at the West Bay Indian Day School. It is noted that the parents have promised that they will send their children more regularly, and it is, therefore, expected that there will be a better attendance during the balance of the school year.\n\nRelative to the request of Mrs. George Corbiere that $10 of the fund in her husband's name be retained in order that clothing to that amount may be bought for her children so that they can attend school, I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding this amount. You should arrange to make the purchase of the necessary clothing, forwarding accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenses. This amount will be paid from this Spring's interest money. Please make the purchase of the clothing as soon as possible in order that this family will have no further excuse for keeping their children at home from school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. W. MacKenzie,\nActing Ass't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. Jackson, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nCore Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, May 18, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, copy of my letter of today's date to the teacher of the West Bay Indian Day School.

Mr. Wm. Jackson, the acting Indian agent, is being informed. I trust that you will be fully recovered in time to re-open school on September first.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

We want a teacher that will teach our children education.\n\nAnother reason why we don't want Miss Elizabeth is that she is too extravagant on our interest money and I demand a very strict teacher.\nOttawa, July 6th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Isaac F. Bobbins, an Indian of the West Bay Band, regarding the school gardens. I shall be pleased if you will state who is conducting the garden at this school, the gardening, if any, that is being done and who receives the crops grown therein.

Lavallee. I should be grateful if you would inform the members of the Band that it is too late to make changes for the beginning of the academic year and that Miss Lavallee will open school on or about the last of September. You should enquire carefully into the reasons for the Indians' dissatisfaction with this worker, and make a full report to the Department, with a recommendation as to what action should be taken. You may tell the members of the Band that you have had these instructions, and inform them that the Department expects a good average attendance as long as Miss Lavallee is in charge of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There are now 66 pupils on the register with a few also in Spanish Residential School, and there are a number of children situated from three to five miles from the present school, which is not a first class building, having been previously enlarged by an addition resulting in a leaking roof that is difficult to prevent.\n\nC.M. Johnston,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 17, 1945.\n\nMr. C. R. Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of\nthe 9th instant, the Department accepts the\nresignation of Miss Mary Whelan as teacher of\nthe West Bay School.\n\nWe are not prepared to approve\nthe transfer to West Bay of Mrs. Paul Petahtegoose.\n\nIf you are aware of any qualified\nCatholic teacher who would like to teach in this\nschool for the coming year, please let me have her\nname and qualifications.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 24th, 1945.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.,\n\nIn your report for the month ended June 30th, you stated that there are sixty-six pupils on the register at the East Bay Day School.\n\nI discussed this situation with Inspector Arnell recently and he recommended that we endeavour to secure another building situated some distance from the present school. Will it be possible to rent a house or other building for the purpose for the academic year 1946-46? We have no funds in the present appropriation for the erection of a new building this year.\n\nPlease give this matter your early consideration and let me know if anything can be done along the lines suggested above. If so, the Department would be prepared to make an endeavour to secure a second teacher for the academic year 1946-46. I also understand from Mr. Arnell that he has discussed this matter with you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nManitowaning, Ontario,\nJuly 20, 1945\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of departmental letter No.12-4-1 dated July 17th accepting the resignation of Miss Mary Whelan as teacher of West Bay School.\n\nThe only suggestion I can offer at the present time for this school is Miss Robichaud, who formerly taught a school at Batchawana. I have been informed the school has been closed at Batchawana and that Miss Robichaud is a very capable teacher. No doubt the Department have her address as I understand she has been with the Department for about twenty years.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, July 26th, 1945.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ont.\n\nYour letter of the 20th instant, with reference to securing the services of Miss Robichaud for the East Bay School has been received. I regret that it is not possible to obtain her as she has already been appointed at another school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nManitowaning, Ontario,\nJuly 30, 1945\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Department letter No.12-4-1 dated July 24th 1945 in regard to securing a temporary building for school purposes on West Bay Reserve.\n\nThe only thing I can find that might serve the purpose, is a large two storey log house situated on Village Lot No.49, and covered by Location Ticket Number 7282 quite close to the present school.\n\nThe building is in poor repair however, and in its present location would not serve the outlying parts of the reserve for which it is actually required.\n\nThere is a small house on Lot 6 Concession 3, covered by Location Ticket No.7096, which could possibly be secured for a teacher's residence. This is about the proper location to best serve the community, if it is considered worth while to move the big house from the village along side, to serve as a class room.\n\nThe flooring and roofing would have to be renewed anyway, and the moving would not involve a great deal of extra expense, as the Indians are very handy at moving log buildings. It should also be sealed up inside, and should have some alterations in the doors and windows to make it suitable for a class room.\n\nI would judge the expense altogether might run to four or five hundred dollars.\n\nIf the building were being moved, I expect we would have to purchase it outright, otherwise we could no doubt rent it. As yet I have not approached the owner, Mrs. Florence Babamash.\n\n[Signature]\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\n\nCRJ / JH\nOttawa, August 3rd, 1946.\n\nMr. C.H. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitouining, Ont.,\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to securing a temporary building to be used as a school on the West Bay Reserve.\n\nIt is noted that you consider that you can secure a large two storey log house and move it from its present location to Lot 8 Concession 3. I understand from your letter that the cost of moving and placing this building in suitable condition would involve an expenditure of $400-$500. Please let me know what it would cost to either purchase this building or rent it.\n\nYou might also let me know what it would cost to rent a house on Lot 8 Concession 3 as a teacher's residence.\n\nI discussed the contents of your letter with the Director, but we would like to have more information before making a final decision.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRETIREMENT FUND APPLICATION FORM\n\nDepartment: Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe Supply Division,\nDepartment of Finance,\nNew Post Office Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDate: August 25, 1943.\n\nRETURN OF THE AMOUNT AT CREDIT OF THE UNDERMENTIONED EMPLOYEE IN THE RETIREMENT FUND IS REQUESTED.\n\nName: Whelan, Mary (Christian names in full)\n\n(In the case of a female employee married while in the service give maiden name also)\n\nEmployed at: West Bay Indian Day School, Exeter, Ont., Paylist No.: 58, Payroll No.: 3876\n\nDate taken on strength this Department: October 1, 1942\n\nDate to be struck off strength this Department: July 1, 1943\n\n(If the employee has had previous service in one or more other departments, please state)\n\nThe final Retirement Fund deduction was made from the salary for the month of June, 1943\n\nAmount $6.25\n\nTotal contributions (if available) $\n\nI hereby certify that no overpayment of any kind to this employee is outstanding except as indicated hereunder:\n\n*Payable as follows:\n1.

Debassige has agreed to rent the house he is living in at the present time for $20.00 per month. It is not as large as the other house, but is newly built and has sleeping quarters overhead. Joe has also agreed to build an addition to the house this fall to serve as living quarters. This house is situated on Lot 9, Concession 4, held under Location Ticket No.7527. It is quite suitably located to accommodate the locality. The only objection being that there is no well on the lot.\n\nThis seems to be the best arrangements I can make for a temporary school, and would accommodate from fifteen to twenty pupils if a teacher can be arranged for. It has occurred to me that Mrs. Isabel Gingras might fit in at this place, if it is decided to accept it.\n\nIt might be possible to secure a separate house on a rental basis for a residence and not have Joe make the addition to his house. In this event the rental would be about $15.00 per month for Joe's house, and possibly ten or twelve dollars per month for the residence.\n\nIf Mrs. Gingras were to get the position, she would want to have her parents with her. A younger single person would be preferable if it is decided to use the combined school and residence.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 28th August, 1945.\n\nMr. C.R. Johnston, Indian Agent, Manitowaning, Ontario,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to securing a temporary building to be used as a second classroom for the West Bay Reserve.\n\nThe Department is prepared to accept the offer of Joe P. Debasage to rent his house for $20.00 per month for the period September 1st, 1945 to June 30th, 1946.\n\nWe are also prepared to accept the services of Mrs. Isabel Gingras but we are not very happy at the suggestion that both her father and mother reside with her. It is our experience in other reserves that when there is an unmarried woman around the teacher's residence trouble usually arises with some Indians. I realize, of course, that Mrs. Gingras' father is an Indian but that does not, as a rule, improve matters.\n\nPlease discuss the matter with Mrs. Gingras and point out the Department's feelings in the matter.\n\nWe are prepared to pay Mrs. Gingras $20.00 per month plus bonus of 17%. As she is an Indian she will not be subject to Income Tax and consequently the amount mentioned will be her net salary with the exception of $4.00 per month which is deducted for superannuation. However, this amount will be repaid to her with interest when she gives up teaching.\nI would be pleased to hear further from you when you have discussed this matter with Mrs. Gingras.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, August 30, 1945,\n\nREMITTED\n\nC.R.

Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer you to your letter of August 24 and my reply of August 28, with reference to securing a teacher for the West Bay School.\n\nWe have not heard anything further from you and I was wondering if Mrs. Gingras was prepared to accept.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we also need a second teacher if we accept the offer made by Jos. P. Debasige. We have been unable to locate any additional teachers within the last two weeks. It is possible that the local Catholic Missionary might be able to find one or two teachers for you. Please communicate with him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nManitowaning, Ontario.\nSeptember 19, 1945\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAs I have no information regarding a teacher for the present school at West Bay, I am at a loss to know what to do about the proposed school in Joe P. Debassige's residence.\n\nMrs. Isobel Gingras is prepared to take this school, and Debassige has the addition to the house well on the way, but is held up for lack of material. He has the frame up, boarded in, some floors laid and roof shingled, and has requested an advance of $100.00 on the rental, to secure doors, windows, and other finishing material.\n\nI would hesitate to have Mrs. Gingras open up the other school, as I am doubtful if she could manage the number of pupils and grades if only one school is available.\n\nI would prefer to have a competent teacher established in the present school first, as we will have to draw on this for supplies to get the second school into operation.\n\nPlease advise at your earliest convenience.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent\n\nCRJ / JH\nOttawa, 22nd September, 1945.\n\nMr. C.R.

If she accepts, you can place her at the residence at West Bay School and engage Mrs. Gingras for the other classroom.\n\nThe matter will have to be held in abeyance for a few days until I hear from the teacher to whom I am writing. As soon as I do, I will communicate with you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 22nd September, 1945.\n\nMiss Margaret MacNulty,\n31 Hall Street,\nRenfrew, Ontario.\n\nDear Miss MacNulty:\n\nAt the present time we have the following vacancies at R.C.

A salary will be allowed at a rate of $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\n(2) Mississauga River Day School - You taught at this school previously; therefore, you are familiar with the conditions which exist there. The salary at this school is also $100.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nPlease let me know as soon as possible if you are willing to accept either of these schools effective 1st October, 1945.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, September 23, 1948.\n\nDear Doctor McCann:\n\nYou telephoned the writer yesterday concerning an appointment for Miss MacNally who was formerly in charge of an Indian School at Golden Lake. On enquiry, I find that his possibility of being paid to September 30th is that she has already been offered her choice of two schools in Northern Ontario which are the only schools presently vacant.\n\nI am writing this note owing to the difficulty of getting in touch with you by telephone.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nThe Honourable James J.

J. Howitt wrote to three school Inspectors of his acquaintance with the same result; they claim to be all short of teachers in their own Inspectorate.\n\nIn your letter of Sept 22nd, I note you were communicating with a teacher and immediately after I received your letter, Mrs Corbiere of Wikwemikong whom I had previously approached about West Bay school has informed me she will go no other teacher can be procured; Mrs Corbiere had previously declined to take West Bay school but expressed her willingness to take a school on her home reserve.\n\nMrs Corbiere was formerly Rita Trudeau and taught the junior room at Wikwemikong with very good success; She also taught Bugwan school for a short time since her marriage.\n\nThe only objection Mrs Corbiere has three small children of her own born in June 1942, January 1944 and January 1945, so that it would be preferable to get an outside teacher if possible, however as a last resort, I would recommend that Mrs Corbiere be given the appointment.\n\nPlease advise at your earliest convenience so that we can prepare to open both schools about November 1st.\n\nMrs Corbiere is willing to take the other school to be opened at Wikwemikong residence at any time.\nJ.

Johnston, Indian Agent,\nManitowaning, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to securing a teacher for the West Bay Indian Day School.\n\nWhen Mrs. Corbiere taught there previously her services were satisfactory, but I do not consider it would be wise, either to Mrs. Corbiere or to our work, to re-engage her at the present time, in view of the fact that she has three young children, one of whom is only a baby.\n\nWe have secured the services of Mr. J. U. Byrne as teacher of this school and he will arrive in Little Current in time to re-open the West Bay School on November 6, 1945. I have given him your name and he will telephone you when he reaches Little Current. I hope you will find it possible to accompany him to the West Bay School.\n\nThere may be a few articles of furniture that he will require and, if so, you may purchase same locally. You should arrange, of course, to have both the school and the teacher's residence cleaned before Mr. Byrne arrives. He will be accompanied by his mother, who is an elderly lady; she will keep house for him.\n\nYou should also engage the services of Mrs. Gingras and have her open the school at Joe Debasage's residence on the same date as Mr. Byrne re-opens the main school, namely, November 6. Owing to present regulations,\nI regret that it is not possible for us to pay rent for Debassige's house in advance.\n\nI enclose two sets of forms.

Have visited some of the parents personally and find some of children are frightened of teacher, who, they claim, is subject to some kind of fits.\"\n\nI think the complaint of the Indians is sufficiently serious to justify your talking to the teacher. I have known the Byrne family for some time and I had no idea that Mr. Byrne was subject to fits. I trust you will find it possible to investigate the complaint thoroughly and let me know.\n\nPhilip Phelps,\nChief, Training Division.\nManitowaning, Ontario.\nJuly End, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nWelfare and Training.\n\nThe necessity and demand for more schools is steadily growing. A new school should be erected at West Bay during the summer. The junior room in Wikwemikong School is very overcrowded, and new day schools are being requested in two other sections of Manitoulin Island Unceded Reserve.\n\nA change of teachers at West Bay Village School is urgently requested. Mr. Byrne is evidently not in good health, and is certainly not adapted to the Indian Schools and children.\n\nWith this one exception, I believe, the present teachers are satisfactory and will return for next term.\n\nC.R. Johnston,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, July 11, 1946.\n\nDear Mr. Byrne:\n\nReports have reached me that you do not enjoy good health, and, as a consequence, it has been suggested that we make an immediate change in the teaching services at the West Bay School for the academic year 1946-47.

In fact, I rather expected him to resign anyway, since he appeared to be rather dissatisfied with the salary etc., however, he has not given any resignation to this office, and I wish to emphasize the desirability and necessity for a change of teacher at this school.\n\nI understand Mrs. Jean Lowe, a young widow woman of Killarney is available if she has not already secured a school elsewhere. This young woman is highly recommended by Inspector Greening, and unless the Department have some one else in view for West Bay, I would recommend an effort be made to engage her immediately.\n\nSince the close of school, Chief Wm. McGregor has requested a change of teacher at Birch Island School on the grounds, the children are not making satisfactory progress.\n\nI am under the impression Inspector Greening is well satisfied with Mrs. Fox, and her only eighth grade pupil passed her entrance this year.\n\nMrs. Fox of course is not a qualified teacher, and has two children of school age, which in addition to the four Polish children attending, makes the class room rather overcrowded, however, unless a qualified teacher is available, I would recommend Mrs. Fox be retained another year.\n\nPlease advise at your earliest convenience regarding a teacher for West Bay Village School.\n\n[Signature]\nO.

H. McVicar\nChief Treasury Officer.\nSir,\n\nLast August I accepted to take charge of the 47 pupils, grades 1-6, at W.A.S.C. I am of the opinion that the school is good and can be improved. It will take about three years to bring this school to normal standard, and it will be very expensive.\n\nThe classrooms are overcrowded and the equipment is far from modern. The pupils are rather good children but they are not interested in English lessons. To me it is a lost battle. The chief complaint told me they \"can't read\" when I gave them a test.\n\nI have been charged with the school. I understand that the number of pupils was about 30 to 35, and grades 1-6, and the salary $25 per month. This seems too low. Would you ask if you could find a better position? As much as possible you would do me great a favour and you would oblige.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n12-6-1 (N.T. 1)\n\nOttawa, 9 January 1947.\n\nMiss J. DesCoteaux,\nP.O.

Johnston,\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to refer to previous correspondence regarding the school situation at West Bay Reserve.\n\nAn official of the Department was to have come the latter part of March to investigate but has never arrived.\n\nAs previously stated, the farm house being rented from Joe P. Debassige is altogether inadequate for that section of the reserve, there being thirty-seven pupils enrolled with about fifty at the Village School and prospects for an increased attendance next term.\n\nMrs. Isabel Gingras, teacher at No. 2 School is desirous of teaching here another term and it would appear a new school will not be available by September 1st. Mr. Debassige would like to have his house next winter but we must open school in the house again in December. I would suggest we continue the rental throughout July and August to avoid moving or storing the school supplies.\n\nMrs. Gingras has had great difficulty in keeping down vermin in the house and if we have to begin another term in this building, we do not wish it to be occupied by anyone else during vacation. I will therefore continue to submit the usual vouchers for rental during July and August.\nAt the Village School, Miss DesCoteaux suggested that part of the living quarters should be converted into a classroom and engage two teachers.\n\nThis would necessitate considerable alterations and although it might serve as an emergency, would not be very satisfactory.\n\nIt would appear that accommodation should be provided at West Bay Reserve for a maximum of one hundred pupils and one graded school may be the solution; however, something should be done immediately to relieve the situation.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.

This school is two hundred yards from the post office at Expositor, Ontario. The nearest railway station is Little Current, Ontario. This is a frame schoolhouse and each room is heated with a stove. The teacher's living quarters are above the school. I understand that Miss Bruyere is handling the lower grades which would mean that you would have approximately twenty-five children to teach in the upper grades.\n\nI would appreciate hearing from you in the near future if you are interested in this position.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard P.

During the past summer we remodelled this building in order to provide a second class room and living accommodation sufficient for two persons. We have a teacher for the junior room and she is still in our employ.\n\nIs there any possible chance of securing a teacher that you think might give good service for the balance of the current academic year?\n\nYou are aware of our salary schedule which provides payment of salary according to qualifications of the teacher concerned.\n\nWe would appreciate very much any assistance that you could give us in the above regard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter No. 19-13-1 (E.1) dated March 9, 1948 with reference to Birch Island and West Bay Bay Schools. I have discussed with Miss Morris the matter of taking the senior room at West Bay Village School when she is able to resume work after her operation and although Miss Morris would not definitely commit herself, I can see that she would prefer not to go to West Bay.\n\nMiss Morris informs me that she should have two operations and if her doctor considers she should not have both at once she will probably have the second operation about six weeks later, so that it would mean there is a great possibility that she may be unable to teach for two or three months, probably the remainder of the term.\n\nWith regard to operating these schools on a summer time basis, I am sure it would not work out satisfactorily in this Agency.\n\nI discussed the matter with Chief William McGregor at Birch Island and he was very much opposed to the idea. Practically all of these people are employed by tourist and berry picking during July and August and I am doubtful if we could get sufficient pupils to warrant keeping the schools open.\nIf it is possible to get teachers, I would suggest one be engaged for West Bay Senior Room as soon as possible and that a new teacher be engaged for the remainder of the term at Birch Island school, unless we can have some assurance that Miss Morris would return on April 26th and complete the term, in which event, I would suggest she might be given one month's leave of absence.\n\nC.

Benson,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nR/H/EM\nOttawa, April 20, 1946.\n\nDear Miss Comeau,\n\nI have received your letter of April 17th with attached application form and references. Our Department is quite willing to accept your services in view of your qualifications and recommendations. At the present time we could offer you a beginning salary of $1,000 a teaching month plus free house, fuel and light.\n\nAt the present time indications are that there will be several vacancies in our Ontario schools. There are only two, however, of which we are certain at this time:\n\n(1) West Bay Indian Day School. This is a two room school situated one half mile from the last Post Office on Manitoulin Island. This is a two room school and I would have charge of the Junior rooms. Plumbing fixtures were installed last fall and the school is connected with a power line. The teacherage is a part of the school and you would share it with Miss Bruyere, the Junior teacher.\n\n(2) High Island Indian Day School. This is a one room school situated seven miles from Whitefish Falls, Ontario. This school has some forty children in attendance. The teacherage is a part of the school and is of frame construction. There is no running water nor hydro.\nI would appreciate hearing from you as to whether you would be interested in either of the above schools. In conclusion, may I add that our teachers' salary schedule is now under revision and it is quite likely that we may be able to offer you a more attractive salary in June.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nDept. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss M.M.

Daley,\nFarrellton, Que.\n\nDear Miss Daley:\n\nYou will recall that I wrote you before concerning employment at one of our Port Arthur schools and advised you that it was unlikely that we would have a school on Manitoulin Island.\n\nHowever, we have today transferred one of our teachers from the East Bay Indian Day School on Manitoulin Island to a school near Cornwall. This leaves a vacancy in the senior room at the East Bay Indian Day School. This is a two-room school and the junior teacher is Miss Bertha Bruyere who lives in Maniwaki, P.Q.\n\nIn view of the fact that she lives near you, I would suggest that you phone her at Maniwaki 93 - Ring 6; as soon as possible and arrange to see her and get all the details available concerning the East Bay School.\n\nI have also offered this school to another teacher but as I have not heard from her I am presuming that she is occupied elsewhere. I would, therefore, ask that you see Miss Bruyere as soon as possible and advise me as to whether you are willing to go to East Bay. Your salary will be at the rate of $115.00 a teaching month.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: West Bay Indian School\n\nI acknowledge receipt of copy of Department Letter No. 19-27-1 (E) addressed to Miss Agnes Ritchie of Montreal who was recommended by Miss Edith Leblanc to take the senior classroom in the above school along with Miss Bruyere.\n\nA Mr. Cameron from Montreal has called by telephone advising that Miss Ritchie has been employed by him as maid for three years, that she has only attained Grade nine and has not attended school since she was fifteen years of age.\n\nUnder these circumstances, I consider it would not be advisable to engage Miss Ritchie as teacher for this school, particularly for the senior room.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.

I have 2 daughters... age 12 and age 9. I am trying my best to keep them in school to get educated but they have to walk 6 miles to school & 5 miles back. That means a walk of 11 miles every day winter & summer.\n\nI wrote to the Indian Agent about this but I don't seem to get no answer from him. There is even thirty pupils going to this school & I find it very odd why there is not some transportation of some kind for the children there.\nis very fine, but I fear we will not send any children to school. If there is not a change made, I think it is up to the Board of Education to see that we get transportation of some kind for our children. If we are forced to keep our children home on account of storms, the Government is on our side, but they don't seem to realize that we are human beings. And don't want to see our children health badly, on account of forcing them to walk too far.\n\nI am kindly sure that the Indian Agent of West Bay and Manitoulin Island looks after this.\n\nYours Truly,\nMrs. Ambrose Pleasant\nEgoscue, P.C.\nWest Bay Ont.,\nManitoulin Island.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI acknowledge receipt of Department Letter No. 444-1 (E.I.) dated October 21, 1948 enclosing a letter received at Ottawa from Mrs. Ambrose Pheasant of West Bay.\n\nMrs. Pheasant has greatly exaggerated the distance from the school. They are less than three miles from the site of the new school which is on the same Lot as the farmhouse where her children are now attending.\n\nThey had somewhat farther to go to the Village School before this school was opened and the new school is as centrally located as possible.\n\nI had discussed with a great many of the settlers the matter of having one larger school in the Village and practically all appeared to be greatly in favour of having a second school built in the vicinity where the new school is located.\n\nThere are several other families that are about the same distance from the school and from whom I have heard no complaints.\n\nMrs. Pheasant's letter is returned herewith as requested.\n\nC. R. Johnston,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency.\nDear Colonel Henry:\n\nAttached please find the petition which is mentioned in my report upon West Bay Indian Bay School No. 2, which report will be reaching you in due course.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLieut-Colonel Bernard J.

It is very pleasing to the Department to have him remark that this school building is superior to a large proportion of the schools that are provided throughout the rural districts for white children.\n\nHe suggests that the boys' and girls' playgrounds be separated by a fence in front of the building, as this will secure among other things more privacy in the closest accommodation. If you consider it advisable you may have the Inspector's suggestion carried out.\n\nHe also advises that a strip should be taken from the eastern end of the playground for gardening purposes, as this ground can be easily spared.

The inside measurement is slightly over 20 feet directly in the centre of the black board space is a bench three and a half feet in width and a door in the left rear corner any plans that may be desired should make provision for black board space.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary of State\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, February 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant enclosing a resolution from the West Bay Council authorizing an expenditure from their funds of a sufficient amount to erect an addition to their school building.\n\nIn reply I have to ask you to be good enough to consult with the teacher and submit a sketch of the addition which they wish put up, showing the disposition of the space. It is presumed that no extra space is required upstairs as such is not mentioned. You should also state how this work is going to be done, as it will only be a small job probably it can be done satisfactorily by day labour, if there are any mechanics available.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Thorburn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nCora Bay, Ont.\nOttawa, February 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter of April 21st, last, in which an expenditure of $12.50 per annum for prizes for the West Bay and Sheshagshening School was authorized, purchases to be made quarterly, I beg to say that the intention was that $6.25 should be spent on each school during the year. The records show that accounts have been received from the Sheshagshening School quarterly since that date for amounts approximating $6.25.\n\nAs the allowance of $6.25 per annum for each of these schools may be a little small the Department has decided to increase it to $10.00 and the teachers may, therefore, expend $2.50 at the end of each quarter for these prizes for distribution. You will be good enough to advise them accordingly and see that the accounts do not exceed this amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. Thomburn, M.O.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nI hereby certify that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\nI hereby certify that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nAgent\nOttawa, 20th May, 1913.\n\nSIR:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith an amount rendered at $58.00 which was submitted by your predecessor in office, Mr. Thorburn from Chief Peter Ane. I have to request that you will kindly state for what purpose the lumber charged for therein was used. You should also quote on the face of the account the authority for expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nFrank V.

Harbin\nWest Bay Coop\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have with kindness found statement of expenses in connection with school timber. Also bill from Mr. McIlwain, foreman.\n\nNow, Mr. Harbin, had two nice little boys and he said he had no use for them as he says he fell the tree because a tree got lodged on it while he was lumbering and was boys, so I told him to put them with the school boys and that would make it \"right\" with him, and also people who want to get their lumber saved here have to clear logs to avoid damage and pile the lumber.\n\nSo you see the reason I put the additional expenses on the lumber.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n[Signature]\nPete A. Coop\nI have the honor to reply to your letter No. 15727-5A under date of May 30th. I am unable to find any letter from the Department authorizing the cutting of said timber. I am informed by Chief Peter ace that said timber was taken out for an addition to have been built at West Bay school this year and that said timber has not been used.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. W. Baxter\nIndian agent\n\nThe best Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nOn Saturday the first of June I drove with Mr. Agent Baxter from Gore Bay to West Bay and visited the school in charge of Miss Laferrier, a lay sister who has had ten years experience in teaching. She had an enrolment of 45, 20 boys and 25 girls. The register is well kept and shows that the pupils are well advanced. The children that I met all understood English and answered questions well.\n\nYou will see from the accompanying snapshot that they have a comfortable school building with teachers' quarters, but a few repairs are needed. The foundation wants pointing; the roof should be attended to as it leaks in one or two places near the chimney; the grounds should be graded up a little higher around the building and drains should be dug to the gully in the rear, which would carry off the water which lies around the building after a heavy rain. The distance from the school to the gully is 94 feet with plenty of fall. Wire windows should be furnished as\nthe mosquitoes and black flies are troublesome. There is no artificial ventilation in the school-room, but a ventilator could be put into the chimney.\n\nMiss Laferriere asked for a flag and I think one should be furnished her.\n\nThe teacher gives instruction in sewing and cooking and she should have some assistance in providing a light mid-day meal for the pupils as it would insure more regular attendance and afford an opportunity of giving practical lessons in cooking.\n\nThere is no caretaker and I would recommend that one be appointed.\n\nThe quarters over the school building proper are in good shape, but the kitchen in the rear might be improved and the pantry adjoining should be sheeted, and as it is only clapboards on the outside and is very cold in the winter.\n\nMiss Laferriere is teaching gardening and has a very nice garden plot well fenced and well kept. It is 215 feet long by 20 broad, divided into 26 separate beds, well stocked with flowers and vegetables, all of which were well up and gave promise of a good yield. Miss Laferriere should be supplied with a watering pail.\n\nThere is space between the side windows in the school-room for blackboards and I would recommend that two hyloplates\nhyloplate boards 9' x 3' be furnished as the two in use are small and well worn.\n\nThe school grounds are well fenced and neat in appearance.\n\nA truant officer should be appointed.\n\nChief Peter Ace brought out a quantity of hardwood which was sawn at the mill for the purpose of flooring the school-room. I think it would be well to use this lumber for the purpose for which it was intended and they should be allowed to put up an implement shed at the back as they have a very good stock of garden tools which will only be destroyed if proper provision is not made for their care.\n\nI was very much pleased with my visit to this reserve and I think that Miss Laferriere is deserving of all encouragement that the Department can give her. She has an assistant who helps her in the care of the household arrangements.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Baxter be asked to send in a detailed report as to what is absolutely necessary to be done to the school at once so that the work might be undertaken during the holidays.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, July 8, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Benson of this Department, who visited the West Bay School in company with you on the 1st ultimo, reports that certain repairs are necessary to make the building thoroughly comfortable for the winter and I would like you to furnish the Department with a detailed report as to what you consider absolutely necessary to be done to this school, with an estimate of the cost.\n\nI would call your attention to the suggested improvements outlined by Mr. Benson in his report, which are the pointing of the foundation, repairs to the roof near the chimney, grading of the grounds around the building and drainage to the rear, wire windows, a ventilator in the chimney and a foul air pipe attached to the stove pipe and placed on a tripod, which would come down to about six inches above the floor near the stove.\n\nYou should make inquiries as to whether the services of a reliable Indian could be assured to act as caretaker and truant officer. Kindly state what you consider would be a fair remuneration for both services.\n\nMr. Benson is of opinion that the kitchen should be improved and the pantry adjoining should be sheeted, so that it will be more comfortable for the winter.\n\nP. V. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nNyloplast blackboards will be ordered for this school.\n\nThe Department is pleased with the manner in which Miss Laferriere is conducting her school and is inclined to make her comfortable. Be good enough to attend to these matters as soon as possible so that the work can be done during the holidays.\n\nAs to the re-flooring of the school-room be good enough to state whether the hardwood flooring which was got out by the Indians is available and, if so, what it would cost to lay it, and whether there are sufficient boards to make a small implement shed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nEstimate of Repair Necessary for West Bay School\n\nLabour & Material for new kitchen $250.00\n4 Bags cement at 60\u00a2 bag 2.40\n100 feet of 4\" drain tile at 6\u00bd\u00a2 foot 6.50\n4 window screens at 50\u00a2 each 2.00\n6 \" \" \" 30\u00a2 \" 1.80\n25 feet of galvanized pipe 1 inch at 20\u00a2/ft 5.00\n3 gallons of paint for fence & Closets at 25\u00a2/gal 6.75\n1 \" \" \" oil at 140 \" 140\n12 days labour for painting & putting up all at 15\u00a2/day 18.00\n50 loads gravel for grounds at 30\u00a2/load 17.00\nTotal $311.35\nThe work could all be done by the Indians and the Chief Peter ace is a good honest fellow and would see that the work was performed in the proper way. I am enclosing the Estimates of the Material & Labour in detail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. W. Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Act Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nI have the honor to reply to Department Letter number 151727/5 under date of July 8th 1912 and would say that I have visited West Bay school in company with Mr. Chief and Councilor and thereby make the following suggestion. First that the present kitchen and pantry which is 12 feet x 22 feet in size be torn down and a new kitchen & pantry 15 feet x 26 feet be built onto the school. The present kitchen is in my estimation too small for the work that Miss Superior is trying to do in regards to the cooking class that she has. The cost of material and labour would be about five hundred and fifty dollars as near as we could estimate.\n\nAs for the grading of the school grounds close to the school I would not recommend that but would recommend filling in around the school with gravel which would take about fifty loads at thirty-five cents a load. The water from the roof of the school on account of our Eau Claire has washed the sand away from the building and I think it would only be lost time and money grading up more sand to the building.\n\nAs to painting the wall and repainting around the chimney I think it would\ntakes about four bags cement at sixty cents a bag and about two days labour at a dollar and fifty cents a day.\n\nI would recommend a tile drain from the cellar out to a distance of one hundred feet; the cost of which would be about fifteen dollars and fifty cents.\n\nI would also recommend ten window screens at a cost of three dollars and eighty cents; also twenty-five feet of foul air pipe and tripod at a cost of five dollars.\n\nAs to the hard wood flooring gotten out by the Indians there is not enough to do the school-room and the present floor is not in very bad condition yet. I would recommend leaving the school floor as it is at present and use the lumber gotten out by the Indians for the new kitchen.\n\nI would also recommend that the fence posts and outside doors be painted which would require about three gallons of paint.\n\nAs to the appointing of a caretaker and steward office the Chief has promised to let me know in a few days who would be a good man for the position and what salary he would accept.\nOttawa, July 27, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant submitting an estimate of the cost of certain needed repairs, etc., at the West Bay School in your agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to have the work as outlined done by the Indians under the direction of the Chief. It will be necessary, however, for you to visit the school once or twice during the time that the work is going on in order to see that it is being properly performed. The vouchers should show in detail the materials purchased with prices; the number of days of labour with rates of wages paid, which should be reasonable.\n\nIn this instance the Department would like to have a resolution of the Council authorizing the necessary expenditure. This resolution may be obtained after the work is completed and the exact amount known. You should, therefore, present the account to them.\n\nYou should be guided by the patronage list in making the purchase of materials for this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nI have the honor to enclose a Resolution passed by the Chief and Councillors and members of West Bay Band requesting the Honorable the Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa to grant them the sum of three hundred and sixty dollars to pay for the new kitchen built for the West Bay Indian School and the leveling of school grounds in accordance with Department Letter number 151727/3 under date of July 27th 1912.

Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe West Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nIndian Agent's Office,\nPort Bay\nMarch 21, 1913\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose the account of fuel and wood supplied to the West Bay Band and our school under authority of Department letter number 13172/65-887, under date of February 1913 amounting to \u00a313.4.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nH.W. Baxter\nIndian Agent\n\nThe cost of fuel is included in the budget of the school.\nSir,\n\nSince two months ago I told Mr. Smith the Indian agent at Pine Bay to get a pipe made to go over the chimney for the kitchen at the school, it was thrown down there. But it seems no man got an answer.\n\nNow there is a cap on the west side of the kitchen and the roof of the school building itself is ten or twelve higher than the roof of the kitchen so when the wind blows from east or south the smoke goes against the cap on school building roof and the stove smokes so bad that the rooms are almost unsmoke now. Kindly inform the agent to get one made so I am sure we need so we have a furnace in this band.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPete Lee\nChief, Pine Bay Band\nOttawa, July 23, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to official letter of April 4th last, in regard to the furnishing of a pipe for the chimney of the kitchen of the West Bay School and to ask you to let the Department know by return mail what action you have taken in this matter.\n\nAs you are aware the teacher of this school is taking the second year's course at the Ontario Agricultural College and the Department wishes to provide every facility for experimental work at this school upon the completion of this course.\n\nThe soil is not very suitable for gardening here and it will be necessary to provide a few loads of black mud to mix with it. The teacher states that this was promised her last spring, but nothing was done. The Department must insist on its being done without any further delay. She also states that she purchased some fertilizers so that she has not yet been paid for them. Please let me know these should be forwarded.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to obtain an estimate of the cost of a suitable woodshed and let the Department have a description of the shed. This must be erected within the next couple of months.\n\nThe teacher also asked for shutters to protect\n\nF. W. Baxter, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGore Bay, Ont.\nthe windows when the school is not in operation and you should at the same time submit an estimate of the cost of these.\n\nThe grounds in front of the building require to be levelled and you should engage an Indian to do this during the holidays.\n\nI have also to ask you to obtain at once an estimate of the cost of sinking a well, obtaining a price per foot for the digging and cribbing.\n\nThese matters in connection with this and the other schools in your agency are considered of supreme importance by the Department and in future more consideration of the interests of the schools and those connected with them will be looked for. In this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of May 20th last, in which you were asked to forward vouchers for the fertilisers. It is understood that these accounts were given to you by the teacher and it would appear that they have lacked attention on your part. If all these matters are not promptly attended to serious notice will have to be taken of your neglect.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nI wish to remind you that the cheque in payment of the term ended June 30th has not yet come, nor the cheques for the items already sent you through the agent, Mr. Baxter.\n\nDuring vacation the West Bay school house was visited by thieves last fall. I do not know the extent of the loss. The money was given me by the West Bay chief, and going back to West Bay at the end of this week. I would be very grateful to see if you could send the cheques at the earliest date. Two weeks ago the agent was notified of the theft of the cheques.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nElida Laferri\u00e8re\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, September 3, 1913.\n\nIndian,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has not received from the Agent the returns of your school for the June quarter. A cheque, however, is being sent you by today's mail.\n\nWith regard to the accounts for which you have not been paid, I would ask you to submit these direct to the Department. If you have paid the accounts send the receipts, when you will be reimbursed. The Department regrets the delay in your having those matters attended to.\n\nOn July 23rd the Department wrote the Agent with regard to a pipe for the chimney, providing black earth for the garden, estimate of the cost of a woodshed, shutters for your windows, levelling of the grounds and the cost of sinking a well, but up to the present time has not heard from him. As you are now at West Bay kindly let the Department know by return mail if you are aware whether any action has been taken by Mr. Baxter in these matters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Clotilde Laferr\u00e8re,\nTeacher,\nWest Bay Indian School,\nExcellence P.O., Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter no. 15727 of the 3rd inst. I thank you for the cheque sent.\n\nWith regard to the accounts not paid, I cannot send you the receipts by this mail as they have been sent to the agent in the following order:\n\nApril 1st. Prize - March quarter $2.50\n\" School care \" $6.00\n\nJune 6th. Slate $1.45\n\" Garden and gymnastics $8.35\n\nJuly 1st. Prize - June quarter $2.50\n\" School care \"\n\nI will try to have duplicates made and will send them, unless the agent is expected to this week submit these accounts himself.\n\nWith regard to the work to be done this fall, the agent came in August and took the measurements of the windows in order to have shutters made.\n\nAnd it is intended a woodshed will be built at a cost of $75. This woodshed also serves as a shelter for the road machine which is under a tree at...\nThe sinking of a well has also been \ndone about the house for the chimney and \nhave put up in May.\n\nYour servant,\nClotilde Laferri\u00e8re\n\nThe Secretary Dept of Indian Affairs\n(Winnipeg)\nTo the Honorable the President of Indian Affairs\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (Cat. No., Volume 6178, File 44538)\n\n[Handwritten note]\n\nThe Board has also requested me to have an interview with Chief and Councilors.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nExtract from report of J. P. Finn, Inspector of Separate Schools, on the West Bay School, dated October 8, 1913. Original on 191727/6.\n\nThis school is very well kept and the teacher deserves every encouragement. But, I believe, someone is neglectful, for the teacher has not received anything since March for money laid out in gardening, prizes and care of school, etc. There is certainly little use in preparing teachers for gardening and agriculture unless they are assisted in preparing the grounds.\nMEMORANDUM,\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nSome time ago your attention was directed to Mr. Agent Baxter's (Gore Bay) inattention to his duties. The quarterly returns for the West Bay and Sheshogwaning Schools have never been forwarded, although placed in his hands at the end of June by the respective teachers. We have had, therefore, to make payment of their salaries without the usual voucher.\n\nAt both these schools there are other urgent matters requiring attention and at both of them also there are outstanding accounts which have not been paid. The teachers of both of these schools out of their meagre salaries have made payments direct for certain supplies and services and have not been reimbursed because Mr. Baxter will not forward the necessary vouchers for the Department to make payment. In the meantime the teachers have been asked to obtain receipts for the payments they have made and forward them direct to the Department so that payment can be made to them.\n\nAt West Bay a woodshed is needed. They have no well.\nwell. Shutters are required for the windows, as the school was broken into both last summer and this summer. The grounds have to be levelled and prepared for gardening operations, as the teacher has taken two courses at the Ontario Agricultural College and wishes to give particular attention to this.\n\nAt Shoeshewaning the teacher paid for wood in the latter part of the winter and has not been reimbursed. Also an Indian named Wilson Samson did small jobs around the school for the teacher, for which she paid and has not been reimbursed. A well is much needed at this school and the grounds have to be fenced and, although the Agent was written to on July 22, last, drawing his attention for the second time to these matters, there has been no reply. The roof of the school building is leaking and the furnace is not working properly. These are matters that should be attended to before the wet and cold weather sets in. In the spring also the teacher of this school sent in a requisition for certain supplies articles of furniture which it is customary for the Department to supply, but this has never been forwarded to the Department.\n\nIt would hardly seem possible to allow matters to go along indefinitely in this way and if the Agent will not attend\nattend to them somebody else should be given authority to have the work done.\n\nA.F. [signature]\nGentlemen,\n\nIn the second week of September I wrote you in answer to your letter 15/727 of Sept. 3rd. We have now the list of the boys due for school, and I send duplicates of invoices under the agent would send the receipts himself as no bills had been addressed to him.\n\nI reminded the agent of these bills and asked of him to forward them without delay. In the end October he told me that all accounts were sent to the Department. I expected all these accounts to be settled with those of September quarter, but as nothing has come yet I think it prudent to complain of it for fear that you would not suffer any such delay were you aware of it.\n\nI am obliged to say as a matter of fact that for the last three months, from Oct. 1st to Nov. 1st during that time the sweeping and the scrubbing had to be paid, as also the house, laundry work and hot soup for children etc.\nThe school prizes have not been paid for the \nsummer longer of time. The receipts for same \nhave all been sent to the Agent along with the \nreport of each quarter.\n\nI trust in that these accounts be settled \nwithout too much delay and oblige,\n\nYour servant,\nCatherine Lapierre\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 19th November, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, in regard to matters connected with the West Bay School; and in reply I beg to say that Inspector Parker, of this Department, will be in Gore Bay during the present week, and it will be well for you to see him in connection with the matters which you have mentioned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Clotilde Laferriere,\nTeacher,\nWest Bay Indian School,\nWaxelton, Ont.\nThe strong wind we had on the 8th instant drifted the snow in the house over the roof, and it has been leaking for two days through the plastered ceiling. So there is no chance to go to the attic, I fear other storms will have the same result without our being able to remove the snow. If you would permit the cutting of a trap door through the ceiling I would have it done\u2014and the opening through which the snow came in repaired.\n\nYour servant,\nClotilde Laferri\u00e8re\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, November 21, 1913.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 15th instant I beg to say that you may have a trap door cut in the ceiling under the roof of the West Bay School so that the necessary repairs may be made to prevent the snow drifting in. You will be good enough to send the account for this work direct to the Department in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst.

I ask him the probable cost of putting in a windmill and piping and storage tank everything complete and he told me he would install the whole system for about two hundred and twenty-five dollars and I think that it is the only way in which to get good water for the school as we cannot get good water drilling for it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.
