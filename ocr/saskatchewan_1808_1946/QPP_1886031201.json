Their claims are not only worthy, but overdue. The officers of the Qapelle Valley Farming Co., and when their claims have been honored, the best interest of the community will be served. It is a great sacrifice to the farmers at this time to give up their claims to those who have been so generous. They have not yet been paid off.\n\nThe Barn Farm has not been treated justly in its requests. We shall see who will really benefit from this scheme. Will it be fair? Will it be just? Will it be practical?\n\nLooking forward to a brighter future, we must stand together and defend the cause of the much abused Indian.

Two charters are now asked for from Parliament, one calling for a railway in this place. One is called the Brandon and Hudson's Bay and Edmonton Railway Company, and the other is the removal of the Northwest Central.\n\nThe last number of the Winnipeg Chamber says: \"The Rapid City Standard has just been published. The best thing now doing about the Editor did not know what it was writing about. The Standard was published in 1883, and has since appeared under- rapidly. Will the Commercial please correct?\"\n\nIt would seem as if the North-West Central Railway Co., were in earnest about building a portion of their road this year. Their act of incorporation declares that they should build fifty miles in 1885, and seventy miles each succeeding year till completed. Mr. Jas. Austin, of the North-West Central, Co., has introduced an Act in the Dominion Parliament to extend the charter for another twenty-five miles. That means that the Co. will be able to build 120 miles this year. If the work is done as construction goes on, it is reasonable to think that the Co. would make good its claim for renewal of their charter for one year only, unless they intended to go on.\n\nOn Feb. 27th meeting was held at the Queen's hotel for the purpose of organizing a Liberal Conservative Association. Mr. S. D. Currie was appointed Chairman, and motions and by-laws for the government of the association were read, adopted and sent to those places. The following members were elected officers for the ensuing year: President, Alfred Ross; Vice-President, G. L. Stone; Secretary-Treasurer, Thomas Huggett. Executive Committee: Messrs. M. T. Ford, W. Hooper George Humber, Jas. Burland, Miss. Grammitz, Tom Huckle.\n\nMr. Currie, in his address, gave short addresses thanking the members for the honour done them, urging upon them the duty of cooperation and organization, and reviewing the policy of the Conservative Government as being progressive and to the very best interests of the country.\n\nVick's Floral Guide for 1886, the pioneer seed annual of America, comes out this year in a booklet, not a dry list of hard botanical names, but over thirty pages of illustrations and descriptions of articles on Roses, House Plants, Cheap Greenhouses, Onion Culture, Muscari and Manure, Flower Gardening, and very interesting and charming, followed by about 150 pages containing illustrations of everything the heart could desire in the line of Seeds, Plants, Bulbs, Potatoes, etc., &c., &c. It is a book easy to afford to publish, and really give away this beautiful work for only 20\u00a2. It will be found, with hundreds of illustrations and two fine Colored Plates, all enclosed in an elegant cover, that the purchaser of this guide cannot do better than send him 10 cents for the Floral Guide, to James Vick, P.O. Box 409, Rochester, N. Y. Deduct the 10 cents. Order first order sent for seeds.\n\nCONSUMPTION CURED.\n\nAct 41 of the Victorian laws, from practical having had placed in the hands of the Indian missionary the formula of a simple vegetable remedy for the specific consumption of man and beast. With the aid of this formula, Mr. J. A. Jackson, late of Perth, Australia, and all absent and long afflicted with pulmonary consumption, Nervous debility and all forms of Nervous complaints, after having tested its wonderful curative qualities on himself, was enabled to bring it known to the suffering fellow-men. Assailed by this malady and unable to stand the tortures of consumption, he took up this formula, and by constant use of it, he was enabled to change, in all who knew him, this disease into health, strength and vigour.

The beautiful display of fireworks and pyrotechnic effects between General Middleton and Powdermaker, painted by Capt. Ruthven, who certainly displayed his claim as a powderhouse manufacturer in a very handsome manner. The first act, \"Sweet as a cucumber,\" was exceedingly well done and displayed the acting talent of the company. Miss Eliza Short acted \"Florine,\" who had been sent abroad by her father to overcome her lovesickness. Her coquettishness was amazing under the situations presented. Capt. Ruthven took the part of \"Old Barkins\" and acted it most effectively. \"Phoenix\" came into prominence; however, early rated highly by the spectators. The second act again displayed the acting talent of the company in an enjoyable manner.\nST.

When Mr. Pope rose to reply to our toast, it was impossible to make a speech. However I hope that you will allow me to express my satisfaction throughout, the memory of your enthusiasm, and to offer to Major Short Maguire, Esq., Brevet Lieut., for his admirable skill and pains which he displayed in the management of his business. I think it is desirable that this should be done, both for the loss of reputations for the valuable assistance given to the Institution at its maturity, and for the kind co-operation which you have shown through your unwearied interest and constant attention to the affairs for which your presence made the whole half.
