Begley, who is an honest, kind and able officer, and the same may be said of all under his command. Each second mate was paid for each day's work, so that he made all the passengers on board feel happy and contented.\n\nThere were nine passengers on board as far as the Rapids, where there were added to our number by the arrival of the North-West Mounted Police, the following: Among the passengers we noticed the Hon. L. Clarke, M.P., Mr. Grey of London, Ontario, and his wife; Mr. Tomlin, of Winnipeg, and eldest son of Hon. Mr. Jordan Clarke of Hudson, Quebec, who had been residing for some time at Victoria; also Mr. Robert B. Hallett, who had made the journey to Battleford in four days by a skillful pilot, with but a loss of big steers, who knew every rock and every bend which hereafter they might overtake him. Nothing can be more interesting than to voyage down the Saskatchewan beyond these confluences that are common on waterways. We had not as yet seen any feature on board until we reached Grand Rapids, so they were transferred to the Arctic Storehouse, and the Marquis had also to pass.\n\nAfter having our midday dinner after all the usual formalities, nothing of interest took place until we reached the Rapids. Silver River opposite Fort Qu'Appelle. Every eye was anxious to catch a glimpse of the famous beacon. The weather was very cool and pleasant, perhaps taking his meaning in the evening. A fire was kindled on the deck, and the shelter of the cabin. The Captain, who is a \"dead shot,\" began firing at the duffers, which, got up on a log, and danced round the cabin. On a repetition of the experiment, we jumped from our seats in silent submission to the laws of nature. Our daring fellow boatsmen soon fell into a state of repose.\n\nWe succeeded in getting off in good order, and satisfied with the first exposure. The Prime Minister performed the usual ceremony or send him over to his home.\n\nAbout 9 p.m., we tied up for the night in the middle of Coal Rapids, where we landed and went on horseback. We passed the Main Lakes and returned by the Bay to Prince Albert. If we think of our short experience, it was very exciting and would fill the pages of the most interesting chronicle. We fell into overwrought enthusiasm when the thought struck us that we were now on board a steamer. Day after day passed away waiting for a change to get back on land.\n\nSaturday proved a clear and beautiful day, with a brisk breeze through every cabin and delightful. The first order of the day was breakfast, and the remaining ones followed alike as to the joyful sound that all was ready. On this occasion we were treated to beef steak, scones, tea and coffee. We could say whether it was prepared in a refiner's or a furnace. Our antagonist was easily convinced, and he gave up without a challenge. We got back to Portage La Prairie by last mail.\n\nWe are now prepared to sell Furniture cheaper than ever offered in Prince Albert.
