Lawrence Clarke left for Winnipeg yesterday.\n\nMr. Butchart will shortly leave here on a visit to Ontario.\n\nMr. J. L. Reid, D. L. S., has purchased a farm near R. R. Keith & Co., and advertises in another column.\n\nMr. Hugh McDougall is expected to return today.\n\nMr. Riggs will be here next Wednesday to bring up supplies for Moore & Macdonald.\n\nAmongst the many excellent speeches delivered at the banquet, given by Mr. Clarke on Tuesday last, was one from Mr. John McNaughton, gardener. Mr. McNaughton had been here for some years in Manitoba before coming to Prince Albert. He recounted interesting experiences to do with the history of the Red River rebellions, and also with the early history of this town, and as he does not often speak in public we deem it not out of place to give particular mention of his effort.\n\nLest Fear\u2014We hope that our ladies, young and old, interested in the future here, have not forgotten that this is but a temporary situation that they are exercising the privileges which the year confers upon them. Leap-year surprise parties are quite the thing nowadays, and we would suggest that they make good use of their liberty by gathering together in a warmer climate, but down East, in which the position of the sexes is reversed, and the males are put into the ring and round and pick up the young women and select their partners after a hearty hand shake.

The last I saw of him was on board the steamer Lake Winnipeg going to September 3rd and having been separated from it at Cobville during the time it had visited knobbies about seven leagues from Wapusk. It remained placidly there until it finally turned up here, O.K.\n\nThings get mixed, and missing very much.\n\n**Secretary\u2019s Address.**\n\nThe Secretary acknowledges with thanks the remarks made by Mr. Jones from Mr. Poveshell Howard of Edmonton, of the papers from the club, and other kind papers from kind, unknown friends, and expresses a hearty thank you. A large departure was taken from the usual course; the ordinary club list only had regular reports to be presented; the Queen\u2019s message was read by Mr. Smith, who has been so useful to the successful career of Mr. Smith. Mr. Smith has returned to his post at his high position on Chief Justice, and has been most liberal in all public objects, and has expressed himself very highly in saying that in honoring his guest to his proper banquet, the citizens of Prince Albert were present. Mr. Smith, in responding, expressed the feeling of the Club as being expressed upon him by being tendered this honour. We regret that want of space prevented the Secretary from making a speech, in which he reviewed the progress of the Club; but he spoke very happily, and especially dwelt upon the importance of the proposed Hudson Bay Railway. He expressed the hope that it would be completed, and that the land would be opened up, and that the Dominion Government would see fit to take up the question of the North West. He expressed the hope that the Club would continue to prosper, and especially dwell upon the importance of the proposed Hudson Bay Railway.

Hist.\nCOMMUNICATIONS.\n\nNORTH WEST REPRESENTATION.\n\nThe Editor of the Times,\n\nSir,\n\nAt the meeting called by our member, Mr. Macdonald, we had the privilege of addressing the House of Commons in regard to the question of representation for Canada West. We have been well pleased with the manner in which the debate has been conducted. We believe there is nothing like making an effort, and in the first place we want a telegraph office in every town in Canada West. We want something like looking for sheep, but we want them to be moved to some convenient site; we want the sheep taken care of, and the sheepmen paid. We want patents issued immediately; we want them (sheep) to be so much less as to make them profitable to the sheepmen across Canada, and an equal amount as a compensation; we want the navigation of the lakes opened up. We believe that if the Government can give us the Hudson Bay Railway, so as to make a market for our cattle, and if they will take the trouble to examine the reports of the P.E.R., we can put our hands on the resources of the province, and the result will be evidently prosperous.\n\nThe arguments presented by the Prime Minister are worthy of the attention of all who desire peace and prosperity for Manitoba and the North West. If these arguments do not prove to be important and therefore worthy of expenditure, we shall be obliged to say that we must rely upon the government for our future.\n\nIn conclusion, we will give a third argument on the question of education and the school system. We should be glad to see the government take this question into their own hands, which may properly concern the future prosperity of the province. We believe the North West Council had in view in having the ordinance passed and circulars distributed, the question of the administration of the schools, and the publication of the school law last week was our main object. We believe that the people from the North West ought to have any other interest placed in this discussion, than the subject of the education of our children, where we are sure in Prince Albert, and we desire to write upon it. We believe that the public's views on the subject should be heard.\n\nIn the case of Parliament, the one of the most important matters now before the people of Canada is the question of the administration of the schools. We believe that the people of Canada should be interested in this question, and that the government should take steps to provide for the education of our children, where we are sure in Prince Albert, and we desire to write upon it. We believe that the public's views on the subject should be heard.\n\nPLAIN SPEAKING.\n\nAn Ontario paper remarks in reference to the agitation in the North West:\n\n\"The early settlers in Ontario met many difficulties, and the difficulties are still greater today. The people of Ontario are not willing to be governed by the government of the North West, and they are not willing to be governed by the government of the North West. They are not willing to be governed by the government of the North West, and they are not willing to be governed by the government of the North West.\"\n\nA judge, or postmaster, that a trader indebted to him for the sum of two hundred dollars, is entitled to a writ of attachment addressed to the guardian of the estate which is possessed, in trust, of the estate which is required forthwith to be sold.

An immense mass meeting was held in the opera house in Winnipeg on the 1st Feb., presided over by Mayor Logan, at which speeches were made by Mr. Duncan Macarthur and other leading men, and resolutions passed in favor of the project.\n\n1st resolution\u2014Moved by Mr. Duncan Macarthur, seconded by Mr. Fonseca and supported by Mr. B. D. B. Taylor.\n\n\"This meeting hereby expresses its hearty sympathy with the building of a railway to some point on the Hudson Bay, and regards the early construction of the same as essential to the development of all the territories west of Manitoba and the North West.\"\n\n2nd resolution\u2014Moved by David Glass, Q. C., seconded by Mr. William Bingham and supported by Mr. Moyne Daly.\n\n\"Resolved, That this meeting take this opportunity of expressing its opinion that encouragement and support should be given to any scheme to build a railway from Winnipeg to the coast, by taking the same course adopted by the Government of Canada in such a way as to prevent the road from falling into the hands of any private railway company or other corporation.\"\n\n3rd resolution\u2014Moved by Mr. Kenneth McKenzie, President of Board of Trade, seconded by A. C. Kinloch M. P., F. P., and supported by Captain Macdonald.\n\n\"That the Hudson's Straits and Bay have been successfully navigated for the last 27 years, and that the navigation has no doubt been rendered more easy and safe, can be successfully carried on in the future, and that the iron steamers now generally used in the navigation of the Straits and Bay for a period at least as extended as the navigation of the St. Lawrence, if a better route to Europe, via Liverpool, can be found, should be made as successful, and in as short a time, as that from Montreal or New York to Liverpool.\"\n\n4th resolution\u2014Moved by ex-Attorney-General Clarke, seconded by Mr. William Clarke, supported by Mr. Luxton and Hon. C. P. Brown.\n\n\"That in the opinion of this meeting the most important question at the present juncture is the question of a railway to Hudson's Bay, the extension of our boundaries to the Arctic Ocean, parallel of ninety-north, and further north, this meeting expresses its hearty sympathy with the efforts to that direction now being made by the Hon. Mr. Neepawa at Ottawa.\"\n\nNAVAL HISTORY OF HUDDSON'S BAY.\n\nSir,\u2014At present, when anything bearing on the feasibility of the navigation of Hudson's Bay is of interest, I may mention a case which took place back in 1879, between Captain Macdonald, an iron steamer Polyphemus, and myself, while crossing the Atlantic. He says that the man who brought out the locusts of the Atlantic, which have since been used by the Hudson's Bay Company in the carrying of the North West, that he believed ultimately the Hudson's Bay route would be the greatest route in the world, and that it was possible to navigate it, and be bound to find as good as Quebec, and that the ice after leaving Davis Strait turns back, so that from the mouth of Labrador, the course to Cape Farewell would be so smooth that it would take vessels of any size to navigate it, and that there was nothing in running for the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The opinion of such a practical seaman as Captain Macdonald would be worth more to carry weight with it.\u2014Wishing Free Press.\n\nTelegraph.\n\nWe have made arrangements with a company near us in Winnipeg to send us on a weekly budget of telegraphic news suitable to our readers.
