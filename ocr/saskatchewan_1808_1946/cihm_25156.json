G. C. M. G., Governor General of Canada.\n\nTo the Honorable The Senate of the Dominion of Canada, in Parliament assembled.\n\nTo the Honorable The House of Commons of the Dominion of Canada, in Parliament assembled.\n\nPRAYING THAT THE BILL RELATING TO THE NORTHERN RAILWAY OF CANADA MAY BE REJECTED.\n\nBELL & Co., Printers, 13 Adelaide St. East, Toronto.\nI.\u2014Petition of the Bondholders of the Northern Railway Company of Canada.\n\nTo the HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS of the DOMINION OF CANADA in PARLIAMENT ASSEMBLED.\n\nThe Petition of the undersigned Bondholders of the Northern Railway Company of Canada.\n\nHUMBLY SHEWETH\n\nThat your Petitioners have observed with much concern a notice in the \"Canada Gazette\" that application will be made to the Dominion Parliament to introduce a Bill to amend the Act respecting the Northern Railway of Canada, passed in the Session of 1877, so as to enable the private Shareholders of the said Company to elect from amongst themselves three Directors on the Board in the place of one, as now provided by Section Twelve of the said Act.\nYour Petitioners would humbly represent that the Capital required to reorganize and keep open the Northern Railway when it was about being closed in 1859, was provided by means of the issue of Bonds, the Share Capital being then considered as nearly worthless, and the owners thereof declining to make the further advances necessary to reinstate the concern.\n\nThat, as an inducement to, and condition of, raising the required Capital, it was provided that the holders of the Bonds should have a power and control in proportion to the amount of their subscriptions, the right being reserved to the Corporations of Toronto and Simcoe, who had subscribed stock, to be represented each by a Director.\n\nThat afterwards, when further additional Capital was required to be raised, the same right of representation was guaranteed to the Bondholders, and that right was throughout retained as an essential condition of the subscriptions.\n\nThat finally, by the Act of 1877, which authorized the issue of \u00a3850,000 of First Mortgage Bonds, partly to pay off the Government lien and partly to meet other pressing demands on the Company, it was expressly settled with the concurrence of all parties interested, and was embodied in the Act (Section Twelve), \"that the private Shareholders in the Company should no longer be entitled to vote with the Bondholders at the election of Directors, but might thereafter, by their exclusive vote, elect from amongst themselves one out of the ten Directors then chosen by the joint vote\" of themselves and the Bondholders, and the Bondholders should elect the other nine by their exclusive votes; the two Corporations of Toronto and Simcoe continuing nevertheless to nominate each one Director as theretofore so long as such Corporations continue to be Shareholders in the Company.\n\nThat on the faith of the foregoing provisions, and the various Acts of Parliament embodying the like conditions, your Petitioners have purchased, acquired, and now own Bonds of the Northern Railway Company of different descriptions, especially those issued under the Act of 1877.\n\nAnd that they would regard it as a violation of a most important and essential guarantee if the constitution of the Board\nwere to be in any way altered, or the conditions of the Act of 1877 departed from.\n\nYour Petitioners would further represent that in order to extend and improve the Railway, and give the additional facilities to the localities through which it runs, large advances have been made in England, and they are aware that the creditors, in lending their money, relied on the control which the Bondholders through their Directors might exercise over the administration of the Company's affairs.\n\nThat although they claimed to retain the power of administration to which the faith of the Canadian Parliament is pledged, your Petitioners have always been solicitous that the affairs of the Company should be managed so as to meet the legitimate requirements and convenience of the public in Canada, and as a proof of this they can point to the names of gentlemen of the highest standing as to business capacity and position in Toronto who have from time to time been selected as Members of the Board, and to the fact that no complaints have been made against the manner in which the public interest and convenience have been served in Canada.\n\nYour Petitioners would further point to the accounts of past years and to the financial position of the Company to show that the parties chiefly interested in the Railway are the Bondholders. The bonded debt of the Company amounts to \u00a31,233,90c beyond its floating engagements, while the private share capital (not including that of the Municipalities, amounting to about \u00a378,000, which is specially represented), is only about \u00a385,000.\n\nThe demand now put forward by the private Shareholders is in direct violation of the understanding arrived at during the Session of 1877 (which was embodied in the aforesaid Act.) And your Petitioners cannot for a moment believe that it will be entertained by Parliament.\n\nYour Petitioners would finally beg to call attention to the fact that a considerable part of the money raised under the Act of 1877 was received by the Government in liquidation of its claims as stated in that Act, and that many of your\nPetitioners subscribed this money on the faith that the conditions of the Act as to representation would be adhered to.\n\nYour Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honorable House will be pleased to reject any Bill which may be introduced in accordance with the notice above referred to.\n\nAnd your Petitioners will ever pray, &c.\n\nW.

The Government of Canada and the Shareholders at that time invited subscriptions of new capital to make the necessary outlay to work and improve the road, and from time to time as further capital was required the like condition of adequate representation of the Bondholders on the Board has been adhered to and sanctioned by Parliament.\n\nAt the same time your Petitioners would represent that it has always been their earnest and sincere desire to meet the legitimate requirements of the district through which the road runs, to work it in harmony with Canadian interests, and also to construct new branches to meet the growing wants of the district.\nTo that end they have at all times sought to obtain as representatives on the Board in Canada gentlemen who would give effect to this policy.\n\nYour Petitioners further represent, that in order to carry out these objects, they have from time to time had to obtain large advances of money, and also to issue loans to the English public, and they are aware that the representation of the Bondholders, as defined by Parliament, was at all times regarded as a most important condition by subscribers and creditors, and your Petitioners especially point out that under the Act of 1877 it was after much discussion settled that the private Shareholders should have the right to elect one Representative on the Board from their own number, and no more, the City of Toronto, and the County of Simcoe, continuing to be represented as before.\n\nYour Petitioners further represent that the bonded and other debt of the Company amounts in round figures to about \u00a31,320,000, while the private Shareholders' amount to about \u00a3163,000.\n\nThat the proposal now made that the private Shareholders should elect three Directors on the Board would altogether violate the equilibrium as regards the Bondholders' representation.\n\nThat while your Petitioners would refer to the condition of the Company to show that the Shareholders have more than an ample representation for any present or prospective value which can attach to the Share Capital, they cannot too strongly represent that the change now proposed would be regarded by your Petitioners, and by the Subscribers to the different loans, and by the Creditors of the Company in England, as a distinct violation of the condition on which their money was obtained, and they believe it would in every way have a most injurious effect as destroying confidence in the efficacy of safeguards deliberately provided by Parliament.\n\nYour Petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honorable House will be pleased to reject any Bill which may be introduced in accordance with the notice above referred to.\n\nAnd your Petitioners will ever pray, &c.\nTHE SCHEDULE

That the petition for the Bill has been presented without the knowledge or consent of the Company, and without any measure having been taken to ascertain the opinion of the Company thereupon.\n\n2. That the existing capital of the Company (almost exclusively of foreign subscription) has been raised under the pledge and security of successive enactments of the Parliament of Canada, especially providing for the exercise of the franchise by holders of the Company's Debentures, and that in the absence of the security of such franchise the said capital could not have been raised.\n\n3. That by Act 23 Vic., chap. 105, sec. 135, May 12, 1859, authority was given to raise \u00a3250,000 sterling, under the special provision \"that\" all holders of the first and second preference\nbonds then authorized should be entitled to vote in the same proportion as the holders of the Stock.\n\n4. That by Act 31 Vic., chap. 86, sec. 10, 22nd May, 1868, it was again enacted that all holders of an issue of third preference bonds thereby authorized, to the extent of \u00a3150,000 sterling, should be invested with a similar right to vote at all meetings of the Company, including the election of Directors.\n\n5. That by Act 40 Vic., chap. 57, sec. 3, 28th April, 1877, it was again enacted that in regard to an issue of \u00a3850,000 sterling of five per cent. first mortgage bonds, all the holders thereof should be entitled to vote as aforesaid, excepting that in addition to two Directors representing Municipal Stock holdings, one Director should be elected by a separate vote of the Shareholders from amongst themselves.\n\n6. That as a matter of fact the seats at the Canadian Board, which are filled by the vote of the Bondholders, are at present, and have been for very many years, occupied exclusively by Shareholders qualified to serve as Directors, as Stockholders, and not as Bondholders.\n\nYour petitioners therefore humbly submit, that the Parliament of Canada has been pledged by repeated enactments since 1859 to secure to the investors of all the capital of the Company since raised in England a stated and definite participation in the organization and administration of the affairs of the Company, and your petitioners humbly protest that the Bill now presented to your Honorable House would be repugnant to the spirit and letter of past enactments, subversive of the rights thus created, and contrary to the just principles upon which the Parliament of Canada has heretofore held sacred the pledges of its laws.\n\nAnd your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the said Bill may not be passed into law, but may be dismissed.\n\nAnd your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.\n\n(Signed) FRANK SMITH,\nPresident.\n\n(Signed) FRED.
