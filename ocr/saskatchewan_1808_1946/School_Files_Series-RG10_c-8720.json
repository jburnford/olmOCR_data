The cost of these batteries amounted to $1,319.00.\n\nWhile certain funds were provided for expenditures at the Joussard Indian Residential School this year, the Department understands that you have already made arrangements to expend the money provided.\n\nRecently, we have been obliged to incur some very heavy expenditures at other residential schools for which no special provision was available; consequently, the amount in this year's appropriation for unforeseen expenses has been practically all assigned.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the Department finds it extremely difficult to see its way clear to supply batteries to the Joussard School at an approximate cost of $1,300. Would it be possible to make the present batteries last for another year or, failing this, would one set of 56 cells be sufficient for this year and a similar set could be supplied next year.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

I am sorry to say that this very day the Principal came here for the very purpose of telling me that their light was red due to the fact that the Batteries were exhausted. He entreated me to write without delay. The suggestion was made to take this year a single set of Batteries, viz 56 and next year another 56 could be added. I regret to say that the Engineer from Bruce Robinson Limited who supplied the Batteries in Grouard consider that batteries should be installed immediately and no set added later. In view of that fact, I would suggest the Department to supply one set this year (Iron clad) and I will borrow sufficient money to pay for the other set, said amount to be reimbursed me next year out of 1967-68 appropriation.\n\nI hope my suggestion will prove acceptable and will be treated accordingly.\n\nWith anticipated thanks I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n*Ottawa, September 4, 1936.*\n\n**SHIP TO**\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Joussard Indian Residential School was the object of an attempt to destroy it by fire by one of the pupils on the 24th. At 3:00 P.M. Jos. Morin, aged 15 and orphan, placed birch bark and kindlings within the wall of the West Porch, behind an electric three-knife open switch and put a match to the bark; two or three other boys were watching him. They all scattered after the bark was ignited, Morin going to the dairy barn to help the men milking the cows. One of the others went by the front entrance and gained entrance to the sisters' store-room and stole an assortment of candies.\n\nThe fire was discovered by the sister Assistant-Superior who ran promptly to the main switch to cut off the electric current and returned to extinguish the blaze with basins of water obtained from the near-by laundry. A chemical extinguisher was also used, its spray being directed inside the partition. The damages were negligible and were confined to a flame-scorched wall in the porch.\n\nFor some time the cause of the blaze was assessed to a defective electric switch. But after the supper the sisters had found some evidence that this fire was the work of a pupil and that it was premeditated. For instance one girl declared that a boy told her a few days before that he had the idea that the school would burn \"Wednesday or Thursday but not later than Sunday\" and asked how they (the girls) would like this opportunity to go home. He said he had had a dream. It was also found in the girls' dormitory that they had made neat parcels of the toys given them at Christmas and everything did look as if they were making ready to go to their parents and relatives soon; just in the same manner as they prepare for the summer holidays.\n\nPiecing all this together they made a thorough investigation with the assistance of the Principal and soon found out that this fire was started by a criminal hand. The evidence secured led to pupil Jos. Morin as the perpetrator and he readily admitted his guilt.\n\nThis boy, Jos. Morin, had been in that school for nine years. The Reverend Principal had in his great confidence. He is of little better than average intelligence and unlike other boys of his age, he had very little liking for play and for sport; during dallying recesses he would invariably go to the principal or to the man in charge of shop or barn work to ask them to give him work. He was helping to the full extent of his ability. In view of his good disposition the Principal had provided him with some woodworking tools and had asked the Engineer to teach him the rudiments of Carpentry and light shop work. The Engineer was eminently satisfied of his progress as well as were all others with whom he came in contact with.\n\nThis boy is paid annuity under the late Chief Kinnosayo's t cket No.1 of Driftpile Band. His ancestry is rather obscure. It is thought that he came to be adopted by an Indian family through the Child's Welfare Branch of the Provincial Department of Public Health.\nDiscussing the question of a fitting punishment for him, with the Principal, Rev. Father Bertrand, we have both agreed that his prosecution under The Juvenile Delinquents Act and sentence for a term in a Reformatory School would serve no useful purpose but rather prepare him and harden him for a criminal life. The agreement was to ask Mr. Inspector Schmidt's authority to transfer the boy to a distant residential school (the Duck Lake Indian Residential School being recommended) following a good strapping administered before the other pupils by a Constable of the R.C.M.P. to make the example a salutary one.\n\nMr. Inspector Schmidt having advised that he had referred the case to the Department, I received in due course a telegram from the Director stating his interview with His Lordship Bishop Guy and advising that prosecution should be made under the Juvenile Delinquents Act. As little or no information were given with my original request for transfer, I have taken the liberty to postpone the trial until the case can be further reviewed and if it is the wish of the Director, he may re-affirm his decision or give new instructions for the settlement of the above case.\n\nIn the meantime the boy, Morin, is under detention at the agency.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 22nd February, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to refer to your report of the 6th February and particularly to the case of the pupil, Joe Morin, a boy of fifteen years who set fire to the Joussard Indian Residential School, and note your suggestion that a good strapping administered to this boy by a Constable of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police before the other pupils would be a salutary example.\n\nIn reply I have to say that while that may be true, there is no legal authority for that treatment for such an offence and the Department might be severely criticised for authorizing such a course if something unusual should occur in connection with the proceeding. It is thought that this boy should be proceeded against under the Juvenile Delinquents Act in the regular way.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nN.P.

Sutherland,\nActing Superintendent,\nSchools Branch,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI must admit I prefer to be at a distance to remit the enclosed labour returns after the reception my other accounts have received, not from you, but from some other quarters. The facts remain that we have spent the money shown and some other (specially disbursements for freighting from station to lake, from Joussard to Grouard on lake, from Grouard wharf to Mission, over $600.00) on the different building operations undertaken at Grouard and Joussard.\n\nYou will recollect that in my requests for estimates I had included an item for $2000.00 to reimburse us for work on Barn at Joussard (outside of the equipment), $1500.00 had been voted for a 75'x 36' combination cow barn and horse stable. You will admit that amount was not sufficient. The enclosed returns show the complete outlay for wages. You will note that there is only one sheet. The foremen did not think of having the other two signed by the men, a fact which was noticed only when he handed in the returns. Rev. Fr. Serreand Q.M.I., the Principal at St. Bruno's School, to whom I remitted the borrowed money, was not conversant with the fact that duplicate and triplicate copies had to be signed. I suppose you can have proper copies made and certified. Our foremen has left for Wabasca and will not be available (nor specially will be the men) for a few months.\n\nAs already suggested please keep this and other accounts until you are satisfied that they are entirely turned down and then...there will be still hope!!!\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Grouard.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by The Deputy of His Excellency the Governor General on the 31st March, 1937.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 22nd March, 1937, from the Minister of Mines and Resources, stating that the repairs, equipment and labour stated hereunder have been authorized at each of the Grouard (St. Bernard's); Joussard (St. Bruno's); Sturgeon Lake and Vermilion Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools, located in the Lesser Slave Lake agency, northern Alberta:\n\n| Location          | Amount   |\n|-------------------|----------|\n| Grouard (St. Bernard's) | $2,283.49 |\n| Joussard (St. Bruno's)    | $1,434.97 |\n| Sturgeon Lake           | $211.27  |\n| Vermilion              | $417.64  |\n\n$4,347.37\n\nThe Minister further states that these schools are in an isolated locality, it has been found that the most economical method of arranging for the purchase of equipment and in carrying out repairs is to place the work in charge of the Oblate Order, under whose auspices these schools are conducted;\n\nThat all purchases of equipment and the labour in connection with repairs were approved by the Department and carried out under the direct supervision of His Lordship Right Reverend Joseph Guy, C.M., Bishop of Grouard; and\n\nThat funds to cover the cost of the above mentioned equipment and labour are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the current fiscal year, 1936-37.\n\nThe Minister recommends that authority be granted for the expenditure of the said sum of $4,347.37 in payment of the cost of supplying the equipment and in carrying out the labour at the above mentioned schools.\n\nThe Committee concur in the foregoing recommendation and submit the same for approval.\n\n(Sgd.)

C. Indian Residential Schools, under authority of Order-in-Council 18/1886 of July 24th, 1886.\n\nI may state that the above mentioned schools are three of those operated under the jurisdiction and direction of the Right Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I., of Grouard, Alberta. It would appear that it has been the practice of the Department in the past to deal with the schools under the direction of Bishop Guy, for administrative purposes, as a unit.\n\nThe amounts specified for the schools in the Order-in-Council were taken from reports received from Bishop Guy at the time the Estimates were in course of preparation. Bishop Guy, however, who later visited Ottawa and discussed these expenditures with the officials, pointed out that the inaccessibility of the schools, his failure to obtain satisfactory transportation facilities, in addition to the difficulty experienced in providing proper supervision for the work of construction, made it impossible for him to proceed with the repairs in conformity with the terms of the Order-in-Council. Inasmuch as these schools had been in the past considered as a unit, Bishop Guy was permitted to proceed with his programme of repairs and improvements.\n\nGeorges Genther, Esq.,\nAuditor General,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe that the matter might be very profitably discussed between one of your officials and the officials of the Welfare and Training Division of this Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Minister.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPAY TO: Rev.

It seems to me that we should have five or six more which could be placed on different floors and which would be immediately to hand in case of fire, enabling us to extinguish it without delay.

And it is clear by the previous correspondence that the Department will not refund anything over the amount voted. On the other hand, as the furniture requested are of urgent need, would you accept to buy for Joussard School the beds and the Sewing Machines with the understanding that I will pay the bill for this year but that this will be refund on the appropriation of the coming year?

This will help giving adequate training to the girls.\n\nNotwithstanding the heavy expenses imposed on us by the drought which has prevailed in the district, I have just ordered the beds asked for the same Mission. They are absolutely needed due to the fact that the number of applications has increased this year. And besides some old beds are out of use.\n\nThe drought has been so serious that we have practically no preserves this year. This will reflect heavily on our finances. We know now what drought means.\n\nThanking you once more for your attention, I remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S.

I expect to be in position to send the other reports in a short future.\n\nSome buying of material has been done directly. As pointed out in previous correspondence, it was due to the fact that notification of passing through the Department has reached me too late, when most of the material had been delivered. Cement was taken in in April in order to profit by frozen roads in case the season would be wet. I do not insist as the explanations have already been accepted by the Department.\n\nLet me confess openly that refunding within a relative short delay would accommodate me. The paying of the material as well as of the wages through the ordinary revenues has put me short of money. With December will start the buying for Schools which can be reached economically but in winter time, on snow roads.\n\nAs foreseen, the crop has been very poor, not to say more. We will have to buy most of the vegetables: onions, carrots, peas, corn, etc. This never happened in the past. It means an heavy burden on all our Schools.\n\nBelieve me, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF.S. LaJoie, O.M.T.,\nGrouard, Alta.\nReverend Sir:\n\nRev. S. Lajoie, O.M.I., visited the Department recently and requested the following desks for the Joussard Indian residential school:\n\n13 desks 23 x 29\n2 fronts for desks 21 x 26\n1 rear for desks 31 x 22\n\nThe above information is not sufficiently complete to permit us to order the desks. The Department supplies single school desks and these can be obtained as follows:\n\nNo. 1 for children 16 to 20 years\n\" 2 \" \" 12 to 16 \"\n\" 3 \" \" 10 to 12 \"\n\" 4 \" \" 8 to 10 \"\n\" 5 \" \" 5 to 8 \"\n\nPlease let me know for what age of children you require the desks and the number for each age.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBanff, Alberta,\nFebruary 20th, 1939.\n\nREPORT on Water Supply Situation at\nJoussard Residential School, Alberta.\n\nI inspected the water supply situation at Joussard Residential School on 2nd February 1939 and discussed the matter as fully as possible with all local and interested authorities. Before proceeding on this trip, I discussed the problem with Mr. C. F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Affairs at Calgary, and also obtained as much information as possible regarding the water levels of Lesser Slave Lake from Mr. O. H. Hoover of the Dominion Water Power Branch, Calgary.\n\nThe present water supply installation has worked reasonably well and satisfactorily during the summer seasons in the past, with the exception of certain points which I will bring out later in this report. They have always had trouble, but have managed to operate under difficulties during the winter seasons until this winter owing to the pipe line from the intake to the pump freezing. This is a stretch of 450 feet of 1-1/4\" galvanized iron pipe. This winter the lake level has receded lower than at any previously recorded time, with the result that there is no water at the intake and water has to be hauled in barrels from out in the lake to the pump, from whence it is pumped to the buildings.\n\nThe school buildings are on a bench about 10 feet above extreme high water mark of the lake. Attempts have been made in the past to drill wells close to the main buildings but no water was found to a depth of 150 feet.\n\nThere is a dug well at present about 600 feet from the main building which supplies the barn. This well is 60 feet deep and 5 x 5 feet on the bottom and water seeps in very slowly, sufficient to handle comfortably the requirements for 30 head of stock. The water is hard and unsuitable for domestic use without treatment, which experience is common throughout the Peace River District.\n\nAs there are one hundred and fifty people - pupils and staff - resident in the school, with the likelihood of a gradual increase in numbers each year in the future, it is considered that any well in the vicinity of the main buildings would not give sufficient water to supply the needs of the school.\nThe improbability of finding a well in the vicinity of the main buildings with sufficient and suitable water for domestic and fire protection purposes leaves only one alternative as a source of supply and that is from the main Lesser Slave Lake.\n\nThis school is supplied with inside plumbing, water closets, baths and fire hydrant equipment. However, in my opinion, the water storage reservoir and septic tank are quite inadequate for the numbers of children and staff in residence. There is a 440-gallon pressure tank for water storage in the boiler room to which an additional 440-gallon tank should be added. The septic tank is 6' x 6' and too small for 150 people, with the result that the children still use outside dry privies.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe first thing to do would be to dig a well close to the present pump house on the lakeshore. If sufficient and suitable water is found here, the water supply situation will be eased considerably as it can be pumped with the present equipment to the 440-gallon reservoir in the boiler room. The only additional equipment required being another 440-gallon pressure tank.\n\nEstimate of Cost for doing Above Work:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Digging and cribbing well                 | $100.00|\n| 440-gallon pressure tank installed in boiler room | $250.00|\n| Alterations to pump connections           | $50.00 |\n| Engineering expenses and contingencies    | $50.00 |\n| **Total**                                 | **$450.00** |\n\nI was informed that the school authorities had previously dug a well at the pump house but did not get sufficient water for their needs. Their explanation was that the lakebed consists of blue clay through which there is little flow or seepage. However, I think it advisable to try again with another well near the pump house on the lakeshore. If, however, this does not prove satisfactory, the only recourse will be to go out into the lake for it. The lakebed is very flat and it will be necessary to go a long way out into the lake with the intake.\n\nThe present intake pipe has 450 feet of 1-1/4\" galvanized iron pipe laid on the lake bed. This was covered with several feet of earth and rocks to guard against frost in winter time, but the wave action during storms on the lake practically demolished this covering so that great difficulty and expense has been incurred every winter in countering the effects of frost. Some difficulty was experienced in getting sufficient water at the intake to pump, but until this winter it was always managed. This winter, however,\n\n*********\nthe level of Lesser Slave Lake has receded lower than at any previously recorded time so that, in order to get to a depth of water sufficiently deep for the intake to be below the ice, it would be necessary to extend the intake a further 950 feet where the water was 4'-8\" deep on 2nd February, 1939.\n\nThe whole intake pipe, 1400 feet, should be buried in the lakebed below frost line and the problem is how to do this in this isolated locality without suitable equipment.\n\nThe most economical method to do the excavating for the trench is by use of a small dragline. From enquiries made while on this inspection trip, I do not believe there is one nearer than Edmonton where the Provincial Government has a 60-tonne 1/8-mile-dragline machine. There is the possibility that a small dragline may be used for the proposed improvements to the water supply system at Sturgeon Lake Residential School (See separate report for Sturgeon Lake); also the provincial Government will most likely be using a small dragline in this district next summer. This being so, I suggest that at the suitable time an arrangement be made with the Provincial Department of Public Works for the loan of the machine when it is in the vicinity, and thereby affect a saving on cost of freighting by dividing it between the provincial government and the jobs at Jouniard and Sturgeon Lake.\n\nIf it is found necessary to extend the intake out into the lake, I believe the most suitable time of the year in which to do the work would be last to 15th October when the lake is low and just before freeze-up.\n\nEstimate of Additional Cost if it is found necessary to extend the intake into the Lake from the pumphouse.\n\n| Description                                                                 | Cost   |\n|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 950 lin.ft. - 2\" galvanized iron Pipe                                      | $315.00|\n| Excavating trench and backfilling (including an allowance for freighting dragline) | $635.00|\n| Taking up and relaying 450 feet 1-1/4\" pipe and laying 950 feet 2\" pipe     | $100.00|\n| Engineering expenses, freighting pipe and contingencies                    | $100.00|\n| **Total**                                                                  | $1,050.00|\n\nThis cost would be additional to the $450.00 mentioned previously in this report.\n\nAs is the case for the other Residential Schools in the Peace River District, I would recommend that any work done on the water system be left to the local authorities under the Indian Affairs Branch, our Engineer's Service remaining in an advisory capacity only. The prevailing rates of pay are little more than half of what we would have to pay under the Dept. of Labour's Fair Wage Scale and it would make it decidedly inconvenient for the local authorities afterwards if we went in there and paid the higher rates for labour.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs the water supply and sewage disposal are closely related problems, I checked over the sanitary arrangements at this school and am forced to say that, while there has been no trouble or complaints in the past, I do not approve of them. There is a 6' x 6' septic tank, which is too small for 150 people and the disposal field is too restricted. This is situated on the bank of an intermittent stream which empties into the lake about 500 feet west of the school pumphouse. Into all the waste water from the laundry and kitchen is dumped directly into this intermittent stream without treatment. As a result of these conditions, I believe there is a danger of contaminating the lake water at the intake and recommend that this situation be brought to the attention of the Indian Affairs Branch to be considered as a separate project during the summer months when the stream is flowing and the examining officer would have the best chance of tracing its discharge.\n\nAssistant Engineer.\nMarch 6th, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water Supply Situation at Jousserd Indian Residential School\n\nAs instructed in your memorandum of January 20th last, arrangements were made for the making of an investigation of the water supply situation at the above school, and report received is attached in duplicate.\n\nBy the system now being used at the above school, water is obtained from a well for the stock and from Lesser Slave Lake for domestic use. This system has been partly satisfactory until this winter, except that storage facilities have been insufficient. Owing, however, to extreme low water, in Lesser Slave Lake, there has been no water in the intake this winter.\n\nFrom history of wells in this district, it is our Engineer's opinion that it is useless trying for water in wells near main building. The only solution, therefore, appears to be to go to the lake for water either by infiltration well at shore or by extending present pipe line further into the lake.\n\nWe therefore recommend trying first, a well near lake shore line with estimated cost of $450.00, as detailed on page 2 of our Engineer's report. It will be noted that only $100.00 of this amount is for the well, the remainder being for improvements to present distribution system.\n\nFailing to obtain sufficient water by above method, then it will be necessary to go out into the lake. The present pipe line is 450 feet long. This would have to be taken up and re-laid, below frost line, and an additional 950 feet of pipe put down, making a total of 1,400 feet of pipe line out into the lake.\n\nOur engineer gives an estimate of $1,350.00 for this work but it should be understood that no estimate for this type of work can be guaranteed owing to uncertainty of availability of suitable equipment for the work in this remote district.\n\nAll labour costs in the above estimates are based on prevailing rates in the district as referred to in the last paragraph of page 3 of our Engineer's report.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 4)\nIt will be noted our Engineer, on page 4 of his report, comments on the sewage disposal system at this School. In his opinion the system is inadequate, particularly as there is danger of contaminating the lake from which water is obtained.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.O. Miller\nMarch 11, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nRe: Water Supply, Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nWith respect to the above, our Engineer, Mr. LeCapelain, made an inspection of the water situation and has submitted his report. A copy of Mr. LeCapelain's report is attached, together with a covering memorandum from the Chief Engineer and a blue print showing the lay-out of the buildings at the Joussard school. It may be noted from Mr. LeCapelain's report that he does not consider probable that digging a well in the vicinity of the buildings would result in a sufficient or suitable supply of water. His recommendations are first to dig a well close to the present pump house on the lake shore, cost of well and tank, etc., being estimated at $450.\n\nShould this well prove unsatisfactory, it will be necessary to go out into the lake and lay sufficient pipe to a depth sufficient to make it safe against frost. This latter will cost an additional $1350.\n\nYou will also note the last paragraph of Mr. LeCapelain's report in which he calls attention to the present condition of the septic tank, and the danger of contaminating the lake water.\n\nDirector.\nOTTAWA, March 15th, 1939.\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nRe Water Supply - Joussard School\n\nIn connection with the report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch, regarding necessary improvements to the water situation at the above mentioned school, see letter of March 15th, 1939, addressed to Rev.

That's not what exactly you want, I couldnt get anything else.\n\nI am writing by same mail to the Northern Alberta Railways Co to send you copies of mentioned freight bills. If you cant wait any longer, let it go.\n\nI am rather late to answer yours of the 25th of March. Our mail service has been disturbed by the snow storm of a few days ago, I couldnt help.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nN.B. Thanks for notice.\nMay 12th, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water Supply, Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nUnder cover of my memorandum of the 11th March last, I sent you a copy of Mr. LeCapelain's report in connection with this matter, together with a covering memorandum from the Chief Engineer, and a blueprint showing the lay-out of the buildings at the Joussard School.\n\nIn this report Mr. LeCapelain called attention to the present condition of the septic tank, and the danger of contaminating the lake water, and in this connection I should be pleased to be advised if it is your intention to take any action towards rectifying this situation.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR\n\nSurveys & Engineering Branch\n\nRe: Water supply Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nI desire to refer to your memorandum of May 12 in which you refer to your memorandum of March 11 last forwarding copy of Mr. LeCaplain's report in connection with the above matter.\n\nThis report contained a recommendation that a well be dug close to the present pump house on the lake shore and estimated the cost of the well, tank etc. at $450.00.\n\nAs your engineer suggested that any work done be accomplished by the school authorities under the control of this Branch and that your engineering service remain entirely in an advisory capacity, I am arranging to forward an amount of $450.00 to the Principal of the Joussard Indian residential school. I am informing him that he is not to proceed with the work until he receives definite instructions from your engineer with regard to the manner in which the work is to be carried out.\n\nIn regard to the present condition of the septic tank you may authorize your engineer to issue instructions to the Principal for the work required and funds for the purpose will be forwarded to the Principal.\nI note that it may be necessary to extend the intake into the lake which would involve an extra expenditure of $1350.00. However, as this work, if required, could not be done until the early part of October there is no necessity of considering it at the present time.\n\nFor your information I may say that authority has been secured from the Honourable the Minister for the requisite work in connection with the water supply systems at the Jousard, Vermillion, Croward and Sturgeon Lake schools. In forwarding this authority the Chief Executive Assistant stated that the Minister desired to know if the Mines & Geology Branch had been consulted for the purpose of ascertaining if they had any information in connection with the underground water supply at these four schools. The Minister expressed the view that we should proceed carefully before spending money in drilling wells until we are certain that there is a sufficient water supply. I should appreciate it if you would let me know if you have consulted the Mines & Geology Branch and, if so, let me have a copy of their report in order that I may forward it to the Minister's office.\n\nDirector.\nMay 24th, 1939.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water Supply Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 18th instant, in which you advised that $450 is being forwarded to the Principal of the school in connection with the digging of a well, I would advise that our Chief Engineer will have one of his men go to Joussard as early as possible, and give the necessary instructions to the Principal in connection with the work.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa,\nMay 27, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nRe: Water Supply Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nThe engineer sent by the Department recommended in connection with the above that a well be dug close to the present pump house on the lake shore and estimated the cost of the well, tank etc. at $450.00.\n\nThe engineer suggested that any work done be undertaken by the school authorities under the control of one of our engineers. I am today informed by the Surveys & Engineering Branch that an engineer will visit your school at as early a date as possible and give you the necessary instructions in connection with the work.\n\nEarly next week an accountable cheque for $450.00 will be forwarded to you. As soon as the work is completed you should forward a voucher in triplicate to which should be attached receipts giving detailed information regarding the manner in which the money was expended. If there is any balance remaining it should be returned to the Department. This is the only manner in which we can properly handle the work from an accounting standpoint.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. P.

Mills,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Water supply for Indian schools at Grouard, Fort Vermilion, Sturgeon Lake and Joussard.\n\nWe have practically no information about the ground water occurrences near the above mentioned schools, but judging from the geology it seems advisable to limit the depth of drilling in some cases.\n\nThe chances of getting a water supply near the Sturgeon Lake School are probably good. The district is underlain by the Wapiti formation which contains several sand horizons that carry a good water supply in the Peace River district. I cannot tell to what depth you will have to drill here but it should be no deeper than the top of the black shale which underlies the Wapiti formation.\n\nThe chances are probably poor of getting a supply of good water from the bedrock of all the other schools and drilling should be confined to the surface deposits. The bedrock in these places is a black or dark grey shale.\n\nIt is impossible to tell exactly where you should drill, without having seen the ground. Usually in searching for water in the surface deposits, gravel ridges and stream valleys are good places to prospect.\n\nWe will be very glad to co-operate with you in any way we can, and if you wish to consult us please do so at any time.\n\nIf you drill please let us know what results you get in order that we may have the information on file.\n\n(Sgd.)

Failing to secure water then the alternative was to go out into the lake. We have received a letter from Mr. Walker reporting findings of Mr. Snelson's investigation when recently at Joussard. From test borings and pits dug by Mr. Snelson in numerous places along the beach above the present water level and within 100 yards of the present pump house no indications of any quantity of water were obtained. In every case heavy impervious blue clay was encountered and continued as far as tests were made namely 30 feet. It is understood that well drillers who have worked in the vicinity report that this clay stratum extends from 80 to 200 feet below the surface. Obviously, the possibility of obtaining water from shallow wells along the lake shore need not be further considered. There, of course, remains the original alternative of running a pipe line far enough out into Lesser Slave Lake to reach a suitable depth of water. For such work Mr. Snelson estimates that the cost would be $1,000.00, providing a small Bear-cat trenching machine now at Jasper could be secured for the work and the work done in weather when ice was about 12 inches thick. If done when the lake is not frozen over, he estimates the cost would be $1,500.00.\n\nAs another alternative Mr. Snelson tentatively suggests the drilling of a well at least 200 feet deep near the mission buildings. Such a scheme he estimates would cost $1,000.00.\n\nMr. Walker in his report however recommends that further work at Joussard be postponed until the results of the well drilling at Grouard is known. He advises that a decision will then be made as to which of the two above methods will produce the most satisfactory water supply.\n\nIn the meantime, Mr. Walker recommends that three 720 gallon pressure tanks be purchased immediately and installed in the boiler room at Joussard to store a supply of water for fire protection. His estimate for this is as follows:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| 3 tanks at $210.00 each       | $630.00|\n| including fittings delivered  |        |\n| Labour, installing and making connections | $70.00 |\n| Total                         | $700.00|\n\nIn addition -----\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-5, part 4)\nIn addition to the above recommended expenditure of $700.00, there will later be required for obtaining a water supply an estimated amount of $1,000.00 for drilling a well or $1,500.00 if water is taken from Lesser Slave Lake.\n\nIn explanation of why three tanks are recommended, Mr. Walker states that a 720 gallon tank is the largest that can be moved into the basement through the present stairway opening through the concrete wall.\n\nYou will recall that no money was transferred to our Service for this project and it is therefore recommended that the Indian Affairs Branch might approve of the immediate installation of the tanks in question as they will apparently be necessary and form part of the water system when water is finally obtained.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nT.

You will note our Supervising Engineer recommends that three 720 gallon pressure tanks be purchased immediately and installed in the boiler room to provide a supply of water for fire protection. The estimated cost is $700.\n\nIn regard to the source of water supply this can be secured from Lesser Slave Lake by running a pipeline out to deep water at a cost ranging from $1,000 to $1,500. An alternative is to build a deep well near the mission building which would cost approximately $1,000. A decision as to which method is the better will be made when the results of well drilling at the Grouard school are known. In the meantime, however, the three pressure tanks should be purchased. I am asking Mr. Mills to let me have at once specifications for the tanks and fittings and on which the Purchasing Agent can call for tenders.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This matter will be referred to our Engineers and given full consideration, although it is doubtful if Mr. Gervais would be able to locate water by his method at depths to which the wells are being dug.\n\nJ.

These arrangements have now been completed and a cheque for $700.00 was forwarded to you last week. This makes a total of $1150.00 which has been sent to you as an amount of $450.00 was forwarded early in June.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward a voucher to which receipts should be attached showing the expenditures from these two cheques and, if there is any balance unexpended, it should be refunded. This voucher should reach the Department before the end of the current month.\n\nRegarding the account of Gorman's Limited I may say that a cheque for $486.00 has been forwarded by the Department to this firm.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

I hope that everything will be found in order.\n\nAs soon as yours of the 29th of March has been received, I have communicated with Rev. F. Serrand. He was just to mail me all the documents.\n\nAs to the Sturgeon Lake accounts, you should receive them within few days. If they happen to delay, don't worry. They will reach you as soon as it will be possible in the circumstances. I mean that the roads are impassable and I wonder if the mail will be regular for some time. I tried myself to make Sturgeon Lake, but I had to come back after having covered a few miles. It is impossible to pass a car. With horses, it takes at least three days to cover the distance. Undoubtedly, the Rev. Principal will make any haste possible to answer your request. Considering the circumstances, I hope that the delay will not hamper the forwarding of the balance agreed on.\n\nLet me tell you how I appreciate your last step. His Excellency requests me to present you his best regards, as well as to Mr. Hoey.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S.

I have delayed presenting same as I didn't know up to lately how much money would be requested to complete the water system there. The water found last winter was containing so much iron that it was out of question to use it. The driller was called back and we were lucky enough to strike a good flow of better water around 300 feet. It contains some iron yet, but so little that we are advised to use it. It is a flowing well. Our intention is to build a reservoir to store a certain quantity of water. The pumping to the pressure tanks will be made from this reservoir.\n\nHaving found a good flow of dry gas when drilling the well, we have requested the driller to drill a hole for that gas. Unfortunately, there was so little gas left that we have been compelled to abandon the idea of having gas for the kitchen stove and possibly for the furnaces. We had deemed that it was worthwhile to try.\n\nLast winter when I was in Ottawa, you have expressed your intention to visit our Missions during the present summer. I have been expecting you since spring. It is not too late. The summer is rather dry. The roads are in fine shape. It would be a pleasure for us to welcome you in our seminaries. If you decide to come, let it be understood that you will be at home in any of our Missions. Besides bringing us the pleasure of receiving you, a visit would surely interest you. Do your best to come.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. S. Lajoie, O.M.I.,\nGrouard, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Provision was made in the estimates, however, for the purchase of desks, institutional beds and mattresses. These were ordered on August 17.\n\nIt is my intention to send forward to the Purchasing Agent a requisition for 500 sacks of cement. It is just possible, however, that in view of this purchase you may have to forego the purchase of certain other equipment at Joussard this year. I notice in the estimates an item for a refrigerator.

It requires a reservoir to store a quantity of water. The well is flowing at the rate of around four gallons a minute. The building prospected will store the reservoir and the pump.\n\nBesides, the ice-harn having collapsed lately, we have decided to erect a new one in the bank of a creek passing close to the School with cement walls. It is why I have applied for 500 sacks of cement. Cement is far cheaper by carload than by sacks. Local freight rates are prohibitive at the hundred for such material.\n\nHaving not received message giving authority to order myself, I have come to the conclusion that you have found possible to have this material ordered right away by the Purchasing Agency. I have been fortunate to secure the services of a very capable man in this line and any delay would compel me to lay him out. It would not be easy to get him back as his services are requested in many places. I expect to hear that the cement is coming any day.\n\nThanking you for the attention given to this, I remain, Dear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF. S.

The shipment was addressed to - Rev. P.P. Serrand, Principal,\nJoussard Indian Residential School, Grouard, Alta.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED\n\nLH.\n\nSales Department.\nMr. R.A. Hoey, Supt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nParliament Buildings,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn your letter of Aug. 20th ultimo, you pointed out that there was nothing in the estimates for the purchasing of cement this year for our Joussard School, while there was some money for a refrigerator. You were suggesting that the purchase of the refrigerator be postponed to next year.\n\nLet me point out that due to the difficulty of getting electricity in the country, we have decided not to ask for an electric refrigerator. An ice-barn, rather than a room to store ice, is being erected. We had to do something to keep ice as the old ice-barn collapsed this summer, as pointed out in a previous letter. Some of the cement shipped in August is being used for the new ice storage. The erection of such storage is far less expensive than an electric refrigerator. Besides, the operation of an electric refrigerator with a private electric plant is not practical.\n\nMost of the cement received was used for the building of a water reservoir. As explained formerly, the well at Joussard is a flowing well, but the water has to be stored before being pumped into the pressure tanks. Besides, the water has to rest to allow some gas coming to evaporate.\n\nMay I point out that there is an error in the address given to firms supplying what you order for the Joussard School. You give: \"Joussard Indian School, Grouard, Alta.\" It should be: Joussard Indian School, Joussard, Alta.\" The precise address means the saving.\nof transportation on fifteen miles. Joussard Station is only a few miles from the School.\n\nThe weather keeps very dry. Brush fire is running. Let us hope that it will keep away from our schools. We have taken out four or five small fires started close to the mission here at Grouard, but it is impossible to fight large fire at miles away in the bush. Rain or snow would be welcomed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. B. Lajoie, O.M.I.\n\nGrouard, Alta.\nOur Order No. 26006\n\nYour Order No. 3564\n\nSold to Dept. of Mines & Resources,\nc/o M.P.

A few dollars have been put on an Ice-House which takes the place of an electric Refrigerator prospected last year.\n\nOf the $2,400.00 allotted for improvements and equipment at Joussard, the sum of $482.54 has been applied for desks and beds while a carload of cement has absorbed $408.75 making a total of $892.75. The balance which is $1,507.77 has been spent for material and wages paid as shown by attached vouchers.\n\nThe water system at Joussard works perfectly. It is to be hoped that the light trace of iron in the water will not interfere with the operation.\n\nThanking you for the help you have given in the settlement of this very important problem for the Joussard Mission,\n\nI remain,\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.

The whole plant and lay-out is very tidy, and presents a beautiful view from the present highway, which passes along the shores of the lake (Lesser Slave) \u2014 approximately three hundred yards North of the buildings. I am told, that since the Alaska Highway construction has started, hundreds of people have been seen to stop and take pictures of the school buildings; there must be thousands of these pictures in the United States.\n\nFire Escapes:\n\nI cannot do otherwise than repeat what I have said before regarding fire escapes: i.e., These are wooden staircases outside the building. I found them in good condition and repair, but I cannot conscientiously say that I consider them the proper thing on a three-storey, frame building, with the dormitories on the top floor. What would happen if there should be a fire and a panic occurred, no one can say! I have always advocated outside, metal towers or tubes, and have not changed my opinion in this respect. I realize, that at the present time metal fire escapes are very difficult \u2014 not to say impossible to get. I was informed that fire drills are held regularly.\n\nA Night Watchman is employed during the Winter months.\n\nC.

This is being enlarged very slowly, as it has to be hewed out of the bush, which is heavy poplar, and expensive to clear and break. This year they had a fair crop of oats and threshed approximately 900 bushels.\n\nGarden:\n\nThey have a beautiful garden, and harvested, among other things, 2,000 pounds of tomatoes. The potato crop was very good and was being taken up while I was there.\n\nFeed:\n\nThe School have no hay lands; they buy their hay from the Indians at time of hay-making, in July and August.\n\nC.

McGill\n\nRe Purchase of Battery for Joussard Indian Residential School - Your file 131-4-5\n\nI have your memorandum of the 8th instant in reference to the above.\n\nAs you are aware the responsibility for the expenditure of the money voted by Parliament for the purchase and maintenance of equipment and repairs to church-owned schools is placed upon the Department and not the churches. The Minister has on many occasions objected to the churches spending the money first without our knowledge or authority and then sending the bills to the Department for payment. I understand you have several times asked them to discontinue this practice and they promised to do so.\n\nWe are now being asked to make a very substantial contribution for the purchase of a battery for the Joussard School; the cost of which is $1081.03 although when Council approved of the manner in which monies voted for these purposes were allocated, only $300 was set aside for repairs to the Joussard School. If, therefore, we are to contribute towards the cost of the battery a further Recommendation to Council will have to be made. Whether it would be wise to transfer the amount set aside for repairs to the Vermilion and Wabasca Schools is a matter upon which you will have to reach a decision.\n\nAs to the purchase of a battery, the matter has been discussed with the Purchasing Agent who has informed me that the list price of this battery is $1295.00 and that if it had been purchased by the Department discounts would have been allowed which would have brought the cost down to $828.50, plus freight charges of $15.00 making a total of $843.50.\n\nI am not prepared at the present time to submit this matter to the Minister for his approval until the need\nfor the purchase of the battery is fully gone into and you approve of the transfer of the amounts set aside for the other two schools.\n\nIf the Minister finally approves of the Department contributing towards the cost of the battery, I feel sure that he will limit the contribution to the amount that the battery would have cost if it had been purchased in the proper way.\n\nThe accounts attached to your memorandum are returned herewith.\n\nChief Executive Assistant.\n\nOttawa, February 11, 1944\nOttawa,\nMarch 24, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of February 11, with reference to the purchase of a battery for the Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nSince receipt of this memorandum the matter has been again taken up with the school authorities and it was found that new batteries were required. The last batteries supplied to this school were paid for by this Department in January, 1937.\n\nIt is noted from your memorandum that the batteries could have been secured at a lower price by the Departmental Purchasing Agent than was paid by the school authorities. Under these circumstances it is recommended that the amount of $645.80 be allowed. Under separate cover I am forwarding to you Memorandum to Council providing for transfer of funds from the Vermilion and Wabasea Roman Catholic Schools to the Joussard School in order to provide the money required to pay for this set of batteries.

Vermilion - $40.60\n- Grouard - $299.30\n- Joussard - $305.20\n\nAs far as the kitchen range for the Sturgeon Lake Residential School is concerned, I presume that it will be in order to apply this expense to the year 1945-1946 appropriation.

Sauve, who was formerly assistant principal at the Wabasca R.C. Residential School, has been assigned to the Joussard Indian Residential School for duty. This transfer of Father Sauve to Joussard has to a great extent improved the morale and the standard of the pupils of that school. This is especially noticeable with regards to the physical training program which Father Sauve has been able to direct to a high degree of efficiency. Father Sauve, as an instructor himself, has taken summer courses in physical training for several years and upon seeing the boys and girls perform one can readily notice that he is accomplishing a great step in Indian Education.\n\nThe number of boys and girls taking P.T. under Father Sauve is approximately 100. One great draw-back is the lack of space in the existing Residential School. While he is not asking for a gymnasium, Father Sauve informs me that he has been successful in obtaining some funds from private sources and that he is willing to undertake the building of the necessary room space outside of the Residential School. He is not asking for any assistance in so far as labour is concerned. The cost of material however, being so high, is estimated that he will need approximately $1,500.00 to purchase the required material to build this Physical Training Room.\n\nSince this was unforeseen previously, it was not included in my 1948-49 estimates. If however there could be any possible\nsource where this money could be had from, I would recommend it to be a very valuable investment towards the health and education of the Indian Youth.\n\nA.

I think we could quite easily obtain these locally and probably at a lesser cost.\n\nWith best wishes to you in your necessary work,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely,\n\nHenri Routhier, O.M.I.,\nConjutor Bishop of Grouard\nExtract from a letter to B. F. Neary, re requisitions for the Residential Schools in the Grouard Diocese, signed by Rev. L. Beauglet, O.M.I. at McLennan, Alta. Sept. 13, 1948.\n\nThe amount of $1500.00 is required for general repairs at Jousard. Years ago buildings were constructed on wooden blocks and cement foundations should be made under these buildings in order to prevent their deterioration. If the Department is prepared to pay labour for the amount of $1500.00 the school will defray the cost of lumber, cement nails and the balance of the labour required.\n\nI believe, Mr. Neary, that the above requisitions are legitimate and trust that you will give them your very careful consideration.\n\n(Sgd) Rev. L. Beauglet, O.M.I.\n\nCopied: V.S.\nEXD.\n\nSeptember 18, 1948.\n\nRev. L.

Routhier, suggesting that we provide $1,500.00 for building a training hall. Possibly the requests are the same.\n\nIn any case, we have the amount mentioned provided in our current year's appropriation. Please forward a requisition for the materials you require so that they may be ordered through the Departmental Purchasing Agent. If these materials can be secured locally, you should let us have their cost and the name and address of the person from whom they can be purchased.\n\nAs soon as we have your requisition, the matter will have immediate attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

From same Company, we will buy the tar paper at $1.35 per roll, brick tiding, and roofing nails at the price mentioned on the previous list.\n\nThe gravel will be taken in the vicinity, and we figure the trucking expenses to amount to $90.00.\n\nThe hall will be 30'x 60' plus annex for steam bath 10 feet longer.\n\nIt will be greatly appreciated could the Indian Department pay the furnace since it is impossible to connect our steam\nheating system from the main building due to distance. A Gilson mark furnace, complete, could be had from the Grouard Indian Co-op for $404.00. This would relieve us immensely as all the salary expenses plus electricity and water system will still have to be our share.\n\nTrusting these informations will answer your demand,\n\nI remain yours sincerely,\n\nFerdinand Davis\n\nIndian Affairs.

Last Fall, we were forced, due to lack of space, to use the parochial church for that purpose which could not be available from year to year.\n\nTrusting you are convinced as I am of the necessity of the physical fitness of our Indians..., having gone so far as of having two of our staff members obtain certificates under the Health and Recreation Branch in Alberta..., having been encouraged by Honourable Paul Martin and Doctor Plews to ask the help of the Indian Department since local aid is altogether impossible..., I ask you to please use your influence towards the Department to have our demand approved in the nearest future as I am presently ready to begin the building which should be completed for the next P.T. term beginning October the first.\n\nHeartily thanking you,\n\nI remain yours very truly,\n\n[Ferdinand Sauvionni]\n\nIndian Affairs.

No doubt the company will co-operate with you by supplying two accounts.\n\nThe Departmental Purchasing Agent is being requested to secure the furnace.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Recreation Hall - Joussard Residential School\n\nReference is made to your letter of September 18th, file 762-5(E.1) and to our Voucher No. 748 (131) which was attached.\n\nOn June 9th we forwarded to you an amended requisition for supplies dated June 8/49. A copy of the requisition is attached. Apparently Purchase Orders No. 40077-8-9 were compiled from our requisition or May 2, rather than from the requisition of June 8th. I believe the above indicates why the invoice covered by our Voucher No. 748 (131) is for $236.35 rather than $159.25. An error was made here when the voucher was forwarded without a check being made of the amount of the purchase order. It might be noted also that the Ashdown Hardware Co. erred when the order was filled at prices exceeding those of purchase Order No. 40079.\n\nWe shall await your instructions before resubmitting our Voucher.\n\nAlthough Rev. Father Sauve asked for a Gillson furnace as indicated on our requisition of June 8, he has found it necessary in the interest or economy to construct the recreation hall without a basement. Therefore Father Sauve wishes to have a forced air furnace such as that quoted by the Vandergriff's Hardware in the attached quotation. I recommend that the furnace be purchased.\n\nReverend Father Sauve made a careful estimate of materials required before the building was begun but he now finds that he requires the materials listed on the attached requisition, dated October 7. Also attached is a letter from Father Sauve in which he mentions the source from which the materials may be obtained. I recommend that the materials be purchased locally.\n\nSuperintendent.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nNov. 10th 1949\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF...

On Sat-\nurday morning January 23rd, about 10:00 o'clock, I was\ntalking to some boys, Germain Baudoin, Thomas Belrose, Son\nL'Heureux; I told them that I didn't like to stay here any\nmore; I told them that I was going to burn the school. Then\nI left the other boys and went playing outside. After\ndinner I went again with Thomas Belrose to the entrance of\nthe school, and I lit a match and put it in a hole in the\nwall of the school; then we went away. After about five\nminutes Belrose and I came back to see if the fire had start-\ned. It hadn't, and the fire was cut; then both of us went\nback to play. On Sunday at about 4:00 p.m. the four of us\nwent back to the entrance where I had previously started the\nfire. I had some birch bark in my pocket, and I put it in\nthe same hole in the wall, and I lit it with a match, when\nit started to burn. Then we all ran away. The other boys\nwent to the hall and I went to the barn to work. I intended\nto burn the school, and on Saturday the Master gave me some\nmatches to burn some garbage, and I saved two to set fire\nto the school, which I did on Sunday. My reason for burning\nthe school was that I didn't want to stay here any longer as\nthe boys were too rough. Son L'Heureux told me that we\nshould burn the school. I took my tool about out of the\nschool on Saturday before I set the fire as I wanted to save\nit.\"\n\n(Sgd. Joe Morin.)\n\n4.

They live the Indian mode of life; the mother earning sufficiently until two years ago for her living and that of her daughter. However for these two years, the scarcity of fur and game for hides from which she was deriving her revenue for living has caused destitution in her family and she is unable to provide for the education of her daughter.\n\nCorrecting the application, I must say that Elizabeth Cunningham has been in school one year already at the expense of St Bruno's Mission.\n\nI recommend her admission as a grant earning pupil.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.

L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nRe: Peter WILLIER, (Treaty) Jeansard, Alberta.\n\nJuvenile Delinquent Act.\n\n1. 8-12-37. I received a phone call from P.E. Gedye in the am that the Post Office had been entered during the night and several articles stolen, suspicion pointed to an Indian boy who had been in the Hamlet the previous night and who was then at the Emilda station. I had a mental patient in the cell at the time (Re: Vincent Groten - Panet, Alta., Mental Diseases Act.) who was to be handed over to Const. Gurril enroute to Edmonton via R.M.R. I decided to take patient with me to Emilda via P.C.R. 2350 I saw suspect in the station and called him on to the platform where he admitted the offence, then arrested the boy who said he was 16 years of age, after getting rid of my mental patient together with his effects by handing him over to Const. Gurril. I continued my investigation. I obtained a statement from this boy Peter Willier as follows:\n\n\"Emilda, Alberta, Dec. 8/37. Peter Willier (Treaty) states Dec. 8/37. I ran away from Catholic Mission at Jeansard and came to Driffield. No people were away. I slept there that night and left the next morning at 7:30 am and went to Pat Gampe's place. I stayed there till 11:30 am, Dec. 7th and left on the freight passed coal on the engine for my ride. I got off at Emilda about 2 pm and stayed in the Dufresne restaurant paid 15\u00a2 for lunch & 10\u00a2 for cigarettes. I got the latter from Waiters store.\n\nI had been wandering around the Hamlet of Emilda all evening till about 10:30 pm. I was sitting in Gedye's store at Emilda and he told me that he was going to close up so I left and went to the station, there was a saboose here and I stayed in this place till about 11:30 pm. Then I broke the window in Gedye's store. I did not break into the store before because I have never been in Emilda before. I stole a ham, and ate part of this also some apples, bananas and sandwiches. I took $1.20 out of the till. I also stole a pair of leather cuffs, a leather belt, a pair of glasses, two watches, two brooches, two neckerchiefs, two rings, two knives, flashlight, hair overalls, shirt, sweater, pair of buckskin gloves, two boxes chocolates, neckerchief, five boxes cigarettes, five packets chewing gum, two pint lifesavers, two batteries and bulb, magnus lighter, one cigarette holder, matches, one flint, five bottles soft drinks.\n\n(a) I have been staying at the Catholic Mission since September 8th, 1937. I found work, this is the first time I ever ran away. I did not leave the Mission during Nov., excepting to go to a dance at Jeansard about the 15th Nov. I have never been to Grouard or High Prairie.\n\n(b) Once during Nov. 1937 I broke into the Mission warehouse at Jeansard and stole about 1 lb of brown sugar. I got in by the window, I unhooked the window, the glass of the window had been broken before. (F.T.O.)\n\nFile numbers must be quoted\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nRe: Peter Willier, (Treaty) Jossard, Alta.\n\nJuvenile Delinquency Act\n\nStatement of Peter Willier\n\n1. Before, Henry George age 15 went with me when I got the sugar also George Ward age 14, the latter did not enter the warehouse we had a molasses bail that we carried the sugar in. I purchased a ticket from the money I stole from George's store, the ticket is from Enilda to Panet Number 20717. (Signed: Peter Willier.)\n\n2. The above mentioned goods in this boy's statement were all found in his possession, entry: \"Gedy's store was made by breaking the window in the Post Office which is about 2 ft square, as there is no one sleeping in this building which is also used as a general store and the living quarters being a good distance to the rear, I went forward and saw this boy committing the offense. The boy stated he ate part of the ham also drank several portions of pop and ate several biscuits apparently took his time. Having been informed from the Post Office, a search later revealed that a bunch of keys had been dropped by this boy whilst he was searching the till, one of the keys on this bunch is homemade there is also a brass tag with the following \"$100.00 reward for return of keys if lost No.13060 will identify owner-on reverse side of tag - International Registry Co.,161 Broadway,N.Y., 17 Place D'Armes, Toronto, Dime Building, Toronto.\" When asked where he had got these keys Willier explained that when he went home he got them from the house also his Mother had found them but quite a long time ago.\n\n3. The previous day Mr. Galibois clerk of the Indian Agency had phoned me (Dec.9/37) advising that Willier had run away from the Mission at Jossard and they suspected he had gone off in the bush to look for his Father who was out trapping about 25 miles away. Mr. Galibois had a party out then trying to get information on the boy and he was to give me more complete Information on the 8th Inst. When I arrested this boy I informed Mr. Galibois.\n\n4. Upon phoning Sgt. Schulz of Rose River with a view to having Wm. Stewart J.J.O try this case, I was advised that Mr. Stewart suggested the boy be returned to the Catholic Mission at Jossard as Mr. Stewart was unable to be at High Prairie for some time being busy in other parts of the district; the boy however was kept at High Prairie till the 10th Inst. as I was unable to leave this district being kept busy with cases.\n\nRe: Oscar Barry, High Prairie, Alta., Accidental death by shooting, Inquest in this case being held at High Prairie Dec.9/37 which lasted till late in the P.M.\n\n5. Dec.10th, Accompanied by this juvenile I patrolled to Jossard via P.O.2350 and called on Rev. Fr. Serrano J.O. Mission, he advised me he was aware the boy had escaped the Mission, also that he had broken into the warehouse and stolen sugar, several other boys in the Mission were also interviewed and I ascertained that Peter Willier had been making brew in the bush near the Mission during the past summer with two other boys namely Eddy Calliou and George Anderson. Father Serrano stated that the Willier boy had caused considerable trouble in the Mission and he thought if an example was not made matters became worse.\n\n6. With regard to the matter of bringing this case before the Juvenile court, this boy is already a ward of the Indian Department and attending the Mission under control of the Indian Agent, if he is allowed to return to the school after being before the Juvenile Judge it will have a bad moral effect on the other children, as it will appear that no punishment can be awarded other than returning them to the Mission School for discipline, the boy does not seem to realise the seriousness of his offence and rather boastful character leaves the impression that the other pupils that he has distinguished himself by his acts and is looked upon as a hero.\n\n7. I questioned this boy for quite a time as this is the second time Gedy's store has been entered within a month, also the Post Office at Gedy's and it was rather strange that this boy who states he has never been to Enilda or Grouard before should E.A. Steal the first occasion especially a store such as Gedy's where it is not occupied during the night, but continued questioning failed to reveal any further evidence. The parents of this boy are absent at present I intend to question them when they return also Pat Gamble where this boy stayed just before he caught the stage to travel for Enilda.\n\n8. The goods stolen in this instance were left at the store of F.W.Gedy's where they are set aside to be used as exhibits where this boy is brought before the Juvenile Court, the boy himself handed these articles back to Mr. Gedy when he was being questioned. (F.R.)\nCould I be advised if the Indian Department have any suggestion before this case is brought to court.\n\nFunding.\n\nExpense assured 6th\n\nP.O.

Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOttawa, Canada.\nPeace River, Alberta,\n28th December 1927.\n\nCorporal J. W. Faulkner,\nR.C.M.P.,\nHigh Prairie, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just been thinking about your telephone message last night asking me to try a case at Driftpile against a treaty Indian woman for refusing to send her children to the R.C.Mission School at Jussard. As Driftpile is just outside my regular district I must get the permission of the Deputy Attorney General to go there.\n\nIf I remember correctly this is the same woman, who with her father, had an argument some months ago with the Indian Agent in your office about this same trouble. I gathered from the argument that the seat of the trouble is religious differences and the woman had decided opinions on the matter, and for that reason the trouble will have to be approached with care and fairness.\n\nI am not sure that a case of this kind should be brought into the police court.\n\nUnder Section 10 of the Indian Act the Superintendent General designates the school to which the children must attend and I would suggest that the matter be laid before him as he might fix some other school, because I understand there is another school to which this woman is perfectly willing to send her children. It might be a little difficult to get the matter before the Superintendent through the Indian Agent, as you told me and I gathered the same from the argument that he is determined that these children shall go to the Jussard Mission School.\n\nI do not relish the idea of getting mixed up in this religious quarrel as that is just what it appears to me at present.\n\nAs soon as I hear from the Deputy Attorney General I will get in touch with you but in any case I will not be able to get down your way before the second week of January as I have a trip west and besides I have the Debt Adjustment work to look after and that keeps me glued to my desk a large part of the time.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) W.

(RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-10, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Deputy Attorney General,\nEdmonton, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI received a telephone call last night from the R.C.M.P. at High Prairie that they want me to try a case at Driftpile under the Indian Act against an Indian woman for refusing to send her children to the R.C.Mission School at Joussard. Driftpile is outside my regular district. It appears that there is some objection to the Indian Agent trying this case.\n\nI am attaching a copy of a letter I am sending to Corp. Faulkner of the R.C.M.P. which will give you some more information about the case.\n\nThere is another case at High Prairie in which a treaty Indian boy is charged with breaking, entering and theft from a store at Enilda. This store also happens to be the Post Office but nothing belonging to the Post Office was stolen but Superintendent Hale of the Post Office is pressing for the case to be cleaned up. I would have tried this case on my last trip but it was not ready.\n\nThis Indian boy ran away from the R.C. Mission at Grouard and stole about $30 worth of goods, and I told the R.C.M.P. to send him back there until the case was ready.\n\nCorporal Faulkner told me that there would be some objection if I sent him back to the Mission but as he is a treaty Indian I do not think I have the power to make him, under the Juvenile Delinquents Act 1929, ward of the Provincial Government and I would not want to do so anyway unless there was some way of making the Dominion Government maintain him. I believe he would receive better discipline at the Mission than most other places. Will you please give me some advice for cases of this kind.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) W. Stewart\n(W.

Stewart, Police Magistrate, Peace River, also a copy of his letter to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at High Prairie in which he deals with a request from the Police to hear a charge against an Indian woman who refused to send her children to an R.C. Mission School and also with regard to the case of an Indian juvenile who was charged with theft.\n\nIn the first case it is not the desire of this Department in any way to interfere with the discretion of the Indian Superintendent at Driftpile. However, as the Magistrate has received some information which has given him some opinions about the case before hearing the evidence it is possible that you may wish to make further inquiries into this matter before laying the charge against this woman.\n\nWith regard to the Indian juvenile charged with theft, I understand that in the case of an Indian juvenile who is dealt with under Section 20 of the Juvenile Delinquents Act that your Department will defray any costs incurred for the maintenance of such child. I believe that this was done in the case of Rosie Mayfield and Maggie Sitting Eagle who were found guilty of setting fire to a school and placed in the Home of the Good Shepherd in Edmonton.\n\nI would be pleased to have your views as to the proper disposition of these two cases.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEncl. 2\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-10, part 3)\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letters received from Mr. W. Stewart, Police Magistrate, Peace River, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the Indian juvenile charged with theft, I believe that this is the same boy about whom the R.C.M.P. recently reported to this Department. They were informed that it was considered that the boy should be kept at the Joussard Indian Residential School until his father returns from his hunting trip, at which time the boy should be placed in the father's care.\n\nNo further action should be taken in the case of the Indian woman who refused to send her children to the Joussard School until we obtain a report from our Agent, who will be written in connection with the matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDirector.\n\nJ.W. McClung, Esq.,\nAttorney General's Dept.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nRe: Peter Willier, (Treaty) Jossard, Alta.\n\nJuvenile Delinquency Act\n\nStatement of Peter Willier\n\nOn December 15th, Henry George age 16 went with me when I got the sugar. Also George Ward age 14, the latter did not enter the warehouse. We had a policeman with us who carried the sugar in. I purchased a ticket from the man who stole from Gaddy's store. The ticket is from Edmonton to Fort Macleod. (Signed: Peter Willier)\n\n2. The above mentioned goods in this boy's statement were all found in his possession, except a bottle of pop which was broken by breaking the window in the Fort Office. It is said that Mr. Willier was seen in some shopping in this building which is also used as a general store, and the living quarters being a good distance to the rear no one heard or saw this boy committing the offense. The boy stated he ate part of the ham and drank several bottles of pop and ate several biscuits apparently took his time, nothing was missed from the Post Office. A search later revealed that a bunch of keys had been dropped by this boy whilst he was searching the till. One of the keys on this bunch is house key there is also a brass key with the following: \"$100.00 reward for return of missing keys.\" This key was given to Mr. Willier by Mr. International Telegraph Co., 101 Broadway, N.Y., M. Anne D'Amour, Montreal, Quebec Building, Toronto. When asked where he had got these keys Willier explained that when he went home he got them from the house also his Mother had found these keys quite a long time ago.\n\n3. The previous day Mr. Galibois clerk of the Indian Agency had phoned me (Dec.7/37) advising that Willier had run away from the Mission at Jossard and they suspected he had gone off in the bush to look for his Father who was out trapping about 35 miles away. Mr. Galibois had a copy of the warrant and got information on the boy but he was unable to give me more complete information on the 8th Inst., when I arrested this boy. I informed Mr. Galibois.\n\n4. Upon phoning Sgt. Schulz of Peace River with a view to having him Stewart try this case, I was advised that Mr. Stewart suggested the boy be returned to the Ochota Mission at Jossard as Mr. Stewart was unable to be at High Prairie for some time being busy in other parts of the district. The boy however was held at High Prairie until the 10th Inst. as I am unable to leave this district being kept busy with cases. Mr. Stewart, High Prairie, has promised additional details of proceedings in this case being held at High Prairie Dec.9/37 which lasted till late in the P.M.\n\n5. Dec.10th. Accompanied by this juvenile I patrolled to Jossard via Ft. Macleod and called on Rev. Mr. Barrand 1/2 Mile, Mission, he advised me he was aware the boy had escaped the Mission, also that he had broken into the warehouse and stolen sugar. Several other boys in the Mission were also interviewed and I ascertained that Peter Willier had been making brew in the bush near the Mission during the past summer with two other boys named Smith and Wilson. Mr. Barrand stated that he had heard of the Willier boy and caused considerable trouble in the Mission and he thought if an example was not made matters become serious.\n\n6. With regard to the matter of bringing this case before the Juvenile court, this boy is already a ward of the Indian Department and attending the Mission under control of the Indian Agent. If he is allowed to return to this school after being before the Juvenile Judge it will have a bad moral effect on the other children, as it will appear that no punishment can be awarded other than returning them to the Mission School for discipline, thus setting a very bad example to others. I believe the other pupils that he has distinguished himself by his acts and is looked upon as a hero.\n\n7a. I questioned this boy for quite a time as this is the second time Gaddy's store has been entered within a month, also the Post Office at Jossard and it was rather strange that this boy who states he has never been to Edmonton or Grouard before should have stolen the first occasion especially a store such as Gaddy's where it is not occupied during the night, but during the daytime. Furthermore there was another witness. The witnesses of this case are absent at present. I intend to question them when they return, also Mr. Gaddy where this boy stayed just before he caught the freight train for Edmonton.\n\n8. The goods stolen in this instance were left at the store of Mr. Gaddy where they are set aside to be used as exhibits when this boy is brought before the Juvenile Court, the boy himself handed these articles back to Mr. Gaddy when he was being questioned.

I received a phone call from P.C.R. Gedge in the evening that the post office had been entered during the night and several articles stolen. Suspicion pointed to an Indian boy who had been in the hamlet the previous night and who was then at the Emilda station. I had a mental patient in the cell at the time (Rev. Vincent Groves - Fancet, Alta., Mental Diseases Act). He was to be handed over to Const. Currie,\u60c5\u7eea to Edmonton via R.M.R. I looked up the address of the boy at Emilda via P.C.R. I saw suspect in the station and called him on to the platform where he admitted the offense. I then questioned the boy who said he was 15 years of age. After getting rid of my mental patient together with his effects by handing him over to Const. Currie, I continued my investigation. I obtained a statement from this boy Peter Williams as follows:\n\nEmilda, Alberta, Dec.6/37.\n\nPeter Williams (Tronzy) states Dec.6/37. I came away from Catholic Mission to Joncourt because I wanted to drink. Many people were away. I slept there that night and left the next morning at 7:30 am and went to Ed Gaspie's place. I stayed there till 11:30 am, Dec.7th and left on the freight passed coal on the engine for my ride. I got off at Emilda about 2 pm and stayed in the Supreme restaurant paid 15\u00a2 for lunch & 10\u00a2 for cigarettes. I got the letter from Tronzy's store.\n\n(a) I have been wandering around the hamlet of Emilda all evening and about 10:30 pm I visited Mr. Gedge's store at Emilda and he told me that he was going to close up so I left and went to the station, there was a subpost here and I stayed in this place till about 11:30 pm. Then I broke the window in Gedge's store. I did not break into the store before because I have never been in Emilda before. I stole a ham, and ate part of this also some apples, biscuits and jam. I took 31\u00a2 out of the till. I also stole a pair of leather gloves, leather belts, a pair of sun glasses, a flashlight, two boxes chocolate, watch, two rings, two knives, a pipe, flashlight, two overalls, shirt, sweater, pair of buckskin gloves, two boxes chocolates, neckerchief, 5 boxes cigarettes, 5 packets chewing gum, 2 pint tins, 2 batteries and bulb, matches, lighter, cigarette holder, matches, flint, 5 bottles soft drinks.\n\n(b) I have been staying at the Catholic Mission since September 28th. I went to Joncourt, that is the first time I ever went there. I did not visit the Hamlet during Nov., excepting to go to a dance at Joncourt about the 15th Nov. I have never been to Grandin or High Prairie.\n\n(c) Once during Nov.1937 I broke into the Mission warehouse at Joncourt and stole about 1 lb of brown sugar. I got in by the window. I unlocked the window, the glass of the window had been broken before. (P.C.R.)\n\nFile numbers must be quoted.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He has advised me verbally that he had mentioned this case to Magistrate Stewart, Juvenile Judge under whom the boy is to be tried, and it also appears to me that Magistrate Stewart would appreciate to receive information naming a place of detention other than those open to white delinquents.\n\nHowever the perusal of the report, specially of paragraph 6, will make the case clear to you and will enable you to understand the form of suggestion Corporal Faulkner as Crown Prosecutor, would like to have.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.

This was done without the permission of the Principal nor mine. St Germain Laboucan was requested to take the child back to the mission school but he was adamant in his determination to keep her. On January 3rd, the matter was reported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at High Prairie. This officer came immediately to this office with the School Principal who had joined him at Joussard. If prosecution had become necessary to enforce the return of the child to school, it was found that a case of this nature is not specifically covered by any section of the Indian Act; the nearest but not quite meeting the requirements of the case being Sec. 10, s-s 4. The suggestion was made that Sec. 316, (a) and (b) of the Criminal Code, respecting abduction, might apply, the proviso being added that the priority of rights to the child as between the Director of Indian Affairs under the Indian Act and the father of the child should have to be established.\n\nProsecution was not necessary as the father obeyed the warning of the R.C.M.P. to take his child to school which he did the next day. However as a similar case may recur which may require Court action I would like to be advised of the procedure to follow and the Acts and section under which to prosecute to secure indictment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN.

L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nDriftpile, Alberta,\nJanuary 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, your file No. 131-4-10, stating your decision in the case of Peter Willier and requesting a report in the case of an Indian woman refusing to send her child to Joussard Residential School.\n\nI beg to advise that this woman is Mrs. Frank Kissay-nees-Cardinal, No. 44 Sucker Creek Band. She has a child, Florence who has now reached statutory school age. Since the beginning of the September school term, this family has been visited several times by the principal of the Residential School to induce her to send her child to school, the father of the child was quite willing but the mother refused. Upon the matter being referred to me I interviewed Cardinal and his wife, first on October 2nd and later on the 15th. On the last interview she refused in no uncertain terms, the husband taking no part in the discussion. Besides the near abusive language she used, she stated that the reason why she would not send her child to school was because \"they learned nothing in those schools\". In view of the grossly unfair language used by her and poor value of the reason given I called in the R.C.M.P. Constable from High Prairie who served the statutory three-days notice as required by Section 10, sub-section 4, to have her bring her child to school. This notice was not heeded to and on December 27th a second notice was served by the R.C.M.P. Police. To date it has had no effect; the child is not in the Residential School nor in the District Public School where the woman stated to the R.C.M.P. that she wanted to send her child to.\n\nI recommend that this case be brought to Court in order that I may obtain authority to take the child Florence into the Joussard Residential School.\n\nThere is also a similar case on Driftpile Reserve which I want to be dealt with through the Court. John Felix Beaver, No. 78 Driftpile Band, who has a child of school age whom he steadfastly refuses to send to school. On the 7th or 8th of December he called\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-10, part 3)\nat the office in an angry mood because I had asked his father to urge him to send his child to school and he threw his treaty ticket at me saying that he was not treaty any longer and he departed.\n\nI would say that at the beginning of the school term I have had eleven cases of families refusing to send or return their children to school; it has taken much cajoleries and an insistence of every moment to bring nine of these cases to reason; and I say that if those two cases are let off without the Indian Act being enforced or other means taken to insure that those two children are placed in a school to receive an education, I am afraid that we will have many vacancies in our Residential Schools next term.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 27, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the difficulty you have experienced in having the children of Mrs. Frank Kissaynees-Cardinal and John Felix Beaver attend school.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter the Department approves the necessary action being taken under Section 10 of the Indian Act.\n\nYou should, of course, arrange with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to serve the notice required under Subsections 3 and 4 of Section 10. If the children are not placed in the school designated by you within 3 days of the date of notice action may be taken under Subsection 4.\n\nMay I direct your attention to the following amendment to the Indian Act which was assented to 23rd May, 1933:\n\n\"Section ten of the Indian Act, chapter ninety-eight of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1927, is amended by adding thereto the following subsection:\n\n\"(6) For the purposes of this section, every member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Force and any special constable appointed for police duty on an Indian reserve, shall be a truant officer.\"\n\nYou will note from the above that for the purposes of carrying out Section 10 of the Indian Act\n\nN. P. L'Heureux, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alta.\nany member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police is considered a truant officer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 27, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 6th instant and my reply of the 10th instant a report has recently been received from Indian Agent L'Heureux with reference to the difficulty he has experienced in arranging for the education of the children of Mrs. Frank Kissaynees-Cardinal, No. 44 Sucker Creek Band, and John Felix Beaver, No. 78 Driftpile Band.\n\nThese parents have persistently refused to educate their children and unless the necessary action is taken under Section 10 of the Indian Act it is quite likely that other Indian parents will follow their example.\n\nUnder the above circumstances the Department is instructing Indian Agent L'Heureux to proceed against these parents under the Act and I would appreciate if you would notify Police Magistrate Stewart that Mr. L'Heureux's action against these parents is being taken with our approval.\n\nSubsection 4 of Section 10 of the Act provides that on summary conviction before a Justice of the Peace the Indian parent refusing to send his children to school renders himself liable to either fine or imprisonment and that his children of school age may be arrested without a warrant and conveyed to school by the\n\nJ. W. McClung, Esq.,\nAttorney General's Dept.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\ntruant officer. The Department is not anxious to register either fines or jail sentences on parents but our primary desire is to have the children given an opportunity of obtaining an education.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nResidential Indian School, Joussard January 24th, 1938\n\nR. A. Hoey\nChief Training Division\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nBeing in possession of a copy of your letter sent to Mr. L'Heureux, (File 131 - 4 - 10, Jan. 14th, 1938) I would like to let you know how matters stand here concerning some children seven years old and in good health not being in school, so you may understand well the situation and understand why I am asking the Department to enforce the Indian Act as far as the attendance at school is concerned.\n\nSeveral children of school age were kept home since September, for no reason whatever only through ill will and caprice of their parents. No complaint of any kind having been made against the school. They were kept home also against the will of the children, who if they were free would come to school to be well dressed and well fed, (that's their own words). I warned those people that according to the Indian Act they were compelled to send their children to school and if they failed to do so, a complaint would be laid against them: they would be judged and punished and children would be taken to school.\n\nThis I did because I knew that the Indians who had sent their children to school wanted the others to do the same, and also because it was the wish (expressed many times) of the chiefs and councillors. Consequently those parents were served summons.\n\nAt first they did not pay much attention to the summons being under the impression we were running a mere bluff; later on having found we meant business, they changed their mind and sent their children to school with the exception of two. Now according to me those people should be prosecuted with the results that chiefs and councillors and other Indians will be very glad to see that not only some but all Indians must comply with the Indian Act. While if they were not obliged to follow the Indian Act, all the others would be dissatisfied and jealous; so the agent, the constable and the principal would be looked at as bluffers and would be the laughing stock of the reserve. So those children sent to school through fear of prosecution would be taken away for one reason or another. And next year other children would not come. So we would never see the end of our trouble, and finally the Indian Act would be dead letter for our Indians.\n\nSo my conclusion is and I hope it is yours: let us enforce\nenforce the law and see the end of our troubles.\n\nYours respectfully\n\nRev. Paul Serrand\nPrincipal\n\nRe: Peter Willier:\n\nIf you are kind enough to allow me to tell you why I cannot reconcile with the Department's decision, I would do so. To the child having committed a serious offense should be punished according to the natural law - The child himself was sure to be punished and so were the parents and the people of the reserve. So I am afraid this decision is liable to induce other children to do the same as did Peter Willier. This child told his parents I stole because I wanted to be put out of school; (I do not think it is the truth); yet he tries to make that impression around him.\n\nWill not children lonesome at school be induced to do the same? I am afraid they will.\n\nThose are the reasons why I cannot reconcile myself with the Department's decision.\n\nIs it too late to have this decision altered? May be not, the chief's father is in the bush and will not be back for another month.\n\nP.S.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 31, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th instant the Department has written Indian Agent L'Heureux authorizing him to proceed under the compulsory clause of the Indian Act against Mrs. Frank Kissaynees-Cardinal, No. 44 Sucker Creek Band, and John Felix Beaver, No. 75 Driftville Band, who have refused to place their children in school.\n\nI regret that you do not agree with the decision that has been made regarding Peter Willier. Might I point out that after making very extensive inquiries it was not found possible to locate any institution in the Province of Alberta to which this boy could be sent. I feel you will agree that it is not likely that he would profit by being sent to any of the regular penal institutions. His case received very careful consideration but after considering all the circumstances in the case we felt that there was no other action could be taken than to return him to his father.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. Paul Serrand,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nJoussard, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 131-4-10 of the 20th instant, regarding the name of Mabel P. Giroux, No. 0166, not appearing on the December return of the Joussard Indian Residential School.\n\nI would say that the correct number of Mabel P. Giroux is 0116 as shown in the September return. Statement of Discharge for December shows that she is discharged as Mable Giroux, which your letter confirms without mentioning her number.\n\nI hope the above information will enable you to correct your record.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nN. P. L'Heureux,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nOn the 17th of March in A.M., Rev. Father Serrand phoned me up and stated that Felix Beaver had just taken his son, Victor, away from school and was on his way to Driftpile. I immediately wired Const. Duff to come out, stop Beaver and take the child back to the Mission. When the police arrived the Indian had already reached home and both Beaver and his wife opposed themselves strongly, when the R.C.M.P. tried to take the boy away, saying that the latter was sick. Nurse Fisk was then called to the scene, and upon examination she said that the child, who had just recovered from a slight grippe and who had been exposed to the cold during his long trip home with practically no clothes on, was probably developing a bad cold or a pneumonia, so she advised that he be sent to hospital. To that, again, the parents strongly opposed themselves, and it was decided to allow the boy to remain at home until he would be fit to return to school. Miss Fisk then came back to the agency to get the medicine she needed to treat the child, but when she returned to Beaver's house, the mother dared her to touch her son, so the nurse could not do anything and had to come back. The following morning, when Miss Fisk went to visit them, Beaver had closed the gate with barbed wire. The nurse, however, returned a few days later and found the boy, Victor, fit to go back to school. Beaver was notified to take his son to the Mission not later than Saturday the 26th, but he did not do so arguing that Victor was still sick, so on Monday the 27th, I called out Const. Duff, and he with Nurse Fisk took the boy to St. Bruno's school.\n\nN.F.L.

In the case of pupils in residence on June 30 and discharged at that date grant will be allowed for 62 days. This is the holiday period and it has been our custom to allow holiday leave.\n\nFor pupils admitted to the school for the first time during the September quarter grant will be allowed from the date of admission to the end of the quarter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

The Principal of the Grouard School should be directed to bring her case to our attention about May 31, 1944, at which time we will decide what action should be taken regarding her.\n\nI note from your letter that Virginia Collins, No. 0203, died at the hospital.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nThe Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Indian Children Attending Public Schools\n\nOn the 10th Inst. I received from the Principal of the Jeussard (St.Emilien's) R.C. Indian Residential School a list of Treaty Indian Children who had not been taken to that school since the opening date and who were still absent. I made an inquiry into this matter and when I questioned Tr. No. 27, Alfred Giroux of the Kinnaayo Band at Driftpile he stated that he did not intend to place his child in the Mission but was intending to enroll the child in the local Public school. He gave as his reason that the children do not learn anything at the Missions; that he attended for 9 years and learned nothing and that the children at the Missions were not properly clothed or fed.\n\nGiroux mentioned other Indians who intended following his plan with regard to their children who had reached school age. I am mentioning the Giroux case as he is inclined to be an agitator and has been moving among the Indians and persuading them to follow his example. At the time of the payment of the annual annuity this year several Bands requested the setting up of day schools on the reserves to replace the Missions. This feeling is becoming more marked each year I believe.\n\nOn the receipt of the letter from the Principal and having enquired into the facts of this case I perused the pertinent sections of the Indian Act and I believe that the Indians are acting unlawfully in this matter. I have not taken action to have these children removed from the Mission pending receipt of a definite ruling as Giroux stated that he had been advised by the Inspector that he could put his children into any school if he was willing to meet the cost. There is the possibility that Giroux is mistaken, or not telling the truth, which fact I can ascertain when Mr. Schmidt visits this Agency which he intends to do this month. Before I take any further action I would very much appreciate instructions for my future guidance as it would seem that some fixed policy with regard to this should be followed through out the agency.\n\nW.B. Skead\nfor\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 27, 1943.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. C.F. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from W.B. Skead, Driftpile, Alberta, in which he states that you expect to visit that agency in the near future. Consequently I thought it advisable to communicate with you at once.\n\nMr. Skead's letter refers to the fact that a number of the children enrolled at the Joussard Indian Residential School did not return to the school upon the expiry of the summer holidays and, when Mr. Skead endeavoured to return them, several of the Indians, particularly Alfred Giroux, No. 87 of the Kinnosayo Band, stated that they did not want their children to return to Joussard, but that they intended to place them in white schools at their own expense.\n\nIf Giroux or any other Indian wishes to place his children in a white school at his own expense the Department has no objection, but too often this is only an excuse for keeping them home because it would probably be some time before our officials would know if the children were actually attending the white school regularly. With this in mind we favour the return of the children to the Joussard Residential School, or to whatever residential school in which they should be placed.\nThe Department would appreciate it if you would investigate the matter thoroughly when you are in the Lesser Slave Lake Agency and let us have a report.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nCalgary, October 13th, 1943.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter No. 151-4-10 of the 27th ultimo, re Indians of the Lesser Slave Lake Agency \u2014 particularly Alfred Giroux, No. 87, Kinsessay Band, Driftpile, not wanting to return their children to the Joussard Residential School; but that they wanted to place them in White schools at their own expense.\n\nI beg to report that while at the Lesser Slave Lake Agency on the 6th instant, I interviewed Alfred Giroux, aged 34 years, himself an ex-pupil, he having attended the Joussard School for nine years. He has two boys: one, his son Guy, aged 7 years; the other, his nephew Leonard, aged 7 years, adopted, an orphan, son of Emil Giroux, deceased.\n\nThe reasons advanced by Giroux for not wanting to send the boys to the Joussard Residential School, were:\n\n\"The children do not learn much in the residential school; some of them become bad boys and use swear words; some of them steal; some of the older boys are rough on small boys (new ones -- beginners). My boy sometimes walks in his sleep so I want his mother to take care of him. I live not two miles from the Driftpile Rural Public School; I want my boys to go there; I can pay what it will cost.\"\n\nIn reply to my questions, Giroux said:\n\n\"Yes, I had some unpleasantness with the Principal; he refused to help me to build a frame granary; he helped others, but would not help me (on credit); I was sorry and said: 'Alright, the time will come when I will have my children of age to go to school, and they will not go to the residential school!' Yes, on the information of the Principal, I was prosecuted and fined for being intoxicated at the school one time at Christmas; No, I do not hate the Principal now; I forget that. There were some lies told at that time. I got so I won't do what the Agent asks me to do; I do not like him. Yes, the Principal sold me some lumber on time since then -- $9.00 worth; I paid it.\"\n\nIt was obvious when I first talked to Giroux, that he had a \"chip on his shoulder\" and was sore at the Principal and the Agent. I brought it out of him, and he admitted that he was very negligent, not to say that he refused to pay his debts, due through the Agency books, even though he could do so; as he admits that he has had considerable sums of cash pass through his hands. I told him that I believed he was wrong in surmising that both the Agent and the Principal were against him, and would not help him, and told him, \"Play the game fairly; if you get credit, pay your debts; you were fined for drunkenness at the school on Christmas: Accept the rap and don't do it again.\" I then pointed out to him that we had a very good school at Joussard, which he finally admitted.\n\nI told him that we preferred having the Indian children attend our own residential schools, where we give them everything they need: lodging, food, clothing, medical attention and care, education and good training.\n\n(Over)\nI told him, that if for valid or serious reasons an Indian wishes to place his children in an outside school, the Department would agree to this, on the recommendation of the Indian Agent or the Inspector of Indian Agencies; but only on the clear and distinct understanding that the children would be punctual and attend very regularly at all seasons, and that the parents pay all tuition fees to the School Board.\n\nI then informed him that the reasons he had advanced were not sufficient for me to recommend the sending of the two young boys (beginners) to an outside school, and I would recommend to the Department that they be placed in the Joussard Residential School, the nearest to his home, some ten (10) miles away, telling him that if he did not like this school there was plenty of room for the boys at the Grouard Residential School, some thirty (30) miles further away. He appeared to have changed his attitude before leaving me; I think he will send both boys to the Joussard School.\n\nLater that day the Provincial School Inspector, Mr. Stehlin, spoke to Acting Indian Agent Skead on the telephone, to tell him that they did not want Indian children in their school at Kinuso; that they did not have any room for them. I later made enquiries, of Mr. Pickford, the local merchant at Driftpile, re the standing of the Driftpile School mentioned by Giroux; we were told that this school would not reopen this autumn as there were not sufficient pupils to warrant engaging a teacher. I did not meet Giroux again before leaving, but asked Acting Indian Agent Skead to inform him of this, and advise him to send his children to Joussard School at once.\n\nIn conversation with the Reverend Principal of the Joussard School, he stated that there was no difficulty encountered as regards pupils returning to school, but that it was the admission of new pupils that Alfred Giroux appeared to be opposing, and that he understood that he (Giroux) had spoken to one, Ambroise Giroux, re his daughter Edna, aged 7 years, also to Harry No Hat, re his son Adolphus, aged 7 years, re sending their children to Driftpile School, but that the latter two were not in favour of this. The Principal stated that a few had been late in coming back; that in one case he had permitted a girl (laboucan) to remain home for a couple of weeks because of her mother's illness (maternity). Two others, Angelique, aged 8 years, daughter of Ed Willier, and the step-son of Harry No Hat, mentioned above, had not yet returned, but were expected to return in a few days' time. He added, that apart from Alfred Giroux, who is somewhat of an agitator, he had no trouble with the other Indians, and found the children happy in school.\n\nRe that part of the third paragraph of Const. Skead's letter, wherein he says that Giroux states that .. \"he had been advised by the Inspector that he could put his children into any school if he was willing to meet the cost\"; I asked Giroux, in the presence of Mr. Skead, who this inspector was; he appeared somewhat embarrassed; then said: \"The one before you came.\" I did not check him closely on this, but remarked to him that I have been in Alberta since 1937 and had made my first visit to that Agency in May of that year.\n\nC.

Mr. Sowan resides on the reserve, but tells me that he owns some property in the Hamlet of Kinuso, and pays taxes there to the Kinuso School District. He wants to have his children attend the school there instead of sending them to the Indian Residential School at Joussard. I was in Kinuso last week on some other business, and while I was there, I was interviewed by Mr. Boisvert, Chairman of the local school Board, and one of the other Trustee's, whom I do not recall the name, and they expressed the desire that these Indian children should not be allowed to attend their School. The first reason given by them, was that they were very short of room, and that if the children of both Paul and August Sowan were permitted to attend their school, it would eventually lead to more Indians wanting to do likewise. They did not seem to want these children at their School.\n\nOn this same day when I was in Kinuso, Mr. August Sowan spoke to me about his children, and his desire was to send them to Kinuso also. His reasons for doing so were in my estimation very poor. His first reason was that the children at the Mission Schools learned to steal, and that there was too much time spent at praying. Those were the only two reasons given by him.\n\nI would appreciate it very much to have your decision on this question by return Air-Mail, as they want to have their children start school right after New Years. My recommendation is that they should return to the Mission School at Joussard.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 23, 1943.\n\nMr. P.J. Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alta.\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the children of Paul and August Sowan. After carefully considering the contents of your letter the Department feels that these children should return to the Joussard Residential School. It is hoped that you will be able to arrange to have them sent back at an early date.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT JAMES BAY INDIAN SCHOOL DURING QUARTER, 1943\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | No. of Ticket under which Child's Admission is paid | BAND | NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD (Insert L for living, D for dead, after name) | Father | Mother | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Places and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|---------------|--------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|--------|---------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n|     |               |                    |                  |                                                   |      |                                                                                  |        |        |                     |                                          |                                         |\n| 0258| Violet Chalfour| Dec 15 '43         | 7                |                                                   |      |                                                                                  |        |        |                     |                                          |                                         |\n| 0259| Agnes Chalfour| Jan 14 '44         | 7                |                                                   |      |                                                                                  |        |        |                     |                                          |                                         |\n\n### DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | NAME          | Date of Discharge | Age on Discharge | PERIOD IN THE SCHOOL | STATE OF EDUCATION | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | REMARKS UPON DISCHARGE | REASONS FOR SAME |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------|\n|     |               |                   |                  |                      |                    |                                               |                       |                 |\n|     | Clifford Davis| Dec 31 '43        | 11               | 3                    | 5                  | Nil                                           | Grade III             | Did not return   |\n|     | Agnes Willie  |                   |                  |                      |                    |                                               | Grade II              | Of Age           |\n|     | Martha Hamlin|                   |                  |                      |                    |                                               | Grade III             | Sickness        |\n\n---\n\nShould be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile,\nvia Kinuso, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the December quarter return of the Joussard Residential School, pupil No. 180 Thomas Bellrose was shown on the September quarter return as 16 years of age. This agreed with our records as shown on the original application form. On the December quarter return this boy is stated to be 14 years of age. Please discuss this matter with the Principal and let me have an explanation.\n\nPupil No. Q250 Elsie Ward was evidently absent from the school for the December quarter 1943, and also the March and June quarters of 1944, as no request was made for any grant for her during those three quarters. On the September quarter return grant was requested and allowed for this girl for 92 days. Her name is shown on the December quarter return but no grant is requested and it therefore appears that she is again absent from the school. I would appreciate some explanation regarding her.\n\nPupils 243 and 244 are shown on the return and grant requested for the full quarter. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of November 13, 1943, and letter of April 14, 1944, also your reply of April 21, 1944. The admission of these children was originally refused, due to the fact that they were not considered Treaty Indians. Has their status been changed in the meantime?\n\nWe have not yet received the eight\napplication forms requested in my letter of October 24, 1944. These covered the new pupils who had entered the Joussard School for the first time during the September quarter.\n\nPaul Chalifoux No. 206 was transferred to the Grouard Residential School in March, 1944. On the December quarter return of the Joussard School grant was requested for him for 92 days. Has he been transferred back to Joussard from Grouard?\n\nForm I.A.411 was not sent. This form must accompany all quarterly returns. In this connection I enclose copy of circular letter of December 28, 1944.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDriftpile, Alberta.\nJan. 30th. 1945\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of 12-1-45, File 131-4-10, and wish to advise you as follows:\n\nIn the case of Thomas Bellerose No.190, I enquired from his father, and he told me that this boy is 14 years of age.\n\nPupil No.0250, Elsie Ward is not attending the Joussard School at present, and will not likely come back.\n\nPupils No.243 & 244, are Non Treaty's,\n\nThe eight applications requested in your letter of Oct. 24th. 1944, have not been sent, because these children have not yet had a Medical examination. I have spoken to Dr.J.B.T. Wood of High Prairie, on two different occasions, to have these children examined, and he promised to come, but has not yet been able to do so, owing to pressure of work. It is my intention to have our Nurse do this work in the very near future, and will see that the Admission Forms are sent.\n\nPaul Chalifoux, No.206 was transferred back to Joussard, at the request of his father, as he would not consent to let him go back to Grouard.\n\nI have drawn the attention of Form I.A.411 to the Principal, and he said that he would send this Form.\n\nP.J.Demers\nIndian Agent.\nDriftpile, Alberta.\nFeb. 9th. 1945.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Canada.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the following, and would appreciate your advice;\n\nOn January 25th, 1945, Paul Chalifoux, No.345 Grouard School, Jack Willier No.215, Archie NoHat, No.219 and Dan G. Theodore No.214 of Joussard School, ran away from the Joussard School. I wish to state that Paul Chalifoux was also attending the Joussard School since the opening term in September. Jack, Archie and Dan were returned to school on the 26th, the next day, and Paul is still at home. Paul Chalifoux was a source of trouble at Joussard last year, and it was on account of this that he was transferred to Grouard, and while he was there to finish the term last year, he was a very good boy and caused no further trouble. On Sept. last when the time came for Paul to return to school, Francis Chalifoux, the guardian of this boy did not want him to go back to Grouard, but consented on having him attend the Joussard School. This I agreed to on the understanding that if Paul did not cause any trouble there, he would be allowed to remain there, but if he ran away from school, as he had done last winter, he would again be transferred to Grouard. This the guardian (Francis Chalifoux) agreed to.\n\nThe point now raised, is that Francis Chalifoux does not want Paul to back to any school, as he says that he is needed at home to help his wife Mary Chalifoux, the mother of this boy. I might say that Mary Chalifoux is the lawful wife of Jimmie Walker, #53, Sucker Creek, but they have been separated for quite a number of years, and she has been living with her father and mother, Mr. & Mrs. Francis Chalifoux. She also claims that this boy Paul is needed at home to help her, as she is alone with her mother and three children, one who is a sick baby since he was born, and requires special attention, and another boy of 5 years of age, who\nis medically unfit to be at school. This family is not in good financial circumstances, as they are getting monthly rations from the Agency, and their only means of existence, is for Francis to work out for a living, and provide for the rest of the family. Francis is now 62 years of age, and is hardly able to be at hard work continually. I quite agree that this boy can assist his mother at home, but on the other hand, if this boy had not run away from school, there would have been nothing said about it.\n\nI also told the parents of this boy that if they would let him go back to school; I would assist them with firewood, clothing and perhaps some extra food, but they refused. They also have as an excuse that there are four boys of 14 years of age, who are not attending school, and they feel that if their boy is compelled to return to school, these other boys should also go. I explained to them that of these four boys, one was medically unfit, having a Doctor's certificate, and the other three are needed at home, but they do not seem to want to understand this.\n\nMy honest opinion is that, I am satisfied that this boy can be of help at home, as he is healthy and strong, and not lazy by any means, but on the other hand, if this boy is allowed to stay at home, I am afraid that there will be other boys from the Jeunebard School, who will try and do the same thing. Therefore I would appreciate very much getting your advice in this particular case.\n\nPlease reply by Air Mail.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 15, 1945.\n\nMr. P. J. Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to Paul Chalifoux, pupil No. 206 of the Joussard Residential School. The quarterly return states that this boy is only 13 years of age, and if this information is correct it would appear doubtful if he would be of any great value at home. If he is discharged now, it simply means that he does not receive any more education, as it is extremely unlikely that he would ever return to school. There is the further fact, as stated in your letter, that if we discharge him it would probably encourage others to make similar application.\n\nI think you should again discuss the matter with the Principal and probably the latter and yourself could have another interview with the guardian, and at that time you might point out to him the desirability of his taking more interest in the boy by allowing him to continue his education at least until the close of the current academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name\nAge\nName of Band\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\nFather's full name and No.\nMother's full name and No.\nParents living or dead.\nState of child's health.\nReligion\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Dr. Jackson was in Peace River with 18 Indian Children who were being checked at the T.B. Clinic at this point. The three Capot-Blanc children, Agnes age 10 yrs., Evelyn age 7 and Madalain age 4 had been left homeless at Keg River when their mother died in January of this year. The father of the children is Napoleon Capot-Blanc, is at the present time on his trap-line at Ft. Nelson, B.C. and apparently cannot be contacted.\n\n2. Dr. Jackson stated that she had endeavoured to reach Peace River in time to catch the N.A.Rly train on the 24-2-45 but they had arrived after the train had departed. She had also attempted to get in touch with the Indian Agent at Briftnile to make arrangements for the care of the children but with negative results. The children had been in the Joussard Indian Mission School up until a short time prior to the mother's death.\n\n3. Phone call was made to the High Prairie Detachment and arrangements were made to meet the High Prairie Det. P.C. at McLennan in the P.M. of the 25-2-45.

This was an error on the part of the school staff at the time of taking the applications. This little girl is often called by both names, Alice and Dorothy, and this is the reason of having two entries for the same child. No.0268 should be eliminated, and No.0269 placed in its place.

Demers\nIndian Agent.\nDriftpile, Alberta.\nSept. 27th, 1945.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Can.\n\nATTENTION MR. PHELAN\n\nI wish to draw to your attention the fact that about 14 Indian children of the Driftpile Reserve, have not yet reported for school attendance at the Joussard Indian Residential School, and would respectfully request that you tell me just what to do with these children.\n\nOn Sept. 14th, the parents and guardians of these children were all notified in writing that if their children did not report for school by Sept. 20th, legal proceedings would be taken against them as under Sec. 10 of the Indian Act. Since these notices were sent, quite a few of the children reported for school, but there are still about 14 who have not. I wish to state that there is no school at Driftpile, and they cannot attend school at Faust, as they cannot get admission there for lack of room, and therefore are not going to school anywhere. If I lay a charge against them, they are going to have a lawyer to defend their case, and I would necessarily have to get one also, as there will be strong opposition to meet. This would also have to appear before the Magistrate, as the local J.P. does not want to have anything to do with it, and the Magistrate's fees would have to be paid. I would certainly appreciate receiving your instructions as to what to do, so as to settle this matter once and for all.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 9, 1945.\n\nMr. P. J. Demers, Indian Agent,\nDriftpile, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, with reference to certain children who have not yet returned to the Joussard Indian Residential School. Possibly, since writing that letter, the condition has improved, and before giving final instructions I would appreciate another letter advising me the number of children who have still refused to return after the summer holidays.\n\nIt is possible that some of the objections to returning the children are due to the fact that they are receiving family allowances. In this connection I would refer you to circular letters of April 16 and July 19, and no family allowances should be paid for children who are not attending school when school facilities are available. The instructions that you have already received give you the necessary directions regarding the action that you should take in such cases.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRA350 21/18 VIA EDMONTON=GVT DRIFTPILE ALTA 12 NFT\nDEPT OF MINES AND RESOURCES=\n0580 INDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH OTTAWA ONT=\n:ATTENTION MR PHELAN PLEASE AIR MAIL REPLY TO MY LETTER\nOF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH FILE 210 DASH 45=\n:P J DEMERS INDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6368, file 762-10, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDriftpile, Alberta.\nOctober 15th, 1945.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nATTENTION MR. PHELAN,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 9th inst. File 131-4-10, re Indian Residential School at Joussard, and wish to give you the information asked for.\n\nThe number of children whose parents have refused to send them to school, are as follows:\n\n| Location       | Number |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Driftpile      | 19     |\n| Sucker Creek   | 3      |\n| Total          | 22     |\n\nI might add that the parents of some of these children had made up their minds to send their children to Public schools at Faust and Kinuso, but all the public schools within a radius of 50 miles from here, definitely refuse to admit Indian children to their schools. The reasons are, lack of accommodation, cost of operation and not very anxious to have them mix with white children. This has been agreed upon between Inspector's, Sthein of McLennan and Inspector Hodgson of Athabasca. Therefore these children are not attending any school, and they still refuse to send them to the Joussard Indian Residential School. I have done all I could to have them return, but have not succeeded for the above mentioned children.\n\n(over)\nIt is not a question of Family Allowances which prevents them from going to school, but mainly obstinacy, for various reasons, such as not sufficient food, do not learn enough English etc., which is all false, as I have carefully gone through this matter with the Principal, Rev. P. Serrand, and have found out that these children are adequately fed, with good food, and also kept very clean. This school is known to be the best in our Agency.\n\nI might also add that all our Indian Residential Schools in this Agency, are not experiencing very much difficulty in having the children return to school, and generally speaking, the attendance is very good.\n\nSince every means of having these children return to school has failed, I would respectfully request that get your permission to enforce Sec. 10 of the Indian Act, and that authority be given for paying the Magistrate's Fees in connection therewith.\n\nPlease Air Mail your reply.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 19th October, 1945.\n\nMr. P.J. Demers, Indian Agent, Driftpile, Alberta.\n\nI discussed your letter of the 15th instant with the Director this afternoon and we feel that it would be advisable to cut off the payment of Family Allowances to those children who should have returned to the Residential School on the expiry of their leave and have not done so.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nEnquire as to name of pupil No 257.\n\nNo Application for Admission\n\nNo Application for Admission\n\nfor Rita Willier\nNo 0271.\nOttawa, 26th October, 1945.\n\nMr. P.J.

We have not received any application form for him. We also require the application form for Rita Willier, No. 0271.\n\nYou should direct the Principal's attention to our circular letter of December 29th, 1944, which points out that form I.A.411 must accompany each Quarterly Return. Copy of this form was not forwarded with the September Quarter Return of the Joussard School. The Principal should prepare and forward same at once.\n\nPhilip Phelen,\nChief, Training Division.\nDriftpile, Alberta.\nOctober 24th, 1945.\n\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nATTENTION MR. PHelan,\n\nReceipt is hereby acknowledged of your letter of 19-10-45, File 131-4-10, re children who have not yet returned to the Residential School, and I wish to advise you that it is not a matter of their Family Allowance being cut off, as this has already been done. All I want is a reply to the last paragraph of my letter of October 15th. If the Department wants these children to return to school, then it will be up to me to enforce Sec. 10 of the Indian Act, as every other possible means have failed. They simply do not want their children to return there.\n\nPlease reply by Air Mail.\n\nP.J. Demers\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 8, 1945.\n\nMr. P. J. Demers, Indian Agent,\nDriftpile, via Kinuso, Alberta.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, in further reference to certain Indians who refuse to place their children in the Joussard Residential School.\n\nI have discussed the contents of all your letters with the Director, and we feel that at the present time it is not advisable to enforce Section 10 of the Indian Act. We feel that the Principal and yourself should continue to use moral suasion and we will be prepared to review the matter at the end of December, if these children have not returned to school by that time.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014 September 30, 1945\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name Rita Willier\nAge 7\nName of Band Tucker Creek\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid 34\nFather's full name and No. Francis Willier (Walt)\nMother's full name and No. Christine Willier\nParents living or dead Living\nState of child's health\nReligion Roman Catholic\nDoes applicant speak English?

Morris held a meeting\nof the Driftpile Band, and at this meeting Mr. Morris\nemphasized to the parents of all school aged children that\ntheir children must attend school. On February 23rd, I\nvisited the Chief of the Sucker Creek Reserve and requested\nhis full co-operation in seeing that the parents having\nchildren of school age be sent to school. The response has\nbeen very satisfactory, not only from Sucker Creek but also\nfrom Driftpile. Prior to Mr. Morris' visit there were 40\nchildren, 27 from Driftpile and 13 from Sucker Creek who were\nnot attending school. To-date 35 of these children have been\nreturned, 23 from Driftpile and 12 from Sucker Creek. On\nSaturday, March 2nd, I had the R.C.M.P. notify the parents of\nthe remaining five children of the consequences of truancy.\nI feel confident the parents of these children will heed this\nfirst notice and no further action will be found necessary.\n\nR.C. Hamer,\nClerk, Indian Agency.\nOttawa, 24 September 1946.\n\nMr. A. Landry, Indian Agent,\nDRIFTPILE, via Kinuso, Alberta.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the attached application form which has not been signed by the father of the child. Please secure his signature on the application.\n\nWe would also point out that the official name of this school is \"Joussard Residential School\".\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, 25 October 1946.\n\nRev. Paul Serrand, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nJOUSSARD, Alberta.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe names of pupils numbered 275, 276, 277, 0291, and 0292 were not shown on the June quarter return and presumably were not in the school during that quarter. Consequently you are not eligible to receive the 62 days' holiday grant for them and we are only allowing 30 days' grant for each of them.\n\nWhat has been said regarding the above applies to pupil numbered 0244 also, who was absent from the Joussard School during the June quarter.\n\nPupils numbered 243 and 244 were discharged some months ago and a parently are now being re-admitted. We presume the school re-opened after the summer holidays on Sept. 1st and therefore for these two pupils we can only allow grant of 30 days each.\n\nForm 411 forwarded with the September return did not show any new pupils admitted during the quarter although the return itself carries the names of five pupils admitted admitted on Sept. 1st and two pupils re-admitted. Their names should have been shown on form 411 as the information requested on this form should be the same as contained on the quarterly return.\n\nWhen a pupil is absent from the school for any period, the date of departure from the school, the exact\ndate of return and the reason for absence should be shown opposite the pupil's name in the column provided for that purpose.\n\nWe have not yet received the application forms for the pupils recently admitted. It is hoped that you will arrange to have these forwarded at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

A. F. Clark and I discussed this matter very fully with the principal of the Joussard Indian Residential School. The facts as already reported by Mr. Lapp and myself were found to be correct, except that the Indian families concerned are living on lands belonging to the R. C. Mission and not on Provincial lands. However, if some of the families living on the Sucker Creek Reserve were eventually to follow the example set by the Kakinocit family, they would more than likely take up residence on Provincial lands adjoining the Church land.\n\nIt was finally agreed that Mrs. Kakinocit's children would be accepted as day pupils at the Joussard Residential School provided that a grant on their behalf is authorized by the Education Division. This will also involve the acceptance of children of four other families living on the Church property.\n\nThe principal stated that no other families would be allowed to take up residence on their property. If other families follow suit and take up residence on Provincial lands next the school, their children must not be accepted at the Joussard Residential School on a day school basis.\n\nIf you concur in the decision reached, please advise. It will be necessary to make retroactive payment of Family Allowances on behalf of those children who attended the same school on the same basis last year, provided their attendance was regular.\n\nMr. Lapp will also have to supply the school with the necessary forms so that attendance of the day school pupils, when not regular, can be reported to the Regional Director of Family Allowances.\n\nMajor Clark has reported on this matter direct to Col. Neary.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

As this case is most unusual, the Regional Director will require full particulars before action can be taken.\n\nI would appreciate your assurance that the Family Allowances Act is not being similarly misinterpreted elsewhere in Alberta.\n\nH.

Police, Ottawa, dated the 29th of November, 1950, and signed by Insp. L.M. Lapointe, Fort Smith S/Division, Fort Smith, N.W.T.\n\nRe: Phillipe Charles NORWEGIAN - Fort Smith, N.W.T.\n\n2. Since his arrival at the Fort Smith Detachment, this boy has shown himself to be exceptionally bright and alert, and far above the usual Indian of his age (14). He is exceptionally clean about his clothing and person, baths practically every day, and takes pride in his appearance. He has also shown himself most willing in performing the chores and work allotted to him.\n\n3. His formal education has been sadly neglected, through no fault of his own. All members of the Fort Smith detachment have taken a keen interest in the lad, and Cst. Coulter, who was a school teacher before joining the Force, has been teaching him for several hours each day in grade three subjects, assisted by the other detachment members.\n\n4. The improvement in this boy's general attitude, etc., since coming here, has been amazing. In my opinion it would not be to his best interests to parole him at this time. I feel that his chances of ultimate rehabilitation would be greatly enhanced if he were left here at least until Spring, when, if he were returned to Fort Simpson, he could come under the continued guidance of our members. It would perhaps be better however, if he could be sent from here to a good Indian school rather than return to his home at Simpson. I feel that he has very good possibilities, if given the opportunity to make good.\n\n5. I agree that the course suggested is a deviation from regular routine, and could not be followed in every such instance; however I feel in this case it is well worth while.\nDear Col. Neary:\n\nPhillipe Charles Norwegian\n\nThe above noted Treaty Indian boy, born the 24th of December, 1935, was sentenced at Fort Simpson, N.W.T., on September 26, 1950, to serve one year at hard labour in the Fort Smith guard room of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police upon being convicted on two charges of breaking and entering and one charge of wilful damage.\n\nThe Juvenile Delinquents Act was not in force at Fort Simpson at the time and, therefore, the Stipendiary Magistrate had to deal with the case in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Code of Canada. Attached is an extract from a report submitted by the Officer Commanding the Fort Smith Subdivision of the R.C.M.P. recommending that young Norwegian be paroled in the near future and that he be sent to an Indian school to further his education.\n\nI understand that it might be possible to admit this boy to the Indian Residential school at Grouard, Alberta, and upon definite advice being received from you that he will be accepted in this or some other suitable institution, the matter of obtaining a remission of his sentence will be submitted.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCol.

However, he has much improved following a whole year spent under the supervision of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Nevertheless, I am somewhat reluctant in accepting him in our school where all the boys are under 14 years of age, and consequently too young to come in contact with Phillipe Charles Norwegian who was 15 years old on December 24th last.\n\nEverything is going smoothly presently in our school, and I would not want to see the peaceful atmosphere disrupted in any way by a newcomer.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev.

Under the circumstances we are not at all sure at the moment whether any further action need be taken towards having him registered in the residential school.\n\nIf you would like us to do so, we would be pleased to secure a report from our Welfare Teacher at Fort Simpson concerning this boy. It may be that he would like to have the opportunity of attending a school outside; on the other hand, it may be that with the present educational facilities at Fort Simpson he would be able to receive the instruction there that apparently he needs and wants.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.E.B.

In the Remarks Column he has indicated that these pupils were absent from residence for one reason or another. From the remarks indicated by the Principal it is evident that the school is not entitled to full grant; consequently we have allowed the following for each respective pupil:\n\n| Pupil | Days |\n|-------|------|\n| 247   | 76   |\n| 251   | 80   |\n| 257   | 67   |\n| 264   | 63   |\n| 265   | 64   |\n| 273   | 82   |\n| 274   | 73   |\n| 276   | 82   |\n| 0267  | 71   |\n| 0282  | 64   |\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would bring these figures to Father Sauve's attention instructing him that in future he may claim grant for pupils only for the period they were actually in residence and if a pupil leaves residence for admission to hospital he may claim grant up to thirty days following the date of admission.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n### ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT Jourassak Indian Res.

We are, therefore, disallowing the 62 days and allowing only 30 days for this pupil.\n\nAs pupil # 308 returned to school on September 7th, we are allowing 24 days rather than 30 as claimed.\n\nPupils 326, 327, 328, 329, 330, 0332 and 0333 were admitted to school on September 2nd. We are allowing 29 days grant rather than 30 days as claimed.\n\nPupil # 331 was admitted to school on September 21 consequently we are allowing 10 days rather than 9 days as claimed.\nIt would be appreciated if you would bring to the Principal's attention the fact that when children are at home for any reason including sickness the school is not entitled to grant for the period they are at home.\n\nFor pupil # 274, we allowed 87 days grant; # 0282 - 78 days; # 0302 - 82 days; 0321 - 90 days; 0326 - 90 days; 0328 - 90 days; # 0329 - 90 days as all these pupils were absent for a period during the month of Sept. on account of illness.\n\nIt is noted that pupils 0321-0323, 0326-0328 and 0329 left the school on September 29th and it is presumed that they were left on September 30th and will be returning to school sometime in October.

Indian Agency,\nHigh Prairie, Alta.,\n\nWith reference to the December Quarterly Return for the Joussard Indian Residential School the Department approves the discharge of pupils # 0313 and 0323.\n\nWith reference to the Return, it is noted that in many instances pupils were absent during the Quarter and in the Remarks Column the Principal indicated the dates during which these children were at home. From the information indicated in the Remarks Column, it would appear that in all instances the children were actually at home during the period indicated with the result that in almost all cases the Principal claimed two days more for each pupil than the grant to which the school was entitled. These children left the residence the day before the date indicated and returned the day following the date shown.\n\nTo avoid future errors of this nature, it is suggested that you advise the Principal that he should indicate in the Remarks Column the date the pupils left the residence and returned to school. In other words, his remarks should pertain to the actual attendance of the children in the school rather than their stay at home. This practice is followed by most of the Indian residential school Principals and this system has proved satisfactory. You may advise the Principal that the school is entitled to Per Capita Grant for the day the pupil left the residential school and the day the pupil returned to the school irrespective of whether a child leaves or enters the school in the morning or the afternoon.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nHigh Prairie, Alberta,\nJanuary 20th, 1953.\n\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\n\nThe Principal of the Grouard Indian Residential School has been advised of the contents of your letter of January 13th, 1953, file 761 - 10 (E6).\n\nG.S.

The Remarks Column indicates that this child was sick at home from October 1st to 5th. Actually Orlin Giroux left the school on October 1st and returned to the school on October 5th, therefore the Principal has rightly claimed grant for October 1st and October 5th. Similarly, in other cases where the children were sick at home, during the quarter, the dates shown in the Remarks Column are the dates the children left the school and returned to the school. In each case the Principal has claimed grant only for days the children were at the school.\n\nG.S. Lapp, Superintendent,\nLesser Slave Lake Indian Agency.\n\nL/dp\nc.c. Reverend F. Sauve.

In answer to this, I can only say that since taking holy orders, all thoughts of politics have been avoided.\n\nIn other days I have been in many a hard fought battle for the Conservative party, and so has my father before me; my three brothers also are of the same colour. Charles Bourne of Haldimand was a prominent man in the four-time elected case of that County.\n\nAsking your pardon for so long a letter and leaving this matter entirely in your hand.\n\nBelieve me, Yours faithfully,\n\nH.

Mr. Brown, the Chief of the Presbyterian Missionary at Fort Macleod. I wrote to him today, that I did not think I could do too much by writing, but that when the session began, I would take an opportunity of speaking to you on the subject.\n\nI placed this letter among a number of other papers.\nwhich I brought down with me when the Session began, and I was ashamed that I entirely overlooked it, and was only reminded of it by another letter received from Mr. Brown yesterday.\n\nCan you give him any hope or encouragement? I know him personally, and I can testify that he and his wife are both most earnest self-denying people whose hearts are thoroughly in their work\u2014I feel none vexed than I can let go at my negligence, and should hardly forgive myself if this delay has made it more difficult to meet his wishes. Will you kindly give the matter your consideration and drop me a line of your convenience?\n\nBelieve me sincerely,\n\nfaithfully yours,\n\nG. Wallace\nIndian Agent's Office,\nPiegan Reserve,\nSept. 22nd, 1890.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Bourne called to see me today with regard to his boarding school, and requested me to inform you that he is not prepared to carry on the school unless increased aid is given to him by the Department. He states that he is running into debt himself, over expenses connected with the school, and that he cannot go on, that he was led to believe by the Department, before starting in, that he would receive from them $50.00 a year for each pupil in addition to their rations.\n\nHe explained to me that he receives no aid whatsoever from the Bishop of the diocese, and, outside of what the Department allows, all he gets is from charitable friends down East, some $100.00 a year and gifts of clothing &c. There is a debt he tells me yet of $270.00 on the building.\n\nI explained to Mr. Bourne that the school was supposed to belong to the Church of England Mission, and that I thought the Department had not acted illiberally\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\n\nRegina.\nin giving $480.00 towards the building, $360.00 a year towards the Teacher's salary, and rations to the pupils, that he would probably be thought to have gone into the scheme too hastily if already he had to close down the school for lack of funds. So far he has had three boarders for one quarter, and has secured a home for himself towards which the Department gave him $130.00.\n\nMr. Bourne argued, as stated above, that he had anticipated receiving more aid from the Government.\n\nUnder the circumstances the only way out of the difficulty that I can see is for the Department to make the school entirely a Government one, and take it out of Mr. Bourne's hands, sending up a manager of their own, a woman if possible, and Mr. Bourne might then confine himself to mission work on the Reserve.\n\nMr. Bourne would like to hear at as early a date as possible whether the Department will give him increased assistance.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) A. R. Springett.\n\n24th Sept. 1930.\n\nSince writing the above Mr. Bourne has called to state that he is ready to keep on the three pupils he has already obtained but that he cannot accommodate any further number of pupils unless he receive increased aid from the Department.\n\nS.\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th inst., enclosing copy of a letter from Mr. Rupert Springett, relative to an application made by Mr. Peter Brown for increased assistance toward the maintenance of pupils as teachers at the School at the Sheep Range; and am obliged to inform you that the sum of $540 was voted by Parliament for the maintenance of such pupils.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Bourne for increased assistance towards the maintenance of pupils as boarders at the school on the Piegan Reserve.\n\nThe assistance given has been in the shape of rations and clothing which the pupils would otherwise have had at their homes, and has been of fully equal value with the per cap. money grant of fifty ($50.) dollars.\n\nThe Agent has been told that Mr. Bourne, as far as anything is known here, had no justification for expecting a money grant in addition to rations, but that if he would prefer such a grant in lieu thereof, he can have it for the number of pupils authorized by the Department, but that to make exception to the general rule regarding such schools on Reserves, by increasing the rate of assistance beyond fifty ($50.) dollars per capita per annum, and so create a precedent, I would not feel justified in recommending the Department to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Deputy of the\n\nSupt.

(RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1876.\n\nDear Mr. Bourne,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, in reference to your school on the Peigan Reserve. I regret very much that I cannot assist you in the direction of your request, as it would disorganize the whole Boarding School system under which we are working at present. You can readily understand that if I conceded what you ask for the same concession would have to be given to other institutions, and this would entail an extra expenditure for educational purposes which I am not in a position to ask the country just now to grant.\n\nYou are doubtless aware that we have...\nmy dear Senator,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing a letter from the Revd. Mr. Bourne relative to his school on the Pagan Reserve and simply I am very glad indeed that you brought the correspondence before me as it will enable me to state exactly the position the Dept. takes in reference to these schools.\n\nFor many years as you are probably aware we had no other class of schools than \"Day Schools\" and these worked very well so long as the Indians lived in communities - the children were close to the school and it was an easy matter to secure regular attendance but as the Indians progressed in agriculture we found it necessary and in the interest of Indians themselves to break up...\nup the camps and spread the Indians on the reserves - thus, of course, occasioned a concentration of the schools once too far divided, that, in view of the long distances children would have to travel to attend the schools, no matter where situated, some plan should be adopted whereby the pupils might be drawn into the building and kept there. The result was the establishment of \"Boarding Schools\" carried on in conjunction with the missionary societies operating in the North-West.\n\nThe establishment of these schools of course involves a very large increase in the expenditure for educational purposes and we fear that we should have to go ahead and start in a momentary way - on the Pagan Reserve we had...\ntwo Day schools in operation. One under the Roman Catholic Church and one under the Church of England. Besides assistance given toward the erection of the school house, the Dept pays a guaranteed salary of $300 per annum to the teachers and promises an additional $12 per annum per scholar on the average attendance of pupils over the number of 25 and up to $42 so that if the teacher attains to the maximum he could draw as high as $604 per annum.\n\nWhen Boarding Schools on other Reserves were being started it was considered advisable to extend the system to the Bigan Reserve and consequently a sum of money was voted to assist these two schools namely 9 pupils @ $60 per annum = $540\n\nIndian Affairs.

Consent to give - if so - this were done in the Board's case we shall have to do the same thing all over the Territory and would involve an expenditure which, at present, I am prepared to ask Parliament to bear, besides it would necessitate a change in our Boarding School system. We are not doing anything making this concession to any School in the Country. We are paying other Boarding Schools the per Cap Grant and they appear to be prospering - of course most of them are assisted from the East in Centre Business of Clothing, etc., etc.\n\nSome of them in Money - Mr. Bowne appears to say that the outside Indians do not get any assistance whatever for his School.

On New Year's Eve we gave our boys and girls (numbering 36) Christmas tree. The tree was very tastefully decorated by the principal and staff of the House, with the toys and candy so kindly given by the merchants and friends in Macleod and Pincher Creek. In the earlier part of the day there had been seen Indian wagons coming along with a family and their blankets and the Indians themselves, the chief and the young Indian on his best horse, all making for the one spot, the Victoria House, where always the most welcome and hearty meal is down to feed, potatoes, plum pudding and tea which they seemed highly to appreciate. The large log dormitory was lighted up and a big spruce tree larger than ever was put in position and decorated. After the seats for the parents and friends and children were arranged, the children sang some of their songs in English which much pleased the parents. Then the boys, according to their good behavior, were allowed to choose from the tree what they would like, each having besides a box of candy to give them. The behaviour of the parents and children under the distribution of the presents if the tree was excellent and gold and it is a plain fact that, though the Indians are aborigines, the Indians of the west have never been discouraging, yes, you make a span here and there where the way of the unselfishness and kindness of man been missing, yet surely, driving out the old ways. A very noticeable fact was that not one of the men was stripped of his coat and hat but rather the white man ways they are taking to, even so far coats, high boots and ties. I am obliged to the principal and staff wish to thank those merchants and friends of Macleod and Pincher Creek for their kindness to the children and help which makes it so easy to give the Indians and children on the Feign Reserve, so happy a time at that season of the year.\n\nE. Hillier\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report for your information that on January the 7th, 1899 the boys of this institution were dressed as usual to go out to play, and were warned not to go near the hill about one hundred (100) yards from the back of the institution. They had scarcely been out of the house fifteen minutes (15) when one of them came running in, and said some of the boys were buried under the snow. We at once went to the scene and found that the snow on the side of the hill had slid down. Two of the boys were visible, these we at once set to work to dig out, one of them was buried up to the waist, and the other to the chin, finding there were still two missing, we at once got assistance from a rancher who resides close by, and sent for the Indians. We found one of the boys about twenty minutes past eleven (11.20) but life was extinct, but the second was not found until about fifteen minutes to one (15.1) who was also quite dead.\n\nThe parents of the dead boys arrived and a very sad sight it was to see them beside their dear boys.\n\nWe sent to Pincher Creek for the Coroner, but there was none appointed to that position, but Mr. Morden J.P. said that an inquest was not necessary. A member of the North West Mounted Police came over and saw the bodies, and the place where the accident occurred. The bodies remained here.\nhere until the 8th when the burial service was read\nand the bodies were handed over to their parents.\nThe boys were and are warned every time they go out\nto play of the danger, and on the morning in question\nwere told not to go there. They went as usual to\nplay on the front of the Home, but eight (8) of them\nwent along the creek to the bottom of the hill,\nwhich is about sixty feet (60) high. Five (5)\nof them went up the hill, while three (3) of them\nstayed at the bottom.\n\nThose that stayed at the bottom were watching those\nat the top. Those who went to the top stood on the\nedge of the Hill. Two of those who remained at\nthe bottom were lying down, and one standing up.\nThose at the top were standing on the edge of the\nhill when the whole of the snow slid for fully two\nhundred (200) feet in width to the bottom where\nthe two boys were smothered while the one standing\nescaped. Those who came down with the snow were\nnot hurt and three of them landed at the bottom\non their feet, while as afore stated one was buried\nto the waist and one to the chin.\n\nEvery precaution is taken to watch and warn\nthem of the danger, but unless there can be a high\nboard fence erected to keep them in their proper\nplayground, warnings are almost useless.\n\nThis hill is a constant source of danger.\nThe names of the boys killed,\nJohn Bright Iron, pupil No.43, aged 8 yrs.\nFrank Calf Chief \" \" 38 \" 10 yrs.\n\nThe Indians behaved exceedingly well, seeing\nthat it was the boys own fault, and that the boys\nhad constantly been warned by them as well as us of\nthe\nthe danger.\n\nThe Boys at the time of the accident did not seem to realize what had happened nor could they give us any clear statement as to where the boys were at the time, but now all agree and tell the same story, that five of them were on the top and the three at the bottom as afore stated.\n\nI have the honour &c.\n\nW.R.

Wilson Esq.\nIndian Agent.\nLY TRIBUNE: MONDAY\n\nINDIAN BOYS KILLED.\n\nPupils of the Piegans Indian Boarding School Killed by a Snowslide.\n\nThe Indian department has received word of the death of two Indian children killed in a snowslide at the boarding school on the Piegans Reserve near Calgary. The snowslide occurred on Jan. 7. During recess some of the boys were playing on a hill about three hundred yards behind the school. This hill was covered to the top with snow although there had been prohibitions. They had not been going down the hill but when some pupils ran into the school saying several boys were missing they knew something was wrong. The members of the staff ran out and discovered that while the snowslide had occurred, because of the depth of snow which apparently frequently happens in the spring, the pupils could be seen buried in the snow at the bottom of the hill. One boy was buried up to the waist and the other to the neck, and both were killed instantly. Two pupils were still missing and an attempt was made to rescue them. One was found after an hour and another in two hours. Both had been killed before they were found. The parents of the children were summoned and arrangements were made for their removal. It is understood the Indians do not blame the white authorities and that they have warned the children against going near the hill. The school is located on a river creek and was notched but did not think an attempt would be made to cross it. The boys killed were John Brightmore, aged nine, and Frank Brightmore, aged ten. The hill is about sixty feet high and the snowslide carried down the snow for 300 feet along its face.\nOTTAWA, 27th January, 1899\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a copy of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Church of England boarding school on the Piagun Reserve, addressed to the Indian Agent, giving particulars of the lamentable accident by which pupils John Wright Iron and James Calf Chief lost their lives. The Department is exceedingly sorry to learn of this very sad occurrence and it wishes its sincere sympathy to be conveyed to the parents of these children in their bereavement.\n\nOf course no blame is attached to the school authorities in this matter and pending the erection of a fence or other safeguard, it is hoped that the sad ending of these boys may prove a warning to the other pupils to keep out of danger.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Mr. Haynes, who is the Principal, is wielding a good influence over the Indians of the Peigan reserve. (See Mr. Inspector Markle's report on No. 6 of this file.)\n\nDr. Bryce, in giving his impressions of this school says:\n\n\"The whole history of this school, with limited funds and as found at present, efficient and free from any debt, shows what a devoted Missionary may accomplish. The Agent states that it is especially the Indians surrounding the Mission, which under Mr. Haynes' influence have proved most moral and progressive. He has succeeded in getting them to erect better houses, and their superior character is manifest. A number have enclosed spaces of prairie and begun farming in earnest.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is one of the few boarding schools carried on without a deficit, and in order to do so Mr. Haynes has to exercise most economical management and could not possibly raise funds to buy stock or horses out of the per capita grant. The Woman's Auxiliary pays the salary of the teacher, but that is as far as they can go. I think Mr. Haynes should be encouraged in his good work, and, if funds can be spared, I would recommend that the Commissioner be authorized to procure a pair of horses for the school, which Mrs. Green states Mr. Haynes can purchase for about $200.00.\nOttawa, October 14, 1907.\n\nMadame\u2014\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th inst., asking the Department for a grant for the purchase of a pair of horses for the Peigan Boarding School, I beg to say that, in view of the favourable reports received concerning Mr. Haynes' work in the school and on the reserve, the Department has authorized the Indian Commissioner to take the necessary steps to procure these horses.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

To send them for a school.\n2. After a lot of talk they will say yes, on condition after a certain number of years, some say 7 or 8 or more, they shall leave school, I take them on those conditions, & when I fill in the application form, I say for a number of years stated by the parents, I leave them as such or until such times as the Department or Agent to discharge the child, in most cases.\n\nIt would be necessary to allow them to go out, where the time stated is up, now what I ask you to do is to inform the Agent, that they must stay in school, until I fulfill age, or until after consultation with the Agent & then by the Principal & Agent both agree they ought to stay till they are 18 or 19 years old, so that it may be best for them to be allowed out, then he could write the Department why he thinks the child leave, the Agent is in full accord with this, and sometimes it seems the only way to get the children into the school.

Scott, Superintendent of Indian Education, who recently visited some of the Indian schools in your diocese, reports that the Principals of the Old Sams and Peigan Boarding Schools, conducted under the auspices of your church, had not been supplied with copies of the agreement between the church authorities and the Department for the maintenance and management of these institutions and were consequently ignorant to a certain extent of their responsibilities.\n\nIt seems strange to the Department that you should not have made them aware of the conditions under which these schools are managed and the Department is sending them by concurrent mail copies of the agreement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nRev.

The Department expected to receive an answer from you before this. Would you kindly make an early report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. H. Yeomans, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nOttawa January 22, 1913.\n\nVery Rev. Sir,-\n\nSince writing you on the 24th October regarding the maintenance and management of the boarding schools conducted by the Church of England in the Diocese of Calgary, the Department is advised that the conditions under which the Peigan school is carried on are far from satisfactory and that after making all due allowance for the character of the building the institution is very much below the standard called for by the contract. There is a general air of untidiness about the rooms and buildings, and the rooms available are not used to the best advantage. The school room which was much improved two years ago has been turned into a laundry and classes are held in the boys play room, which is too small and badly lighted and unventilated. The staff is reported to be inefficient and altogether incapable of aiding the principal in managing the school in a satisfactory manner. The stock is neglected, no money being available to provide feed for them during the winter.\n\nThese defects and shortcomings will have to be remedied at once and the Department will be compelled to withhold the grant unless the terms of the contract are lived up to.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nVen. Archdeacon J.W. Time, Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6569, file 765-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nReferring to your letter of 24th October,\n\nNo 63,634-1, I beg to advise you that my report has been delayed to enable the Principle to complete the painting and calsomining recommended by the Superintendent of Indian education, and though a considerable time has elapsed the work is still unfinished, \"the Principle says on account of insufficient material being supplied him\"; There is considerable improvement in the way of painting and calsomining, though the general untidiness of the rooms detracts to a considerable extent the attempts at improvement.\n\n7, I consider the staff altogether incapable of maintaining the building in a satisfactory manner.\n\n8, XXX. The school room which was greatly improved two years ago by the addition of large windows and better ventilation, has been turned into a laundry, and the boys playroom which is much too small, no ventilation, and only lighted by small windows on one side, is being used as a general class room.\n\n9, The industrial work of the pupils is generally speaking commendable.\n\n10, Satisfactory.\n\n11, Pupils fairly clean, and I believe entirely free from vermin.\n\n12, Buildings in fair state of preservation and with reasonable care would meet the requirements.\n\nWith reference to the stock, I am advised by the Principle that $30.00 was allowed him wherewith to provide feed for the stock during the winter, \"one team of horses\nhorses,\n8 cows & other young stock, consequently the horses are never in anything but disgraceful condition, the cows which were milked during the summer as well as those now milking are compelled to hunt their living on depleted pasturage, as are the horses during a great part of the winter.\n\nThe present Principle is working under great disadvantages in not having efficient staff assistance, as under present conditions systematic management is impossible.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept' of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nPincher Creek\n\nE.H. Yeomans Esq\nPeigan Indian Agent\nBrocket, Alta\n\nJany, 22nd, 1913\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI beg leave to report on general condition and state of Church of England Boarding School for Indian children viz:\n\nSec 3\u2014Of a total of nineteen students only seven are in a good general physical condition; Three manifest syphilitic disease; Nine tuberculous disease, all these nine have enlarged tubercular glands of the neck; Four of the nine have open running sores.\n\nSec 7\u2014I believe the staff is entirely too small and inefficient to carry out the instructions laid down in sec' 8 and the instructions are not carried out.\n\nSec 10\u2014I do not think the clothing supplied and worn is suitable for the children.\n\n* 11-The children are kept from day to day in a deplorable state of uncleanness where ordinary soap and water would improve conditions.\n\n* 12-The school buildings and premises are dirty and unsanitary throughout; The children seem to control the staff and not the staff the children as it should be.\n\nAs Medical Officer I would advise:. That the school be closed for such time as proper disinfection and repairs require.\n\nThat a proper system of sewage disposal be installed; At present all sewage &c are thrown in the old creek bottom which in summer is in a stagnant condition.\n\nThat there should be on the staff, one who has some knowledge of the care of the children when sick so as to carry out instructions given by the Medical officer intelligently.\n\nThe efficiency of the staff should be such that they have perfect control of students and to see that the place is kept\nkept\ncleanly and in sanitary conditions.\n\nI submit these few remarks for your consideration trusting\nthat you and the proper authorities will take action to safe-\nguard all parties concerned.\n\nYours &c\n\nJ.J.Gillespie, M.D.\nMedical Officer\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO:\nNo. F/3\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\n27th January 1913\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the condition of the C of E Boarding School I beg to enclose copy of the Medical Officer's report; I have also forwarded a copy to The Venerable Archdeacon Tims at Calgary.\n\nOn the advice of the Medical Officer I have delayed sending several pupils to this school until there is some improvement, included among these are The Warriors children.\n\nYours obediently\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept' of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nDear Sir,\n\nI am extremely sorry that you should have such a report of our Regina School as you intimate in yours of 22nd ult. (No. 63634-1).\n\nFor the past year we have had a great difficulty in obtaining an efficient staff. We have just been able to effect one change and we expect during this month to effect another change which should give us an adequate staff for 200 children.\n\nThe unkindness of the rooms will I trust at once disappear and as we have been spending a lot of money on paint, I think their appearance will be more inviting.\n\nI noted the change of the class rooms when I was here in December and objected to it. I have, since your letter, ordered the change back again to the former class-room.\n\nOur desire is to meet the Department's wishes in every way that we possibly can, but the small number of pupils in attendance, and the increased cost of provisions, and the higher rate of wages demanded, makes our side of the work very difficult, to say nothing of the almost impossibility of getting sympathetic workers.\n\nI have, since receiving your letter, been favored with a copy of the Medical Officer's report through the kindness of the Indian Agent. In it he says \"the children are kept from day to day in a deplorable state of uncleanliness where ordinary soap and water would improve conditions. How such a report can be made by a man who has but twice visited the institution since the present Principal took up his residence there, in the early part of August last, I fail to\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\nOn his first visit I understand he did not even see the children, and his second visit lasted about half an hour.\n\nThe Medical Officer's suggestion that some one of the staff should have some knowledge of the care of children when sick so as to carry out instructions given by the Medical Officer intelligently, I quite agree with, but on the only occasion of his visit, prior to the last, since Mr. Fisher has been there, the Principal states that he had to wait nine weeks before he could obtain the drugs ordered, and \"then,\" says the Principal, \"it was only after continual worrying that we got them.\"\n\nThe Principal also informs me that he has been unable to get from the Doctor a copy of his answers to the question in the circular of Dec. 6th, sent out by the Department, though he has both written and asked him for it.\n\nMr. Geomans, in his letter accompanying a copy of the Doctor's report, says he thinks the necessary work of disinfecting etc., can be done without closing the School.\n\nIf the Doctor will state just what is to be done in that line, we will instruct the Principal to have it carried into effect, but we are not prepared to go to the expense of installing a sewerage system in that building. It is not called for under the contract, and besides I do not think all parts of the building could be kept from proof.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. W. Evans, Addm.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 16th, 1913.\n\nVery Rev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th February.\n\nIt is evident from this letter that you realize that the Victoria Home, on the Peigan Reserve, is not being conducted according to contract. It is observed that you intend to make changes in the staff during the month, which should give you an adequate staff for 20 children.\n\nWill you kindly state in detail what changes you are making in order that it may be known to the Department what you consider an adequate staff for 20 children. Certainly all the changes that have been made at this school lately have pushed matters from bad to worse, and the whole management is so undesirable and so absolutely foreign to the spirit of the contract that the situation is viewed most seriously.\n\nThe space occupied in your letter by considering the Medical Officer's shortcomings seems quite beyond the point.\n\nIt is a fact known to the Officers of the Department that the children are kept in a state of neglect, and that the state of the buildings and the premises are dirty and, therefore, unsanitary.\n\nYou make no mention whatever of the deplorable neglect of the stock.\n\nVen.

If before Spring, the condition of the school has so improved that these children can be safely continued in the Institution they will be allowed to return as grant earners, under other conditions they will be discharged. If the maintenance of these children at the Hospital is undertaken by the Department, the per capita grant cannot be paid in full.\n\nI may remark in closing that the Department has not any installations of sewage system, and it is not called for by the contract, nor in the requirements of boarding schools of this kind, but, I would again emphasize the fact that the main conditions of the contract have not been fulfilled.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I visited the school about two weeks ago and could see no fault to join with the interior of the building. The outside was not in the best of shape but I think that has been rectified by this time. I understand that some of the pupils have been removed to the hospital for treatment. The meals are carried in to them daily from the school kitchen and this entails extra work so that I do not know how the Department would be justified in withholding a portion of the grant.\n\nAs to the \"deplorable condition of the stock\" I failed to notice it. They were in better condition than most of the stock around. The old horse looks short as he was past work, and the agent has promised at my request to assist in obtaining a\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\nSARCEE RESERVE\n\nCalgary, Alta., 191\n\nnew term for the School.\n\nOf the conditions of the contract here\nnot been fulfilled there, I can assure\nthe Department that it is no fault\nof ours; it is perhaps our misfortune\nin not being able to lay our hands\non competent workers, but we think\nand trust that a change for the\nbetter has been made.\n\nOne thing is certain, we must have some\nmore pupils soon or we shall not be able\nto keep the school going.\n\nThe condition of the school has, I am\nsure been magnified to the Department,\nand for what reason? I cannot say.\n\nWe are desirous of doing the best\npossible for the children, and welcome\nthe assistance the Department has\ngiven us in the trained nurse, at\nCALGARY INDIAN MISSIONS\n\nSARCEE RESERVE\n\nCalgary, Alta.,\n\nThe same time we would have considered it more courteous if either the Principal or myself had been notified of the Department's intention before the action was taken.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. W. Tims\nOFFICE OF THE\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nFOR ONTARIO, QUEBEC AND MARITIME PROVINCES.\n\nOttawa, March 26th 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nDuring my visit to the Peigan reserve, Alberta, I went over the C. of E. Indian Boarding school building. I beg to call your attention to a few of the conditions which I found.\n\nMy first impression was that the location is decidedly bad. The building is situated near a creek, and on very low ground. I was told that the overflow in the spring flooded the land at the rear of the building and left an offensive sediment. The ground was very soggy and wet the day I was there but a new fall of snow covered a great deal from sight. I had to pick my way around, however, in order to keep dry.\n\nThe hills immediately at the rear of the building are productive of a great deal of dust at such times as the wind blows in the summer. The waste water is dumped at the rear of the building and the refuse thrown into a creek bottom whence it is expected to be washed away in the spring floods. I do not think that any building in this location could be kept clean. Certainly the place is a breeding place for flies, and in the building there were evidences of a great many.\n\nSchool is conducted in the laundry annex. It is necessary to pass through the kitchen in order to enter the classroom. When I entered the school room the largest boy in the class was sprawled full length on the floor beside the stove. The floor was far from being clean. I noticed that the teacher had, what I considered, a poor method of teaching. She goes from one desk to another and squats down beside the pupils.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\nto instruct them. Her desk, a very dilapidated old table, was piled high with old books etc. and showed no signs of use as a desk. It was also very dusty. The walls of the room had apparently been repaired but were already getting in bad shape again. The children, with the exception of two girls, were very poorly clad and their clothes were dirty. Two of the boys were at work on the wood pile, (during school hours). Principal Fisher took me through the rest of the building. The kitchen floor had two large pools of water on it, one at the pump and the other an overflow from the waste water can. The floor was dirty as also the walls. I did not care to stop long in this part. There are two dining rooms, one for the pupils and another for the staff. The pupils' dining room was far from inviting while the staff dining room, which one might expect to be a model, was very untidy. The boys' playroom was very dirty and the walls were in bad shape. I was informed that the floor had been lately painted, but the only signs of paint that I could see were in the cracks.\n\nIn the dormitories, upstairs, conditions were very little better. In the open air dormitories, which are not used during the cold weather, there were a great many dead or stupified flies on the floor. The dust from the hills previously referred to was greatly in evidence.\n\nIt is not a pleasant duty to place on record such an unfavorable report of conditions in an institution to which the department looks for the education and improvement of Indian children. Success along this line must be the result of first, example, and secondly, instruction. Certainly I could see no commendable example at this place. If I am obliged to say that the personnel of the staff afforded no very uplifting example.\nexample, I am at once inclined to refrain from laying too much blame on the staff as this may be due to insufficiency of staff. I am constrained to say, however, that this institution is in no way a credit to the department nor those who are running it, and I fail to see in what way it can be of any benefit to our Indian pupils so long as it is run as at present. The building, however, is in too bad condition to warrant any very extensive repairs or improvements. The best that could be done would be to close it for such time as would be required to thoroughly clean it and disinfect it.\n\nIn the event of a new building being contemplated I would urge that the department insist on a better location. It would be a grave mistake to continue the use of this location for school purposes. No building could possibly be kept clean in this location. I think that a cesspool of some kind should be built as soon as possible. There is on file a report from the medical officer on this school and I can bear him out in all he says. I do not think that there is any malice shown in his report. Looking at the conditions from a medical man's standpoint, I am surprised that his report is not stronger than it is.\n\nI would like to add that I also visited the cottage hospital, where nine of the pupils have been under treatment. This was certainly a bright spot after the school building. The nurse in charge has the building spotlessly clean. She scrubs it all over, as well as washing the beds every morning. The patients were all doing well. The condition of the hospital was, in every way, all that could be desired. I could find nothing that I would wish different. When it\nis considered that the nurse has done night and day duty without relief ever since taking charge, I think that she deserves every credit. Certainly here was a shining example for the children which they would never get at the school. I noticed a great difference in the discipline also. There was no doubt as to who was in charge.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nI. I. A. & R.\n\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of March the 26th, with reference to the Church of England Boarding school on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nSince the receipt of your letter an Inspector of the Department has visited this school and reported March the 26th.\n\nHe states that in several particulars the school is not being conducted according to contract. The premises are dirty, the children with one or two exceptions are poorly clad and their clothes dirty, the pupils' diningroom is described as being far from inviting and the staff diningroom as very untidy.\n\nAs this new report bears out the previous reports on the management of the school, it is necessary to give you notice under the third (3rd) Clause of the Contract, that the Superintendent General intends to cancel and rescind the Contract. This letter may be taken as the six months' notice in writing referred to in the said Clause.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I hope that it will be kept so.\n\nI would recommend that provision be made for disposal of sewage and refuse in connection with the institution.

Most of the rooms had recently been scrubbed and one of the boys pupils was then engaged at scrubbing the boys wash room. The soil around and about the trees growing in the lawn had been raked and packed and the appearance was generally creditable.\n\n2.

From the above you will observe that there is no lack of housekeeping, this work is carried on by the four persons named within.\n\n5.

The constant changes in the staff is not likely to be an improvement\u2014particularly if they are efficient.\n\n7. In addition to the staff enumerated Miss Macdonald, a qualified and efficient nurse, is in charge of the hospital. There are 3 girls and 2 boys new patients within this hospital and, besides, 5 out-patients pupils of the school. The wards in this hospital are entirely too small and this fact prolongs the period for retaining a nurse and the other expense in connection therewith.

Boarding School.\n\nI should be pleased if you would forward this communication to His Lordship when you have read it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon J. W. Tims,\nSt. John's College,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, January 20th, 1914.\n\nSir -\n\nAs far back as 1913 the attention of the Department was drawn to the inefficient administration of the Church of England Boarding School, on the Peigan Reserve. In the early part of 1913 matters were in such a condition that the Department was compelled to take the stand that the grant paid under the terms of the contract would have to be withheld unless the management conformed to the regulations.\n\nFor your information I might state briefly that at that time, making all due allowance for the character of the building, there did not appear to be any effort made to conduct the school as it should have been; there was a general air of untidiness about the school; the school-room had been turned into a laundry and classes were held in the boys' play-room which was too small and badly lighted and ventilated; the staff was reported to be inefficient and incapable; the stock in connection with the school was neglected - not sufficient food even being provided for them during the winter.\n\nFollowing this the Medical Attendant, Mr. Gillespie, also reported that the staff was entirely too small and inefficient; that the clothing supplied and worn was unsuitable; that the children were not kept clean; that the premises were dirty and unsanitary. He finished his report by recommending that the school be closed until properly disinfected and repairs made. He found twelve diseased children there and the Department furnished the cottage.\n\nH. A. Gunn, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrochet, Alta.\ncottage hospital and removed them there for treatment. I may remark that they were affected with some form of tuberculous or syphilitic diseases.\n\nThese serious conditions were brought to the attention of the church authorities with the result that some new members were appointed to the staff. The building was thoroughly cleaned and renovated and the premises were also cleaned. Mr. Inspector Markle and the Medical Officer reported considerable improvement both respecting the premises and the general management of the school, as a result of which the Department in August, last, decided to continue the contract temporarily.\n\nIt is desired to have a full report from you upon the conditions as they now exist, having special reference to the terms of the contract, a copy of which is being sent you; I may remark that this school is in Class C. At the time of the investigation above referred to the hours of tuition were only from 9 to 12, three hours a day. This the Department considers is not sufficient. They were not, as mentioned above, using the proper class room. The Department would like you to refer to these two points. It is also desired to know what disposition was made of the furniture, furnishings, etc., supplied by the Department at the time the cottage hospital was opened.\n\nI shall be pleased to have you go thoroughly into these matters and report at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI hope now you will feel more satisfied with things at the CPE school here, as we have had several official visits from one or another who seemed quite satisfied with things. A new principal has now arrived and are doing well, and I feel now that things will go along satisfactory to all.\n\nThings are moving much more comfortably now at the Agency, with every prospect of doing so. The appointment seems to have been a very good one, he is a man who has been & is in very close touch with western conditions, and has been below by the Indians for a good many years, he is familiar with them, & they know what he says, he means.\n\nI have also you know been down at the school for some time.\nOf course they work on the Reserve but got behind, still I am thankful I have been able to do something. I would like to ask you how soon when there will be any chance of getting a new school. I am sure you will agree with me, we need it. I am sure now things will go on alright. I don't suppose there will be any chance this year. Will you have chosen a fine spot to build where you are ready to do so for us, & leave province this, & intend to watch things more closely, and do all in my power to keep things in better order. I suppose there is no chance if you happen us a visit, there is nothing like seeing conditions for oneself. I must close thanking you for all your kindness.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW. R.

Original on 63634/6.\n\nMiss Ball does not hold a teachers certificate but has been teaching in Manitoba and in British Columbia under a permit. The opinion is that she could easily secure a certificate if very desirous of obtaining one. My impression is that she is one of the most efficient teachers in the employ of any of the Indian schools in this inspectorate. She is patient and has the faculty of gaining and holding the attention of every pupil before her in class. The children have made progress since she has been their teacher and it will be a serious loss to the school when she quits. I did not hear that she intended to resign but if the salary is not advanced I shall not be surprised if she does and some one engaged at a like salary and expensive even at 20 cents a month. Miss Ball should command not less than $35.00 per month and $40.00 would not be, in my opinion, an excessive salary for the work she is doing.\nOttawa, March 6, 1914.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nMr. Inspector Markle, who visited the Peigan (O.E.), Boarding School recently, reports most favourably on the work of Miss Hall, the teacher, and he considers that an effort should be made to retain her services.\n\nAs good teachers are not easily obtained, the Department trusts that you will hold out such inducements as will make it worth her while to remain permanently in this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Mr. Haynes also visited this institution and doubtless is now in a position to compare the surroundings of this and the Old Sun's school. He has very strong hopes of securing a new and modern building on the Pelican reserve for school purposes soon after the termination of the present war..... to replace Victoria House. As the operation expenses of a modern constructed building are considerably greater than the Victoria House rent and as sufficient funds to properly operate the Victoria House do not seem to be available, it is not clear to me where funds are to come from to operate a modern style school, if the Department does provide one at the termination of the war. It might be prudent for the English Church authorities to transfer the principals of the Old Sun's and the Victoria House schools with a view of giving Mr. Haynes an opportunity of demonstrating his ability to manage a modern institution.\n\nReport dated,-August 22nd, 1916.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nI am writing to you privately. I have just returned from a visit to the new schools on the Sarcee and Blackfoot reserves, both the C of E and the R.C., on the Blackfoot reserve. I have been anxious for sometime to see them for myself, so that I could be guided when the time comes for the school to be built on this reserve.\n\nI found many mistakes in them all, but as I explained to the faultfinders there are many difficulties arise in the building of them, which can and will be corrected in those to be built in the future. And I also find that if they found less fault and did a little more themselves things would be much easier for everybody concerned.\n\nNow Mr Scott, I am going to ask you if the sight of the new school could be decided on. I would at once this fall, get some plowing done, for crop and the planting of trees, even if the school may not be built for a year or two, we should be that much advanced...\n\nThere is a splendid situation about one mile and a half from the agency.\n\nMission House\nBrocket, Alta.\nSep 4th, 16.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\nA good sized lake right on the spot, and every facility for good drainage and sanitation.\n\nIt would stand between the railway and the MacLeod Trail, a prominent commanding position. I spoke to Mr. Markle and he does not think a better position can be found anywhere. It is net in the farming area, and so would not interfere with that branch of the work.\n\nIf you could allow us say $200.00 to fence the whole thing in, we could get the plowing done ready for tree planting and crops, for what struck me with the other schools was the bareness of the surroundings, and that if what I suggest can be done, a much better effect would have been the result now. A crop of oats could be put in for the school next spring, which would help the school, and be ready when the new one was built.\n\nMr. Markle did not care to go further in the matter unless he received instructions from the department. I may say it is at least 6 miles from the site chosen for the R.C. school.\n\nIf the above could be done, I could get in an application to the\nEXPERIMENTAL FARMS THIS FALL FOR THE TREES, FOR AS YOU KNOW THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE TO BE GOT IN NOT LATER THAN JANUARY IN EACH YEAR,\n\nI ALSO SPOKE TO AGENC GUNN AND HE AGREES THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE FOR THE SCHOOL, AND WHILE HE DOES NOT TAKE ANY INTEREST IN TREES AND IMPROVING THE OUTSIDE GROUNDS, STILL HE SAYS IT WOULD BE FINE THING TO GET ALL IN GOOD SHAPE, AND THEN AGAIN THE TIME THAT WOULD BE SAVED, FOR AS YOU KNOW THESE THINGS TAKE TIME, AND IN MOVING INTO A NEW BUILDING THERE IS PLENTY TO BE DONE IN GETTING THE INSIDE FIXED UP, AND IN GOOD SHAPE.\n\nAT THE SARCEE SCHOOL A NUMBER OF TREES ARE PLANTED AND DOING WELL, AND THE GROUND ARE IN GOOD SHAPE.\n\nAT OLD SUNS NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE ALONG THESE LINES.\n\nAT THE R.C. BLACKFOOT, A GOOD NUMBER OF TREES HAVE BEEN PLANTED AND DOING AND LOOKING WELL, HERE THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF PLENTY OF WATER, WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE, FOR ALL AROUND THE DISTRICT AND RIGHT AT THE SCHOOL ARE WHAT ARE CALLED FLOWING WELLS, WHICH AT THE SCHOOL CAN BE USED FOR IRRIGATION PURPOSES.\nAt all the schools I found the boys out on holidays, while at Old Suns School I found both boys and girls out. At my school none of them left for holidays, it is the time when they are most needed, in the garden weeding &c., the mother superior at the Blackfoot felt the situation very much, for she said it made them to have to work so much harder to keep the weeds down and get the general work done.\n\nI am sure if the Dept could make a rule that the children should not go home, but do as we have done, take half a days school and half a days holiday during the months of July and August, the children and everybody would reap the benefit, for they come back dirty and wild, and it takes sometime to get them settled down to work again. To me it seems so much time lost, they only run wild and race about most of the time they are in camp. As regards the holidays of the staff, I always make it a rule they can take two weeks anytime during the year, and at the time that suites them best, and I find it works well.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.R. Haynes.\nSeptember 14th, 1916.\n\nDear Mr. Haynes -\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant. I am glad that you had an opportunity of visiting the schools on the Sarcee and Blackfoot Reserves.\n\nWith regard to the selection of a site for a new school for you, it is impossible for me to anticipate the time of building a new school.\n\nAs you are aware our appropriation has been very much curtailed and just when the Government will see fit to increase it to the usual proportion, it is impossible for me to say.

Tims,\nSarcee Reserve,\nCalgary, Alta.\nIN THIS AGENCY THERE ARE TWO BOARDING SCHOOLS.\n\nTHE VICTORIA HOME (CHURCH OF ENGLAND) AND THE SACRED HEART (ROMAN CATHOLIC) BOARDING SCHOOLS.\n\nThe Victoria Home School is situated just off the western boundary of the Reserve. The Principal, Rev. W.R. Hayner resides on the Reserve as missionary, and the school is run by an assistant principal. This has been vacant lately but there is a new man who is to take over the duties of principal after he has been here three months. The same objection as before still remains, too many changes and the lack of an energetic man. There have been five boys discharged from this school lately and I think it wasted money that they cannot speak better after being in school ten or eleven years.

I told him that I wanted to get away by the afternoon 31st and he informed me that he would come down on the 29th and check over the Department property, but he failed to put in an appearance up till 2 o'clock of the 31st. All the Department property was checked and in its place, and everything left in order, and the keys of the building given to Albert Bear, M.E., and Agent Schmidt notified by postcard.\n\nThe Department do not owe the John Smith's Indians any accounts. I paid Mrs. Adam Charles for assisting me for months of May and June and sent Agent Schmidt the receipt for same asking cheque to be made to me, but same has not reached me, I will inquire of Agent Schmidt for this ashe will be aware of the circumstances.\n\nMy overseers cheque and matron's cheque for month of July has not been received. I surmise I may expect these at an early date.\n\nI am really sorry that you could not personally see the outfit we left, and what we have come into. We left a tidy order, clean, and well kept. This is filthy, disgracefully dirty, badly arranged and I should say poorly looked after in the past. The children are away in a camp for a holiday for a few days, which will give us an opportunity to set fixed a little. I have never come into such a disgraceful place as regards dirt.\n\nHowever we are coming in with a new staff with the exception of the outside man, and changes for the better could be managed without difficulty.\n\nI must ask you to excuse the watered ink and many subjects in one letter.

As these returns have not yet been revised I am unable to forward them to the Bena Department. This school has never before caused this office one tenth part of the trouble we are now experiencing as the frequent and persistent absconding of pupils has become invererate at this institution since the Rev. Mr Middleton was appointed Principal. The attitude taken by Mr Middleton and his assistant seems to be that they are in no way responsible, and have not to bother about these boys running away from the school, and that this matter is the concern of this office only. The requests for the return of absentees from this school have been so frequent since Mr Middleton took charge that this staff having their own duties to perform had not the time to be continually on the road after these truants. This being the case I asked Mr Middleton to come to the office or his assistant to make out information forms so that I could issue a warrant to the R.C.M. Police for the return of these boys. This he did for quite some time and the boys were returned by the police much more speedily than this staff could have done on account of our Indians being scattered all over the country working at the outside threshing. However since I refused to certify to incorrect returns for him, he has refused to make out information in the proper manner and therefore preventing me from issuing warrants to the police without which they will not act, this is pure peevishness and quite obvious to any one. My request that the school authorities come here and make out information forms is reasonable and necessary as a warrant cannot be issued.\nwithout this form first being made out and as this is only the work of a minute it can in no way work a hardship on the school authorities and would also facilitate the return of the boys although I doubt very much if this will prevent the desertions from this school which I am afraid under the present management will be of frequent occurrence. There seems to be an utter lack of sympathy for the boys on the part of the Principal and his assistant as the following incident will show. Two of the boys who had run away from school returned on Monday the 8th inst., it was during the dinner hour and they were not even asked to share the meal with the other children; the Principal or his assistant never took these boys in charge in fact as far as my information goes they were utterly ignored. One boy was let go home again with his guardian and the other boy simply walked out of the school to the camp again. This to me is absurd and past all understanding a school cannot be run along these lines with any hope of success amongst Indians. It seems to me that it was the duty of the Principal or his assistant to interview these boys at that time. Just another instance of the absurd way in which things are run at this school. A few weeks ago an Indian named Crow Shoe returned his boy to the school, on meeting the assistant Principal he told him that he had brought his boy back but that the Agent had said that the boy was not to be whipped, this was not true, but I suppose that the Indian was anxious about his boy, the assistant Principal immediately told him to take his boy away this boy has not returned to the school. This sort of thing is amazing? I met Bishop Pinkham during his recent visit to this reserve and talked this matter over with him in presence of the C of E Missionary and the agency clerk and His Lordship agreed with me that I had asked Mr Middle- tom nothing but what was reasonable in regard to the school matters.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter from the Corporal in charge of the R.C.M. Police stationed on this reserve which speaks for itself, and will show the Department just what amount of extra work this school is causing and how absolutely impossible it would be for this staff to manage all this running around after deserters from Mr Middletons School. Will the Department in view of the facts which I have laid before them, issue instructions to the Principal of the C of E School here, that when this office asks him to come and make out information forms that he is expected to do so, as it is impossible for me to issue warrants to the police for these boys.\n\nIndian Affairs.

He was at that time coming to this office and making out information forms in the proper manner and I was on the strength of these informations issuing warrants to the police for the boys who had run away. This was giving satisfaction and the boys were returned regularly. But it is plain to anyone that since I refused to certify his incorrect returns correct, he now takes the ridiculous stand that he does not have to make information forms in the usual manner and is therefore working a great harm to this Institution.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 1C, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose quarterly returns of the C.O.F.E Boarding School which have been corrected.\n\nI regret to report that out of 18 boys at this school 14 have deserted, and that the majority of them have been absent for a month.\n\nI spoke to the Assistant Principal who was in the office this morning about this matter, but he would not sign information forms for a warrant, because Mr Middleton had told him he was not to do so.\n\nI regret this attitude of Mr Middleton's very much as he is doing this school incalculable harm by his bull headedness, as he must be aware that a warrant is a legal instrument; it must of necessity be issued in the proper manner and he should sign the information form that goes with the warrant and on which the warrant is issued.\n\nMr Middleton's remarks in the margin of his returns, complains that his returns were held up for Canon Gould's inspection, this is untrue as the returns were sent back to him for correction long before Canon Gould arrived here. Mr Middleton's charge that I have incorrect returns for this school before is also untrue as I can prove by the late Principal and my staff. His remarks are in keeping with his usual reckless handling of the truth. As all the parents of the absentees have been interviewed by myself or some other member of this staff and urged to send their children to school, the reply is always the same; we will not send our children back to Mr Middleton, they evidently regard him with a great deal of disfavour. It is very evident I am sure to the Department that there is something radically wrong with the management of this school or there would be no such trouble as we are now experiencing.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\nExtract from Agent's Report on the Peigan C. E. Boarding School for the month of October, 1920. Original on 63654-7\n\nThe management of this school is bad. Never since I took over the agency has this school caused the trouble we are now having. The boys have no supervision and are out of hand completely. On the other hand the girls are well looked after by Miss Stapleton and do not give the slightest trouble. They are under her constant supervision and Miss Stapleton is a most capable and efficient girls' matron. I cannot commend her work too highly. She takes a keen interest in her work and in her girls.\n\nCanon Gould's proposed visit to this school being known before his arrival here, he, of course, did not see this school under normal conditions. Out of 18 boys 14 are absent. This is to be regretted but it cannot be otherwise where supervision is so lax. The Indians realize this and complain of the lack of sympathy with the boys and in many cases tell me that they will not send their children to Mr. Middleton's school. It is entirely the fault of the school authorities that these boys have not been returned, as I have repeatedly asked the principal to lay information in the usual manner so that I could issue a warrant for these boys to the police. This, I regret to say, he refuses to do. The police, who are not stationed here at the agency, have two constables and a native scout and are ready and willing at all times to execute a warrant for these absentees. The information forms are here and all that is needed is the principal's signature, but this small matter seems to be too much of an effort for him and he refuses to co-operate with the police and myself in returning the boys.\n\nSgd. Thomas Graham\nAgent.\nSir,\n\nI was informed yesterday the 17th that the new officer commanding the R.C.M.P at Macleod has given this detachment orders that they can return truant boys without a warrant on receiving instructions from me to do so.\n\nI have issued the police a list of the absentees from this school and they are now taking this matter in hand; this will relieve the situation here in regard to the runaways.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nReverend Canon Gould, M.D.,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nM.S.C.C. Offices,\nToronto.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nRelative to the letter written you by Indian Agent Graham in which he states that it is necessary to issue a Warrant for the apprehension of the deserters, I was informed, in a recent letter received from the Department of Indian Affairs, that in case of any absentees I was to notify the Indian Agent, whose duty it was to have them returned to the School. Such has been done in every case.\n\nIt is now November 8th, and nothing has been done towards returning the deserters. If such a policy is allowed to proceed, the Grant earned during this Quarter for the attendance of pupils will, in consequence of their absence, be reduced to an almost negligible amount. Yet full provision was made regarding foodstuffs, etc., for a full attendance. It is evident that direct action needs to be taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) S.H.Middleton,\nPrincipal.\nPeigan Boarding School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nNovember 20, 1920.\n\nRev. Canon Gould, M.D.,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nM.S.C.C. Office,\nToronto.\n\nDear Canon Gould:\n\nRelative to the question of attendance at the above School.\n\nSince your departure, and until Wednesday the 17th, inst., none of the absentees had been returned to the School, but in the meantime seven more had deserted, thus leaving the School almost destitute of boys.\n\nIn order to have them speedily returned, I followed out most minutely the instructions as sent me by the Indian Department, and repeatedly asked for the co-operation of the Indian Agent in affecting their return. This was apparently refused, for in two specific cases he requested the people with whom the pupils were staying to keep them around camp for a few days. One of these two boys stayed in Mr. Haynes' house for three successive nights, and the Missionary then started a report amongst the Indians that the boy was so filthy and dirty that he had to provide him with a change of clothing, asserting that was the reason the boy left the School. I might state here that this same boy had been absent from the School eleven days prior to his visit to the Mission House, (of which fact Mr. Haynes was quite aware), and during that time had slept in several Indian houses and in hay stacks, and had not taken off his clothing since leaving School.\nThe Missionary has also during the past week been soliciting complaints about the School from a neighboring rancher, but asking that his name might not be mentioned. Needless to say, such conduct met, (in this case) with a well deserved rebuke. The inference is obvious.\n\nSeeing that the Indian Agent at Brocket was openly defying constituted authority by allowing the deserters to habitually frequent the camp around the Agency, (he informed Mr. Heron that the Indians had refused to send the absentees back) I thereupon called to see the Officer Commanding the R.C.M.P. at Barracks at Macleod, and asked if he would kindly instruct his man at Brocket - Stevens - to apprehend and return the pupils to School.\n\nThis he promptly did, for nine boys were brought back yesterday by Corporal Stevens, who stated that the balance would be rounded up and returned during the next few days.\n\nI called upon the Indian Agent and read, and also left him a copy of the letter containing your conclusions dealing with the deserters. On a subsequent visit of Mr. Heron to the Office, Mr. Graham indignantly handed the letter to him, stating that \"Canon Gould's opinion carries no weight with me, as I receive my orders from the Department\".\n\nI trust that you will pardon this bald statement of facts. This is not being sent as a complaint, but simply to place before you the recent developments in order that you may be thoroughly conversant with the main events.\n\nThe points at issue are these:\n\n1. Is the School to be the loser of the grant of the absentees?\n2. Is the tone and discipline of the Institution to be demoralized by the insidious influence of outside sources?\n3. The improbability of obtaining new pupils under such conditions.\nIn view of adequate provision being made for a full attendance, and the apparent laxity, opposition, and negligence displayed by those in authority, would strongly recommend that a ruling be sought from the Department in order that the esprit de corps and finances of the School may be safe-guarded.\n\nThanking you for your past assistance, and earnestly hoping for a continued support in this problem,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n(Sgd) S.H.Middleton,\nPrincipal.\nSaturday,\n12.20 A.M.\n\nDear Mr. Middleton:\n\nOn further reflection, with regard to the subject matter of my letter to you posted last evening, I feel that I must depend on your judgement with regard to the matter of forcing the \"deserters\" back to school just at once. I am unable to judge of the state of mind among the Indians. We must avoid at all costs even apparent grounds for anything in the nature of an outbreak of their part - with their heads filled with wrong notions they might possibly take some unforeseen and regrettable action. No great harm will be done by going slowly until you have time to write me, and also for you to hear from me. Again, I say, I must depend on your considered judgement and knowledge of the Indian character.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) S.Gould,\nGen.Sec.\n\nP.S. It will be altogether better for the Executive Committee and the Indian Department at Ottawa to be able to act together in the matter. S.G.\nMagloed, October 29th, 1920.\n\nThe Rev. S. Middleton,\n\nDear Mr. Middleton,\n\nI have learned with very great regret that, following my visit, two more boys, \"George\" and \"Sam\", have deserted from the Peigan Boarding School.\n\nI have, since my visit, to the School, given a great deal of thought to the situation. I am persuaded that no just cause exists in the School itself for the desertions in question, and for those which preceded them. The children are well fed, clothed, and cared for. The discipline, while strict, has not been greater than the conditions required, while the physical punishments have been of the regulation type which are inflicted in all our schools for white children.\n\nUnder these circumstances it is, in my opinion, your duty to call upon the local Officers of the Department of Indian Affairs to exert their full influence and authority under the regulations of the Department, in returning the pupils who have deserted, to the School, and keeping them there. I do not include in this statement the two older lads, since I am very doubtful of the wisdom of retaining them in school.\n\nI hope to pay an early visit to Ottawa, and will then discuss the whole situation personally with the Deputy Inspector General for Indian Affairs. I will also take up with him the cases of the two \"older lads\" under discussion, and desire in consequence that you take no further steps, in the meanwhile, concerning them.\n\nYou are at liberty, if you so desire, to show this letter to the local Official of the Indian Department, as containing my conclusions after giving the situation my very careful consideration.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n(Sgd) S. Gould, General Secretary\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nD.C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Inspector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn accordance with your wish I beg, herewith, to place in writing the chief points discussed in our conversation of yesterday.\n\n1. The Peigan Boarding School:\nOn the occasion of my recent visit, October 25th, to this School, I found awaiting me, on arrival, a note from Mr. Graham, the Indian Agent, making request that I call to see him. This I did, about 9:00 a.m. in his office, and thus discussed with him certain matters in connection with the School, prior to talking them over with either the Principal of the School or the Missionary on the Reserve.\n\nI subsequently had conversations with the Principal of the School, with the resident master, with the missionary on the Reserve, with the local officer of...\nthe Mounted Police, and also had a \"pow-wow\" in the evening with about fifteen Indians.\n\nMy first visit to this School was made two or three years ago when we were making preliminary investigations with a view to the taking over by the M.S.C.C., from the several dioceses concerned, of full and direct responsibility for the Indian work.\n\nAt that time, I was deeply impressed with the prevailing unsatisfactory conditions. I found, for example, two of the older boys chained together as a punishment for desertion, taking with them the school team and rig. I found other conditions which I described to you, in brief, yesterday. The missionary was then in charge with an Assistant Principal in residence.\n\nOur Executive Committee, as soon as possible after taking over responsibility for the School, endeavoured to put an end to this condition of affairs by appointing the Rev. S.W. Middleton, Principal of the Blood School, Acting Principal, also, of the Peigan School; with a resident master, Mr. Heron, in direct charge.\n\nThe immediate results were apparently very good. Discipline was asserted and a Cadet Corp organized, followed by a successful Field Day held by the united Cadet Corps of the Blood and Peigan Schools.\n\nThe elder girls also were taken, along with those of the Blood School, for a month's holiday to the very\nsatisfactory summer camp held on this Society's leased property at the Waterton Lakes. I visited Waterton Lakes, I may add, and found it a delightful spot. Our Executive Committee, on my recommendation, has voted the money needed, for the erection there next spring, of an enlarged and satisfactory girls dormitory.\n\nOn my recent visit, in view of the conflicting statements given me, concerning severity of discipline, I paid particular attention to the bearing of the children in the School, especially the boys, and came to the conclusion that their free and easy conduct conveyed no impression of \"terrorism\", on the part of those in charge. I noticed, for example, the fact that although the Principal, the Resident Master, and I were in an adjoining room, with only a thin partition between, the boys formed up in their play room and headed by a \"mouth organist\", more vigorous than musical, marched around the room. Boys, who are treated with undue harshness, do not, I submit, engage spontaneously in such \"antics\" in the very near neighborhood of their masters.\n\nFollowing the summer holidays, two of the larger boys who have given repeated trouble failed to return, and their example was apparently, to some extent, responsible for the repeated desertions which have, since, taken place.\n\nThe causes of these desertions are to be sought, I am persuaded, more in influences which exist outside the School than in conditions which are to be found within its walls. One of the boys I understand, for example, deserted\nthe night following his \"birthday party\" which had been held in the School in his honour.\n\nThe \"outside conditions\" in question must, I believe, be faced and overcome, and they must be overcome through the co-operation of the authorities of the Indian Department and of the Missionary Society in insisting that all the local agents of both shall submerge personal antipathies and work together in loyal co-operation for the success of the School.\n\nI enclose copies of:\n\n(1) My letters, dated Oct. 29th, and Oct. 30th, written to the Principal prior to my return from the West.\n\n(2) The Principal's letters to me, dated Nov. 8th, 9th, and 20th, and received this morning.\n\nIn conclusion there is no question in my mind but that the two boys, Joe Warrior and Bert Stripped Squirrel, are incorrigible, and that they should be brought back to the School and then formally and publicly dismissed. As for the others, there is no way open before us, if the old methods of \"incarceration\" and \"chaining up\" are to be forever eradicated, as they have and must continue to be, than to insist that every deserter shall be brought back every time he deserts and be given such \"regulation type\" of punishment as his offence demands. In this way only, I am certain, can the boys, the parents, and all others concerned be convinced that petty intrigue and wholesale desertion will not be tolerated as the local expression of dissatisfaction with the means adopted by those responsible.\nto end an intolerable condition of indiscipline and, as a first step in the rather long task of placing the School upon a basis satisfactory alike to the authorities of the Department of Indian Affairs and of the Missionary Society.\n\nIn view of the conditions described there is, I think, much force in Mr. Middleton's contentions with regard to grants, etc., as outlined in the final paragraph of his letter dated November 20th.\n\nIn view of the great, but necessary, length of this letter, I reserve the discussion of the \"other points\" for a further communication.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mr. Middleton, the Principal of the school, and our local Agent, Mr. Graham, with reference to the matter.\n\nIt is hoped with closer cooperation on the part of the school authorities and the Agent and the disregarding by them of any personal differences, that the present unsatisfactory conditions, especially as regards the frequent desertions from the school, will cease.\n\nBoth the Agent and the Principal are being informed that the two boys mentioned by you as the worst offenders are to be brought back to the school and then formally and publicly dismissed and other absentees are to be returned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

These have been of such frequent occurrence in the past few months as to seriously interfere with the work and success of the school. I have recently, in an interview with Rev. Canon Guild, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, discussed this matter with him.\n\nThe present conditions should be faced and overcome through the co-operation of yourself and your staff acting in harmony with the local Indian Agent, and any personal differences which exist should be disregarded and all work together in loyal co-operation for the success of the school. The Department cannot tolerate these frequent desertions and it is thought that yourself and the staff should be able to exercise closer supervision over the pupils and see that they do not get the opportunity to run away.\n\nRegarding the two most persistent truants, namely, Joe Warrior and Bert Stripped Squirrel, I beg to say that these boys should be returned to the school and then they should be formally and publicly dismissed. It is necessary, in the interests of the discipline of the school and as a lesson to the parents, that this course be carried out in their case. All the other pupils who are absent should be returned as soon as possible and they and the parents should understand that any pupil absconding in future will be returned to the school.\n\nWith reference to the payment of the grant for pupils who are absent without leave I beg to say that, owing to the expense involved in having them returned to the school, the Department would not be justified in allowing the school the grant.\n\nRev. S. H. Middleton,\nPrincipal,\nPeigan (C.E.) Boarding School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nfor them while they are absent. I might point out that the expense occasioned during the past months, owing to the employment of the police in returning deserters, has been heavy. When a deserter is returned to the school it is expected that yourself and the staff will see that such pupil does not again get the opportunity to run away. It is considered, with due supervision by yourself and the staff, acting in harmony with the local Agent, that the causes which have led to the frequent absconding will cease.\n\nYou should endeavour, with the assistance of the staff and the Agency officials, to overcome any prejudicial feeling against the school on the part of the parents, and I trust that more favourable reports will be received and that you will meet with every success in your future work in this school.\n\nI am today writing Mr. Agent Graham and requesting him to co-operate with you and assist you in every way that he can in carrying on the work and making it a success, and I confidently hope that the present misunderstandings between the school and the agency will cease and that both will work together in the interests of the school. The Agent is also being requested to take immediate steps to have all pupils returned to the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 30, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th instant and previous correspondence regarding the present management of the Peigan (C.E.) Boarding School, and more especially to your remarks regarding the persistent truancy of the boys, I beg to say that I have discussed this matter with the Rev. Canon Gould, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada. I have also carefully considered your reports in this connection.\n\nThe Department cannot tolerate these frequent desertions from the school and you should take the necessary steps to have all children returned to the school as soon as possible. The Principal is today being written to and informed that it is expected that he and the staff will see that a closer supervision is kept over the pupils and steps taken by them to see that the pupils do not get the opportunity to run away. The pupils and their parents should understand that these wholesale desertions will not be tolerated. It would appear that the children are well fed, clothed and cared for and the discipline, while strict, has not been greater than the conditions required. It is thought that the present conditions would be, in a large measure, overcome by the cooperation of yourself and the agency staff acting in harmony with the Principal, and all personal differences existing between the agency and the school should be overlooked and both should work together in loyal cooperation for the success of the school. The Principal is also being informed to that effect.\n\nWith reference to the two boys who are persistent truants, namely,- Joe Warrior and Bert Stripped Squirrel, they should be brought back to the school and then formally and publicly dismissed and you should see that this is done.\n\nThe Principal of the school is being informed in accordance with the above and he is also being informed that Thomas Graham, Esq., Indian Agent, Brocket, Alta.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nthe per capita grant cannot be paid for pupils who are absent without leave, as, owing to the expense involved in having them returned, the Department would not be justified in allowing the grant for them, and also, at the same time, paying the expenses in returning them to the school.\n\nI confidently hope that any misunderstanding existing between yourself and the Principal and any prejudices on the part of the parents against the school will, through the co-operation of yourself and the Principal, be overcome, and that, working together in the interests of the school, the desertions will cease and the work at this school will meet with every success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear sir:\n\nThere is no doubt to my mind that the case re deserters mentioned in your letter of the 30th, ult., has been mis-represented to you in some way or other.\n\nDesertion has not been so frequent during the last few months as it has for several years. As to the cases of desertion reported interfering with the success of the work of the School, such is entirely misconstrued, for when I assumed responsibility of the administration of this Institution, look where I would, I failed to find the least vestige of discipline or order. Chaos and laxity reigned supreme.\n\nIt is due to the enforcement of regular order and a system of real School Life which I insist upon carried out, that has been responsible for the desertions in question.\n\nThe pupils, not being accustomed to a systematized scheme of routine, and being under other influences, rebelled against the training given. I personally sought the co-operation of the Indian Agent and other Officials at Brocket, and had same been given instead of encouraging imaginary complaints and sympathizing with unjust claims, there would have been no need for this correspondence.\n\nI might state, however, that during the past four months more successes and prizes have been won at Regina and Calgary in both School Work and Training, than in any four years of the past.\n\nAm pleased to note that instructions have been issued to have the refractory truants returned, and will formally discharge the worst offenders, acting in the best interests of the School, on their being apprehended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nPrincipal.\nWe ask someone to come and talk these things over with us.\n\nHead Chief:\n- Butler\n- Little Plume\n- Little Leaf\n- Meat Face\n- Man Who Smokes\n- Man Who Drinks\n- Standing Bull\n\nChief:\n- Chief John Horn\n- Edward White Head\n- Frank Holloway\n- Samuel Hamilton\n- Big Red Tail\n- Little Leaf\n- Joe Buffalo\n- Jack Ross\n- James Cheeky\n- Running Eagle\n- One Owl\n- Red Young Man\n- Big Crow Shoe\n- Good Chaser\nMedicine Cat\nLittle Person\nTiny Robe\nBear\nBeach Heater\nFour Horse Pin\nJack Dale\nBiggie\nTradesman\nJohn Rider\nSmall Tip\nIndian Woman\nShe Belle\nBig Chief\nBig Chief\nBlack Bear Away\nLong Medicine\nWhite Buffalo\nYellow Wolf Valley\nChief Bull\nClark City\nWillie Thompson\nLady Boy\nMedicine Crazy Man\nWillie\nIndian State\nThe Horse\nIndian Horse\nIndian Horse\nWe ask someone to come and talk these things over with us.\n\n| Head Chief | Chief |\n|------------|-------|\n| Butcher    | X     |\n| Little Plume | X   |\n| Little Leaf | X     |\n| Meat Face  | X     |\n| Man Who Smokes | X |\n| Jim Man Who Smokes | X |\n| Morning Bull | X     |\n| Old Morning Bull | X |\n| Jack Spear | X     |\n| Dandy Spear | X     |\n| Sam Warrior | X     |\n| Baby Warrior | X    |\n| Escapes    | X     |\n| Paul White Cow | X |\n| Yellow Horn | X     |\n| John Yellow Horn | X |\n| Frank Red Horse | X |\n| Edward White Moustache | X |\n| Frank Halloway | X |\n| Samson Knowlton | X |\n| Nap Big Bull | X     |\n| Jim Little Lear | X |\n| Joe Buffalo | X     |\n| Jack Crow  | X     |\n| James Chickey | X |\n| Black Eagle | X     |\n| One Owl    | X     |\n| Red Young Man | X |\n| Will Crow Shoe | X |\n| Good Chaser | X     |\n| Medicine Calf | X |\n| Little Person | X |\n| Wolf Robe  | X     |\n| Bear       | X     |\n| Angel Feather | X |\n| Four Horse Jim | X |\n| Wolf Tail  | X     |\n| Muggin     | X     |\n| Grass Water | X     |\n| John Rider | X     |\n| Small Legs | X     |\n| Under Stands it | X |\n| Thos Scott | X     |\n| Lee Smith  | X     |\n| Philip Big Swan | X |\n| No Chief   | X     |\n| Dick Runs Away | X |\n| Cold Weather | X |\n| North Peigan | X |\n| Sidney Wolf Talks | X |\n| Chief Noe  | X     |\n| Sharp Edge | X     |\n| Samson Knowlton | X |\n| Crazy Boy  | X     |\n| Maurice Prairie Hen | X |\n| White Owl  | X     |\n| Shining Double | X |\n| Joe Warrior | X     |\n| Widow Mrs. Warrior | X |\n| Hair On Body | X |\n\nIndian Affairs.

Boarding School for the month of January. Original on 53634-7\n\nThere have been some changes in the duties of the staff of this school this month. Miss Wilkins is now boys' matron and is doing splendid work. These boys, before she took them in hand, were lousy and dirty. She has everything cleaned up and in good shape and by giving the boys constant and sympathetic supervision has put a stop to the truancy amongst the boys at this school. This bears out what I have already reported to the Department in connection with this school. The whole cause of the frequent truancy here was the utter lack of sympathy displayed by the principal and assistant principal towards the little Indian boys. Deaconess Stapleton's work with the girls of this school has always been excellent. She is a splendid matron and I regret to hear that Mr. Middleton is thinking of sending her away. This will be a very great loss to the school as the deaconess has the confidence of the Indian girls and their parents have a very great regard for her.\n\nThos. Graham,\nAgent.\nExcerpt:\n\nMISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN CANADA,\nThe Mission Board,\nToronto, Ontario, April 5th, 1921.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.,\nDeputy Inspector General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\n(7) Our Indian Commission has given attention to the various matters complained of in connection with the Peigan boarding school, and the Executive Committee has determined, on its recommendation, to bring to an end as soon as may be convenient, the arrangement under which the Rev. S. H. Middleton has been acting as Principal of both the Blood and the Peigan schools, and a new Acting Principal will be appointed to the Peigan institution in full charge. The experiment of placing the two institutions under Mr. Middleton's principalship has been, I think, worth trying and, incidentally, has yielded some good results. In view, however, of the \"various local irritations\" and since the whole matter of the new joint institution is postponed, we think it better to revert to the old plan of separate principals. The new Acting Principal of the Peigan institution will, however, be in direct and complete charge. There will be no reverting to the old state of affairs under which the missionary on the Peigan reserve was the Principal of the school, with the Vice-Principal acting under him.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nS. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary.\nMay 11, 1921.\n\nDear Canon Gould,\n\nI beg to refer to that portion of your letter of the 5th ultimo which deals with the question of management of the Peigan and Blood boarding schools. I am quite in accord with your action in appointing a principal for each of these institutions. I note also that you will not revert to the old system, whereby the missionary on the Peigan was the principal of the school. This, I also think, should tend towards better management.\n\nSo soon as you have made a choice of principal for the Peigan, kindly advise me.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Canon S. Gould,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMissionary Society of the Church of England,\n131 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nToronto, Ontario, May 17th, 1921.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., C.M.G.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott;-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter, dated May 11th. I will inform you as soon as possible of the name of the Acting Principal to be appointed for the Peigan Boarding School.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nSG/DC.\nSir,\n\nMr Giggle Principal of the C.of.E Boarding School has requested me to ask the Department if they will allow grant for 35 pupils at his school, as he can get this number, but does not want to take them in without the grant. Mr Giggle is a most capable Principal and an excellent teacher, and if the Department can see their way to paying grant for 35 pupils at this school and putting it on an equal footing with the R.C. school in this respect, it would be a great benefit to the Indian children of the C.of.E. on this reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSIR\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It would appear from a communication received from our Agent that Mr. Giggie is performing the duties of Principal.\n\nI will be pleased if you will furnish information as to his qualifications and experience, and also state whether he is appointed Principal, or Acting Principal. Our Agent states that he is a most capable Principal and an excellent teacher.\n\nWe are authorizing an increase in the pupilage from the first of the current month. This will provide a grant for 35 pupils, the same as is allowed at the Catholic School on the same Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev.

This will provide for a total of 35 children at this school. You should inform the Principal accordingly, and he may recruit a sufficient number of new pupils to bring his enrollment up to the number allowed.\n\nThe usual applications and certificates of health should be forwarded for any new pupils obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I do not know the precise nature of the appointment, whether Principal or acting Principal. I am writing to Rev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D., Secretary of our Indian Commission, Bible Society House, Winnipeg, asking him to communicate with you on the matter and pointing out that as I understand the position, the Church possesses the right only to appoint acting Principals, the appointments of Principals being made by the Indian Department on the nomination of the Church responsible for the management of the Institution concerned.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

H. Giggle had been appointed Principal or Acting Principal of the Victoria Home on the Peigan Reserve, his qualifications, experience, etc., I have the honour to furnish you with the following particulars:\n\n1. The position to which Mr. Giggle has been appointed is that of Acting Principal. I enclose a copy of my letter of July 15th to your Agent, in which this fact is stated.\n\n2. Mr. Giggle's qualifications are to some extent set forth in the Copies of Testimonials which you will please find enclosed herewith.\n\nIn addition to these I may add that he holds a Second Class Teacher's Certificate in the Province of Saskatchewan, and the F.G.C.M. standing in music.\n\nAs to Mr. Giggle's experience I may say, in addition to the information given in the Testimonials enclosed, that some years ago he held for two years the position of Acting Principal of the Victoria Home. Owing to illness he was obliged to move to a more temperate climate, and this he found in B.C. where he held for some time the position of Teacher and Bandmaster in St. George's School Lytton.\n\nTrusting the above information may meet your requirements, I have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary L.S.C.C.\n\nT.B.R.W./B.T.\n39-40 The Bible House,\nAlexander ve., Innipe.,\nJuly 15th, 1921.\n\nThomas Graham, Esq.,\nThe Peigan Agency,\nBrocket, Alta.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to inform you that from the 1st of July Mr. H. Giggle has been placed in charge of the Victoria Home on the Peigan Reserve as Acting Principal. Mr. Giggle had charge of that Institution some years ago and will be, I believe, not a complete stranger to you. With his appointment I am hopeful that complete harmony may exist between the School and the Agency, and without which no lasting or beneficial results can be obtained.\n\nWith kind regards, Believe me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n(Rgd.) R.R. estate.\n\nField Secretary L.C.C.\nCopies of Testimonials\n\nMr. W. H. Giggle served his pupil-teachership under me in South Ossett Church of England School. He was a diligent and painstaking teacher, and generally obtained good results in his class. His class would mostly range from fifty to sixty boys and girls. He was steady, punctual, and respectful in his conduct towards myself and the managers, and firm but kind with the children. He is a musician, and possesses a good voice. His character is I believe irreproachable.\n\nJoseph Cox (Headmaster)\n\nMiddlestow Vicarage\nWakefield, England\n\nI have much pleasure in adding my testimony to the good qualities of Mr. Giggle as a teacher. During the time he was with us in our mixed school at Middlestown the managers were thoroughly satisfied with his work, and since Mr. Giggle left us I have had opportunities of seeing him. I believe him to be a very reliable man, and that he bears an excellent character.\n\nGarvin C. Hamilton (Correspondent for Managers)\n\nWrenthorpe Vicarage\nWakefield,\n\nMr. W. H. Giggle has been personally known to me for many years past, and I have a high esteem for him and his wife. When I was Vicar of South Ossett Mr. and Mrs. Giggle were great helpers and workers in our Mission of St. Aidan's. Mr. Giggle was voluntary organist and choirmaster for several years, and only resigned when going abroad. His musical ability, patience, and tact brought the choir up to a high state of efficiency, and we were all most sorry to part with him. His work was not only in church music, but in what might be called \"secular\" music as well, and he was highly thought of by the members of the choir and the congregation. Both Mr. and Mrs. Giggle are devout churchfolk and communicants, and I shall always be glad to hear of their welfare.\n\nJohn H. Kirk (Vicar)\n\nForest Glen S.D. No. 1801.\nMay 31st, 1920.\n\nI made a fairly thorough examination of your school today, and beg to report as follows:\n\nGrade III coming on strongly in reading and arithmetic. It is now at the stage where it must broaden out in its reading to enrich its intelligence.\n\nGrade II is also up to standard or rather above standard considering that the two pupils are only six and seven years old.\n\nGrade IV is rather weak all round, and Grade V. only one pupil is barely average.\n\nGrade VI. two pupils are doing exceedingly well giving a brilliant review in history and geography, showing a good grasp of arithmetic and displaying excellent work in their exercise books. The average of Grade VIII. was also good though the pupils differ considerably in ability. Their exercise books were also excellent.\n\nMr. Giggle displays the same thoroughness and careful organization of his work that I noted in my last report. You have a very superior teacher in Mr. Giggle.\n\nJ.A. McLead Inspector of Schools, Estevan Inspectorate.\nThe worst conditions in an Indian residential school that I encountered on my 1 months' tour were found in this institution. The building is old and in a dilapidated condition. The number of pupils enrolled was 31. The evidences as to the class-room work were most discouraging. The dormitory accommodation was poor. Mattresses were apparently unknown; folded quilts were used. The milk supply for a total of 37 in the institution was limited to one cow. I spoke to the Principal regarding this and he stated that he had asked for more stock, but that he had not heard from Rev. Dr. Westgate, of Winnipeg. The health of the children was rather poor, and the Agent and others believe that a hospital is needed in this Agency.\nOTTAWA, August 9th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant furnishing information regarding the qualifications of Mr. W.

Canon S.

The school, inside and out, certainly differed a great deal from the last time I saw it. The Department, since my last visit, authorized $1500.00 to be spent on this school, and as far as I could see, it has been well spent. The interior of the class room has been renovated throughout with new floor, beaver boards on walls, ceiling, etc. There are also new floors in several of the other rooms. The broken down plaster has been repaired, walls kalsomined and woodwork painted. The school is, therefore, now in a habitable condition, both for the children and the staff. From personal observation, the staff are pulling well together and doing good work at the school, and there has certainly been a great change in the management ever since the present principal took charge, some time last spring. Taking everything into consideration, there is a great deal of improvement at this agency compared with a year ago.\nI visited the Church of England school which is in charge of Geo. T. Roe and a staff of five - one man and four women. I found a wonderful change here since my last visit and it is indeed surprising what Mr. Roe has done with this building so much of the work was done by himself. The school was in perfect order, the children clean, the premises very nice that could be desired. The church house and notably good officer in Mr. Roe and from what I could gather I should say he has a good staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. A.

The dormitories are, boys: - 24' x 30' x 12' high and the girls 25' x 18' x 12' high.

School here laid a complaint against four young Indians for entering the girls dormitory of the school.\n\nThe case was heard by Magistrate Graham and as I succeeded in having the charge reduced to causing a disturbance the boys pleaded guilty and were given six weeks in the Blairmore A.P.F. barracks.\n\nThe evidence brought however, that the boys could gain access to the girls at any time during the night and that the girls were in the habit of getting out at night at will, notwithstanding the same manner without the knowledge of any of the staff. I have repeatedly urged on the Principal, the necessity of stricter oversight of the pupils in his care as this condition has existed for some time but it would appear that my instructions have been utterly disregarded.\n\nI do not think that I am unreasonable in expecting that the staff of seven should maintain proper supervision of thirty or pupils and as they have proven that they are not doing so, I would recommend that the Principal be replaced by a man of greater weight.\n\nAttached hereto please find a request for iron-bound heavy four inch mesh wire to place over the windows. These will cost in the neighborhood of $100.00\n\nI am not recommending that this expenditure be incurred till other measures be tried as this would practically turn the school into a prison.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) G.A.

Arthur, in which he complains of Mr. Roe's management of the Church of England School on the Peigan Reserve.\n\nI question very much whether the proper action was taken with regard to the boys who were guilty of the offence. It is not good advertisement for the Department, and I quite agree with the Indian Agent when he says that with a staff of seven they should be expected to exercise supervision of thirty pupils. There is something radically wrong here.\n\nI doubt very much whether we should have iron netting over the windows. What would happen in case of fire. What is needed here is better management. I am enclosing this letter for your advice.\n\nI may say that I found Mr. Roe a practical man in many ways. He certainly improved the school building with his own work, and straightened matters out regarding the premises generally, but it seems to me that he has fallen down in his management of the School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

Indian Residential School. The attention of Dr. Westgate, Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., is being drawn to this situation and I expect that remedial measures will be taken without delay. The Department agrees with you that a heavy wire netting over the windows in question is not a satisfactory solution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

Indian Residential School. There have been certain irregularities at the school, which have resulted in the commitment to prison of four young men of the Indian Band, and there has apparently been, at night, a lack of supervision on the part of the school staff.

I pointed out to the Commissioner that, as the Indian Agent had taken a strong dislike to Mr. Roe, on account of his refusal to allow the Indian girl pupil, Alice Big Smoke, to leave school before her time to act as housemaid at the Agency residence, our Society could not agree to such action, before a careful investigation of the whole of the circumstances referred to had been made. This will now be taken in hand, and a further communication will be addressed to you at a later date.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nDear Sir,\n\nNo irregularities, unsatisfactory condition etc., at the above School, contained in your letter of the 9th inst., the undermentioned report, taken from my Diary will, I think, cover the whole of the circumstances:\n\n1924.\nApril 29. Had suspicions something was going wrong in the School amongst the girls. Mrs. Roe instituted a search this afternoon, and found letters and bunch of keys in mattress of Annie Bull Pen. Had the letters incriminated 4 ex-pupils: Joe Warrior, Jackie Crowshoe, Samson Knowlton and Jim Morning Bull. Did not question the girls today with reference to contents of letters.\n\nMay 3. Took letters and keys to Mr. Arthur (Indian Agent) this morning, and we, Mr. Arthur and myself, agreed it was high time something drastic was done to stop the continual nuisance of these ex-pupils.\n\nThe A.M. Penisher Creek was advised by Mr. Arthur in my presence by phone, and agreed to come in and arrest the four ex-pupils on the following morning\u2014May 1st. Mrs. Roe found another bunch of keys, with two skeleton keys on which had evidently been supplied by the ex-pupils. Annie Bull Pen, Mary One Owl, Elizabeth and Lizzie broke away from Miss Hadden (Girls' Supervisor) whilst at exercise in School grounds. Search was made by Mr. Barlow and myself without success.\n\nMay 1. Mr. Arthur rang me up on phone, and told me he should have to report the matter. I told him it was his duty to do so, so that things could be remedied, and the long delayed necessary equipment be furnished to prevent a recurrence of the trouble. However, on reaching the Agency this morning, Mr. Arthur failed to repeat what he said over the phone, and was apparently in accord with me that the ex-pupils should be charged, and that a salutary punishment should be inflicted.\n\nOn my going round the Reserve with Mr. Arthur, to try and locate Joe Warrior, Mr. Arthur said that Johnnie Crow Eagle\u2014a Minor Chief had told him three weeks previously that these young men were breaking into the School. Mr. Arthur failed to advise me a gross neglect of duty, and amounting to connivance.\n\nDuring the drive Mr. Arthur and I stopped and spoke to Jim Morning Bull's father and Willie Knowlton. Mr. Arthur informed Willie Knowlton that the prosecuting of the 4 ex-pupils was not his doing, inferring that he would not have taken proceedings, and also to blacken me in the eyes of the Indians.\n\nAll 4 young men arrested by Constable Gauzy, A.P.P., today, and lodged in Pincher.\n\nFour girls located at May Big Bull's, and brought home in Mr. Lancaster's car, by Mr. Lancaster and myself.\n\nMay 2. About 10.30 a.m., Mr. Lancaster phoned me from the Agency to say he would be down shortly to take me to Pincher\u2014came coming before the stipendiary Mr. Graham. Mr. Arthur's attitude towards me in the waiting room of the Court anything but that of a gentleman. His solicitor, Mr. Jackson, whom I had not the faintest knowledge he was employing, and why engaged...\nI do not know, seeing that we were agreed in asking only for such punishment as would act as a deterrent. There was some difficulty prior to opening of Court as what charge to bring against defendants. Apparently that of vagrancy was agreed upon both by police Mr. Arthur and myself, and upon this charge the defendants were sentenced to six weeks at Blairmore.\n\nOn the plea of Samson Knowlton being a subject, plea made by Mr. Arthur. Mr. Gresham, the Magistrate, made comment that Knowlton appeared to be the strongest of the 4 defendants. Knowlton was let out on suspended sentence, Tom Big Smoke and Willie Crowshoe becoming bondsmen for him.\n\nMr. Arthur, on making his statement in Court, stated that he considered there was great laxity on the part of the Government and staff of the School. To this remark I begged the indulgence of the Magistrate, telling him I took strong exception to the criticism of Mr. Arthur in Court, and in making his criticism, he was not only exceeding his authority, but making remarks not relevant to the case.\n\nHis Worship nodded apparent consent to my objection, but made no comment, seeing that I was not legally represented.\n\nOutside the Court, after the case was over, Mr. Arthur called out to me, so that Sergeant Duncan and Constable Ousey could hear \"Summon your staff at 10 a.m., tomorrow Saturday morning, as I shall be down to make an investigation at the School.\"\n\nMay 3rd. Mr. Arthur visited the School this morning, accompanied by Mr. Lancaster, his clerk. It was some time before anything bearing upon the previous day's case was brought up.\n\nI asked Mr. Arthur if he had known, or rather had been informed by Johnnie Crow Eagle, a Minor Chief three weeks ago, about these ex-pupils breaking into the School, why he had not made it his business to inform me. His excuse was, that the Indians bring him so many tales, he did not place any credence in it.\n\nI also asked him his reason for exercising himself to Willie Knowlton, saying that it was not he (Mr. Arthur) that was prosecuting, to which Mr. Arthur vaguely replied he \"meant what he said.\"\n\nIt was agreed in the presence of Mr. Lancaster that the staff of the School had exercised reasonable vigilance, and that it would require the employment of a night-watchman to prevent a recurrence.\n\nAt Mr. Arthur's suggestion, wire frames should be fixed to both Girls and Boys Dormitories, and he asked me to supply him with measurements. These were forwarded to the Agency on May 6th.\n\nThe subject of Electrical connexion with the Matron's rooms adjoining the dormitories was also gone into, and Mr. Arthur promised to get advice on the matter.\n\nThis terminated the investigation, not any members of the staff being present.\n\nAs apparently no attempt has been made up to the time of writing June 12th to provide the school with these necessary wire frames for the dormitories, I should be glad if you would kindly take the matter up with the Indian Dept.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"G. A. ROE.\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

School on this Reserve. All the virtues were centred in the R.C.S. and the vices contained in our School.\n\nInvariably, on Mr. Arthur's visits to this School, he would tell me that the days of the Anglican School here were numbered, even going so far as to approximate the time - 5 years - when the school would be deserted. He has not only made this observation to me, but is also priming the Indians on the Reserve with it, and they have come and told me.\n\nAs recently as last December, Mr. Arthur had these same 4 ex-pupils and another before him at the Agency - three complaints made by me, for committing the same offence, that of breaking into the school, and he told me he had held a Court and placed them on suspended sentence. These ex-pupils apparently regarded their sentence in a very light manner, and the pending complaints made by me to the agent subsequent to their sentence, no steps were taken by him to end the nuisance. They were continually hanging around the school, and making themselves a source of annoyance and worry. I might add that 3 out of the 4 defendants had previous convictions against them.\n\nConstable Gaussey, A.F.P., Pincher Creek, the officer who had charge of the case, and an entire stranger to me, asked me on the first day I met him \"What kick has the Indian Agent against your School?\" showing to what length Mr. Arthur had allowed his feelings to run.\n\nI have evidence that, on the occasion of the Court proceedings at Pincher Creek, against two young Indians charged with breaking into Mr. Haynes' house, during his absence at the Coast, Mr. Arthur was the worse for drink, and he was under the influence of it at the Court I attended.\n\nThese two recent Court cases are sufficient to show the state of affairs on this Reserve. There is next to no police supervision beyond a weekly visit by the A.F.P. from Pincher; the rest of the week the Reserve is left to its own resources.\n\nThere should have been no difficulty in Mr. Arthur being able to end the nuisance, had he have wished, seeing that the School is off the Reserve. I found the only way to end the business, was by taking action myself.\n\nAs regards Mr. Arthur's desire to have me removed, and a stronger man appointed in my place, I would suggest that it is a weaker man he wants, and one that would swoop on his intrigues and play into his hands. I have no hesitation in saying that as long as Mr. Arthur is Agent here, our School will never get that measure of justice and equity which it has a right to demand and expect from the person holding the position of Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6260, file 763-1, part 1)\nI am attaching to this letter a letter of recent date received from the Rev. W. R. Haynes, bearing on the attitude of Mr. Arthur, which I think may be of help to you in arriving at your conclusions.\n\nWith regard to No Chief's boy now in the H.C.School, I have evidence to show that it was the express wish of No Chief's wife, who survives her husband some little time, that the boy should be placed in the C.of H.School. This wish was expressed some time before her death. I know the Indian and his wife to whom it was made, and I should like to know if the will of No Chief was made when he (No Chief) was too indifferent to its contents, owing to approaching death, why all the other provisions in the will have been executed.\n\nMr. Arthur's explanation in his letter to Mr. Ferrier, Feb. 5th, a copy of which you have on file\u2014 if accepted by the Indian Dept., makes the will invalid; also Mr. Arthur is not competent to express an opinion as to the state of the man's mind, this fact could only be borne out by medical evidence.\n\nI would strongly urge that measures be taken for the transfer of the boy to this school, and to which he was legally assigned.\n\nTrusting you will find the contents of my Report and covering letter perfectly clear,\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"G.A.Roe\".\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\n-- Re the Situation at the Peigan School. --\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of June 4 (No.116-1-1) and my replies, with enclosures, dated June 9 and 17 respectively, relative to certain conditions at our Peigan School, as reported to you by Mr. Indian Agent Arthur of the Peigan Agency, I now beg to state that the Indian and Eskimo Commission of our Society have given full and careful attention to this whole question, and have instructed me to submit to you their conclusions as follows:\n\n1. With regard to the statement which your letter contains, namely, \"There has apparently been, at night, a lack of supervision on the part of the school staff,\" they beg to state that they are unable to find any evidence whatever which might be accepted in support of this opinion. The Boys' Supervisor at this school, Miss Gregory, of Toronto, who happened to be passing through Winnipeg on June 16, on her way home on short leave of absence, was carefully interrogated on this point, and asked to furnish the Commission with a written statement. The written statement furnished declares, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I am Boys' Matron at the Victoria Home on the Peigan Reserve, and my opinion about the trouble which has happened is, that it is not due to any neglect whatsoever on the part of the Principal or the staff. The ex-pupils who caused all this trouble have been trying to do the same thing ever since I have been there. The Principal has had a lot to contend with from them: not only through...\"\ntheir coming round the school, but through their sauciness to him.... The only way he could get protection was by taking the steps he did, and he was quite justified in doing so.... The Principal and the Farm Instructor have been out night after night through the ex-pupils trying to get into the school....\"\n\nIn addition to the above statements, which our Commission have every reason to believe are fully correct, they are further confirmed in their opinion that there was no lack either of vigilance or of careful supervision on the part of the school's staff, by the uniformly good discipline maintained and progress made since Mr. Roe has been in charge. At the Regina Exhibition last year they carried off more prizes than any other Indian School, except one, which exhibited Indian School work, and information to this effect was conveyed to the Superintendent of Indian Education in a cutting from the Calgary Herald, enclosed in my letter of September 6th last.\n\nWhen the utterly inadequate facilities which the main school building provides in the way of space, equipment, modern conveniences, &c., are taken into consideration, our Commission believe that Mr. Roe and his staff have accomplished a work that no other school of the same class has excelled, and are to be highly commended for it.\n\n2. With regard to your request that I should recommend what action should be taken to safeguard this institution from future trouble, I beg to state that, in the opinion of our Commission, the most reliable safeguard against the recurrence of a trouble similar to the one in question, is to be found, not in the provision of electric alarm bells or wire frames for windows, but in a close and sympathetic co-operation between the Indian Agent and the Principal. That this does not exist at present, and has not existed for some time, the statements set forth in Mr. Roe's letter and report of June 12 make quite clear, and they are unanimously of the opinion that definite and authoritative steps should be taken in the immediate future to effect a radical improvement on this situation.\n\nIn the past, and ever since they have been entrusted with the responsibility of administering the Indian Residential Schools of our Society, our Commission have studiously refrained, even when there was ample provocation, to adopt a different course, from submitting to your Department anything after the nature of an adverse report on the conduct of any of your Indian Agents in the discharge of their duties. From this practice they are even now very reluctant to depart, as they are fully desirous that the relationship of mutual good-will which at present exists between your Department and our Society should not only remain unmolested, but be strengthened and maintained. The attitude, however, of Mr. Indian Agent Arthur...\ntowards our Peigan School, as set forth by Mr. Roe in his letter and report of June 12, and copies of which were forwarded to you on the 17th ultimo, raises, in their estimation, a question of sufficiently grave importance to warrant a departure on their part from the practice which they have observed hitherto; and, if the statements made by Mr. Roe can, as he affirms and our Commission believe, be substantiated, then we are brought face to face with a situation which, from the standpoint of our Society, is so manifestly inimical to fair play, that even with the best of good-will in the world, we should neither be asked nor expected to tolerate it.\n\n\"From the beginning of my career here (February 1922) Mr. Roe writes, 'it was evident to me that, judging by Mr. Arthur's conversations, he had very little use for our school, and that his sympathies were entirely with the R.C. School on this Reserve. All the virtues were centred in the R.C.s and the vices contained in our School'. (Letter June 12, P.1)\n\nFurther on he adds:\n\n\"Invariably, on Mr. Arthur's visits to this school, he would tell me that the days of the Anglican School were numbered, even going so far as to approximate the time - 5 years - when the School would be defunct. He has not only made this observation to me, but is also priming the Indians on the Reserve with it, and they have come and told me! (Mr. June 12, P.1)\n\nThe above statements, so far as they refer to Mr. Arthur's partiality to the Roman Catholic institution, can be supported by Mr. Haynes, our Society's Missionary on the Peigan Reserve and by Nurse Cameron, now on the staff at the Dynevor Hospital, but who, for three months, practically alone, conducted, with great acceptance and benefit to the Peigan Indians, the little Hospital opened by your Department in one of the Peigan Agency buildings.\n\nThat Mr. Arthur, or any other Agent of your Department, is at perfect liberty to entertain his own personal opinion of the relative importance of the work which is being done by the Indian Educational Institutions under the supervision of the different religious bodies, our Commission have not the slightest inclination to question; but, when expression is given to these opinions in such a way as to tend to further the efforts of the one he favours and to obstruct those of the one for which he does not entertain so high a regard, they believe that such action is not only, not in conformity with the wishes of your Department, but such as must prove seriously detrimental to the achievement of results worthy of the purpose for which these institutions are operated and maintained.\"\nThat Mr. Arthur, as Agent in Charge of the Peigan Agency, has erred in the way just intimated, our Commission have sufficient reason to believe, and they have instructed me to request you to take whatever action you may consider necessary in this important matter.\n\nThey have further instructed me to request you to reconsider the action taken by him in placing the children of No Chief in the R.C. School. This matter was brought to the attention of your Department during my last visit, which was on Oct. 26, 1923, when the Superintendent of Indian Education undertook to address a letter to Mr. Arthur in this connexion. The action taken by Mr. Arthur in this matter cannot, so far as they have been able to understand it, be justified, and they are of the opinion that, after you have given it further consideration, you will authorize the transfer of these children from the Roman Catholic to the Church of England School, to which institution it appears to them, they rightly belong.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nField Secretary M.S.C.C. and Secretary-Treasurer of their Indian & Eskimo Commission.\n\nTBRW/K.\nOttawa, October 3, 1924.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate:\n\nConsiderable thought has been given to the subject matter of your communication of July 6th, last, with general reference to the pagan C. of E. Indian Residential School. I am directing a communication to Mr. Indian Agent Arthur, asking him to bend every energy to cooperate with church workers among the Indian people. With reference to the No Chief children, the report of the Indian agent was such that no other action could be taken than placing them in the Roman Catholic institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. C. C.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, October 3, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Arthur:\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that certain church workers among the Indians of the Leigian agency feel that you are not cooperating with them in a sympathetic manner. There are so many difficulties in Indian work, that I do not need to urge you to bend every energy to work in harmony with others who are interested in our wards.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nC. A. Arthur, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBrocket, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report herewith on the affairs of this Agency for the month ending February 28/25.\n\nHEALTH\n\nOne case of Scarlet Fever broke out in the home of the Principal of the C of I school but on account of the precautions taken by the Medical Officer the disease did not spread. Considerable difficulty was experienced in maintaining a quarantine on the C of I school, caused by the very reprehensible attitude of all the female members of the staff. Whooping Cough has been prevalent amongst the children in the Indian homes but not in the schools.\n\nC. A. Arthur,\nIndian Agent.\n\nRegina, Sask., March 13rd, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will note the Agent says that considerable difficulty was experienced in maintaining a strict quarantine at the C of I school, where a case of Scarlet Fever had broken out, on account of the attitude of the female members of the staff.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, March 28, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI regret to inform you that the Department has received a report from the Indian agent relative to difficulty which was experienced in maintaining a quarantine at the Peigan C. of E. Indian Residential School when there was a case of scarlet fever at the institution. Mr. Arthur states that this difficulty was caused by the very reprehensible attitude of all the female members of the staff. I consider that this report should be made known to you, and if you have in due course any comment for the Department's attention, I should be pleased to hear from you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. T. B. R. Westgate, D.D.,\nField Secretary, M. S. W. W.,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received your letter of March 26th. (116-1-1) in which you refer (1) a \"difficulty which was experienced in maintaining quarantine\" at our Society's Peigan School when there was a case of scarlet fever at this institution, and (2) informing me that Mr. Arthur, your Indian Agent on the Peigan Reserve, stated in his report to you that \"this difficulty was caused by the very reprehensible attitude of all the female members of the staff\".\n\nWith reference to the \"difficulty\" mentioned in section (1) I beg to state that when I visited this School on the 6th of March (quarantine was lifted from the main school building by February 25th, but still remained on the Principal's residence) on my way back from the School at Wabasca, I was informed by the Matron-in-charge and the other lady agents on the staff of what had transpired at the time of Dr. Gillespie's visit on February 9th when the main school building as well as the Principal's residence were placed under quarantine.\n\nThe information which I received while it made clear to me that some unpleasantness had arisen between the doctor and the lady agents over the placing of the main school building under quarantine, did not impress me at the time as being of sufficient importance to necessitate any minute investigation of all the causes which conspired to produce the same.\n\nI investigated the situation, however, sufficiently thoroughly to convince myself that a mis-understanding had arisen over the question of posting letters from the school, and as I was informed by the lady agents that no specific instructions...\nhad been issued by the Doctor on this point, I saw no reason to doubt the veracity of this information, and especially as it was imparted to me by the three lady agents who were in residence at the school at that time.\n\nWhen I arrived in Winnipeg on March 2nd, I found a letter from Dr. Gillespie (dated Pincher Creek, February 19th) in referring to this matter he writes as follows:\n\n\"I was called to see the child of the Principal, Mr. Roe, who was suffering from Scarlet Fever. The date of my first visit was February 9th, 1925. The child with the remaining members of the family were isolated and quarantined in Mr. Roe's residence. As the principal and one or two of the children from the school had been back and forth from the school, and for the protection of the other children in the school and those in the neighborhood of Brocket I placed the school in quarantine as well. I also forbade any mail from leaving the institution.\n\nImmediately after having called the staff together and had explained to them the gravity of the situation and asked for their co-operation in keeping the disease confined to its proper limits, the teacher stalks out and up to the post office where there are three young children. The teacher says in her defense that she did not know that the school was in quarantine. I had to take her word for that but I can't conceive of a thread of truth in her statement.\"\n\nAs Mr. Roe the acting Principal was still under quarantine I sent a copy of Dr. Gillespie's letter to the Matron in charge and requested her to furnish me with a written statement on this subject. In her reply she states as follows:\n\n\"On Sunday, February 8th., \"Teddy\" (the Principal's little boy) was poorly and on Monday the Doctor came. After visiting the cottage (Principal's residence) the Doctor and Mr. Roe came back to the School. Miss Neville (the Girls' Supervisor\u2014a fully trained nurse) and I were called into the office, and told that Teddy had Scarlet Fever, and that no Indians were to come from the Reserve, nor were any of the School children to go to Brocket for a month........... Mail was not mentioned, nor were the staff called together on this occasion. After School Miss Holden (the Teacher) was told, but I do not think for a minute she realized that she could not mail her letter as was her custom, every Monday afternoon.\n\nAs Mrs. Grice who was visiting the Roos at the time was allowed to leave by the midnight train\u2014to leave the house where the fever actually was, and endanger people on the train. Miss Holden felt that she would be allowed to post her letter.\"\n\n\"On Wednesday, February 16th, Miss Neville went to speak to Mr. Roe about something, and it was then that the message came that no mail was to go out for a month\".\n\n\"On Thursday afternoon, February 17th, the Doctor called and asked to speak to the staff. While I was getting Miss Holden and Miss Cheshire, Miss Neville asked him a professional question...\"\nand he ignored her. Nor did he answer the others when they came in and passed the time of day.\n\nHe fired straight at Miss Holden telling her she was big enough and old enough to know better than to break quarantine. She asked if she had broken quarantine, why Mrs. Grice was allowed to leave the same night to travel by train. He said it was a special case.\n\nHe did not mention mail, and Miss Cheshire asked him if our mail was stopped for a month. He then forbade any of us to send out any mail for one month.\n\nFrom the above extracts it appears to me to be quite clear that any \"difficulty\" which arose was caused in the first instance through a misunderstanding.\n\nWith regard to the statement made by your Indian Agent and referred to in section (2) above, viz; that \"this difficulty was caused by the very reprehensible attitude of all of the female members of the staff\", it appears to me to be equally clear from the information contained in the Head Matron's letter, and quoted above, that the accusation made is not supported by the facts of the case.\n\nThe ladies in question may not be altogether blameless, but your representative, before he made his report, should have consulted one or more of them as to what actually happened at the time of the Doctor's visit. Had he done this, and then endeavoured to form an impartial opinion, it is very difficult to believe that his report could have contained the offensive and misleading statement you have quoted.\n\nThe accusation, however, which he has made, is quite in keeping with what I have been forced to expect from him from the attitude he has assumed towards the School in question for some time past.\n\nThe opinion of our Society with regard to this attitude was set forth in my letter to you dated July 8th, 1924 and this opinion remains unchanged.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.O.O.\n\nTBRW/JF\nOttawa, April 8, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the first instant, reporting on the difficulties at the Peigan C. of E.

Our Commission have been much concerned over the lack of harmony which has existed between the Principal, Mr. G. A. Roe and certain members of his staff, especially since the time that the School was placed under quarantine last winter, and they have decided that the services of all the members of the staff, the Principal himself included who were unable to work together in harmony must be discontinued. In due course you will be notified in the usual way through our General Secretary of our Society's nominee for the Principalship, but I thought it well to let you have this information at once as our General Secretary is absent from the City and will not be able to communicate with you until his return.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.B.R. Westgate\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\nOttawa, July 22, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, in which you give the Department advance notice of your Society's intention to make drastic changes in the staff at the Peigan C. of E.

I trust that your efforts to find suitable workers will meet with success and I shall be pleased to hear from you in this connection at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Arthur,\nIndian Agent.\nCommissioner's Office,\nRegina, Sask., July 21st, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a copy of Nurse Lucas' report of a visit to the C. of E. Indian Boarding School on the Peigan Reserve at Brocket, Alta.\n\nThe report is not at all satisfactory. Just imagine a school at the present day having the windows nailed down and no means of ventilating the dormitories. It is almost criminal, and it shows the class of man we have in charge of that institution. You will also note that they are feeding the children sour bread, and that they are not getting enough milk and butter. The Indians have good grounds for complaint here and some decisive action should be taken by the Department to remedy this state of affairs at once. Attributing the poor class of bread to the cookstove being broken is almost a joke. The Nurse reports that the school was fairly clean. I do not know how clean it was.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 4, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 406-11B of the 21st ultimo, covering Nurse Lucas' report on the Peigan C. of E. Indian Residential School. I note that this report is not at all satisfactory. I have been in correspondence with the church authorities with reference to remedial action in connection with this school, and on the 17th ultimo I received a letter from the Field Secretary of the M. S. C. C., intimating that it was the intention to make drastic changes in the staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

A. Roe who has held this position for some time retired on the 31st ultimo, and the Rev. W. Barlow who has been Principal of our Society's School at Carcross in the Yukon for four years has been appointed to succeed him and will enter on his duties from today. The experience of Mr. and Mrs. Barlow in Indian Residential School work should enable them to place and maintain the work of this institution on a satisfactory basis so far as this is possible with the existing buildings and equipment. The difficulties which confront him and his staff in this respect at this institution which I have just visited almost baffle adjectival definition, and I greatly hope that steps may be taken for the provision of a new school building in the not remote future.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFIELD SECRETARY M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Lord as Acting-Principal of the Peigan Indian Residential School. In reply to Dr. Westgate, I am pointing out the fact (I trust that my understanding of it is correct) that the appointments of Acting Principals do not require confirmation by the Department, the Church authority having the right to make such appointments, with the view of testing out the fitness for the post of the person in question. Subsequently, should it desire to do so, it submits the name to your approval for appointment as Principal.\n\nAmong the copies of correspondence forwarded to me by Dr. Westgate, I notice one from you to the effect that the matter of erecting a residence for the Principal of the Onion Lake Residential School, together with the provision of certain necessary outbuildings, has been placed in the hands of Mr. Commissioner Graham \"to do what is necessary\". You will doubtless remember the special circumstances attached to our entering into occupation of the main building of the Onion Lake School and the special assurance given me that the Principal's residence and other buildings would be provided this year. May I respectfully express my disappointment that apparently it is not the present intention to have the Principal's residence, in particular, erected according to plans and specifications drawn up by the Architect of the Department and by a Contractor responsible directly to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

St. Bentgate, and everyone connected\nwith this mission; and this title is so painted on the old wooden\nbuilding, it is always so spoken of.\n\nAllow me to explain my interest in the matter. I came to Alberta\nin 1882, by the help and advice of Lord Dufferin, after a week's residence\nat Riddell Hall. When the Peigan Agency and Mission were moved to\nBrochet, I was chiefly responsible for the building of the Victoria Home,\npaying a large proportion of the cost myself, & collecting much of the\nbalance. Soon after it was complete, Lord and Lady Aberdeen visited\nPincher Creek, where Lady Aberdeen was addressing a society. I took the\nopportunity to get Lord Aberdeen to visit the Home, and\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6369, file 763-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nformally open it, and name it, the building having commenced\nthe year before, the year of Queen Victoria's Jubilee. We therefore\nwish to keep up the name, and its connection, and I have been asked\nto write to you. I return to Victoria, B.C., where I now reside, shortly.\n\nI take the opportunity, and liberty, to add my pleasure in finding that\nmy old friend, E. Gordon Smith, is employed by the Department to\nsuperintend the work, so I know that the government, and our country,\nwill be well and conscientiously served. I was connected with him in a\nbuilding company on Vancouver Island, and he did such excellent work\non a large Indian Industrial School on Rupert Island, that the Roman\nCatholic priest in charge expressed to me his extreme satisfaction with the\nbuilding. Later, Mr. Gordon Smith was employed by the B.C. Government\nto examine and report on farms for which Government loans were applied\nfor; the official in charge of that department told me that E. Gordon Smith\nwas the most painstaking and conscientious man they had ever employed.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nF. W. Goddall.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Providing Every Modern Convenience in New Plants\n\nMARVELLOUS PROGRESS IN INDIAN EDUCATION\n\nIn fulfillment of its announced policy of providing modern educational facilities for the Indians wards of the government, the Department of Indian Affairs has under construction, and now almost completed, two fine residential schools for the education of the boys and girls of the Peigan reserve.\n\nOne school will be administered by the Roman Catholic church, and the other by the Church of England. The former building being located about six miles south east of Bracken near the Canadian border, and the latter about three and a half miles from Bracken near the highway to Fishburn.\n\nDescription of Buildings\n\nIn general plan the two buildings are similar, but in interior arrangements accommodations have been made to meet the requirements of the respective institutions; there being a number of rooms in each of the Church of England school as residential quarters for the principal and his family.\n\nThe main building of each school has 100 feet frontage, 24 feet depth, and is four stories high including the basement, beneath which there is a rear extension of one story, 100 feet by 24 feet, which contains the boiler room, machinery room, laundry, dairy, bath-room, store rooms, etc., rooms in the commodious well-lighted basement of the main building are placed the offices, library, dining-room, boys' and girls' play rooms, lavatories, store rooms and scullery. On the second floor above the entrance hall are the principal's office and school parlor, and also on this floor back of the main entrance is the school chapel, staff room, bedrooms, bathroom and store room.\n\nUpper Stories\n\nThe next above the ground floor comprises another class room, boys' and girls' dormitories, washrooms, bathrooms, attached pharmacy, a large well-lighted sewing room with access to balcony, and store rooms, all easily reached from spacious corridors which regularly increase in size.\n\nThe top floor is divided in half by a solid wall across the centre and contains boys' and girls' dormitories, well-ventilated dormitories, with sleeping accommodation for 50 children, one bedroom for the principal and one for the girls each with a supervisor's room attached. Two stairways extend from the basement to the top storey and steel fire escapes provide exit from all floors at each end of the main building. Fire-fighting hydrants are also installed at suitable points.\n\nThe schools are of frame construction throughout, with brick walls and plastered interior. The foundations are of concrete, extending one foot above grade level, and the brickwork is low for the brick veneering of the building should it ever be deemed necessary.\n\nInterior Conveniences\n\nThe most approved modern conveniences are installed throughout each building. A Dunham low pressure steam heating system of the type will provide abundant heat in severest weather, and running hot and cold water will be supplied to each building from large pneumatic storage tanks in the basement, drawn by a powerful pumping plant. Each school will have its own lighting system consisting of a 6 K.W. Lister-Branson portable lighting plant, automatic in operation. Electric bells and fire alarm gongs are provided.\n\nInstruction\n\nThe department has allotted a full section of land to each school, and in addition to the ordinary public school courses, the boys will receive training in farming, dairying, care of live stock, and carpentry; and the girls' training will include domestic science and domestic arts. Excellent buildings have been constructed for each school, consisting of a large stock barn with suitable equipment, an implement shed, and poultry house, and other outbuildings are being provided.\n\nThe plans of the schools were designed by the department's architect, Mr. J. Murray Orr, R.A., of Ottawa; and Mr. Gardner-Smith is the department's building inspector supervising the erection of the buildings.\n\nThe contractor for the Roman Catholic school is Mr. B. D. Scanlan of Medicine Hat, Alta.; Messrs. W. G. Graham and Sons, Ltd., of Moose Jaw, Sask., are the contractors for the Church of England school. These splendid buildings, when fully completed and equipped, will represent an expenditure of approximately $130,000.\n\nNo longer can it be said:\n\n\"Lo the poor Indian whose untutored soul Sees God in the clouds, or hears Him in the wind.\"\n\nWith the establishment of these modern, commodious buildings, a new era is dawning for the Peigan Indians, and under the efficient administration of the department's chief, Mr. Murray, excellent results may be confidently expected in the uplifting of the native race, and in preparing them ultimately fitting them for the duties and responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.\nBishop Sherman Warmly Welcomed By Indians Of Peigan Reservation; St. Cyprian's Principal Is Ordained\n\nNew Anglican Church Leader Spends Busy Sunday at Brocket\n\nRECEIVES MEDICINE PIPE, TOBACCO, POUCH\n\n(Special to The Herald)\n\nBROCKET, May 26\u2014His Lordship the Bishop of Calgary, Rev. Dr. Sherman, M.A., newly elected Anglican bishop of the Diocese of Calgary, accompanied by Ven. Arch-Deacon Timms of the Sarcee Reserve, made his first visit to the Peigan reservation near Pincher Creek, arriving at Brocket on March 19th.\n\nHis Lordship was met by Mr. Vivian Lord, principal of the Anglican Indian school, who had been sent out in advance of the reserve, and C. A. Arthur, Indian Agent. On Saturday morning after breakfast at the school head-quarters, the bishop and party proceeded to the new mission church now nearing completion, situated three and a half miles from Brocket. This mission church has been officially named St. Cyprian. Indian residents of the Peigan Reservation, Bishop of Calgary, the Right Rev. Cyprian W. Pinkham, D.D., in recognition of his services in the welfare of the Peigan Indians extending over many years.\n\nInspecting New School\n\nThe bishop and party were received at the school by the school department and building inspector, E. Gardiner, who showed them the progress of the new building following, expression and pleasure was expressed by all at the neatness and comfort and conveniences of the edifice were noted and the bishop was most impressed with its forward policy in providing such splendid facilities for the education of the Peigan boys and girls. His Lordship commented favorably upon the excellent view of the Rockies as seen from the school.\n\nWelcomed by Indians\n\nAn interesting feature of the afternoon was the visit paid by the Indians in the parish hall held for the purpose of extending their welcome to the new missionary. Gifts of welcome were delivered in Blackfoot by Chief Phillip and Mrs. Phillip and Men Who Smoke, their remarks being interpreted into English by Father Pollock. In his speeches, Bishop Sherman was presented with a valuable medicine pipe and tobacco pouch. Ven. Arch-Deacon Timms was also the recipient of an Indian pipe and pouch. His Lordship expressed his pleasure in being so kindly welcomed by the Peigan Indians and assured them of the close personal interest he will take in their welfare and advancement.\n\nOrdination Services\n\nOn Sunday morning, March 29, the little church alongside the old Victoria Jubilee Bridge, on the banks of the river bottom, was crowded to capacity by Indians. This old church has been used for Anglican services originally built through the generosity of Mr. F. J. Macdonald, late of C. C., and was formally visited by Lord and Lady Aberdeen during the former's term as governor-general of Canada in the early nineteen twenties. Assisting the bishop at the ordination services were Ven. Arch-Deacon Timms, Rev. Mr. Haynes, minister of St. Augustine's church, Lethbridge, and Rev. W. R. Haynes of the Peigan reserve.\n\nService in Blackfoot\n\nProceeding to the mission, Rev. Mr. Haynes conducted a service officially in Blackfoot, in which the Indians took part and did much to impress many to observe their familiarity with the prayer book. The prayers were heartily in the responses and prayers and in the singing of hymns. It was a splendid testimony to the labors of Mr. Haynes in his many years of service to the cause of Christianizing the Indians on this reserve.\n\nBishop's Sermon\n\nHis Lordship prefaced his remarks by saying that he felt sure that the service his address would be of the highest value to the Indians. He referred to professor Bishop Pinkham, who had labored so long and faithfully among the Indians, and who had only relinquished the burden through his own request. He knew that their former bishop was respected and beloved by every person present. His Lordship then spoke of Bishop Pinkham's successor to keep the work to successfully inaugurated. He expressed pleasure at seeing so many Indians present and reminded them that the church knows no division or separation, but that all are one people in Christian fellowship. Proceeding, His Lordship referred to the history of the church to the flowing of a great river which had been there for centuries where ever since apostolic times had received many tributaries and in every generation had been strengthened.\n\nOld Landmarks Passing\n\nOn all sides the old world was evidently passing away. The great majestic mountains to the west which looked down upon the valley of the river came and go and remind us of the extreme brevity of life. His own call to serve was that of the church and its individual change. The closing of the old mission house was a sign that they were gathered and the moving into the new building was almost a complete change, yet there were indications of change. Turning to the Book of Acts, His Lordship pointed out the present day application. Concluding, he said: \"We are gathered here today in the name of our brother. May he ever be a faithful witness for the church and may he bring many to Christ.\"\n\nOrdination of School Principal\n\nFollowing the bishop's address an impressive ceremony took place in which the bishop consecrated an interested congregation of Indians and white people. Mr. Vivian Lord, principal of St. Cyprian Indian residence school. He was ordained by His Lordship and Ven. Arch-Deacon Timms and was duly ordained as deacon of the congregation according to the ritual of the Church of England. There was an enthusiastic response to the communion at the morning service in which about fifty Indians and a lesser number of white people took part.\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to request that you will kindly send us all official publications, circulars etc. that have been issued by the Department from time to time with reference to co-operation between Indian Agents and Principals of the Department's Indian Residential Schools, with special reference to the archives of each office.\n\nThe object of this request is that I am responsible by file with such information for reference, as none of the old files are destroyed in the fire which burnt the Principal's residence at the old Victoria Home.\n\nI have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 24th, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, and enclose herewith the circular letters requested, for file in your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Vivian S. Lord,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Cyprian Indian Res. School,\nBrocket, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring my interview with the Superintendent of Indian Education on the 1st inst. I directed his attention to the great difficulty our Society would have in securing a capacity enrolment of pupils for the St. Cyprian's School and was advised by him to address a separate communication to you in this connexion. This is a matter of very great importance to our Society and I trust that Your Department may take whatever steps you may find necessary to have an enrolment of fifty pupils effected at the earliest date possible. The staff at present includes four women agents and three men agents. In the new building it is felt that an additional woman agent is required, but the operating expenses are now so heavy and our capita earnings too inadequate to meet them, that our Society feels quite unable to provide another agent until the enrolment has been increased to capacity. As the number of Indian children on the Reserve in not, from information I have received sufficient to fill the school, it would appear that pupils will have to be secured from other sources.\n\nBelieve me Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nField Secretary, M.S.C.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sr. Cyprian\u2019s (CofE), Pegagan, School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1944.\n\nPrincipal (Res.)

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Cyprian Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended September 30th, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: October 5th, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nAnthony M.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Cyprian C of E.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St Cyprian (Church of England) School for the Quarter ended 31st March 1946.\n\nPrincipal: E. O. Cole (Rev)\n\nDated 2/4/46\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. CYFRAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL School for the Quarter ended 30 SEPTEMBER 1947.\n\nPrincipal: (Rev) E.S.W. Cole.\n\nDated: BROCKET, ALBERTA 2 OCTOBER 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n(Anthony McMillan)\n\nDated at: BROCKET, ALBERTA this 2 Oct 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RC 10, Volume 6369, file 763-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Sept. 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this date\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions set forth on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1949.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Ignatius School for the Quarter ended June 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 29 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Brocklehurst this June 30 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the BROCKETT SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated APR 4 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nAnthony D. Mullay\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at APR 4 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence by all pupils entering the school. This amount is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. CYPRIAN BROCKET School for the Quarter ended DEC. 31 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated DEC. 31 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Apparently, in the case of Peigan, this has not been done, and we have today written Mr. Arthur asking him to submit his report.\n\nTrusting that this point may receive your favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.,\n\nT.B.R.WESTGATE\n\nper\n\nIndian Affairs.

The amounts were charged against the grant during the past fiscal year as was done in former fiscal years.\n\nRecently Mr. Agent Arthur forwarded $239.12, which he stated he had received in payment for beef supplied the school for the months of July, August, September, October, November and December, 1923, and January, 1924. As our books showed that the respective amounts had been charged against the grant, cheque No. 7619 was issued and he was instructed to return this amount to you. For your information I enclose a full statement showing the amount charged against the grant during the past fiscal year.\n\nThe agent is being instructed that, in future, he should show on his monthly beef returns the amount received from your office in payment of beef supplied the school, in order that the Department may not charge the respective amounts against the grant.\n\nThe other agents interested will be given similar instructions in connection with the beef supplied to Church of England Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

On the return, grants should have\nbeen requested for 91 days for each of the pupils who\nwere in residence during the full quarter.\n\nAs you are aware, we allow grant for 62 days\nholidays and if pupils were allowed four days holidays\nduring the June quarter, it means that only 58 days\nholidays should be requested when preparing the September\nquarter return.\n\nWhen preparing the September quarter the\nprincipal should request grant for each pupil who was in\nresidence at the time school closed for holidays for 58\ndays plus the number of days such pupil is in actual\nresidence during the period July 1st to September 30th.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\nProvince of ALBERTA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended JUNE 30, 1947\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n|           | ST.

Henry G. Cook\nSuperintendent\nOttawa, March 18, 1948.\n\nDear Archdeacon Cook:\n\nWe have your letter of the 17th instant, file Pg-6, with reference to the per capita allowance at the St. Cyprian Residential School.\n\nThe authorized pupilage at this school was 50. The average attendance for the quarters ended March 31st and June 30th was 54 but we only allowed the authorized pupilage.\n\nThe average for the September quarter was 52.38 and for December 55.45. In regard to the September quarter, we allowed supernumerary grant for 2.38 pupils and in the December quarter, for 5.45 pupils. In other words, we paid the per capita allowance for the full average attendance during those two quarters, although as stated above, the authorized pupilage was only 50.\n\nWe have arranged to increase the authorized pupilage at St. Cyprian's to 60 for the fiscal year 1948-49.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nVen.
