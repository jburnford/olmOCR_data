You will be paid at the same rate as for your work at the Duck Lake School. The contract for the portion of the building which it is proposed to erect has been awarded to Mr. R. N. Wyatt of Winnipeg at his tendered price of $25,519, and it will be your duty to see that this building is erected in accordance with the plans and specifications, and also to issue progress certificates for payment on the contract, the procedure for which you are already familiar with.\n\nI would particularly draw your attention to the fact that under no circumstances is any extra work to be authorized in connection with this contract that will add to the cost of the building, without first submitting an estimate of the cost to the Department and obtaining authority in writing.\n\nFor all information with reference to the site of the proposed building you are to communicate with Indian Agent Waddy at Le Pas, Man.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover blue print copies of the plans and specifications, tender forms and diary sheets, also certificate forms.\n\nThe voucher for your salary should be signed by Indian Agent Waddy, and forwarded to the Department attached to the diary sheets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I asked local men the cost of doing this work and their figures are all the way from $25.00 to $50.00 per acre. I have no idea of how much should be cleared, but would judge that at least 20 acres should be done to make the place fairly fire-proof, though this would not make it altogether safe as the forest is heavy all round this district. It might be well to allow the contractor to do the work on percentage basis, no local man made an offer, but there are one or two who would do it if given the chance. It could also be done by day labour under the inspector who goes in to superintend the construction of the building.\nLe Pas, Man., 5 June, 1925.\n\nThe Secretary of Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 26th of May, No. 132-7-15, re the contract for the erection of the new Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing.

D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Wyatt, Esq.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJuly 28th, 1925.\n\nMr. Adrien Tailleau,\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have yours of the 23rd inst., and note contents. In answer to same will say:\n\nRe page 3, paragraph 2, for first certificate. We sent you a list as we have sent to all architects that we have worked for, and it should be sufficient for you to issue a certificate on. If you thought the amount was too much it would have been easy enough for you to have sent part of it and asked for something different for the balance. However, I think what I have sent you will be sufficient for the department, as it would be up to you to check the amount of materials and put your own valuation on them, and see if this corresponds with the amounts asked for. If they didn't, then it would be in order for you to cut them down.\n\nI might say that it takes two weeks from the time we send you a letter until we get a reply, and that if we do not get a certificate by return mail we will take this matter up direct with the Department.\n\nRe doors:- While specifications call for 3 panel doors, 1/2\" thick, we took the liberty of changing them to stock doors, as 3 panel doors are stock doors in the East, and the specifications being written in the East, they would naturally follow stock specifications, because I understand the Department's requirements are, that they don't purpose going into special work for Indian schools. All doors sent, except 4, which are 2-6-6-6 are 1/2\". These 4 are 1 3/8\", and not 1 1/8\", as you mention. These are for closet doors and are always used for this class of work.\n\nRe Windows:- Windows will be painted before being placed in the frames, as specified.\n\nRe base & Casings:- The specification calls for moulded bases and casings. If you will look at cross section on the plan you will find that we have sent base exactly as is shown there, which is a moulded base, within the meaning of standard millwork specifications. Any wood that is worked other than being absolutely square is called moulded, and to match this base we sent bull nose casing, but if the Department were to insist on having a back band for this casing, which is not nearly so sanitary, we would certainly send it.\n\nRe specifications for flooring:- Specifications call for hardwood flooring to be bored, driven up tight and nailed. If you will wait until this flooring is laid or until we are laying it to voice a complaint. I think that you will find that there will be no need of complaint, as I think our men will lay it to your entire satisfaction.\nRe specifications for beams:- Specifications for beams reads as follows \"beams shall be of 8x10, formed in long lengths of 2\" thick, by depth of beam\". It doesn't say that pieces that it is formed of shall be of long lengths, but that the beams shall be formed the full length of what is required of 2\" material. This we have sent you, and to make up the beams we have sent 2x10-16's, with less than a 10 ft bearing, will be ample.\n\nRe Outside Studding:- All outside studding are full lengths, with the exception of the jog in the foundation, which will have short studs, with plates on top doubled, and then top studding the same length as the balance of the building, on top of this. This is standard construction, as we have always done it.\n\nRe Ceiling over Boiler Room:- Specifications distinctly say that all joints for floor joists will be 2x10. Cannot see how you can read 2x6 sideways for a solid floor. We have sent these joists for this job and they are on the ground, and if we had to re-order it would cost a lot of money; as this place is situated, as you are aware, a long ways from lumber yards. This we certainly did not figure on, and would expect an extra for the work if it were changed.\n\nRe steps and platform in basement:- Page 21, paragraph 17 says, \"build outside and inside steps and platforms indicated on plan of concrete, etc.\" Indicated means 'marked'. There are no steps marked. Page 29, paragraph 23, specifically mentions steps to chapel of wood. Page 33, paragraph 40, calls for stairs to be constructed where shown of wood. It would not look good construction to me to have reinforced concrete stairs and platform running up between frame walls, and would not take it as such. The stairs that we figure should go in concrete are those from the boiler room to hall, to engineers quarters, and machinery room. These are part of the floor, which are concrete and which will go in in concrete. The mill men in estimating this job also estimated this would go in in wood, as they read the specifications, and sent them that way. We are sorry that you interpret these any other way, as I am afraid your ruling is not correct.\n\nRe certificate of radiation of boiler:- This we have mailed to you at your request.\n\nI trust that the above explanations will meet with your approval. If not, I would ask you to kindly get the architect, Mr. Orr's interpretation, and let me have it.\n\nTrusting that we will hear from you, with certificate enclosed by return of mail, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRNW/EB.\nR. N. Wyatt\nContractor\n\nWinnipeg July 29th, 1925.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are enclosing copy of letter sent to Mr. Taillon, Building Inspector at Sturgeon Landing, re Guy Residential School, in reply to his of July 23rd, a copy of which he claims was mailed to you. We trust this is in order.\n\nIt looks to me as though this man and I are not going to be able to pull, as it seems that he is starting in to make things rather impossible. It is rather to be expected that when a party, who has tendered on the job, and whose price was too high, and who is set as Inspector over the successful contractor, that he would try and make it impossible. I might say that I figure I am a responsible contractor. I have worked under a great many architects and have always been able to give satisfaction. I have done business with the Merchants Bank of Canada as their contractor for over a period of a dozen years, also built for the Bank of Montreal, Royal, Union, Imperial, Nova Scotia and Home, and have yet to hear of any complaints.\n\nThe things mentioned in Mr. Taillon's letter are very easily overcome, and I think it would be well if he were instructed from the Chief Architect, as to how he should interpret those specifications. I might say further that unless he issues a certificate for some money that we will have to shut down the works. I would kindly ask that you instruct him to issue a certificate for some monies.\n\nIt takes two weeks from the time he writes us until we get an answer back to him, on account of the slowness of the mail service. Only one mail a week from The Pas to Sturgeon Landing, and it is easily seen that it would be a month before we get a certificate from him, and we have already been working on the job over a month.\n\nI am enclosing copy of Estimate as sent him, and will say that we have all materials on the job to complete it, with the exception of Electric wiring, as per our estimate, and we would be pleased if you would instruct him to take care of this at once, and have certificate mailed to us without further delay.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRNW/EB.\n**R.

Wyatt, Esq.\nWINNIPEG, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour foreman on the works of the construction of Guy Indian School at this point has given me your statement of material delivered to date but I regret to say that I cannot accept same before the following are adjusted and before the conditions set forth on page 3, paragraph 2 of specifications (Before teh 1st certificate etc) are realized.\n\n1o-The doors are not as specified. Instead of 1/4\" three panels doors all those received are with five panels and some only 1/4\". I therefore refuse those doors.\n\n2o-The windows should have been painted before being sent but it is understood that they will have to be painted before being placed in frames.\n\n3o-The bases and casings; the specifications call for moulded bases ans casings but as just plain bull nose ones were received I cannot accept them.\n\n4o-According to specifications flooring should be bored. I wish to have the flooring nailed at about 3\" from the end and not 7 or 8 inches. Therefore kindly see that this matter is attended to.\n\n5o-Specifications mention that beams must be made up of long pieces. As I do not see any here I must say that I will not accept short pieces or beams made up in two pieces. For your information I may tell you that long pieces as desired can be had in The Pas.\n\n6o-Outside studing; the latter 2x6 should be full length. I do not see them on the grounds. Please order them.\n\n7o-Ceiling over boiler room: Plan shows 2x6 edgeways solid floor. Kindly see that this is complied with.\nSo\u2014Steps and platform in basement.\n\nBy what is sent it looks as if those were to be made in wood but specifications distinctly call for concrete steps and platforms and I insist upon this point.\n\n9c\u2014Certificate of radiation of boilers from the manufacture must be sent to me as soon as possible in order to enable me to accept said boilers.\n\nYou will note by the above remarks that I do not ask anything outside of what is called for in the specifications and plans but I insist upon having it.\n\nAnother point which I wish to call to your attention is the fact that your statement of material delivered is incomplete and not enough detailed. By the experience I have in connection with such contracts I am positive that the Department of Indian Affairs would certainly not accept your statement and figures as set forth in your last communication.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Architect of the Indian Department at Ottawa and another to Commissioner Graham, Indian Department at Regina.\n\nI hope that you will give immediate attention to the above and adjust whatever is found deficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAdrien Taillon,\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMr R.G. Orr, Architect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Orr:\n\nIn the course of my visit at Sturgeon Landing Mr Taillon gave me the enclosed letter and asked me to forward it to you. It is a copy of a letter sent to Mr R.N. Wyatt, Contractor of the school at that point.\n\nBy my own personal experience I can say that there are no exaggerations in Mr Taillon's statements and I could say that most of the material seems to be of inferior quality. Mr Taillon did not mention the spruce which is on the ground for being specified he could not refuse it but I must say that it is of the worst quality being twisted and bent and I wonder how nails will keep in place in such timber. You are probably aware that this northern spruce is far from having the consistency and keeping qualities of our eastern spruce.\n\nMr Taillon has requested me to ask you to wire to him regarding the ceiling over the boiler room. He says that his opinion is the right one but as there may be a little difference between the plans and specifications he wishes to have a document to show to the superintendent of Mr Wyatt. You can wire to A.Taillon, c/o P.Taillon, The Pas, Man. and the message will be promptly forwarded to him.\n\nI am pleased to state that the site chosen for the school is one of the finest I have ever seen and I am sure that in such a location the school will be a credit to the Department and a boon for the Indians of that remote country.\n\nI will leave tomorrow for the Blood reserve to see the new construction being made presently. I will be in Edmonton at the above address until August 12.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\nSir;-\n\nRe Guy Indian School -\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nThe plans of the survey made by Mr. Patterson of the property of the proposed Guy Indian School at Sturgeon Landing and of the Sturgeon river in that vicinity show that it will be impossible to consider the installation of a hydro plant at that point to operate the water and lighting system for the school building. The survey reveals that it would be impossible to secure power in this vicinity without completely damming the river, the cost of which would be prohibitive for the power required. These plans will be forwarded in about a week's time.\n\nThe power required to operate the water system and lighting can be more economically obtained from some of the standard types of gasoline, kerosene or fuel oil engines, and as I understand the Department of Indian Affairs wish me to prepare a report dealing with the installation of the water, light and sewerage systems, it will be necessary before doing this to have the following information:\n\nI - Light and Power.\n(a) - Total number and size of lights, to be provided for.\n(b) - Approximate amount of power required for the laundry and other purposes.\n\nII - Water System.\n(a) - Number of inmates to be provided for.\n(b) - Is fire protection required from the main water system, and if so, to what extent?\n\nIII - Sewerage.\n(a) - Number of inmates to be provided for.\n(b) - Will septic tanks of the same size and capacity as those installed at McIntosh be required here?\n\nDir.

Mr. Attwood, our District Chief Engineer in Winnipeg, advises that it will be impossible to consider the installation of a hydroelectric plant at this point to operate the water and lighting systems for the school.\n\nA copy of Mr. Attwood's letter is enclosed and you will note that, understanding you Department desires a report covering the installation of water, light and sewerage systems for the school, he requires certain information covering the required capacity of these systems. If you will be good enough to supply this information it will be transmitted to Mr. Attwood promptly.\n\nYou will also note that Mr. Attwood assumes that the room marked \"machinery room\" on the plans of the school is provided for the installation of machinery for the operation of the above mentioned systems. We shall be glad to be advised of the correctness of this assumption.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nThe data obtained through the survey show that the securing of a water supply from the river, which is the only visible source, will entail an expensive intake in order to prevent freezing.\n\nIf you will please let me have an early reply my report outlining the suggested installation with estimated cost can be forwarded within the next two weeks. In preparing this report I am assuming that the room marked \"Machinery Room\" on the plans of the school is provided for the installation of the machinery to operate the water, lighting and power systems. If this is not the case, please advise, in order that a separate building may be provided for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. H.

Wyatt Contractor,\nWinnipeg Manitoba.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReceived your letters of July 28th, 1925 and contents noted.\n\nIn reply would say that it would take too much time to refute all of your arguments which are based on your own idea and to your own advantages and not fair to the Department. I base myself on the plans and specifications.\n\nRegarding the issuance of certificate page 3 paragraph 2 of specifications, in order that first certificate for payment be issued you must comply with terms of specifications; moreover I have notified you that no certificate would be issued until everything was O.K.\n\nI have notified you and your man here regarding the thickness of the walls, that is that they should be 13\" and 15\" thick as called for and not 13\" and 14\".\n\nYour man here has decided to retrench the wall that divides the scullery with the Main Building, also the bolts on the sills which are specified to be placed at every 5 feet, there are some that are placed as far away as 12 feet and he does not mind what I say nor the specifications.\n\nHe wants to change the part of the joists that is putting them running on the width of the building, the plans call for the joists to run with the length of the building, in changing them a beam will be needed the whole length that will be supported on 6x6 partitions, this will not be strong enough to support the weight, where this change is proposed it comes under the chapel.\n\nAll of the changes that you are making we have no reason to be made as before any change is made you are supposed to have a written order to that effect, even if this building is for Indians the money is just as good.\n\nRegarding the ceiling of the boiler room look at the detail, you will see that half of the section that starts from the bath the floor measures 6\", the other half section the joists are lengthways of the building the joists are 2x10 so that the boards are even on top, there is four inches difference at the bottom of the half section being in back of the boiler room.\n\nRegarding steps and platform they should all be of concrete we will let the Architect decide, also the doors on the outside of the Boiler Room and the double door on the side the sills are to be of concrete and not of lumber.\n\nDo you know that the steam sashes have no sliding panels as specified, I have not all unpacked yet but I have seen quite a few that are not as specified, also some have three lights and two lights instead of six as specified.\n\nSome of the steam piping that came with the boiler has been in use before and I do not think should be used here.\n\nRegarding the doors outside for the Boiler Room and the double door on the side the specifications call for doors to be 2\u00bd\" thick these here are 1 5/8\" thick with a V joint the V joint should be even on the top (A real Indian Door).\nI am preparing a list of all that does not conform with plans and specifications and will mail same to you by the next boat. I will also send a copy to the Department.\n\nRegarding the issuance of certificates for payment I have my orders to follow and you have certain conditions to fulfill and if we cannot agree the Department will have to decide.\n\nI was forgetting your framing lumber, I am sorry to say that it cannot all be used in the building as some pieces for outside studding are too short and these cannot be put in in two pieces but plans will have to be followed in this respect. I am refusing these unless a ruling is forthcoming from the Department otherwise, also understand that everything must comply with plans and specifications these are my orders received from the Department.\n\nAgain no certificates for payment will be issued until everything is O.K., it depends on you to either shorten or lengthen the time regarding the issuance of certificates.\n\nRegarding the doors that you mention in your letter as 1 1/8\" thick this is a mistake in writing they are 1 5/8\" thick and still do not conform with the specifications which calls for them to be 1 3/8\" thick.\n\nRegarding your foreman here you state that I am taking him the wrong way and that I am acting a little unreasonable with him. I am only following orders and asking him to comply with plans and specifications, and I assure you that if this is done there will be no difficulties at all and that we can get along fine.\n\nHoping that this will receive your consideration and that orders will be given your foreman here to comply as stated above, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing,\nSaskatchewan.\nDear Sir:\n\nReceived your letters of July 28th, 1925 and contents noted.\n\nIn reply would say that it would take too much time to refute all of your arguments which are based on your own idea and to your own advantages and not fair to the Department. I base myself on the plans and specifications.\n\nRegarding the issuance of certificate page 3 paragraph 2 of specifications, in order that first certificate for payment be issued you must comply with terms of specifications, moreover I have notified you that no certificate would be issued until everything was O.K.\n\nI have notified you and your man here regarding the thickness of the walls, that is that they should be 13\" and 15\" thick as called for and not 12\" and 14\".\n\nYour man here has decided to retrench the wall that divides the scullery with the Main Building, also the bolts on the sills which are specified to be placed at every 5 feet, there are some that are placed as far away as 12 feet and he does not mind what I say nor the specifications.\n\nHe wants to change the part of the joists that is putting them running on the width of the building, the plans call for the joists to run with the length of the building, in changing them a beam will be needed the whole length that will be supported on 2x4 partitions, this will not be strong enough to support the weight, where this change is proposed it comes under the chapelle.\n\nAll of the changes that you are making have no reason to be made as before any change is made you are supposed to have a written order to that effect, even if this building is for Indians the money is just as good.\n\nRegarding the ceiling of the boiler room look at the detail, you will see that half of the section that starts from the bath the floor measures 6\", the other half section the joists are lengthways of the building the joists are 2x10 so that the boards are even on top, there is four inches difference at the bottom of the half section of 10\" being in back of the boiler room.\n\nRegarding steps and platform they should all be of concrete we will let the Architect decide, also the doors on the outside of the Boiler Room and the double door on the side the sills are to be of concrete and not of lumber.\n\nDo you know that the storm sashes have no sliding panels as specified, I have not all unpacked yet but I have seen quite a few that are not as specified, also some have three lights and two lights instead of six as specified.\n\nSome of the steam piping that came with the boiler has been in use before and I do not think should be used here.\n\nRegarding the doors outside for the Boiler Room and that of the double door on the side the specifications call for doors to be 2 1/2\" thick these here are 1 5/8\" thick with a V joint the V joint should be even on the top (A real Indian Door).\nI am preparing a list of all that does not conform with plans and specifications and will mail same to you by the next boat, I will also send a copy to the Department.\n\nRegarding the issuance of certificates for payment I have my orders to follow and you have certain conditions to fulfill and if we cannot agree the Department will have to decide.\n\nI was forgetting your framing lumber, I am sorry to say that it cannot all be used in the building as some pieces for outside studing are too short and these cannot be put in in two pieces but plans will have to be followed in this respect, I am refusing these unless a ruling is forthcoming from the Department otherwise, also understand that everything must comply with plans and specifications these are my orders received from the Department.\n\nAgain no certificates for payment will be issued until everything is O.K., it depends on you to either shorten or lengthen the time regarding the issuance of certificates.\n\nRegarding the doors that you mention in your letter as 1 1/8\" thick this is a mistake in writing they are 1 3/8\" thick and still do not conform with the specifications which calls for them to be 1 3/4\" thick.\n\nRegarding your foreman here you state that I am taking him the wrong way and that I am acting a little unreasonable with him, I am only following orders and asking him to comply with plans and specifications, and I assure you that if this is done there will be no difficulties at all and that we can get along fine.\n\nHoping that this will receive your consideration and that orders will be given your foreman here to comply as stated above, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAdrien Taylor\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing,\nSaskatchewan.\nDIARY FOR MONTH OF July 1923\n\n1\n2\n3\n4 Excavating\n5\n6 Excavating\n7 Rain during night\n8\n9 and clearing land\n10 Rain\n11 Rain\n12\n13 Excavating and clearing land and hauling gravel\n14\n15\n16 Concrete footing and clearing land and hauling gravel\n17\n18\n19\n20 Forms for concrete Clearing land\n21\n22 Unloading boilers\n23 Rain during night\n24\n25 Rain and wind\n26\n27 Concrete\n28 Concrete\n29 Concrete\n30 Concrete\n31 Concrete\n\nAGENCY\n\nIndian Affairs.

Aug 7th 1925\n\nI enclose herewith Vouchers Nos. , amounting to $182.10 in favour of Adrien Taillon, Sturgeon Landing, Sask. for work as Inspector of construction at Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental\n\nI have no authority to pass this voucher, but Mr. Taillon asks me to sign it. I know he has performed the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJuly 28th, 1925\n\nMr. Adrien Taillon,\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have yours of the 23rd inst., and note contents. In answer to same will say:\n\nRe page 3, paragraph 2, for first certificate. We sent you a list as we have sent to all architects that we have worked for, and it should be sufficient for you to issue a certificate on. If you thought the amount was too much it would have been easy enough for you to have sent part of it and asked for something different for the balance. However, I think what I have sent you will be sufficient for the department, as it would be up to you to check the amount of materials and put your own valuation on them, and see if this corresponds with the amounts asked for. If they didn't, then it would be in order for you to cut them down.\n\nI might say that it takes two weeks from the time we send you a letter until we get a reply, and that if we do not get a certificate by return mail we will take this matter up direct with the Department.\n\nRe doors:- While specifications call for 3 panel doors 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" thick, we took the liberty of changing them to stock doors, as 3 panel doors are stock doors in the East, and the specifications being written in the West, they would naturally follow stock specifications being written because I understand the Departments requirements are that they don't purpose going into special stock for Indian Schools. All doors sent, except 4, which are 2-6-6-6 are 1\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\". These 4 are 1 3/8, and not 1 1/8, as you mention. These are for closet doors and are always used for this class of work.\n\nRe windows:- Windows will be painted before being placed in the frames, as specified.\n\nRe base and casings:- The specification calls for moulded bases and casings. If you will look at cross section on the plan you will find that we have sent base exactly as is shown there, which is a moulded base, within the meaning of standard millwork specifications. Any wood that is worked other than being absolutely square is called moulded, and to match this base we sent bull nose casing, but if the department were to insist on having a back band for this casing, which is not nearly so sanitary, we would certainly send it.\n\nRe specifications for flooring:- Specifications call for hardwood flooring to be bored, driven up tight and nailed. If you will wait until this flooring is laid or until we are laying it to voice a complaint I think that you will find that there will be no need of complaint, as I think our men will lay it to your entire satisfaction.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe specifications for beams:- Specifications for beams reads as follows \"beams shall be of 8x10, formed in long lengths of 2\" thick, by depth of beam\". It doesn't say that pieces that it is formed of shall be of long lengths, but that the beams shall be formed the full length of what is required of 2\" material. This we have sent you, and to make up the beams we have sent 2x10-16's, with less than a 10 ft. bearing will be ample.\n\nRe Outside studding:- All outside studding are full lengths, with the exception of the jog in the foundation, which will have short studs, with plates on top doubled, and then your studding the same length as the balance of the building, on top of this. This is standard construction as we have always done it.\n\nRe Ceiling over Boiler Room:- Specifications distinctly say that all joists for floor joists will be 2x10. Cannot see how you can read 2x6 sideways for a solid floor. We have sent these joists for this job and they are on the ground, and if we had to re-order it would cost a lot of money, as this place is situated as you are aware, a long ways from lumber yards. This we certainly did not figure on, and would expect an extra for the work if it were changed.\n\nRe steps and platform in basement:- Page 21, paragraph 17 says \"build outside and inside steps and platforms indicated on plan of concrete, etc.\" Indicated means 'marked'. There are no steps marked. Page 29, paragraph 23, specifically mentions steps to chapel of wood. Page 33, paragraph 40, calls for stairs to be constructed where shown of wood. It would not look good construction to me to have reinforced concrete stairs and platform running up between frame walls, and would not take it as such. The stairs that we figure should go in in concrete are those from the boiler room to hall, the engineers quarters, and machinery room, these are part of the floor, which are concrete and which will go in in concrete. The millwrights in estimating this job also estimated this would go in in wood, as they read the specifications, and sent them that way. We are sorry that you interpret these any other way, as I am afraid your ruling is not correct.\n\nRe certificate of radiation of boiler:- This we have mailed to you at your request.\n\nI trust that the above explanations will meet with your approval. If not, I would ask you to kindly get the architect, Mr. Orr's interpretation, and let me have it.\n\nTrusting that we will hear from you, with certificate enclosed by return of mail, we remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wyatt, Esq.\nWINNIPEG, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour foreman on the works of the construction of Guy Indian School at this point has given me your statement of material delivered to date but I regret to say that I cannot accept same before the following are adjusted and before the conditions set forth on page 3, paragraph 3 of specifications (Before teh 1st certificate etc) are realized.\n\n1o-The doors are not as specified. Instead of 1\u00bd\" three panel doors all those received are with five panels and some only 1\". I therefore refuse those doors.\n\n2o-The windows should have been painted before being sent but it is understood that they will have to be painted before being placed in frames.\n\n3o-The bases and casings; the specifications call for moulded bases ans casings but as just plain bull nose ones were received I cannot accept them.\n\n4o-According to specifications flooring should be bored. I wish to have the flooring nailed at about 3\" from the end and not 7 or 8 inches. Therefore kindly see that this matter is attended to.\n\n5o-Specifications mention that beams must be made up of long pieces. As I do not see any here I must say that I will not accept short pieces or beams made up in two pieces. For your information I may tell you that long pieces as desired can be had in The Pas.\n\n7o-Outside studing; the latter 2x6 should be full length. I do not see them on the grounds. Please order them.\n\n7o-Sealing over boiler room: Plan shows 2x6 edgeways solid floor. Kindly see that this is complied with.\nSo\u2014Steps and platform in basement.\n\nBy what is sent it looks as if those were to be made in wood but specifications distinctly call for concrete steps and platforms and I insist upon this point.\n\n9c\u2014Certificate of radiation of boilers from the manufacture must be sent to me as soon as possible in order to enable me to accept said boilers.\n\nYou will note by the above remarks that I do not ask anything outside of what is called for in the specifications and plans but I insist upon having it.\n\nAnother point which I wish to call to your attention is the fact that your statement of material delivered is incomplete and not enough detailed. By the experience I have in connection with such contracts I am positive that the Department of Indian Affairs would certainly not accept your statement and figures as set forth in your last communication.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to the Architect of the Indian Department at Ottawa and another to Commissioner Graham, Indian Department at Regina.\n\nI hope that you will give immediate attention to the above and adjust whatever is found deficient.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAdrien Taillon,\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nTo The Secretary of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing please find forthnightly report for\nthe month of July regarding work on the Guy Indian Residential School\nat Sturgeon Landing Saskatchewan.\n\nI am here since the fourth of July and up to now the following\nwork is completed, Excavation and concrete forms and footing., the\nwalls will be finished in two more days, there are now fifteen men on\nthe job and more are expected shortly.\n\nThe following materials are on the job..\nAll rough and finished lumber, brick, boiler and plumbing\nfixtures, steam and water pipes, metallic lath and shingles,\ndoors, windows, paint and hardware.\n\nRemarks.\nA lot of the above mentioned material is not according to that\nspecified in the specifications such as the doors that are here-\nare 5 cross panels and half of them are 1 3/8\" thick instead of\n1 1/2\" as specified., the storm sashes are not equipped with sliding\npanels., the casings are 4 1/2\" instead of 5\" and are plain bull\nnose without moulding also the base is the same.\nOf the amount of steam pipes here a lot of them have already\nbeen in use.\nPlatforms and steps the foreman here calculates putting these\nin lumber, the lumber for same is here, I have refused same.\nThe walls that form the division of the scullery and main building\nare the same height as the others walls that is 5'6\".\nHave you a sketch of the electric fixture showing what the contractor\nis supposed to furnish, if so please sent me one.\nRegarding the sewers do they come in from the front part of the\nbuilding facing the river?\nI have notified the contractor Mr. Wyatt at Winnipeg that plans\nand specifications must be followed and that no changes will be\nallowed without a written order to that effect.\nThe foreman here has been notified too but he will not listen\nto me at all.\nI have not issued any certificates for payment yet and will not\ndo so until everything complies with plans and specifications\nregarding labor and material.\nAwaiting your reply, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nAdrian Tailon\nInspector of Construction.\nGuy Indian Residential School.\nSturgeon Landing Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnclosures 2.\nSir,\n\n2.\n\nSome of the bolts which are set into the cement walls to hold the sills are not spaced at proper intervals of five feet as called for in the specifications, and Mr. Taillon objected to this. It is possible that not quite enough bolts are used in the building, and that they are not set in according to the strict interpretation of the specifications, but I think the building will not suffer for this. However, I am reporting it just as I saw it.\n\nThere is an argument in regard to a stairway leading up between the laundry and the storeroom. The Contractor states this is a stairway, and according to specifications it should be made of planks, as it abuts onto the plastered wall. It seems that the Inspector classifies it as steps, and the specifications state that steps should be made of cement. The Department can judge which is the correct interpretation, either stairway or steps. There are dozens of little objections not noted here that were drawn to my attention by the Inspector.\n\nI was very friendly with Mr. Taillon and endeavor to get him to give me a progress estimate of some sort, so that Mr. Wyatt could be allowed an advance on his contract, but the Inspector absolutely refused to give a progress estimate of any sort, and he told me that he fully intended to leave the job this week, as he had given the Indian Department his resignation and has made other arrangements for the future for himself.\n\nOn my return to The Pas on the 17th I wired to you asking that a new Inspector be sent in. I cannot see any other alternative as Mr. Taillon has his mind made up, and he is going to leave.\n\nI am not in a position to give a progress estimate myself, but I enclose a list received from Mr. Wyatt, giving estimate of cost of his material up to date, and also a letter from his foreman, showing the amount of labor used in the construction of the building, and I believe when these letters and this report are received at Ottawa that it will probably be decided to allow Mr. Wyatt a fair advance cheque on his contract, of course, the Department\nSir,\n\nIn reference to various telegrams regarding Inspector Taillon at Guy Indian Residential School. I beg to report that I was at Surgeon Landing on the 16th inst., and went over the building in company with Mr. Taillon and Mr. Alyea, the Foreman for Mr. Wyatt.\n\nMr. Taillon pointed out that the walls are not thirteen inches in thickness. Some of these walls are more than thirteen inches, some slightly less than thirteen inches, and the foreman explained that in running the concrete he allows for the form expanding when the concrete is being poured, and pressure comes on it. In some places the pressure did not expand the forms to full thirteen inches. The wall itself is constructed in first class shape.\n\nThe joists and sills do not come flush at every angle of the floor and walls. There is a small space between some of the joists and sills. Mr. Taillon states that this is not according to specifications; that they should be exactly flush, and tight, in every instance.\n\nThe walls of the first floor are sheeted in, and the building is well under way. The mill work, hardware, sheet metal, plumbing, and heating equipment, brick etc. is on the ground.\n\nThe Inspector objects to some of the piping being second hand, but the Contractor states that this second hand pipe is being filled with cement and used as some sort of a stand under the pipes, but no second hand pipe is really on hand for general use.\n\nThe Inspector also objects to the shed, which is used to house the mill work. Although this shed is water-proof from the top, he states that the rain can drift in through the sides into the mill work. Up to the present little damage seems to have been done from this cause but no doubt Mr. Taillon was right to object to the shape of the building.\nWinnipeg Man Aug 24-25 1929\n\nJ D McLean\nDeputy Superintendent General Dept Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nRe Guy Indian School kindly wire a credit on estimate today to Bank of Montreal Lombard Branch Winnipeg\n\nR N Wyatt\n12:54 PM\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPHS\n\nHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONT.\nGEO.

As we have had no reply to the questions asked in our letter of July 22nd we have assumed that the requirements of these services will be for an institution of 100 inmates and with a limited power supply and fire protection.\n\nThe investigation of the Sturgeonweir river showed quite conclusively that a water power development for the requirements of the Guy Indian School would be too costly and for that reason Mr. Craig has provided for moderately priced but reliable oil engines, which I feel are suitably adapted for the requirements of the institution. In selecting suitable machinery Mr. Craig received actual prices for all equipment f.o.b. Winnipeg, and in going into this matter he found that while a number of firms could supply various machines, fittings, equipment, etc., the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse company are prepared to supply a complete installation. In my opinion it would appear advisable when calling for tenders for the above machinery and installation that tenders should be called for from firms who can and will supply and install the machinery, equipment, etc. In addition to facilitating the work it places the responsibility for the completion and successful operation of the entire plant upon one firm.\n\nWith respect to the installation of the sewerage system and the intake pipe for the water supply system I am of the opinion that a price for this work should be received from R.M. Watt, the present contractor of the school building. I feel sure that he would be prepared to quote a reasonable price for this work, or that he could do the work on a cost plus basis, naming an approximate completed job. I would further point out that it is absolutely necessary, if the Department of Indian Affairs decide to proceed with this work, that the equipment which may be decided upon should be purchased immediately, and the work be started with the least possible delay.\n\nThe plans of the sewerage and water system accompanying the report are in sufficient detail to permit the contractor to proceed with this work immediately. With respect to the purchasing of the engines, generators, pump, tank, shafting, pulleys, belts, etc., if the Department are satisfied with the machinery installation as outlined in Mr. Craig's report, specifications for these machines can be forwarded immediately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

I now beg to enclose copy of a letter from our District Chief Engineer at Winnipeg, Mr. G.H. Attwood, together with a copy of a report covering the ground outlined in your letter of April 9th.\n\nYou will note from Mr. Attwood's letter that a water-power development would be too costly and that the engineer has therefore provided for a moderately priced but reliable oil engine installation. You will also note his various recommendations as to the manner in which the work might be carried out.\n\nMr. Attwood states that if your Department decides to proceed with this work the equipment which may be decided upon should be purchased immediately and the work started with the least possible delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

This is partly due to the fact that the place is so isolated, and weather conditions very bad (in fact, it rained nearly every night in July and quite a number of days) together with mosquitoes, of which I believe they have never known them to be worse, (in fact the Indians that we had engaged could scarcely stand them). Then the heat, bull dogs, which attacked the horses and sand flies, together with Mr. Taillon bothering the man on the other hand, it got him nearly bushed. However, he seems to be doing a very good job, and in speaking with Mr. Taillon I found him a very nice old gentleman who would possibly want to put something over you if he thought he could get away with it, but after discussing the building in general with him and he found out that I knew just about as much about the job as he did, he became very amicable, in fact, I don't think I would have any trouble in the world getting along with him myself.\n\nMr. Taillon states that he has written the Department asking for advice on how he was to interpret the specifications, and that he had received no reply. I think this possibly had something to do with his retiring. There were several matters of contention which he took up with me, a copy of my letter to him was mailed to the Department. No doubt you will be able to see it.\n\nWould like to have your orders on this given to your new Inspector, and a copy of same sent to me. It must be remembered that it takes two weeks from the time that I get a letter from our foreman on the job until we can get a reply back to him, and in the meantime something has got to be done to push the job along. I think it would be necessary for you to instruct your Inspector to be able to decide these things at the moment.\n\nThere is the matter of electric lighting fixtures, in which the amount of $175.00 has been allotted. Would be pleased to have your recommendations as to the class of fixtures to be installed, as the electrician is now on the job and we want to send them as quickly as possible.\n\nAnother matter that we haven't yet taken up with the Inspector is as to how you purpose having the return pipes to the boiler placed under the floor. It says in the specifications \"as shown\", but\nwe figured nothing for this, as there was nothing shown. Kindly let us know what you would have done in this case.\n\nWould be pleased to receive a reply from you at your earliest convenience, as we expect to be plastering this job the week after next and would like to have the floor put in before we start the plastering.\n\nI think it would be better if you would allow me to write you instead of to the Inspector in charge, a copy of which could be sent to him, as it would help matters a great deal on account of the slowness of the mails in that direction.\n\nTrusting to hear from you, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRNW/EB.\nOttawa, Aug. 28, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 18th instant with reference to the work at the Guy Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Department has issued a certificate (No. 1) in favour of the contractor for $3,000, and a cheque for this amount has wired him yesterday.\n\nI am enclosing herewith a copy of the certificate which I would ask you to please forward to the building inspector.\n\nWith regard to your comments on the building I would say that it would appear that the concrete walls should be satisfactory. Regarding the stair leading up between the laundry and store room, it was the intention that these be built of wood, in fact steps which come between concrete walls should be built of concrete and those between plastered walls on frame work of wood.\n\nIt is hoped that Mr. Grant, the newly appointed Inspector of Construction, will be able to arrange all matters satisfactorily with the contractor.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, Aug. 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th instant with reference to the Guy Indian Residential School, I have noted your remarks with regard to the difficulties experienced in the carrying out of this work on account of local conditions. I addressed a letter yesterday to Indian Agent Waddy, advising him that the Department had issued a certificate for $6,000 as a payment on your contract. I also advised him that from his report it would appear that the concrete walls would be satisfactory, and that the stairs leading up between the laundry and store room should be built of wood, and that steps which come between concrete walls should be built of concrete and those between plastered walls on frame work of wood.\n\nWith reference to the electric lighting fixtures, I am today writing to Mr. Bunn to select these fixtures, and I would ask you to please get in touch with him.\n\nWith regard to the return heating pipes under the floor, these may be covered up and the floor finished in the regular way. Regarding the other items in connection with the building which came up between your former and Mr. Taillon, these will have to be left to Mr. Grant, the new Inspector, and I think he will be able to make satisfactory arrangements.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Wyatt for the Guy Indian Residential School at Sioux Lookout there is an item of $175.00 provided in the specifications to cover the cost of lighting fixtures. The installing of the fixtures is included in Mr. Wyatt's contract. I have today written to Mr. Wyatt and asked him to communicate with you, and I would ask you to kindly select what you consider suitable fixtures, the cost not to exceed the above mentioned amount.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

The three additional copies of the blue prints attached to the report on this work will be sent to you in the course of a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir;\n\nIn reference to the Guy Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, I would be obliged if the Department will advise me if it is the intention to have this place heated this coming winter. In my opinion it will be necessary to keep the frost from getting in and heaving the foundations.\n\nIn case it is decided to heat the place it would be well to have wood cut immediately and it could be done under the supervision of Inspector of Construction Roderick Grant.\n\nI have had the timber on the 20 acres saved for wood, but it is green poplar. We could use it if a similar quantity of dry wood was used in the furnaces at the same time.\n\nAny instructions thought necessary in this matter will be appreciated, we have not much time to think it over as the winter will soon be coming in this district.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, Sept. 14, 1926.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the new Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, I beg to say that it will be necessary to keep the portion of the building now under construction heated during the coming winter, and you may, therefore, make arrangements to have the wood cut as suggested in your letter.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you as to the best arrangements that could be made for someone to look after this building during the winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

I will refer you to the plans sheet No. 2 Cross section A-A shown the floor to be Constructed of 2\" x 6\" spiked together. When I asked the foreman about the change from the plans he told me that was what they called for. He also referred me to the Specification of Carpentry plan page 28 clause 14 dealing with Joists according to the Specification all Ceilings on the ground floor excepting water room to be finished with Metal Ceiling according to the foreman interpretation of the ceiling of water room will have open joists. In the plumbing and drainage inside the building the water closet completed except for the line from the bath room which they are working upon now. There is no plans here showing disposal of the sewage outside the building. The same applies to the water service, if the bathers are to be used this winter it will be necessary that the installation take place at once if not we will not be able to get a test on the heating system before the steam fitter go away as I have been here a little over two weeks. I cannot find any information dealing with the part of the work, I do not know what arrangement had\nmade previous to my coming here there is no record left here for me to go by regarding the degree of surveying plans prepared for the new building we would like to have a copy here.\n\nChimney:\n\nPlan of heating layout sheet No. 6 shows to figure that the chimney for boiler base flue 31\" x 31\" x 6' high. The chimney head 31\" x 31\" x 6' high. This would bring the top of the Capping on chimney 17' above the ridge of the present main roof. The height of the domestic chimney is 52' high.\n\nPlease advise if I am right. I have not seen the plans for the future extension and do not know the height of the highest part of the water tower.\n\nPlan sheet No. 3 shows an opening in wall between Scullery and the future building to be boarded up the same as the other three openings. If we had the height of this opening it could be framed there at no height given at present the Contracting Council this wall on the outside with 10% of shingles. The work will take the Contractor about five weeks. Complete the plaster work is not started yet the bricks are set and the steam pipes are on the heating plant. The plumber is well advanced with the drainage under the building. The Concrete floor has been put in when practical to work.\n\nPoveshell let me have the information asked for at Oblique.\n\nYour truly,\n\nR. Grant\n\nInspector of Construction\nOttawa, Sept. 19, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the work on the new Guy Indian Residential School, I beg to give you the following information on the different points mentioned in your letter:\n\n1. Boiler Room Ceiling.\n   The specifications call for boiler room ceiling to be built of 3 x 10 joists similar to other portions of the building and no extra covering of any kind is specified for this ceiling. If you can make satisfactory arrangements as to price with the contractors you may arrange to have the ceiling covered with sheets of galvanized iron.\n\n2. It is not the intention to install this year the water supply or sewage disposal systems, as there are no funds for this work, and they will be included in the plans and specifications when these are completed for the finished building. You may, therefore, make the most economical arrangements possible for temporary water supply for the building and temporary drainage.\n\n3. The chimneys should be built to the height as shown on the elevations.\n\n4. The opening shown between scallery and future building should be the width as shown on plan, and the bottom opening three feet from floor line, and top opening six feet from floor line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.

The first unit of this school is completed, and it will have to be kept heated during the cold weather and every precaution taken against fire. Mr. Milette holds a second class engineer's certificate, and he would be willing to take up the work at a salary of $90.00 a month. The Indian Agent urges immediate authority be wired, as it will be necessary for Mr. Milette, if engaged, to go to Sturgeon Landing before the middle of October, so as to be on the job before the freeze-up.

I will take this matter up with His Lordship Bishop Charlebois on his return to The Pas this week, as I have an idea that he has some priest in mind, whom he intends to use for a caretaker and I will discuss the matter with him and then report to the Department.\n\nThe Inspector of Construction has asked me for blank forms of Progress Estimate, but I have none of these in the office. I would be obliged if the Department could send him a supply of these blank forms direct to Sturgeon Landing by the first mail as he wishes to put in a progress estimate as soon as possible.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Please arrange to have him be on job as soon as services necessary.\"\n\nMr. Milette's position will be classified as that of Fireman, as that position is exempt from the operation of the Civil Service Act. Should, however, his employment extend beyond the period of six months it will be necessary to obtain a certificate from the Civil Service Commission to continue his services. As stated in our telegram, the salary allowed will be at the rate of ninety dollars ($90.00) per month. Please advise when he takes up duties. You should forward properly certified vouchers in duplicate from time to time for the amount of salary due at the above rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. P. MacKenzie\nActing Asst.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Grey Indian School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nOctober 1st, 1925.\n\nThe Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of September 29th inst., to hand, replying to my letter of the 12th inst., with reference to certain part of the work on the contract.\n\nI note that you advise that the joists over the boiler room should be 3\" x 16\" as per specifications. I admit that the specifications read 3\" x 16\" joists but the plans call for or show 2\" x 6\" laminated floor. As you have decided to cover the ceiling with galvanized iron it will be satisfactory as a fire prevention. I am getting a price from the contractor for this work. I am also getting a price direct on the material ourselves, and if required will do the work.\n\nRegarding the heating plant, we are arranging to heat the building this winter with wood heaters. We are also going to make a test on the heating plant before the boilers and piping are covered.\n\nChimneys are built to the height above the present roof as shown on elevation.\n\nThe opening between scullery and future building is the width shown on plan. Height 5'-0\" from finished floor to bottom of opening, 6' from finished floor to top of opening.\n\nIn regard to the present excavation for the future building it will be necessary to have this drained, otherwise the present building would be flooded in the Spring. I have asked the contractor to have this done before he completes his contract.\n\nIn regard to the outside drainage of sewage disposal the contractor has made a ditch 18 ft deep from the point where the cast iron soil pipe comes out of the building on the right side elevation, 15' north of the entrance to the basement. This ditch runs southeast for 190 ft, towards the riverbank. This work was started before I took over the inspectorship. There is no records showing that this work was included in the present contract. The foreman on the job says that the contractor instructed him to have this done and a record kept on the time.\n\nI may state that we will drain the heating system after making the test through this drain. We will have some difficulty in getting a supply of water from the river, but will do the best we can.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nInspector.\nDIARY FOR MONTH OF September 1925\n\nWork done by Contractor on Boys School\n\n1.

The vouchers are as follows:\n\n#276 - Inspector's wages for September, $168.00\n#277 - F.M. Hayes, Inspector's board bill for the month of September, $50.00\n\nYou will note that the voucher in favor of Mr. Grant is accompanied by his diary certified to by the Agent, Mr. J.W.

The explanation being that this was unavoidable as the plasterers insisted on proceeding with their work in order that they might return home sooner.\n\nMr. Grant requests that his salary of $168.00 be paid to his wife Mrs. R.

Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas with reference to the contractors who were erecting, and the Inspector who was put in charge of the work at Guy's School at Sturgeon Landing, as follows;-\n\n\"The freeze-up is here now and this man is still at the school, the contractors must be finished but they are frozen in also. I have a letter from the Department telling me to advise Mr. Grant they have no further work as Inspector of Construction in sight. I will keep you advised of any actual change in travelling conditions, as if the actual freeze-up is here the Inspector will not be able to get away from Sturgeon Landing until the roads are passable, probably over a month.\"\n\nI gather from the information Mr. Waddy conveys that he is preparing the Department for a possible additional charge for his services by Mr. Grant owing to his compulsory detention at Guy's School. I should like to know if under the circumstances the Department would continue to pay him the per diem rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 30, 1925.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI have your 100-4 of the 24th instant, with reference to the services of Mr. R. Grant, Inspector of Construction at the Guy Indian Residential School. The Department will allow salary in his case at the regular rate of $6 per diem until such time as he reaches The Pas. It is understood that Mr. Grant will leave the school as soon as possible. You may so inform Mr. Indian Agent Waddy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir;\n\nIn reference to letter 132-7-15 of the 2nd inst regards appointment of Mr. E. Millette as fireman at Guy Indian Residential School, I beg to state that this man left The Pas on the last boat leaving for that point on the 13th inst.\n\nThe Captain of the steamboat just informed me that he just got to Cumberland, which is half way to Sturgeon Landing, and then ran into a snow storm which held him up. When the storm was over the lake had frozen over. He waited two days to see if the ice would move, and when he saw it had tightened up for the winter he unloaded all his passengers, and came back down the river.\n\nMr. Millette is marooned at Cumberland House until such time as dog teams can cross the lake to Sturgeon Landing, and in the meanwhile the Inspector of Construction, R. Grant is ice bound at the school in company with the contractor's foremen, his painters and carpenters, and may be there three weeks or a month more before travelling is safe.\n\nWhen I put in the pay list for Mr. Millette at what date will I start his time, I think it should be allowed from the 14th at which time he would have started work if the elements had not interfered.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 2, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, informing the Department that Mr. E. Millette, who was appointed fireman at the Guy Indian Residential School, has, on account of weather conditions, been held up at Cumberland House and will not be able to proceed to the school until such time as dog teams can cross the lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department agrees with you that payment of Mr. Millette's salary should be made from the 14th ultimo, at which time he would have started work if weather conditions had not interfered with his arrival at the school. You may therefore, in forwarding vouchers for his salary, request payment from that date.\n\nIt is hoped that the contractor's men who were unable to leave the work will arrange to have the building heated until such time as Mr. Millette arrives.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

At the time Mr. Patterson made the survey of the school site the question of supplying the school from a storage tank was not taken into account and the elevations of the ground some distance back from the river were not secured. Mr. Patterson states, however, that there is very little rise in the land for a considerable distance from the river, and I consider that the slight increase in height that would be gained by locating the tank some distance back from the river, would not compensate for the additional expense of the piping.\n\nI note that the Departmental Engineer desires me to mark what I consider is the most suitable location for a storage tank to take the place of the pneumatic pressure tank proposed in the report. With very little difference in the elevation of the ground in the vicinity of the school, the storage tank might be placed at any point that would be most suitable in connection with the required water mains.\n\nThe suggestion is made that, with the practically level ground surrounding the school, it might be more feasible to arrange to have the water tank placed either in the top storey or on top of the school. This is only a suggestion, and if realized, changes in the design of the school might be necessary to support the weight of the tank when filled with water.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. H.

STURGEON LANDING.\n\nRegards my letter to you of the 31st October with a list of the work to be completed on the above school, I beg to report that since then all the material required to complete the work was delivered at the school and all the items on list were completed on the above date.\n\nThe work has been completed as per plans and specifications except for the following changes and omissions. 1. Brick chimney for boiler; the base of the chimney was carried up to a height of ten feet in concrete above the concrete footing, then finished in brick to the height given on plans. Concrete base was in place when I took over the work.\n\n2. Opening in partition wall between machine room and laundry; plan shows opening to have doors the same as shown on outside double door on the rear wall to machine room; the partition was changed from the location shown on plan and moved seven feet into space allowed for laundry; opening has been finished with plain jamb and casing.\n\n3. Cross on roof; the plan shows cross on roof, rear elevation. This has not been done as shown, the contractors foreman had no instructions to do this work as there was no mention of it in the specifications. If the Department does not have it done His Lordship Bishop Charlesbois informs me he will be pleased to contribute it himself.\n\n4. Grading has been done on the rear elevation and right side elevation, there is approximately about 75 yards of earth to be graded on the left side.\n\n5. The following were sub-contractors on the work. J.Davidson, Winnipeg, contractor on the plastering. I have to report that all the plaster, cement and keen cement work was finished as per specifications excepting the work done in the machine room, hallways and stairway and plaster work above the keen cement on the walls in the laundry which owing to difficulties with delay of material and delay by the carpenters not being prepared for the plaster the plasterers lost considerable time and wanted to get away to catch the last boat so they put the finishing coat on before the undercoat was properly dry as per the manufacturers specifications. They were over.\nThey were told, along with the contractors foreman, that these walls were not ready for the finish coat and if they put it on it was at their own risk as they were working away from the specifications. I have to report that this part of the work has shown up well under the circumstances.\n\nStandard Plumbing and Heating Co., Winnipeg, were contractors on plumbing and heating. The heating plant has been installed as per specifications, with one omission from the plans, it has reference to installation of the radiator in the scullery, 27 sq ft of which was to be connected up and removed when future extension is to be made. We did not require the radiator so did not connect it up and give a finished job to the heating plant in this part. The heating plant has been in operation since the end of September and there is one boiler operating all the time and will be during the winter. The heating plant is giving first class satisfaction all radiators are working satisfactorily. The plumbing has been installed with all fixtures as per specifications, and all drains and connections as per sketch submitted showing the drainage layout.\n\nShumacher & Gray, Winnipeg put in the electric wiring. This is completed, according to specifications, fixtures hung and all switch and push plates in position. All wiring was finished except for boiler room, fuel room and stairway before I took charge.\n\nWith reference to the general construction of the building all work was done while I was in charge in accordance with the plans and specifications.\n\nI would draw your attention to the finished floor laid in chapel. The flooring supplied in accordance to specifications #1 Maple. I beg to report that it is a poor grade of #1, it was badly matched, varying 1/16 inch in width and when #1 Maple is mentioned in specifications it should be #1 best grade as there are several grades of #1 Maple flooring on the market. It did not help the flooring being stored at the school site all summer during the wet season although it was under a roof. Kiln dried maple is very susceptible to moisture which it absorbs; while on the matter of finish flooring it is right that I should mention that the floor joists should all be sized before the rough floor is laid; in the present case the sizing of the floor joists did not help the laying of this grade of maple flooring. The flooring is 13/16\" thick.\n\nRegards interior doors, all the doors supplied were 1\u00be\" thick of good quality fir 5 cross panels, except for the two doors at rear of platform in chapel which are 1\u00be\" thick taking the place of three panel doors specified, the only difference is in the design.\n\nAll interior staining and varnishing has been completed, also all outside painting as per specifications.\nThe contractor has supplied and fitted all the window screens and screen doors as per specifications, all having been marked for their proper location and stored in the store room, all windows are fitted with storm sash with one sliding panel to each window.\n\nThe excavation for the future building has been done to the depth called for, but no excavation has been done for the footings. It was necessary to have a trench dug from the lowest point of the excavations to the river bank for drainage in the spring. Instructions have been left with the fireman to keep the drain open.\n\nCovering of boilers and steam pipes and all fittings in piping covered as per specifications, also jacket heater for summer use covered. All return pipes and boiler front in boiler room painted. All bare risers, radiators and piping in building not covered painted as per specifications.\n\nThere is a piece of cement base not on wall, right side of hallway from future building entrance. I gave instructions at the time the plasterers were doing the plaster work not to put it in as they had no time, the length of this piece of base is only 12 feet and they were not in position to do it at the time to my satisfaction.\n\nIn handing over the building to the fireman instructions were left with him as to the temperature required during the winter in the building. The building is now thoroughly dried out and there is no sign of dampness. We are heating the building by using one of the boilers and will be able to do so all winter, this will allow the fireman every opportunity to regulate the heat as best required.\n\nWhen there was no possible means of heating the building before the boilers were in use and no water service I asked Mr. Waddy to ship me three heaters and stove pipe for emergency. After getting word from Ottawa that there would be no water service this year and advising me to make the best arrangements possible to heat the building and as I have already reported to the Department the heating of the building with the boilers was preferrable to heating by stoves I left the stoves which are not being used in the care of the fireman.\n\nConsidering the circumstances and difficulties under which the construction of this building was put up I would say that we got a good job and value received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nDEAR SIR:-\n\nRE GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nI would further add to my report to you of the 23rd of November on the completion of the work on the contract of the erection of the above new school, that the prospects of finding suitable sand and gravel at sturgeon landing should be well considered by the contractors tendering on the work of the proposed extension to the present building next year.\n\nThere is plenty of good gravel to be had at the Pas suitable for the work that would cost $5.00 per c. yard landed at the school site this price for gravel would run up the cost of the concrete work. There is suitable gravel to be found at the landing providing time is taken to locate the best to comply with the specifications by the contractor and approved of by the inspector in charge before delivered on the job if this is done there should be no trouble about the gravel after delivered on the job, they will have to figure on hauling sand and gravel anywhere from 3 to 10 miles return trip. I was told that the contractor on the present building hauled 6 loads per day with one team hauling one yard and a quarter to a load this gravel was not up to all the requirements in the specifications, the gravel used in the concrete floors in the basement was of a better grade.\n\nI would also recommend that the contractor have all cement lime and plaster tested out before it leaves the yards, if does not come direct from the cement plant, if this is done it will prevent the use of inferior material on the work, sometimes the yards is carrying old stock which has deteriorated unknown to the management and they ship the material to some job as good stock, if this test is made the trouble with bad material will be eliminated.\n\nI would also recommend that the plans for the future extension provide for eavestroughing the same should apply to the building now completed as the rain water from roofs affect the foundation walls through time although they received a heavy coat of waterproofing on the outside.\n\nSince I made out my last report a patch of plaster 2ft.x 4ft., sealed in the pantry it has being pointed out to the contractor it is not much only the putty coat that sealed, an allowance should be made by him to have this repaired by the plasters on the work next year.\n\nI would also recommend that if the proposed work go on next year that arrangements be made for an early start on the work so that the contractor will have a chance to finish in time before the freeze up takes place, this year the work was not finished before the freeze up came and the contractor and his men were placed at a disadvantage to get out, one man had his feet frozen and another a bone broken in his foot on the ice, the contractor reports that they will both be laid up for two months, I trust you will take my recommendations as given with the best intentions,\n\nyours truly\n\nInspector\nSir;\n\nI have the honor to enclose a file of vouchers, estimates and reports from R. Grant the Inspector of Construction of the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\n1. Report reg gravel etc for future building.\n2. Final report on present contract with R.N. Wyatt.\n3. Report and plan of drainage system.\n4. Final progress certificate.\n5. Voucher for extras passed by Inspector of Construction.\n6. The last noted voucher in detail from the contractor as supplementary to the voucher #5.\n\nThe building is occupied by the fireman Mr. Milette and has been taken over as complete I should judge, with the few minor items noted.\n\nMr. Grant told me he thought it would be well if the Department shipped in the cement and the rough lumber for the forms this winter. This would give the contractor a fair start on the work in the spring if he could obtain gravel near the site. If the gravel has to be obtained at The Pas of course the cement need not go in ahead, as gravel would have to go forward on barges after navigation opens.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst.

Wady, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are enclosing copy of a letter written to Mr. Moxley, Painter, who went up to work for us at Sturgeon Landing, in reply to one received from him.\n\nI might say that this man is far from being a painter, and when Mr. Weber was down here I asked him what he promised to pay this man, as it was he whom I wired to have a couple of painters go up there. He said this man was not much of a painter and if he were hiring him he would give him 40 cents an hour. We paid him 50 cents.\n\nIt is unfortunate the way the job has ended up that those fellows didn't get back on the boat. Apparently this is something which none of us have any control, as I understand the boats usually quit running about the 15th, and we would have been ready to come out had the boat made its last trip.\n\nI would be pleased to hear from you as to what your idea is regarding this man Moxley by return of mail, as we do not want to have any after clap like this with workmen.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRNW/EB.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Moxley, Esq.,\nPainter,\nThe Bas., Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter dated November 12th re cheque, and might say that when we make out cheques we make them out from time sheets, as made out by our foreman, and these are supposed to be O.K'd by the workman. Mr. Alyea, our foreman, claims that you are not a first class painter by any means and we paid you as a second class painter.\n\nWe took the matter up with Mr. Weber as to what he thought the wages were in your town for that class of man, and this is the amount that we paid you.\n\nI cannot understand how you arrive at your statements, as we never asked Mr. Lovell to go up except through Mr. Weber, whom I wired to see if he could get a couple of painters to go up. It would be much better if you could get in touch with Mr. Weber and ask him if he quoted any wages to Mr. Lovell. I want you to understand that we pay a rate of wages in keeping with a man's ability, but understand too that if a man does not prove to be first class and we agree beforehand to pay him a certain wage we will certainly pay him that. In this case I have got to be informed as to what rate you were promised. Upon receipt of this information I will take the matter up again.\n\nI am sorry that any adjustment like this has to be made, as I am not in the habit of having any disputes with anybody regarding wages.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of this letter to Mr. Wady, and will ask him for his opinion.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr Wyatt:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th about dispute regards Mr. Moxley's account for wages as painter at Sturgeon Landing.\n\nI went to see Weber and he says he pays 50\u00a2 per hour to painters, but he picks them up when the season is slack. Mr. Moxley works as painter and has done a number of jobs in town, and probably could make out a case that he is a painter, though he does not belong to any union.\n\nHe paid $23.00 to get back from Sturgeon Landing, so has not much to show for his work.\n\nI do not intend to interfere with you and this man, but just give you the above facts, so you might reconsider paying him a little more than you intended to do, he is hard up and requires money and would probably settle reasonably with you. He says he must have satisfied Bert with his work or he would have been fired, as you kept no drones on the job.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.H. Wyatt, Esq.,\n505 Merchants Bank Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to the contract for building Guy Indian Residential School. The painter on this job, Mr. R. A. Moxley, has asked me to write to the Department and state that he has not received sufficient pay for his work.\n\nI enclose some correspondence which I have had about this matter with Mr. Wyatt, the contractor. I understand that Mr. Wyatt has paid this man off at the rate of 50\u00a2 per hour, and that there is no dispute about the number of hours worked, but that the painter asks for 65\u00a2 per hour.\n\nThe Inspector of Construction wrote to the contractor on November 26th, and advised him that this man was the only real painter who was on the job, and that he thought it would be advisable to pay him the difference between what he asked for and what he received; in other words he advised that Mr. Moxley be paid at the rate of 58\u00a2 per hour.\n\nI have no comments to make on this matter, but am just advising the Department of the wishes of Mr. Moxley.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Grant, Inspector of Construction.\n\n- #394 - Opasquia Hotel $25.50\n- #395 - F.M. Hayes, Board of Inspector 33.00\n- #396 - Inspector's Salary for November 144.00\n- #397 - Inspector's fare The Pas to Prince Albert, Sask. 11.00\n\nBefore submitting these vouchers I wrote Mr. Waddy for further explanation as to why the Inspector should have remained at The Pas for six days after his return from Sturgeon Landing, and why his final reports and statements could not have been prepared before leaving Sturgeon Landing while he was waiting for favorable weather conditions to come out. Mr. Waddy writes in reply that Mr. Grant informed him that he could not make out his report at Sturgeon Landing as he did not know whether certain work would be completed. The work in question appears to have been that to be performed by an electrician whom he met at The Pas on his way to do the work. There was some carpentry work also to be completed, and men left to do this would not have returned to The Pas until a day or two after the Inspector arrived at the latter place.\n\nThe Inspector's diary accompanying voucher #396 does not clearly state what he was doing on the days he stopped over at The Pas, but Mr. Waddy gives more elaborate details. It would appear that on Monday the 23rd the Inspector interviewed and instructed the electrician, and also interviewed Bishop Charlesbois who desired some details about the plan of the building.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTuesday the 24th the Inspector was preparing his final reports and estimates. On Wednesday the 25th Mr. Grant was attending to correspondence and prepared to leave on the train, but had to wait over to see what the contractor had to say in answer to some telegrams sent to him. On Thursday the 26th there was no train and Mr. Grant spent the time in the Agent's office doing some odd jobs on his final work, and finally he left on Friday the 27th for Prince Albert on the afternoon train. The voucher includes payment for Friday the 27th while he was on the train proceeding to destination. The Agent, Mr. Waddy seems to make out a case justifying payment for the number of days charged in the voucher, but I am inclined to think that Mr. Grant need not have made it necessary to remain at The Pas to draw up his final reports and estimates, and that two or at the outside three days should have been sufficient to enable him to obtain sufficient data to make his final report to the Department. However, I have made no deductions in the voucher and leave the matter for the Department to decide.\n\nIn concluding his letter to me Mr. Waddy refers to the preparation by Mr. Grant of the sewage disposal plan for the use of the Department's architect to show the location of each pipe. I presume the Department requested Mr. Grant to submit this plan, which he prepared I understand at his home in Prince Albert and for which no time is allowed. Mr. Waddy completes letter by saying:\n\n\"Mr. Grant's employment was taken as complete when he reached Prince Albert, though I am more or less certain that he will have considerable correspondence with the Department as the contractor may try to get a few more extras than Mr. Grant allowed. He was looking out for the interests of the Department all the time.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

The sewerage system consist principally in the construction of a septic tank and two separate sewer lines from the building to the tank, the outlet sewer from the tank to discharge directly into the Sturgeon Lake. The estimated cost of this work will amount to $1,800.\n\nThe water work system as projected will comprise an eighty gallon per minute typhoon pump, operated by an eight H. P. gasoline or oil engine, all of which can be installed in the basement in a room specially provided for same. The water will be conducted from the lake into an intake well by gravity, from where it will be pumped into an elevated water tank, which will be embodied in the new addition.\n\nThe reason for placing the tank above the building is due to the fact that the school grounds are practically level and a saving will be made in both the cost of construction and the maintenance.\n\nThe estimated cost of the water works, including the pipe line, which will be about 700 feet long, will amount to $3,000. exclusive of the cost of the tank, the plans for which are under preparation.\n\nUpon consulting with Mr. Orr it was found advisable that the capacity of the engine specified for the water work system be such as to equally operate the electric generator, which will be required for this building. I have therefore prepared a specification for the electric generating plant in order that the machinery may be adjusted in co-ordination with that of the water supply. It will consist of a five K. W., D. C., 110 volt generator, a switch board complete with ammeter, voltmeter, fuses, switches, etc. and a 200 ampere hour storage battery.\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe estimated cost of the generating plant as before specified will be $1,500.\n\nWith your approval the specifications of the above mentioned systems will be attached to the general specification for the building, in order that the tenders submitted will also include a price for these works. Otherwise the advertisement for tenders will have to call for a separate price for the sewerage, water supply systems, and electric generating plant.\n\nWill you kindly advise me accordingly.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nTHE PAS. 31st December 1925\n\nIndian Department.\n\nTreaty 5.\n\nper J.W.

However, it was not delivered in time to be put on by the contractor, and I told the fireman that if he had any spare time during the winter I would be pleased if he did this work, and he informs me that he has the work about finished.

This report outlines a water supply, electric light and power installation, and sewerage system for the school, together with the estimated cost thereof. It is proposed to install both plants in the machinery room shown in the plans of the school.\n\nWATER SUPPLY AND POWER.\n\nGENERAL.\n\nAn investigation was made of the feasibility of developing hydro power for the school from the Sturgeon river. The investigation showed however that the cost would be excessive for the small amount of power required and it was decided to use two oil engines for the necessary power.\n\nThe water supply system is designed to fully supply the domestic demand for over 100 inmates and give a limited fire protection. The electric lighting and power plant comprises a 7\u00bd k.w. and a 5\u00bd k.w. generator, driven by a 10 h.p. and 6 h.p. oil engine respectively, which should amply take care of the light and power demands of the institution.\n\nAs shown on the General Layout Plan No. 1, it is proposed to take the water from the river some 700 feet north of the school, a four-inch intake pipe running from the river to the school. As this is some distance above the sewer outlet, with rapids between the sewer outlet and the water intake, there should be no danger of the water supply being polluted.\nThe proposed plant calls for two oil engines, a 10 h.p. and a 6 h.p. By means of a line shaft either engine can be used for driving the pump or the electric generators. With this duplicate power there should be no interruption to either the water or electrical service.\n\nWATER SUPPLY.\n\nIntake.\n\nAs shown on General Layout Plan No. 1, it is proposed to take the water from the river about 700 feet north of the rear end of the school through a four inch wrought iron pipe. This location was decided on in order to avoid the necessity of having to go far out into the river to avoid freezing. At the location shown on the plan for the point of intake, the current is fairly swift near the shore and at the present level the water is ten feet deep a short distance out. No trouble should therefore be experienced from freezing during the winter. Another reason for choosing this location was the advisability of going a certain distance above the sewer outlet. As between this point and the sewer outlet there is a fairly swift rapids, no danger from pollution should be incurred. A ridge of rock about 150 feet wide, three feet below the ground will make part of the excavation for the intake line expensive, as it will be necessary to have at least five feet of covering over it to ensure against frost.\n\nPumping Plant.\n\nThe proposed pump will be of the plunger type similar to the Fairbanks-Morse \"Typhoon Pumps\" capable of pumping 90 g.p.m. against 60 pounds pressure with either an independent air compressor or with the compressor attached to the pump. The plunger type of pump is chosen on account of the long suction pipe. As shown on the Machinery Layout Plan No. 2\nthe pump will be driven from a line shaft. Two sources of power will be available, either from a 10 h.p. or a 6 h.p. oil engine. This should ensure continuous service. From a three-inch discharge pipe the water goes to a 12\" x 4\" pneumatic pressure tank and from there to the school water mains. Though the proposed pumping plant will more than supply the domestic requirements, only a limited amount of fire protection will be given. It is considered, however, that for any ordinary outbreak of fire the supply should be sufficient.\n\nELECTRIC LIGHTING AND POWER.\n\nThe Say Indian school is remotely situated from rail and water transportation during the winter months and in order to provide continuous service it is most advisable to install two power units. In the following layout two units are proposed, the larger unit being sufficient to meet most of the power requirements of the institution as finally completed. In case of breakdown or engine trouble either power unit would provide light and water service.\n\nThe electric lighting and power plant will consist of a 7\u00bd k.w. and a 3\u00bd k.w. D.C. generator. As shown on Machinery Layout Plan No. 2 the 7\u00bd k.w. generator will be driven from the line shaft by the 10 h.p. oil engine already mentioned, or in case of its breakdown by the 6 h.p. oil engine. The 3\u00bd k.w. generator will ordinarily be direct belt driven by the 6 h.p. oil engine, but in case of this engine failing it may be driven from the line shaft from the 10 h.p. engine. By this means practically continuous operation will be secured.\nThe 3\u00bd k.w. generator should supply most of the electric power for lighting, while the larger generator may be used either for power or lighting requirements.\n\nA one panel switchboard with voltmeter, ammeter and necessary switches is provided as shown on Machinery Layout Plan No. 2.\n\nLaundry Room Service.\n\nAs shown on the Machinery Layout Plan No. 2, the line shaft is carried through to the laundry and the necessary power can be taken either from the 10 h.p. or 6 h.p. oil engine.\nESTIMATES OF COST.\n\nWATER SUPPLY AND ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER.\n\nPIPE LINE.\n\nExcavation 300 cu. yds. earth @ 1.00 ............... $ 300.00\n\" 50 \" \" tank @ 6.00 .................. 180.00\nLaying and backfilling 700 feet of 4 in. wrought iron pipe ............ 350.00\nLaying 24 feet of 4 in. cast iron intake ............. 100.00\n700 feet of 4 in. wrought iron pipe ................. 600.00\n24 feet of 4 in. cast iron pipe ...................... 30.00\nStrainer and 4 in.

Plans and profiles, together with estimates of the cost accompany this report. The elevations given on the plans and profiles are sea level, Topographic Survey B.M. 51, Elevation 883.75 on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan boundary.\n\nAs the land about the school will be used for playgrounds and gardens the system has been so designed that no structures appear above ground level. The sewerage system proposed will take care of 100 inmates.\n\nAfter an examination of the conditions both from the cost and sanitary points of view it was decided that a sewerage system with only septic tank treatment would be sufficient and at the same time the most feasible.\n\nFurther treatment by disposal beds, of the sewerage after leaving the septic tank, was considered, but in addition to entailing a large extra cost the topography of the site is not suitable. Sewerage Disposal Beds to give satisfactory results should be near enough to the surface of the ground to allow of air action which is the main factor in the purification of the sewerage. As the ground surrounding the school is practically level the sewer will have to be laid at a depth of about eight feet. This would mean placing the disposal beds at this depth which is too deep for the securing of proper action from the air. From the sanitary standpoint the septic tank treatment of the sewerage should be sufficient as the affluent after passing from the tank will discharge directly\ninto the river where the dilution should be great enough to prevent dangerous pollution.\n\nAs shown on the General Layout Plan No. 1 it is proposed to take the drains from the laundry room at the rear of the building. The laundry waste and roof water are to be carried in a separate drain to a manhole below the septic tank, where it will then join the outlet pipe which will carry both it and the sanitary sewerage to the river. By this method, in addition to reducing the amount of sewerage to be treated, it ensures that no chemicals, etc., used in washing, enter the septic tank.\n\nThe sewerage from the toilets, baths, etc., is carried by a six inch tile (designated Sanitary on the Plan) to the septic tank, from whence it discharges into the river.\n\nLAUNDRY WASTE.\n\nAs already stated the waste from the laundry is not treated but is discharged directly into the river. A six inch cast iron soil pipe carries the waste from the building to the double manhole \"A\". See details of manholes Plan No. 4. From this manhole a six inch tile is laid in the same trench as the sanitary sewer as far as the septic tank and from this point is carried round the septic tank to the outlet manhole \"B\" and thence into the river.\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND SYPHON CHAMBER.\n\nThe sewerage, other than the laundry waste, leaves the building through a six inch cast iron soil pipe to the double manhole \"A\", thence through a six inch tile to the septic tank. As shown on Plan No. 3 the septic tank and syphon chamber are combined and are to be constructed of a 1, 2 and 3 concrete mix. To secure protection from frost a double plank roof with a six inch air space is provided.\nThe septic tank itself is seven feet wide, seventeen feet long and six feet deep at the centre. To facilitate the removal of sludge the bottom of the tank slopes towards the inlet end, and a manhole is placed in the roof at this point. The effluent enters the tank through a six inch cast iron soil pipe and by means of a tee and a short length of pipe is carried one foot below the sewerage line, thus avoiding any disturbance to the surface scum.\n\nFrom the septic tank the sewerage flows over the dividing wall to the siphon chamber; two baffle boards carried one foot below the standing level of the liquid preventing any undue disturbance.\n\nFrom the siphon chamber the sewage is discharged through two three-inch \"Anthes\" automatic siphons designed to discharge under an eighteen-inch head.\n\nMANHOLES.\n\nAs shown on Plan No. 4 the manholes are constructed of concrete, with the exception of the roof which is made of two thicknesses of two inch planks. Each manhole is provided with a two feet square cast iron cover to allow of easy entrance.\n\nManhole \"A\" is a double manhole having two chambers separated by a concrete dividing wall, the one chamber taking the laundry waste and the other the sanitary sewerage. An iron screen is provided for the sanitary sewerage chamber to prevent any articles such as rags, boots, etc., reaching the septic tank.\n\nIn case it is desired to shut off the sewerage from the septic tank an opening between the two chambers with a sliding wooden gate is provided. The sewerage can thus at any time be diverted into the laundry drain and discharged directly into the river.\nOUTLET.\n\nIn the vicinity where it would be feasible to place the sewer outlet a boulder shelf extends for some distance out from the shore. To lay a pipe through this, at a sufficient depth to prevent freezing, would be very expensive and to avoid this it is proposed to carry the sewage from the river bank in an eight inch square wooden box drain. The box drain would be made in sections about twelve feet long. With the rise and fall of the river a sufficient number of the sections will be taken up or laid down to carry the end of the drain to the river.\n\nThe other alternative is the laying of cast iron pipe far enough out into the river to ensure any possibility of freezing in the winter. This would entail expensive excavation through the boulder shelf and a certain amount of cofferdamming in the river itself. The cost for this will be quite high and for the present at least it is not considered necessary or advisable as the use of the wooden box drains though entailing a certain amount of labor should be satisfactory.\n## Estimates of Cost\n\n### Sewage System\n\n#### Septic Tank and Syphon Chamber\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 22 cu. yds. concrete                      |          | $46.00     | $952.00 |\n| 30 cu. yds. earth excavation              |          | $1.50      | $45.00  |\n| 28 cu. yds. rock                          |          | $6.00      | $168.00 |\n| 1400 F.B.M. lumber                        |          | $75.00     | $105.00 |\n| Twin \"Arthas\" Syphons and fittings        |          |            | $150.00 |\n\nTotal: $895.00\n\n#### Manholes \"A\" and \"B\"\n\n| Item                                      | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 6 cu. yds. concrete                       |          | $16.00     | $96.00  |\n| 16 cu. yds. earth excavation              |          | $1.50      | $24.00  |\n| 2 cast iron manhole covers and screen     |          |            | $40.00  |\n| 200 F.B.M. lumber                         |          | $75.00     | $15.00  |\n\nTotal: $198.00\n\n#### Laying and Supplying Drains\n\n**Sanitary Drain**\n\n- 180 lineal feet 6 in. tile @ $1.75\n\nTotal: $315.00\n\n**Laundry Drain**\n\n- 136 lineal feet of 6 in. tile in same trench as Sanitary sewer @ $1.00\n- 70 lineal feet 6 in. tile in separate trench @ $1.75\n\nTotal: $257.50\n\n**Outlet Sewer**\n\n- 30 lineal feet 6 in. tile @ $1.50\n- 50 \" 8 in. wood box drain @ $1.00\n\nTotal: $95.00\n\nTotal: $1,760.50\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

The tenders closed at noon today and in response the following have been received.\n\nE. B. Sharpe, Minnedosa, Man. $86,329.00\nR. N. Wyatt, Winnipeg, Man. $92,255.00\nS. Brown, Winnipeg, Man. $93,900.00\nA. Amyot, Hull, Que. $99,900.00\nWyndels Construction Co., St. Boniface, $112,300.00\n\nAn offer was also received from F. W. Graham of Moosejaw to construct the building on a cost plus 10% basis.\n\nAll of the above mentioned tenders are accompanied by the required deposit security with the exception of the tender of E. B. Sharpe. With reference to this tender a telegram was received from the Canadian Surety Company advising that they have issued a bid bond as his security. A telegram was received from Mr. Sharpe advising that he will arrange for a cash security in lieu of the bid bond. As the tender of Mr. E. B. Sharpe is the lowest and a reasonable price for the work, I beg to recommend that it be accepted.\n\nA portion of the building was erected last year, which included boiler room and boilers, kitchen, power house, laundry, store rooms and chapel, the cost of which was $25,519.00. The cost of the building is necessarily high on account of its isolated location and the cost of freighting the materials by water from The Pas to Sturgeon Landing. There are funds provided in this year's vote for Indian Education for this building.\n\nThe above tenders include in addition to the building itself the complete installation of the water supply, sewerage disposal, and electric lighting systems.\n\nARCHITECT.\nOttawa, May 17, 1926.\n\nE.B.

McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 10th, for which I beg to thank you. I am returning herewith copies of Contract duly signed.\n\nWe are putting this building in hand and promise to rush it to completion, but we are going to experience some difficulty in getting materials delivered on account of the low water in the rivers and lake. The company who handles the transportation by boat expect a raise in water by the 21st of this month, as the snow in the mountains usually comes down about that time, although the weather here up to date has been rather cool, which would retard the melting of the snow. However, you can rest assured we will try and get out before we are frozen up again.\n\nRe payments on this job:- If it could be arranged that upon the report of your Inspector, Mr. Grant to your Agent, Mr. Wady at The Pas, that Mr. Wady could wire you the amount due me you could have the monies wired to the Bank of Montreal, Lombard Street Branch, Winnipeg. This would assist materially in financing this job, as I presume you are aware that we have to get all our materials in by boat before the first of August or it would be impossible to get them in afterwards, as the water usually goes down by that date, so you can understand my payments for materials would be heavy and if we were to wait until Mr. Grant's report reached you from the job and a cheque sent back here to me it would be half a month gone.\n\nWould be very pleased to have this arranged as asked for.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

OF THE INTERIOR, CANADA.\n\nSIR:\n\nWould you kindly inform me if the plan prepared by your dept., for the dept. of Indian Affairs showing the Water Supply Sewerage System for the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL is correct, specifications say that the intake well is to be located at a point 700 ft. north of the rear of the school, the plan checked up shows it approximately 930 ft. from the building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nINSPECTOR OF CONSTRUCTION\nJuly 27th, 1926.\n\nR. Grant, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nGuy Indian School,\nSturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis will confirm the decision we arrived at when I took up with you personally at Sturgeon Landing the question raised in your letter of July 9th, with reference to the water supply intake for the Guy Indian School.\n\nIn your letter you state that the plan of the water supply system shows the four-inch intake pipe to be some 700 feet long, whereas to reach the location shown on the plan as the point of intake would require 930 feet of four-inch pipe.\n\nThis discrepancy in the length of the four-inch intake pipe required was, as I pointed out, due to a misunderstanding as to the location of the school. In June of last year Mr. Patterson of this office visited Sturgeon Landing in company with Bishop Charlebois when two alternative sites for the school building were chosen by Bishop Charlebois and staked out by Mr. Patterson. These alternative sites \"A\" and \"B\" are shown on the blue print plan which I left with you.\n\nBefore designing the water supply it was necessary to know which of the sites had been chosen and the question therefore was taken up with Mr. Wyatt, contractor for the school, who stated that the site designated \"A\" had been decided on as the most suitable.\n\nIn estimating the cost of excavation Mr. Wyatt was requested to make borings along the proposed pipe line as Mr. Patterson with his limited equipment and help had not been able to determine how much rock excavation would be necessary. The borings were carried for 700 feet from the school building, which distance from site \"A\" would bring the intake well above the small point shown in white on the plan. As already stated, it was understood that site \"A\" had been chosen and the plans for both the sewer and water systems were therefore laid out for this site.\n\nOn receipt of your letter the question was taken up with Mr. Wyatt, who stated that this office must have been given the wrong location, as the lower site \"B\" had been chosen, and not site \"A\". This, of course, explained the discrepancy, as the distance between the two sites is about 200 feet.\nAs shown in red on the plan, with the actual location of the school at site \"B\", 700 feet of intake pipe would bring the point of intake in the bay, and not above the small point as originally proposed. In examining this point of intake on the ground with you it was found that there was very little current and we both agreed that it would be advisable to extend the four-inch intake about 125 feet, as at this point the current is quite strong a short distance from the shore.\n\nIn order to ensure running water at this point during periods when the river is low I pointed out to you that it would be advisable to clear the channel above of the loose rocks and boulders.

The Inspector of Construction strongly recommends that the material for this additional work be purchased at once, owing to the early closing of navigation. The question of the laying of this pipe can be decided later on, after the Department is furnished with an estimate of the approximate cost of the work by the Inspector, who is now engaged in boring test holes to find out the nature of the soil. I would, therefore, recommend that he be authorized to instruct the contractor to arrange for the delivery of the above mentioned material as early as possible.

Grant, Inspector of Construction.\n\n1st. In regards to porch on right side elevation of building under construction, and the entrance to the boys wing, these two places should be screened in.\n\n2nd. His Lordship Bishop Charlesbois asks for a stairway to be provided for an entrance to the sitting room in the girls wing.\n\n3rd. The site for the stable is picked out by His Lordship east of left side elevation of building and the stable should be provided as the animals are already arriving here. Bishop Charlesbois has put up a one ply shed for temporary stable for one team but this will be no use for winter quarters.\n\n4th. A root cellar will be required in addition to the small cellar in the main building. Mr. Grant has written you about need of drain for cellar in building.\n\n5th. Outside toilets will be required for pupils arriving here before the sanitary arrangements are complete.\n\n6th. A warehouse is required for storing supplies coming off the boat etc.\n\n7th. Seating and necessary furniture for completing the chapel should be sent soon to allow of water transport being used as this is much cheaper than team work in the winter.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nI beg to suggest that favorable consideration be given to foregoing requirements. It can all be done cheaper at this time than after the contractor leaves, and could be done on cost plus percentage basis by contractor under supervision of Mr. Grant.\n\nIf these items are allowed I should be advised by wire as water transport will close in near future from lack of water on the lakes and rivers.\n\nI am pleased to be able to report to the Department that the school is being put up in workmanlike manner and that the materials supplied seem to be first class. The building is now having the finish put on and of course will not go ahead as quickly as up to this time, but the contractor will have enough of it finished to allow the Principal to have some pupils enter the school by September 15th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nP.S. On my return to The Pas to-day I received telegram of the 25th inst. regards lack of funds for stable. I presume this will also apply to the root cellar. Bishop Charlesbois will require lumber for floor, mangers etc of rough stable if the permanent one is not built at once.\nSTURGEON LANDING, SASK.\nAugust 28th 1926.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 10th inst and your wire of the 24th inst regards re-location of water intake well at the Guy Indian Residential School I beg to say that I will have the test borings made as authorised and submit estimate on the cost of additional work just as soon as we have taken the borings, I will send the estimate to Mr. Waddy at The Pas and he will wire you the information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRe: Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nSir,\n\nAs per your wire of the seventh inst regarding laundry machinery for above school instructing that contractor should purchase same the Canadian Laundry Machinery Co quoted to the contractor as follows $860.00 and the Beaver Laundry Co $990.00 both prices F.O.B.Winnipeg, Man. I instructed the contractor to accept the lowest price, which includes the washer and extractor. It is probable that this price does not include commission to contractor for handling charges. I have arranged for contractor that following be supplied, belting for machines, line shaft and bearings etc. Line shaft and bearings have been shipped also the generator, the latter is here and loaded on the barge.\n\nThe sisters and the Bishop are leaving here to-night for Sturgeon Landing and I came to town and arranged for shipment of everything that we can foresee to complete the building, as we have very short time to do the work.\n\nWhile here I arranged for supply of roof coating for the rubberoid roofing on the roofs of the laundry, kitchen and fuel room, which was built last year and require this treatment. I also ordered sufficient concrete paint of suitable color for the basement floors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nAsst.

Intake well.\n\nThe test borings along the proposed ditch for the additional 125 feet to intake well shows clay and loose rock formation. Location of intake well shows formation of clay and boulders at depth of nine feet six inches. Ditch from well to shore line is 85 feet, test borings show loose rock at depth of six feet from surface, this formation shows the same from well to shore line.\n\nThe elevation of the ground at site of proposed well is 20'6\" above lowest water level, the 4\" pipe will be laid at depth of 14'10\" below grade line where it enters intake well, this depth is caused through the grade line at point of well being high. The depth of the 4\" pipe as laid at the 700 foot point completed by the contractor is down 8 feet, the location selected for the well is the best as there will be no interference with bends in the suction pipe, the distance is increased between the well and the shore line, it is also advisable to use the selected site for protection of the pipe line from frost; by bringing the intake well closer to the shore line it would mean that the pipe line would be too close to the embankment, and as I have said we do not want to have any fittings or bends in a pipe line the length of 825 feet from suction pump.\n\nReferring to your wire of September 3rd I have arranged with the contractor for the shipment of the necessary materials only as required for the above work as outlined. In regards to the labor on this work I received a further estimate from the contractor of $6770.65, which included diverting the stream to ensure fresh water all winter at point of intake, but I considered this so excessive that I will not recommend it to the Department. I now recommend that we go ahead with the work under the contractor plus percentage you consider will be additional to his contract.\n\nWe are going ahead with this work on this basis to complete same as economical as possible, and on my return to Sturgeon Landing I will send a detailed estimate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRodrick Grant\nInspector of Construction.\n\nAsst.

Wyatt the contractor on the erection of the Guy Indian School, since I submitted my report of Sept 1st.\n\nThe work on the outside sewer drains is now completed except where the drain pipe leaves the septic tank for the manhole \"B\" this manhole has to be built.\n\nSeptic tank is complete with roof put on ready to be covered over with earth.\n\nThe water intake pipe is connected to the pump in the machinery room and the supply pipe brought from the pump to the floor of the tank house also the overflow pipe installed from the tank house to the boiler room and connected to the sewer, the tank house is built but not completed, the material is now on the job for the water tank but it is not assembled.\n\nThe basement is now completed except for the following items, cement base on outside walls, pipe covering which is now underway, to connect the wall radiators and interior painting on metal ceiling and all varnishing.\n\nGround Floor,\n\nThe work on this floor is now well advanced towards completion, the carpenter work is all done except for the finished floor in the corridor, the painting is being gone on with, and all hardware put on.\n\nFirst Floor,\n\nThe plaster work is well advanced on this floor and at this rate is 50% complete, the carpenter work is ahead as far as it is possible until the plaster work is done, the work on the metal will go ahead as soon as the plasterers are through with this floor.\nThe second floor.\n\nThe balance of the lathing is not done on this floor, however, I expect they will be working on it in a few days; the plasterer completed three rooms.\n\nPlumbing.\n\nThe plumbing work is well advanced under the conditions in which the plumbers are working not being able to complete one floor at a time, all toilet and bathroom fixtures in the basement are connected up complete, the toilet and bathroom fixtures on the ground floor are connected up to the extent of 75%, inside toilet and baths on the second floor has being connected up.\n\nHeating.\n\nThis work is as well advanced that we are in a position to supply heat to all parts of the building when it turns cold at night time, I expect this part of the work to be complete in 12 days.\n\nElectric work.\n\nThere is nothing to report on this work of any further advance being made since my report of Sept 1st, we have the generator and equipment here on the job and work of installing same will be proceeded with at once as the electricians are here.\n\nWater intake.\n\nSince the 13th of Sept we are busy working on this intake pipe lines and excavations for the well I expect to have the pipe here with the next beat which is expected here at the end of the present week, this is the part of the work that is holding us back we are our best to have the water to the building and the work completed outside.\nbefore the freeze up or sooner if possible.\n\nOutside work,\n\nOwing to a shortage of materials we have been delayed in completing the siding on the front elevation and the right side elevation, the veranda on the side of the building is now being built. I expect the carpenters will be through with this work in a week's time so that we will have the painting completed. The work on the outside of the tank house is also going towards completion. I have arranged that the sisters have temporary accommodation with tables and anything they required for the children until such time as we will arrange for the permanent requirements.

If you have a list of all the furnishings that is being shipped, it's possible that they may be shipping some of the furnishings I mentioned above.\n\nIf I had a copy of the list we could be governed accordingly and make only the requirements not shipped.\nI think we will have time to get this material before the freeze up, there will be quite a job of cubards required for the sewing room, and linen closets, it would be best to leave everything off until we have a copy of the as shipped, we could make everything here as outlined.\n\nWe are getting along fine with the intake well we, the 125 ft, of 4\" suction pipe laid in trench and filled in, the well is down 22 ft, and in a clay, we are down 14 ft with the inflow pipe down.

He states that later on he will submit detailed list for the other floors for these extra requirements; that it will be plain work and could be done by the carpenters working for the contractor.\n\nI would be obliged if the Department will issue instructions in this matter.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nI have the honor to submit herewith my report on the work done by Mr. R.N. Wyatt, the contractor, on the erection of the above mentioned school since I submitted my report of September 15th, 1926.\n\nThe manhole marked \"B2\" is complete with the pipes from the septic tank and the laundry running into it, with the discharge pipe from the manhole connected to the box drain discharging into the river. The roof of the septic tank is now covered with earth and graded over top.\n\nThe additional 135 feet of the water intake pipe is now laid in trench to well. The well is excavated to a depth of 22 ft. We have run into quicksand at this depth and had to stop operations until we could get suitable material for cribbing, which we expect to arrive here next week. The trench for the inflow pipe from the river to the well is now down 16 ft. Owing to the river rising 3 ft above the low water level, we are having difficulty in excavating to the depth required below the low water level mark.\n\nWe have connected a temporary pipe line from the river to the intake pipe at the well for a domestic water supply to the building. We are using the pumping plant in the machinery room which is now installed. The water is now installed and in use as it may be a few weeks before the intake is completed. I decided to have this temporary work done to accommodate the requirements of the building as it was quite a hardship on the Sisters, trying to attend upon the children without a water supply. It was also best to have the water tank filled before the cold weather set in so that any leaks would have a chance to take up before the frost came.\n\nThe basement.\n\nThe basement is now complete except for the following items, interior painting on metal ceilings and all varnishing on the woodwork, painting of all exposed steam pipes and radiators.\n\nGround floor.\n\nThere has nothing further been done on this floor except the painting of the rooms at the boys wing and class room #3. At present the children make use of this floor as it was the most advanced toward completion.\nFirst floor.\n\nThe plaster work is now completed. The metal ceiling has been put throughout except in two rooms. The metal was left off these rooms until later as it was advisable owing to the waste and water pipes being exposed on the ceiling. Carpenter work of this floor, All door jambs set in place. Work to some extent has been done on window trim, also finished floor laid in sisters dormitory.\n\nSecond floor.\n\nPlaster work all completed. Carpenters have not started work on finishing.\n\nPlumbing.\n\nThe plumbing work is completed throughout the building to the extent of 80% of the contract.\n\nHeating.\n\nThe work on the heating installation is now complete on all floors with all pipes in the basement covered as per specifications.\n\nElectric work.\n\nThis work has been pushed ahead since my last report. The generator has been installed with the necessary equipment and now working but not completed.\n\nOutside work.\n\nThe contractor is pushing the outside work before the cold weather comes on. Work is done grading around the building and finishing up all painting outside on main building and tank house and framed tower. Storm sash has all been fitted and now being painted. Carpenters are getting well completed with all details on the outside. The pipe box from the roof of the machinery room to the outside of the tank floor for the supply and overflow pipes is now being built. The steam line to tank room is also completed.\n\nWe have not done very much work on the inside except when the weather would not permit outside work.\n\nTHE SECRETARY DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo RODERICK GRANT\n\nINSPECTOR OF CONSTRUCTION\n\nSend cheque to GUY INDIAN SCHOOL,\nMrs R.Grant, 119-14th St.West, Prince Albert, Sask.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\n1926 | At Guy Indian Residential School | \n| Sturgeon Landing, Sask. | \n| 30 days at $6.00, per day | $180.00\n| Diary showing work being done, including Sundays, will be sent in later.

The lumber arrived here on the 3rd but owing to the barge which carried this, breaking away from her cable and got away from the boat in a high wind and stranded across the lake. We expect to have this lumber delivered here about next Monday, when work will be pushed ahead. We have diverted and increased the stream by clearing the channel above the point of intake, of loose rocks and boulders.\n\nBarn.\n\nWork has been started on this and we expect it to be completed and ready for the housing of the stock in about one weeks time.\n\nElectric installation.\n\nWork on generator and equipment is now completed.

Heating and plumbing installation has now been completed as per specifications and is giving good satisfaction.

It will take us three or four weeks to complete the permanent work, as we are having zero weather and as low as ten below we find it much harder to maintain the present water supply.\n\nAll the work on the outside of the building is now complete.\n\nThe work on the barn is completed except for the floor; at present we are taking out bush timbers for this part of the work; there is now II head of cattle and four horses housed in the building for the past ten days.\n\nWe have also excavated for a root cellar as there was not sufficient accommodation inside for the potatoes and vegetables to be stored during the winter.\n\nI may further state that we did no work on the ground and first floors since my last report.\n\nI delayed my report as there was no mail service until the winter trail is open for travelling.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\n\nInspector of construction,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Rt.

I expect all the carpenter work to be completed about the end of the year.\n\nThe painting work is now well advanced on the first floor and will be ready for occupancy on the 20th Dec., when the sisters will move up to their permanent quarters.\n\nThe woodwork on the ground floor has to receive two coats of varnish except for class room #3 Indians room, and two bedrooms which had being finished previous to this floor being occupied. All floors has to be oiled or varnished as specified on this floor, metallic ceiling on the ground floor has to receive the finishing coat of paint on the ceiling of all the corridors.\n\nThe woodwork in the basement has to receive two coats of varnish throughout where stain and varnish is called for in the specifications, the painting is complete in the girls recreation room and toilets, washroom, the painting in the boys recreation room, toilets and washroom has not being started.\n\nThe metallic ceiling in the basement is complete to the extent 75% of the painting.\n\nI expect the painting work to be complete before the 15th of Jan.\n\nWe have installed the new cook range for the\nuse in the kitchen.\n\nThe desks have been assembled and will be placed in the class rooms when finished painting.\n\nWe have not started on the work of installing the oven in the bakery as the space taken up with the oven was 9'x7' and the size of the bakery was limited for an oven this size. I waited until the Bishop arrived and took the matter up with him when he decided to have it installed in the bakery, as we have the brick here. We will start upon the work at once, the capacity of the oven is 300 loaves, we will install the dough mixer as soon as it arrives here.\n\nThe work of making the furnishings required in the way of tables for the dinning rooms, benches for same, and benches for the recreation rooms with hinged tops, also the fitting up of the kitchen and pantry, cupboards for all the dormitories, sewing room, platforms in the three class rooms will be started as soon as the material arrives. His Lordship Bishop Charlebois paid us a visit last week and told me that he wanted me to remain here until all the work of making the furnishings was complete. I told him that I would be here until the water intake was completed and if it was satisfactory to the dept., that I would remain and have all the work outlined above done, the items mentioned above does not include any of the furnishings made outside.\n\nThe seating accommodation in the chapel is being arranged for as per your instructions.\n\nRe: the water intake\n\nWe are working on this work through the cold weather and are now getting close to the river, it is impossible to say when we will have this completed as we have so many difficulties to contend with and it is work on which you can't use many men.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\n\nInspector of construction.\n| DATE | NO OF PIECES | FEET | PRICE | AMOUNT | TOTAL AMOUNT |\n|------|--------------|------|-------|--------|-------------|\n|      | 2 bags Lime  |      |       |        |             |\n|      | 2 sacks      |      |       |        |             |\n\nLime received.\nPrice just and fair.\nCertified correct.\n\nNo. 357.

They cannot do without a bell, but I do not see any place in the building provided to put it. You could call the attention of the Department on this fact.\n\nI think the best would be to put up a little tower in the centre of the building in which the bell could be placed. Please see about this before you get through your work in the school.\n\nI beg to remain yours truly,\n\n+ O. Charlebois, P.A.\nBishop of Keewatin.\nSIR,\n\nPlease find attached letter from Bishop Charlebois drawing my attention that they require a bell for the Guy School, as there was no provision made on the plans for a tower to house a bell. I would recommend to the dept. that they consider placing this tower on the main roof of the centre portion of the building, centre line of bell tower to be on centre line of building, design of tower and roof of same, to conform with the construction of the main roof design. I would prefer that this was done now while I am here as I understand that a bell has been purchased and will be shipped here very soon. By placing the bell on the centre line of the building it would be operated in the main corridor on the ground floor.\n\nI have the honour to be your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment Of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nJan. 25, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the providing of a belfry for the Guy School, I beg to say that you may arrange to have a small belfry built on the roof of the passage leading from the school to the chapel. A suitable covering can be provided in this location for the bell at a cost not exceeding $60.00, the bell rope to be taken down and operated from the passage leading from the school to the chapel.\n\nIt is not considered advisable to place a belfry on the main building as this would cost considerably more in order to keep it in proportion to the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

The estimate is dated for the 1st of Feb., as I expected we will have the cofferdam completed in the river at that time.\n\nI have not made out my final report on the work until the intake is complete. Mr. Wyatt has a considerable amount of money coming to him for extra work on that understanding. I have given him his final certificate, that he will complete his work as per contract. The work inside the building is practically complete and anything not now complete will be done as per contract.\n\nI am sending this to you for your approval and if you consider it right kindly let it go through as it is.\n\nWyatt is anxious to get the money he has tied up at Ottawa.\n\nI believe it is the best to let him have this until the extras is adjusted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Wyatt for the Guy Indian Residential School. The Inspector of Construction says there are a few minor items to be given the final touch but he is satisfied to sign this final estimate. His letter is attached.\n\nI understand that Mr. Grant is getting two of Mr. Wyatt's men to help him with the cupboards, shelves etc at the school. In this connection I would be obliged if the Department will say if this meets with their approval, as Wyatt will probably charge us a percentage on cost. My opinion is that it is satisfactory as the men have their own tools on the job and that Mr. Grant will push the work of completing the extras and clean up the whole operation, but I would feel satisfied if the Department will give an opinion one way or the other.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFeb. 9, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo enclosing certificate No 6 for payment to Mr. Wyatt on his contract for the Guy Indian Residential School. This certificate has been changed to $15,000.00, and cannot be considered, therefore, as a final certificate. The final certificate will have to show and include all extra work that has been authorized, and should be accompanied by a statement showing how the various amounts are made up.\n\nWith reference to the erecting of cupboards, shelves, etc., if Mr. Grant can undertake this work himself the Department would be prepared to retain him for this work, providing same did not exceed two months. This would probably work out more economically than by using Mr. Wyatt's carpenters.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. W. Saddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

D. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary Dept., Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI thank you very kindly for your prompt answer on the 10th Inst., to my wire of the same date.\n\nI received your remittance of Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00), but the Certificate calls for Fifteen Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty Five ($15,535.00), kindly let me know what happened to the Five Hundred and Thirty Five Dollars ($535.00), and would like to have your check for this amount, and now that the Contract is completed I should have my deposit check returned.\n\nYour Inspector on the job being Scotch exercises all the qualities of their race when it comes to issuing Certificates, one would think it was his own money he was paying out. You can readily understand that I was entitled to further money after September than he gave me as we had the School inhabited by the 15th September and could have been easily finished by the Contract time had we not done the extra work outside, which we wanted to get done to protect ourselves from suffering from the cold. This also assisted the Department in saving time on extra cost of doing this work in cold weather. Our bill for extras will amount to a considerable sum and presume that he will not want to give me any\nfurther payment until we are through although I am asking for it and by the way the work is going and the amount of extra's that are continually cropping up we will not be through until the 1st of April. Of course we have not many men working there now as the cost would be too great in shipping any more men.\n\nKindly see that these checks are issued at your earliest convenience, I am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\nFeb. 21, 1907.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the payment on your last certificate, I beg to say that it was necessary to hold back $500.00 from this certificate in order that it would not be considered a final certificate. All extra work performed by you, in order to be considered, will have to be shown on the final certificate. It is not necessary of course to wait until all of the work is completed in order for you to obtain an advance on the extra work, provided everything is in order. Your deposit security cannot be released until thirty days after the completion of the contract. I wrote to Indian Agent Waddy on Feb. 9th advising him that the Department had changed the certificate to read $15,000.00 in order that it would not be considered as a final certificate and instructed him that it would be necessary to show all extra work performed on the final certificate together with a full statement showing the nature of the work performed and the authority for same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

In the meantime I will have to make arrangements for further financing unless you are about to meet my request.\n\nIn closing I wish to refer to my letter of February 14th and having re-read it, it strikes me as no doubt it struck you as rather unusual from a standpoint of business. You will doubtless be pleased to learn from me that the relation with Mr. Grant had been entirely satisfactory except he is rather slow in issuing Certificates and does not appear to realize the difficulties of financing so far removed from our centres.\n\nHoping you will be able to give this matter your immediate attention, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRNW/EM\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy, Dept. Public Works,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe - Guy Indian School Sturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour favor of the 21st ultimo, received while I was away from the City temporarily and it could not be answered until now.\n\nThe principal difficulty of financing the work at Sturgeon Landing lies with the Extra's of which the total amount will run to between Twenty and Twenty Five Thousand Dollars.\n\nI was at Sturgeon Landing in the last week of January and of course asked Mr. Grant, the Inspector in charge, to certify an appropriate proportion of my outlay on these Extra's; but for some reason unknown to me that was not done, and I now ask that you give consideration to the difficulties of the situation thus imposed on me.\n\nYour letter in reference allows that an advance on the Extra work is due to me; but, also stated that the Extra work in order to be considered will have to be shown on the final Certificate, yet because it is impossible to state when the final Certificate will be issued there appears to be some degree of inconsistency in the conditions thus laid down. I therefore desire to appeal to you for relief which is absolutely necessary and in the circumstances properly due to me.\n\nI note the reason why you send me Fifteen Thousand Dollars by check just recently instead of the Fifteen Thousand Five Hundred and Thirty Five Dollars as certified by Mr. Grant. Do you not think that a much smaller sum, say the odd Thirty Five Dollars would serve the purpose indicated in your statement. Then as Mr. Grant has certified to the full amount of the Contract, same being complete in every respect to his satisfaction, there does not appear to be any reason for holding the deposit security and I hope to receive that at once because the date of Mr. Grant's certificate was Feb. 1st 1927, and the thirty days mentioned in your letter is now nearly expired.\n\nPersonally I am of the opinion that the security deposit and at least Five Hundred Dollars from the amount you have retained out of the total of Mr. Grant's certificate dated February 1st, can be sent to me at once according to your letter of the 21st, and\nCERTIFICATE\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCertificate No. 1\n\nMarch 9, 1927\n\n$500.00\n\nI hereby Certify that Mr. Smith, Esq., of Winnipeg, Man.\n\nhas supplied material and performed labour on erection\n\nof the Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nContract for A L L work\n\nentitling him to a seventh payment of five hundred dollars.\n\ndollars.\n\nCertificate No. 1 $19,000.00 Contract $92,235.00\n\n1. $19,000.00\n2. $19,000.00\n3. $19,000.00\n4. $19,000.00\n5. $19,000.00\n6. $19,000.00\n7. $19,000.00\n\nTotal $92,235.00\n\nLabour and material in building at first certificate $1. $21,054.00\n2. $20,000.00\n3. $21,000.00\n4. $15,000.00\n5. $18,000.00\n6. $7,101.00\n\nLabour and material required to complete contract $92,235.00\n\nSignature\n\nReceived payment\n\nRegistered Architect\n\nIndian Affairs.

It seems the easiest thing in the world to do this, but it is not by any means a snap. Wyatt's crew has put in about two months trying to get excavated a spot of clay and boulders six feet long and one foot deep, and to get his crib work water tight to put in the length of pipe. The rock bottom has cracks through which the whole force of the current is forcing water, and at the day of my visit four large pumps could not hold back the flow. The foreman is about disgusted and I would not wonder if he pulls off the job.\n\nIf he does pull out we will probably get someone to tackle the work and finish it, though we may have to wait till summer when the water is tame enough for a chap to get right in and do little spade work in his pelt, but not by any means what I would call an impossible situation.\n\nYour letter #132-7-12 of the 9th of February instructed me to take Wyatt's men off extras and furnishings etc and I told Mr. Grant to do this, since then he has worked alone, see my other report on furnishings.\n\nThe purpose of my visit was to get the extras and contract cleaned up to March 1st as there has been lots of time to do this. However Mr. Grant has not been able to get the contractors figures done so where he wants them yet and they have not been presented in voucher form. I wished to get them all in for this fiscal year but the contractor has nothing ready so they will have to stand over.\n\nAsst.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nMarch 19th, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nRe work required to complete the job as requested by the Principal and Sister Superior.\n\nBasement. To stain and varnish the cupboards already built and to build 15 more lockers in girls playroom. One cupboard 12\" deep x 3'x6'. Kitchen. One cupboard 12\" deep by 3'x6\". In Father's Sisters and Men's dining room one cupboard each.\n\nIn scullery. One table with drawer and bread cutting shelf. Covering the bottom of stairs in basement. The Principal asks that these two openings be closed with v joint and doors supplied. This is to ensure privacy from the boys and girls who are inclined to wander through the building when they are left in the recreation rooms.\n\nPainting in kitchen and pantry. Put paint on over the keene cement and on the metal ceiling in the kitchen; this is very dirty.\n\nGround floor. Desk platform in Class Room #3. The Principal also requests that we close up the opening between the 3r girls room and corridor with a doorway 7' high. This will keep the Indian visitors who visit this room from wandering around, and will also give the visitors a record to themselves at this end of the building as well as the other end.\n\nFirst floor. Closets made. One cupboard 12\" deep x 14\"x10' with hat and coat hooks for each girl.\n\nSewing room. One cupboard 12\" deep x 10\"x20'.\n\nIn corridor to chapel balcony. One blanket cupboard, for use of staff. 18\" deep x10\"x18'. With doors.\n\nSister's living room balcony. Bench on hinged strips.\n\nSecond floor. Boys dormitory. Cupboard under wash basins to hold boots etc. One cupboard for blankets 18\" deep x10\"x12', with doors on all cupboards.\n\nYou will see from this that there is quite a lot of work to be completed; I would like to have it done by break up; you will have to arrange for the materials to come at once if the work is to be done. I have put on a painter to help me finish the job; he will have about fifteen days work, this was necessary as I want to get the job through.\n\nThe Principal mentioned the following. There are no facilities here for drying clothes in the winter and they are using every empty room here to dry the laundry. If the Department will allow this I could have one made here suitable for their requirements, in the meanwhile I will do nothing about it except get prices on materials which would be required, and when I get this here I will advise you.\n\nI hear you are coming up here soon and at that time I will go into all these matters personally with you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRodrick Grant\nInspector of construction,\n\nCopy for the Department\n\nIndian Affairs.

On the completion of the laying of this pipe I came inside and worked on the extra furnishings. During part of the months of January and February I had to get help from the men who worked for the contractor as the demand to have this work done was urgent, I had to get the work done that was most required.\n\nSince the end of February I have been working alone on receipt of your instructions through Mr. Waddy. This was on furnishings.\n\nDuring the time the 65 feet of pipe was being laid I had to keep continually on the job outside. The contractor started into work where we left off laying pipe as per his contract. At the end of January he had all his pipe laid with the exception of the last length of steel pipe in the river. He had the coffer dam ready for pumping out, but unfortunately owing to the rock bottom in the river he could not get the dam tight to get the excavation finished for this length of pipe, he had only to go down two feet for the distance of six feet when the deep water would have been reached. To date he has only been able to excavate one foot. To make connections with the pipe laid it will be necessary for him to go down this other foot so that the pipe will be deep enough at the lowest water level for the protection from frost. I am sorry that he is having such trouble, he has worked every workable day since the end of January, we have had four pumps working and cannot get the water low enough to finish excavating but we are hopeful that we will have this completed any day now. We have expected every day since the last of January that that would clean up the job. I am enclosing copies of letters forwarded to Mr. Waddy in reference to furnishings. I am working on plan of present water line and sewage line as they were changed on account of the building not being on the spot noted on the plan. These will be for your file for future reference.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nMar. 30th, 1927\n\nSIR:\n\nPlease find bills from R.

Waddy, Indian Agent, Le Pas, in your favour for extra electrical supplies and work at the Guy Residential School at Sturgeon Landing amounting to $3,240.29. This voucher is prepared from invoices for goods supplied by The Standard Plumbing and Heating Company Ltd., of Winnipeg, and Schumacher-Mackenzie-Kusmen, Ltd., but there is no evidence on the invoices that these firms have been paid by you. If you have paid them, will you kindly get the invoices receipted, and if not, kindly advise the Department and we will issue cheques direct to these firms for the amounts of their invoices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Under separate cover, a cheque for $355 is being directed to Your Lordship.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

McLEAN,\n\nIn view of the distance of the new Guy Indian Residential School from markets, the Department authorized Bishop Charlebois to get whatever equipment was necessary for the satisfactory conduct of the school and to present receipts to the Department. Reimbursement has already been made for many articles which His Lordship purchased to advantage. He bought a bell for the school, however, which is a more expensive type than usually secured for this purpose. It was purchased from the Meneely Bell Company, of Troy, New York State, and the cost was $555. There was no duty on the equipment.\n\nAs His Lordship had carte blanche authority and in no other case was it abused, I am inclined to recommend reimbursement, particularly as he made a special plea when in Ottawa last week. I should be grateful for your instructions.\n\nRussell Heines\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nCOPY\n\nTroy, N. Y., U. S. A.

He would like to know if the work for the completion will\nbe done by day or by contract. If is by contract, he would prefer\nthat Mr. Waddy will have charge to give the contract. I do not know\nmuch work is still to be done. Mr Waddy will know it. I wish you will\nnow communicate with him.\n\nMy best regards to you with sincere thanks for your refund\nchecks, specially the one for the bell. I greatly appreciate your\nkindness.\n\nI remain, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\n+O. L.

Father Doyon, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, informs him that the barn at the institution is not completed. I should be grateful if you would let me know just what work remains undone and estimate the cost thereof.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School in which he asks that the following buildings be constructed at that school.\n\nWarehouse 15'x20' walls 10'.\nBuild root cellar in place excavated 15'x30'.\nChicken house 15'x40' walls 10'.\nIce house 16'x20' walls 10'.\nCarpenter-machine-blacksmith shop 20'x50' walls 12'.\nHouse to accommodate visiting parents etc. 16'x30'x8'.\n\nThe Principal has sent me list of material required for the above work, but no plans of the buildings so I am not able to figure on the cost of labor. His list of lumber, brick, cement, paint, hardware, freight etc would come to about $5000.00, and the labor might amount to probably $2000.00.\n\nThe Department, after considering whether the buildings are to be constructed, might advise what policy is to be planned in reference to labor, or whether contract work will be considered.\n\nDuring June and July it will be impossible for me to overlook any construction as I am absent paying annuity.\n\nDay labor is not satisfactory unless the workmen are under close supervision.\n\nMr. R. Grant made out the list of material for Fr. Doyon, and when he comes through The Pas on his way home next week I will have him make sketches of each building, and have the matter put in shape to submit to contractors if so desired, or to submit them to the Department.\n\nI enclose the lists of material sent here, and will be obliged if they are returned when the Department checks them over and approves or cancels them.\n\nThe Principal asks for 25 rolls barbed wire, this will be purchased under instructions in letter 132-7-14. The canoe he asks for on last sheet of estimates enclosed is for use while fishing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

You may purchase what materials are necessary to complete the root-house and also 11 rolls of rubberoid to cover the implement shed. The labour should be supplied by the school management without cost to the Department. Our funds are completely assigned this year and it will not be possible to proceed with the hen-house, ware-house, ice-house, carpenter shop and Indian house. These requirements have been noted for future estimates. I have already written, asking for an estimate of the cost of completing the barn. You may let me know what paint is required to protect the buildings already erected. I regret that the Department cannot authorize the purchase of a canoe. I am returning the list of materials for the other outbuildings. These should be kept in your office, and, when you are forwarding recommendations for future expenditure, you will be in a position to quote just what is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I hear that the department does not intend to put it up now; but, you know, it is needed very soon. Next month, we are going to ship all the outfit for the year, because the rate of the freight will nearly double after the 1st of August on the boat. And just now there is no place at all to store it as the existing small whare house is occupied as poultry house.\n\nSo I wish you will wire at once to the Department to recommend the construction of the whare house at once. It cannot wait so much after all. I hope you will find the opportunity of this demand and you will wire accordingly.\n\nI will be back only at the end of July.\n\nBest regards to you & remain\n\nYours truly,\n+ O.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have the honor to inform the Department that His Lordship Bishop Charlesbois has asked me to write to the Department regards a warehouse for keeping supplies that are being purchased for the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department recently informed me that they had no funds for this purpose, and I informed the Rev. Principal of the school of this fact, however, Bishop Charlesbois says that this matter is urgent and asks that the matter be reconsidered. The building is necessary, and it could be put up as a shell and finished later on if so desired.\n\nThe matter of a boat for the same school has not been settled, but Rev. Fr. Martin Lajeunesse, who is the secretary here for His Lordship Bishop Charlesbois, informs me that a 24 foot boat with six horse power engine is required, it will cost $552.00 built here by the Pas Canoe Co. He asks that this boat be authorised, also a skiff costing $42.75 for use in the fishing operations at the school. I beg to recommend that this matter be considered, and as I will be away on treaty trip again on Monday, for probably 16 days this time, would be obliged if the Department would advise Rev. Fr. Lajeunesse by wire if the warehouse, boat and skiff are allowed, and if he can get them built by Pas Canoe Co if allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSend the following Day Letter, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nOttawa, June 18, 1927.\n\nRev.

You should make best possible arrangements. You may also accept offer of Pas Canoe Company to construct 24 foot power boat for $552.\"\n\nIf you propose to erect the warehouse by day labour, you should buy the materials, after getting the best possible price, send in labourers and have time sheets kept, in duplicate, showing the hours the men worked and the receipts for their wages. The Pas Canoe Company's offer of June 11th to supply one power boat, 24 ft. long, 4 ft. 6 in. beam, V bottom, with 6 H. P.

Estimated quantities of material were gotten out at first for a building complete except for the drop siding and shingles. The shiplap on the outside was to be covered over with tar paper and held with lath and the same on roof. As the stock was on the ground the Bishop wanted the work done at once and would prefer a completed job which was given except for the outside painting, he was afraid that a temporary building would not be suitable. The size of the building was approved by the Bishop and the site was chosen by him. The floor of the barn is well laid with bush timbers well hewn which makes a solid floor.

The depth of the 4\" pipe where it enters the well is 14' 6\" below grade line and 9' where connected to the pipe at the point 700 feet from the building.\n\nThe well is down 30 feet from the roof to the floor of the well. The Contractor's bill includes the construction of the whole well and all material and expense. It also includes the lumber used in cribbing the well and the lumber used in cribbing the 65 feet of ditch to the river.\nAfter a depth of 14 feet was reached we had to drill through rock and quicksand all the way down and at 7' 6\" below the water level we came upon solid rock. It was slow work excavating from 14 feet below the grade line to the bottom of the well we had to dynamite every foot of the way and put in tight cribbing owing to the quick sand. The contractor deducted the amount he figured on in the contract.\n\nThe account for laying the 65 feet of 8\" pipe does not include the cost of supplying the pipe which was charged for in another bill. The formation in the ditch below the river was the same as the well. It had to be cribbed tight all the way owing to the water and quick sand. Pumps were in use all the time we were working.\n\nThe account for laying the 32 feet of pipe to the river and work on the cofferdam I may say that the Contractor had great difficulty in getting the cofferdam tight in the river owing to the rock bottom the water coming in through the bottom where they were excavating.\n\nWith regard to the lay out of the work I have forwarded plan to the Dominion Water Supply Department, Winnipeg, for them to alter their plans to show the work as it was laid. No doubt you will have received a copy of the corrected plans by now.\n\nBelow you will find cost of the additional work as per my estimate of September 4th.\nTo excavating trench 125 feet $284.96\nTo additional work on construction of 10 feet of well 662.00\nTo excavation for 65 feet of 8\" pipe 1661.00\nTo 125 feet of 4\" pipe and 65 feet of 5\" pipe 499.71\nTo diverting stream 500000\n\n$4147.67\n\nWith the above information and referring to your wire of September 3rd and my letter of September 9th you will be able to arrive at the amount which should be paid to the Contractor for this work.\n\nYou will note that the accounts do not show a charge for gasoline except for six gallons purchased from the trading store. As we had the pumps running every day there must have been a considerable quantity used up. The gasoline was supplied by the principal. It looks as if he did not put in his bill to the contractor.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We were able to supply water to the school all winter except for three weeks in December; it was very fortunate that we were able to supply the entire building with water. Otherwise it would have been bad for the sewerage and drainage system, as it was impossible for the occupants to use the outside toilets all the time. During the time we were unable to supply the house, water had to be carried from the river.\n\nI appreciate the assistance that I received from the Contractor in helping maintain the water supply during operation on water intake.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRodrick Grant\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDept.

This place requires:\n- 20 gallons shellac stain------ $60.00\n- 16 gallons red barn paint----- $60.00\n- 2 gallons white paint-------- $11.00\n\nIt will also require\u2014a manure track and outfit, a hay fork and track, tubs for drinking water for horses etc and the doors require changing.\n\nWill you please advise me if any of this is to be allowed.\n\nRe my letter #5858-153 of the 7th ultimo in which I stated that the Principal wanted plans of carpenter shop, hen house and root cellar I have to say that the root cellar is dug and no plans are needed, the material has been allowed.\n\nThe material and freight for the hen house would amount to about $900.00, and the labor to another $250.00 or so if the plan the Principal had in mind was carried out, but I think he will cut down on this, he was here on Saturday and told me he will send some drawings he has regards this place. He requires a hen house before fall.\n\nThe material and freight for the carpenter shop and blacksmith shop will come to about $1200.00. Labor would be $400.00 extra.\n\nThe Principal asks for funds or authority to construct a house for one of the staff and the material for this amounts to $425.00. This is a new item, and the Principal asks that the Department purchase the lumber. Please let me know by wire if this can be gone ahead with as he is very anxious for an answer.\n\nI enclose a list of items he wants to complete some of the rooms with, I have not had time to make copy of it, however if they are allowed will the Department please let me have the list back.

Waddy, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man., and which Mr. Roderick Grant, Inspector of Construction, on the new Indian School at Sturgeon Landing, Sask., had only approved and submitted to Mr. Waddy for his certification in the process of final settlement. The works and materials charged for on these bills were furnished by me, for the greater part before the 1st January last, and a lot of the material was purchased as long ago as September the 30th. I have previously explained how, that we had not been able to obtain any payment on these Extra's and I cannot but feel that, the cause of the delay lies in the fact, that Mr. Grant, although, a first class Building Inspector does not grade high as a Clerk, who would appreciate the responsibility of financing, for as a matter of fact the Bank costs for carrying these accounts has now run to nearly One Thousand Dollars.\n\nNow I want to state that the circumstances are such that a grave injustice has been put on me. The representative of your department has certainly been slack in rendering such fair and reasonable action as I feel should have been accorded. May I, therefore, respectfully apply for payment from your department for at least a part of the Interest we have had to pay.\n\nTrusting you will grant me your favorable consideration,\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Pas, Man., Aug. 23rd, 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose voucher No. 202, in favor of Rev. Fr. Doyon, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask., Via The Pas, Manitoba, for labor making tables and wardrobes for bedrooms of the staff at Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nI do not know just what authority the Reverend Principal had for this expenditure, but can certify that the furniture was necessary and I presume the Principal took the most economical way of having it constructed.\n\nI beg to recommend that the amount be paid if there are any funds on hand for the purpose.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state that on my official visit to the Guy Indian Residential School on August 19th, 19th and 20th, I went into matters very fully with the Principal, as he was complaining that certain things had not been completed before the Inspector of Construction left there. I will come to these later on in this letter.\n\nThe Sister Superior asked if she could be supplied with a typewriter. The Principal has a typewriter but he is located at a different end of the building to the Sister Superior and she does most of the office work, and states that it is necessary that she be supplied with one of these machines if the Department will be pleased to grant one.\n\nAt this time I wish to mention that His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, who was at the school, extends his thanks to the Department for all the favors which have been shown to him and his people while the school was being built and he said he could not express his thanks fully enough to cover all the favors he has received.\n\nStarting the examination of the building in the basement, the laundry requires doors on the clothes cupboards; it also requires an ironing board 3' x 12', to be attached so pulleys so it could be attached to the ceiling and be out of the way when not in use. The bake shop requires a thermometer on the oven, which is made by McQuaid & Roberts, and the baker asks if she could be supplied with a fiber washtub for setting the yeast before she mixes up the dough in the dough mixer. She also asks for a tin box which would hold about fifty loaves, for keeping bread fresh. The principal asked for lock checks for the outside doors, but I noticed in your letter of the 11th inst. that these are refused. In the Brothers' dining room two small cupboards are asked for to hold the dinner, etc., and a cupboard is also asked for to keep the athletic goods for the boys' play room. These could be made on the premises if material is supplied. The Principal also asks for a small door to be placed under the main stairs in the boys' part of the basement, just a V-joint affair; he also asks for a drip basin under the tap in the boys' play room. In the school rooms all the seats have not been attached.\nto strips. Two of the rooms will require four hundred linch feet $1 \\times 3$, with six gross screws nails to attach the seats in sets of four. The Principal asks about the shelves on the shelves of his library in his room; he also asks for a desk lamp for his office; shelving is required in the cupboard in the junior class room; the Sister Superior also asks for a large hand bell to use in the corridors to call the pupils and the staff; the cupboards in the clothes cutting room are not all varnished, and they require staining and hooks and eyes; the partition at the bottom of the stairs on the girls' side of the building requires to be varnished; the girls' recreation room requires a cupboard of v-joint and also requires about twenty more small individual lockers which could be used as seats and for the use of the girl pupils. The Principal asks for two sewing machines for this room, but I see by your letter of August 12th that these have been refused. The Sisters dining room also requires a cupboard for the dishes; the laundry department of the school were asking for a dryer for drying clothes; His Lordship Bishop Charlebois is asking for a steam engine and boiler in place of the gasoline engine, so he says it would be more economical to run and would give more power. If this is supplied eventually the steam could be used in the dryers. The matter of the steam engine will be taken up later on. I am getting information regards costs, etc., of same before I bring it officially to the attention of the Department. In the girls' sewing room three benches 16' long are required; in the same room the cupboards required to be varnished and the doors of the cupboards require to be stained and varnished; On the veranda used by the sisters four benches are required, with folding legs so that they can draw down alongside of the wall and be out of the way when he stands or walks around on this veranda, where they take their exercise. The cupboards in the hall, which leads to the balcony of the chapel have not been varnished and stained. This should be completed. The Principal also asks if window stripping of some sort can be supplied for the windows, to keep the draft out in the winter; on the third floor three clothes closets are required for staff rooms. These are on order in Regina since last fall and I had a letter this week saying they are being supplied. V-joint doors are required under the basins in the dormitory of the boy's room. One set of three doors and springs in the same room; small boys' dormitory ditto; small girls dormitory ditto. There is a hole leading to the roof, in the ceiling of the third floor, and the sisters store a lot of material in the space between the roof and the ceiling. In order to reach this place the Sisters ask for a ladder on hinges and free at one end, and the free end of the ladder could be attached to a pulley and pulled up out of the way when not in use.\n\nIn the boys' dormitory on the first floor there are no basins, toilets, or cupboards. It is absolutely bare except for the beds. Mr. Grant did not draw my attention to this before he left, so I presume he thought it was satisfactory. However, these pupils will require basins, toilets and cupboards.\n\nThe Secretary - 2.\nThe pipe line was extended across a valley, which was filled in with earth, and the filling is now acting as a dam to hold back the water which comes from the surrounding country. In order to allow this water to escape and to save the filling from washing into the river, it will be necessary to place a galvanized pipe or culvert to carry away the excess water. This pipe should be 36\" long and at least 18\" in diameter. If this has not supplied the whole lot of the filling put in will be washed away and the water system exposed. There also should be some back filling done on the pipe line, which was put in during the winter. This is now settled considerably and it should be filled in level with the surrounding ground. I think it would cost probably $20.00 or $25.00 to make a job of this.\n\nFrom the school grounds slopes gently towards the barn, and in between these places all the water from both places collects and during a storm it runs off very quickly. Twice this summer the water has cut a gulch between the school and the barn and has been levelled both times. In order to avoid this it will be necessary to put in 150 feet of 8 inch tile with a small catch basin where most of the water collects. This will drain the water down to the bank of the river and avoid any unsightly washouts in the future.\n\nThe Principal asks to have the hay loft lighted with electricity. This would require 75 feet of flexible conduit, a switch box, 3 outlet boxes, one blank cover, and some other attachments.\n\nThe school has shipped me in one 10\" pulley, which they want to exchange for a 16\" pulley to speed up the dough mixer. The first pulley supplied was not quite suitable. They also shipped me in an 8\" pulley for the generator, as being too large, and asked me to have it brought down to a 7\u00bd\" pulley. If I receive authority from the Department I can ship these two pulleys to Winnipeg and exchange them there. The expense for this should not be very heavy.\n\nThe Principal asks for a 40 foot extension ladder to use along the eavestroughing when it gets clogged up with snow and ice in the spring and fall. He also asks for some solder and a half gallon of muriatic acid for repairing the eavestroughing.\n\nAn extra length of 8\" pipe will be required for the water intake. It should be on hand at the school to be placed in position any time the water gets low in the river.\n\nThe Principal of the school asks if threshold strips can be placed on all the doors leading off the corridors in the school into each room. He states that the draft in the building draws all the dust and dirt from the corridors into the rooms. This was not done during construction and the Department might consider the advisability of having them put in.\n\nThe Secretary - 3.\n\nIndian Affairs.

When I was at the school I naturally walked down to the kitchen to see how the Sisters were getting on in cooking the immense pile of food necessary to feed all the Indians and white people who had been invited to the official opening, and was surprised when I got to the kitchen to find the sisters paddling around in four inches of water all over the kitchen floor and then told me that there had been water standing in the kitchen at times during the last summer; that every time it rained the water came in under the floor and along the outside wall. It appears to me that Wyatt or Wyatt's men slipped some considerably big stones into the cement at this point and the wall and floor just here are not water proof. There is only one way to get away from this trouble and it had to be done at once, so I told the Principal to put some men at work and build an apron of cement, similar to a sidewalk, about six inches tall along the face of the kitchen and in the small entry just where the first part of the school joins on to the main building. This will keep the water from running down along the walls, and I trust will be satisfactory. This expenditure was absolutely necessary and I trust will be approved by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAest.

The Department cannot agree to a hinged ladder for use in connection with storing goods in the attic, as the construction does not allow this space to be used for storing purposes. I regret that there are no funds available for the purchase of a drier. A desk lamp and doors for the Principal's library cannot be allowed. No basins can be supplied in the boys' dormitories on the first floor; but you may arrange for the installation of one toilet. I regret the Department cannot agree to electric light in the hayloft of the barn. I wish to point out that solder and muriatic acid should be purchased from the per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nYou may have the Rev. Principal make a definite proposal in connection with window stripping and threshold strips. An estimate of the cost should accompany the proposal. You may arrange for a small quantity of varnish and stain for the decorating mentioned in your letter - the school management to be responsible for the labour.

On account of the lateness of the season I thought it wise to let the job of clearing the river so as to divert more water to the intake supply. As the water was so cold at that time of year it was pretty hard to get men to work in it and as Mr. Hagen had some of his fellow countrymen who, he had in his employee, he was willing to take the job. The amount to clear was a width of about 25' and 100' long, and the estimated amount of rock to be removed was 100 yards. This had to be taken out of at least two feet of water.

Mr. Wyatt asked me at the time if it was alright for him to get Mr. Hagen to do the work on contract. I told him that it was perfectly alright providing the work did not cost more than $500.00. The channel was cleared of the rock and loose boulders sufficiently to divert the stream and have a stronger current at the point of intake as specified.\n\nI remember Mr. Hagen complained about the work being so difficult to undertake at that time of the year.

Hagen for the diversion of the stream, and dated Oct. 1 - 15th, 1926, and to request that you furnish me with a report as to the amount and character of the work which has been carried out in connection with this special contract.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. India Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter September 14th., re $500.00 account paid to E. Hagen. On account of the lateness of the season I thought it wise to let the job of clearing the river so as to divert more water to the intake supply. As the water was so cold at that time of year it was pretty hard to get men to work in it and as Mr. Hagen had some of his fellow countrymen who, he had in his employee, he was willing to take the job. The amount to clear was a width of about 25' and 100' long, and the estimated amount of rock to be removed was 100 yards. This had to be taken out of at least two feet of water. I estimated 100 yards at $6.00 per yard and think you will agree the price was reasonable, in fact Mr. Hagen did not any more than make wages. In my action Mr. Roderick Grant your Inspector concurred.\n\nTrusting this information will be what you require,\n\nI am\n\nYours truly,\nJ. W.

Mr. Wyatt asked me at the time if it was all right for him to get Mr. Hagen to do the work on contract. I told him that it was perfectly all right providing the work did not cost more than $500.00. The channel was cleared of trees and rocks located sufficiently to divert the stream and have a stronger current at the point of intake as specified.\n\nI remember Mr. Hagen complained about the work being so difficult to undertake at that time of the year. I knew that he gave full value in his work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt Philips Indian Residential School\nKeeseekeese Indian Reserve,\nSt Philips Sask. Sept 23rd 1927\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nYour letter of Sept 21st asking for information re: Hagen account for $500.00. Enclosed you will find a copy of my reply to Ottawa regarding same.\n\nThe work was done by Hagen subcontracted for from Wyatt. The work was done to the value received.\n\nTrusting this information will be satisfactory, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction\n\nJ.W.

This business appears to me to have been fully and satisfactorily explained and therefore I am at a loss to understand why the balance of my account remains unpaid. Certainly I feel some explanation is due me.\n\nThen there is my letter of August 15th addressed to Mr. Scott to which, apparently, there has been no reply. May I ask if you will kindly inquire of Mr. Scott if he received that letter. All officers in the department are doubtless jointly interested in these matters, that is why I feel at liberty to ask any officer to kindly get the information, such as I am now applying for.\n\nThe fact is that I feel considerably aggrieved with the delay or lack of interest shown in settling up my Contract and Extra's in connection with Guy Indian School, and I would hope within a few days to receive some explanation for the delay and a definite statement when the money due will be paid.\n\nThe department surely realizes that every day is a cost to me in carrying these accounts.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The cost in this connection, viz.: $438.70, suggests that somewhat elaborate provision has been made. The Department originally expected the school management to be responsible for the labour costs and I have to request that, at your convenience, you will see the Reverend Principal re the matter and let me have a definite recommendation. You should report just what type of root house has been prepared.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Mr Waddy:\n\nRe- Root-Cellar\n\nI am enclosing herewith the Return os Labour for the Root-Cellar. I am surprised myself seeing how much it costed to have that root-cellar completed, but I am presenting to you the real amount of money I did spent for that work.\n\nOn the starting, laborers had to dig for a few days, though the digging had been done last Fall. Then the work on the walls and the roofing. After the cement walls done, we had that heavy rain for a week; As there was no drain in the root cellar, the walls cracked and bent. We had to put a wall of logs around the inside cement walls and then to put the roof. This took lot a time and lot a money. However the root cellar will be very good.\n\nI didn't take any saw-dust, because when the Toben came here I asked Harmenn, the captain if there was any saw-dust across the river, and he told me that there was none. So it was too late to wait.\n\nI have about 75 bags cement left\n\nI am sending you the cost for the gravel hauled. I paid the that amount Cash. There is some more gravel left also\n\nWill it be possible for a dentist to come here before freeze up. So many teeth to be fixed.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nOctober 31st 1927.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of letter #132-7-5 of the 24th inst regards voucher 190 for root house at the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nA lot of the expense was in connection with digging out dirt that had fallen into the excavation since it was dug out in 1926. Bad weather at time it was being built also added to the cost. The enclosed letter from the Principal explains the situation.\n\nThe root house is straight cement walls with lumber roof, filled in on top with earth.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Carroll, The Pas, Manitoba, for distilled water supplied to the Guy Indian Residential School, for renewing the batteries of the electric light plant. Some time ago the Principal asked the Department for a distillery for making this water at the school and the request was refused. The Principal asked me then to order the water and if the Department refused to pay for the same he will assume the charges. However, he states he thinks the Department should pay for the distilled water. The express charges were necessary on this shipment, as the water was ordered so as to catch the last boat leaving The Pas. It was needed immediately.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Following instructions from Mr. Johnston to this effect the undersigned visited the school on October 27th and 28th and in company with the Principal, Reverend Father Doyen, made an investigation and inspection of the school water supply.\n\nPRESENT WATER SUPPLY.\n\nThe water supply is taken from the river some 325 feet above the school. At this point an eight-inch wrought iron intake pipe extending five feet into the river carries the water to a concrete intake well thirty feet deep located about one hundred feet from the shore. From the intake well the water is drawn through a four-inch suction pipe to the school.\n\nThe present trouble with the source of supply is due to the intake pipe only extending five feet from shore instead of from twenty to twenty-five feet, as instructed, to ensure the point of intake being in the current. Five feet from shore there is no current owing to a small point of land immediately above and the supply is therefore drawn from comparatively still water. The manure which the school authorities complain of is the remains of that used by the contractor in his efforts to seal the cofferdam and which had never been properly\nremoved. With the end of the intake only five feet from the shore and in still water it will naturally take some time for this trouble to disappear, unless steps are taken to remove the manure.\n\nThe question of the distance necessary to extend the intake into the river in order to reach the current was taken up personally with the Inspector, Mr. Grant, in July of last year when the writer visited the school for this purpose. At that time the matter was fully gone into and instructions were given that the intake pipe was to be carried at least twenty feet out from the shore in order that the point of intake would be in running water.\n\nIn Mr. Grant's letter dated August 31, 1927, to Mr. Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas, copy of which is enclosed, he stated that owing to the difficulty of sealing the cofferdam at the water end of the intake the contractor could not make the necessary rock excavations for the last 22 feet of trench, with the result that, as shown on the accompanying plan, this length of pipe was not laid to the proper grade, but has a gradual rise from the eight-inch valve to the end of the pipe in the water. Mr. Grant points out that with the water end of the pipe gradually rising, the further the pipe was extended the nearer it would come to the surface, and as no bends or fittings were available he decided to carry the pipe only a short distance from the shore. In his letter to Mr. Waddy Mr. Grant recommends that the pipe be extended some four or six feet and by using a sixteenth bend correct the upward slope of the present intake.\nremoved. With the end of the intake only five feet from the shore and in still water it will naturally take some time for this trouble to disappear, unless steps are taken to remove the manure.\n\nThe question of the distance necessary to extend the intake into the river in order to reach the current was taken up personally with the Inspector, Mr. Grant, in July of last year when the writer visited the school for this purpose. At that time the matter was fully gone into and instructions were given that the intake pipe was to be carried at least twenty feet out from the shore in order that the point of intake would be in running water.\n\nIn Mr. Grant's letter dated August 31, 1927, to Mr. Waddy, Indian Agent at The Pas, copy of which is enclosed, he stated that owing to the difficulty of sealing the cofferdam at the water end of the intake the contractor could not make the necessary rock excavations for the last 22 feet of trench, with the result that, as shown on the accompanying plan, this length of pipe was not laid to the proper grade, but has a gradual rise from the eight-inch valve to the end of the pipe in the water. Mr. Grant points out that with the water end of the pipe gradually rising, the further the pipe was extended the nearer it would come to the surface, and as no bends or fittings were available he decided to carry the pipe only a short distance from the shore. In his letter to Mr. Waddy Mr. Grant recommends that the pipe be extended some four or six feet and by using a sixteenth bend correct the upward slope of the present intake.\nCOMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS.\n\nIt should be pointed out that with this intake length of pipe not laid to the proper grade the danger from frost at the water end of the intake has been largely increased, and though it may not now, under the circumstances, be necessary to re-lay this section to the proper grade extra precautions will have to be taken each fall to protect this section of the intake from freezing. To provide a proper intake it will be advisable to have the present pipe extended some fifteen or twenty feet further into the river where, as shown on the plan, the end of the pipe will be in six feet of water at the present stage of the river and well out into the current. It will be noted that Mr. Grant fears that by extending the present pipe further than four to six feet out there will be danger of the outer end being broken by ice or other debris. If the pipe is properly covered with earth, brush and rock, however, no trouble from this cause need be feared. This covering will also provide a measure of protection from freezing, though an additional covering of brush and snow should be placed over the intake each fall.\n\nIn extending the pipe one of the following methods may be used in order that the extension will properly follow the bed of the river. (a). Putting on a ninety degree bend on the end of the present intake and with a short nipple connecting it to another ninety degree bend. By this means a flexible joint is secured and the necessary added extension of the intake can be raised or lowered as desired. (b). Flexibility can also be obtained by placing a flexible joint at the end of the present intake and the extra length of pipe can then be lowered to conform with\nthe bed of the river. As the ninety degree bends are cheaper than a flexible joint and more easily obtained the first method is probably preferable.\n\nIn taking up the question with Father Doyen it was agreed that owing to the lateness of the season it would be inadvisable to extend the intake during the winter, but as soon as possible next year after the high water had passed this work should be done. With reference to the contamination of the water caused from the remains of the manure left in the cofferdam, it was pointed out to Father Doyen that this must be fairly well diluted by now and with the forming of the ice this source of trouble should be considerably reduced. No sickness has been traced to the water supply but it was further pointed out to both Father Doyen and Mr. Waddy that it would be advisable to have an analysis of the water made and if from this analysis it was found that contamination existed then chlorine in some form should be used in the water supply until the intake is extended.\n\nIt may be stated with reference to this installation that this office was not requested to supervise the construction but only to submit a report and plans covering the installation. In July 1926, owing to the change in the location of the school, there appeared a discrepancy in the length of the suction main and the point of intake. Mr. Grant wrote to this office with reference to this matter and the undersigned immediately visited the school and discussed with Mr. Grant the location of the intake and the necessity of extending the intake pipe into the current and deep water. This was not done and the manure was not removed which is the cause of the present trouble.\nAnother point raised both by Mr. Waddy and Father Doyen was the slipping of earth on the river bank along the line of the suction main. This sliding as shown in the accompanying photographs occurs a short distance south of the intake well and is taking place along a stretch about two hundred feet long. Though not agreeing with Father Doyen, who states that the whole river bank is slipping, the sliding which has occurred so far is quite serious in that any further extensive slip will endanger the suction main. The usual method adopted to overcome trouble of this nature would be to drive a line of piling, but as rock is likely near the surface a sufficient depth to make the piling secure could probably not be obtained. Another method would be by placing a stretch of rock-filled cribs on the river bank below which would provide a toe for the slipping to come to rest. Either of these methods would be costly and probably the cheapest and most satisfactory scheme is to closely watch the slipping and if there is danger of the pipe being broken to have this stretch relaid sufficiently far back to be out of the way of any trouble from this cause.\n\nJohn Craig\nSt. Phillips Indian Residential School,\nKeesekoose, August 31st, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nYour letter of Aug. 25th to hand yesterday with reference to the water intake and the senior boys dormitory first floor (not Junior boys as per your letter), Guy Indian School.\n\nTell Father Doyen that it would not be to any advantage to extend the present pipe further in the river without first putting the present pipe down deeper, I will explain to you the reason that the inflow pipe is not down deeper in the water.\n\nThe inflow pipe coming from the well is down 5'6\" below the lowest water level, this level was maintained for a distance of 65' of extra pipe 3\" in dia., this pipe was laid at this depth for another two lengths 5' each. Owing to the rock formation in the river the last 22' of pipe had to be raised higher in the river. The contractor could not get the cofferdam tight to excavate the rock with dynamite as the water came thru the rock at the bottom and the pumps he had was not able to keep the water low enough to do the work, we could have added another length of pipe but the water would go into the river at this level the less depth of water we would have at the end of the pipe. You will see by this that to gain an advantage you would have to lower the steel pipe in the river. Supposing you put a fitting on the end of the pipe to extend it out further in the river and to have the end of the length added, deeper in the water you would be working to a better advantage as your pipe would be in deeper and nearer the stream, but it would be no benefit to protect the pipe from freezing in the winter as the supply of water is governed by the part of the pipe nearest the top of the water as it is an inflow pipe not a suction, without lowering the present pipe your best plan would be to put the fitting on, to turn the piece of pipe that you propose to add down in the deep water.\n\nI have explained the particulars to Father Doyen that the trouble will not be now, it may be in the winter from frost unless the pipe is protected, I explained to him that at the late fall of the year as the water over the pipe freezes he will have to cover over the ice for a considerable surface with a good depth of straw or some other covering for a protection, during the very cold weather the river backs up owing to the shallow water in the channels freezing over, when this happens it ensures a protection for the pipe but previous to this taking place it would be wise to protect the pipe, The river will not get low enough to affect the water supply during the spring summer and early fall, the bottom of the pipe is down approximately 4' below the lowest water level taken in Sept. 1926 when the water was very low, that would make the top of the pipe 3'6\" below the water at the low water level, you will see that if we had been able to take the pipe thru at the same level as the extra 65' there would be no danger from frost, should the misfortune happen that the pipe would freeze up on them in the river there supply would not be entirely cut off although it would be limited to a reduced quantity, Father\nDoyen knows about this, this was the source from which we were able to maintain a water supply last winter while working on the intake, as I have pointed out to you that it be better to connect one sixteenth bend with a piece of pipe 4' long or longer if it is possible with the bend turned downwards, according to the depth of water would determine the length of pipe you should use, I would suggest that you do not use more than 4' or 6' of the pipe or you will have to protect it from being hit from ice or any other debris in the water.\n\nWe will prepare a sketch and write the particulars to the Standard Plumbing Co., asking them to supply the required pipe as it is a screwed joint, you can forward the letter and sketch on to them with your requisition, if you decide to have this done.\n\nPersonally I do not think you will have the water low enough for Father Doyen to have this done this year, The reason that I am in favour of extending the pipe is to get nearer the stream and I would like to see the pipe longer than four ft., if it could be protected from all danger of being hit by something that would do damage.\n\nWith reference to the senior boys dormitory not having toilets wash basins and cubboards,\n\nKindly look thru the list of requirements that was asked for by the Principle and Sister and you will not find anything asked for this dormitory, The Sister mentioned about requirements in the way of cubboards but did not ask for any, kindly let them know this so I have all particulars of everything they asked for in the way of furnishings on file.\n\nWith further reference to this dormitory about the basins and toilets there was no mention of this during the roughing in for the plumbing fixtures, you are aware that we installed hot and cold water basin in the principles room and cold water in the Indians room immediately under this dormitory, that was the time to speak to me about this when we were on the plumbing work, you will understand when we put the extra sinks in the drugroom and drain in the cellar, the toilet in the senior boys dormitory all this was bought in with less expense when done at the proper time, had this been pointed out to me at the proper time I would have taken the matter up.\n\nThis dormitory is for the senior boys and I do not see why there should be a run on the toilets during the night that they would require extra toilets, then there is baths and plenty of wash hand basins to spare in the basement, it would be easy to put in a wash basin and connection could be made from the principle room, to install a toilet it would be very expensive compared to having it done at the proper time, The department was not approached for any work to be done in this dormitory, in fact the dept, did not authorize any of the extra work put in by the plumber that I have mentioned, I had this done myself as I could see that theseveral items were necessary and by having them done at the proper time it saved money, I am very much disappointed if the principle and Sister superior say they asked for this additional work to be done in this dormitory if they say so they are wrong, they received all it was possible for me to get for them,\n\nwith kind regards,\n\n(Signed) Rod Grant.\n\nJ.

The difficulty being due to the fact that the work was not carried out according to the plan prepared by our District Chief Engineer.\n\nMr. Attwood recommends that nothing be done until next summer. The principal of the school is in agreement with this, and I beg to recommend accordingly that the work be deferred until conditions are suitable for carrying it out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He also asks for one dozen bushings, size from \u00bd to 1\u00bc\" for use in the engine room.\n\nThe Fairbanks Morse pump requires two valves 1\u215b x 2\u215b\", 5/16 stem, and one piston rod. The piston rod broke and has been temporarily repaired by the blacksmith; it should be replaced.\n\nThe arch in the oven fell in on the day of my visit to the school, through some fault in the construction, but the blacksmith states he can rebuild the arch if supplied with brick. He asks for fifty fire brick, one hundred clay brick, two sax fire clay and two sax lime.\n\nHe also wants rings for the engine which operates the electric light plant.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc. 1.\nOttawa, December 16th, 1927.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your 6207/153 of the 6th instant, with reference to conditions at the Guy Indian Residential School. You may purchase 30 feet of 1\u00bd\" hose pipe for use in the engine room, with a 1\u00bd\" iron \"T\", and one dozen bushings, \u00bd\" to 1\u00bd\". You may purchase two valves and a piston rod for the Fairbanks Morse pump and rings for the engine which operates the electric light plant.\n\nYou may secure fifty fire brick and one hundred clay brick, with the necessary fire clay and lime to repair the arch in the oven.

I do not like recommending anything further at this time of year, and we have the school pretty well supplied already, but they have a first class mechanic at the school and if he saved only one trip of a plumber from town here he will repay this account over and over, so under the circumstances it appears that the request should be granted.\n\nHe also asked me to supply $25.00 of stain, oil, hinges, hooks & eyes etc for completing cupboards. I have sent in so many final requisitions for these cupboards that I will recommend no more, I was handed what I was told the final one last August and sent it to the Department as such. However, if it is considered that this material should be supplied I know it will not be wasted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Please forward an itemized account, in duplicate, properly certified covering the cost. The articles for the water system are to be kept in stock at the school for use in case of a breakdown. Any further replacements will have to be made by the school authorities from their per capita earnings or other receipts.

INDIAN AGENT WADDY,\nfor the month of March, 1928, on the Guy\nIndian Residential School.\n\nOriginal on File 132-7-7.\n\nThe galvanized smoke stack from the boiler to\nthe chimney had not been cleaned and was full of soot,\na fire risk. There was not way to get into it so I am\nsending up a sheet of galvanized iron with flanges and\nafter it arrives the blacksmith will cut out a hole in\nthe smoke pipe, clean out the soot, and then place the\ngalvanized sheet around the pipe with the flanges to\nattach same so it can be got at when required.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThe fire escapes are in good shape, but the\nSisters carry the keys to the doors on same. In case\nthey are away if a fire comes the pupils have no chance\nto escape. Would it be possible to supply them with\nfour boxes containing an axe such as we see on trains,\nthen the youngsters have a fighting chance to batter\ndown the doors in case of necessity. These boxes could\nbe placed near the escape doors.\nOttawa, April 5th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to your report for the month of March, last, on the Guy Indian Residential School, it is noted, with reference to the galvanized smoke stack from the boiler to the chimney, that you are having same cleaned and that you are arranging with the blacksmith at the school to carry out the necessary arrangements to make this smoke stack easy of access for cleaning purposes in future.\n\nRelative to the fire escapes, it is noted that the Sisters carry the keys to the doors leading to these escapes. It is considered that some arrangement should be made by the staff to see that the keys are readily accessible in case of fire, so that there would be no delay in reaching the fire escapes.\n\nThe Department approves of your suggestion that 4 boxes, with glass fronts, each containing an axe, be installed near the doors, and you may arrange for the purchase and installation of this equipment. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and when the boxes have been installed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Satisfactory explanation was furnished by Mr. Wyatt and subsequently certificate No. 9 was issued on the 28th October 1927 for the sum of $500.00, which would appear to complete payment in full of Mr. Wyatt's claim. There is an item however inserted in Certificate No. 9 which seems to complicate the matter, and I am inclined to think that this was only inserted by way of explanation for the $500.00 in question. This item reads as follows: \"Extra work $500.00 (rock excavation for clearing of channel to divert additional water towards intake water supply system, 100 c.yds. at $5.00 a yard)\" and this amount was added to the sum of $111,297.57, thus showing the total amount of Mr. Wyatt's claim to be $111,797.57. I cannot find on the file any correspondence showing that work on this channel to the amount of $500.00 was made twice.

I have looked into them myself, and I am satisfied that the $500.00, which I presume was the \"extra\" for clearing the boulders out of the stream, has been paid. It appears in a list of extras amounting to over $19,000.00 which were allowed. We have no trace whatever of an inspector's certificate for $288.43; perhaps you may be able to give us a copy of this certificate. As for the interest charges, we refused them because claims of that nature are never allowed and, as a matter of fact, I did not bring the matter to the attention of the Minister at all. Now that you have brought it to his notice I shall be very pleased to discuss it with him when we are at headquarters again and give him a full statement of your arguments in support of the claim. If you have anything to add to what we have on file I should be glad to receive it. On the other two items I hope you will, if necessary, correspond with the Acting Deputy who may be able to deal with them before I return.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. H. Wyatt, Esq.,\n501 Lombard Building,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJuly 10th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Stewart,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter from Winnipeg of July 6th and your telegram of July 7th. I have arranged to stop over at Kenora and see the proposed site for the new Residential School and have wired the Mayor to expect me.\n\nI have looked into Mr. R.M. Wyatt's claim and am enclosing a copy of a letter I have sent him. When I received your wire I telegraphed him for a full statement of his claim and you will see that my reply deals pretty fully with the questions. His claim for interest was based on the assertion that our Inspector delayed unreasonably forwarding certificates and, therefore, the contractor was compelled to pay larger interest to the bank than should have been necessary. I do not think a claim of this nature has ever been allowed but I have promised to bring the matter to your attention and discuss it fully.\n\nMr. Brown's claim is based on the alleged fact that he received misinformation from some source that misled him as to the distance of the site of the school from the railway etc., etc. His specification states that he must visit the site and make all investigation for himself. I think you will remember that Brown has not a very high standing so far as this Department is concerned. We will of course be fair and reasonable with him but we cannot recognize a claim which is on such a flimsy basis.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHon.

B. Patterson.\nREPORT ON\n\nEXTENSION OF INTAKE PIPE\n\nOF\n\nGUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nSTURGEON LANDING, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nWinnipeg, Manitoba,\nJuly 4th, 1928.\n\nH. B. Patterson.\nINTRODUCTORY.\n\nFollowing the submittal of a report, dated November, 1927, on the water supply of the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan, by Mr. John Craig, of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation Service, it was decided to extend the intake pipe twenty feet as was first proposed. It was also decided that the work should be supervised by an engineer from the Winnipeg District Office. Under instructions dated June 16th from Mr. C. H. Attwood, the undersigned was given charge of the laying of this extension to the intake pipe. Three men were engaged for the work which was completed in five days.\n\nIn addition to the extension of the intake pipe the instructions covered the following matters:\n\n1 - Examination of intake well.\n2 - Examination of bank slide along suction pipe.\n3 - Condition of sewerage system.\n4 - Examination of water pipe from school to barn.\n\nA general plan of the Guy Indian Residential School showing the extension of the intake pipe, together with photographs are appended.\n\nEXTENSION OF INTAKE PIPE.\n\nSince the existing intake pipe from the eight-inch valve to the outer end was not laid to grade but slopes upward, the extension of the pipe involved a change of direction downward following the bed of the river. A flexible joint at the end of the existing intake would have been the best method of making the connection but one of the required size was not readily available. The method\nadopted was to make, in effect, a flexible joint out of two ninety degree elbows connected by a short nipple.\n\nThe laying of the pipe comprised the following operations:\n\n1 - Unwatering existing Intake.\n\nA cofferdam extending ten feet out from the shore and enclosing the existing intake was constructed. Difficulty was experienced in pumping out the water on account of water \"boiling\" up through the mud bottom from crevasses in the rock below.\n\n2 - Connecting Extension.\n\nAs soon as the water was lowered sufficiently, the intake screen was removed and a ninety degree elbow screwed on. A short nipple was screwed into the elbow and the second elbow connected to it. Twenty feet of 6-inch steel-pipe, in three sections, were connected to the elbow, and after cleaning, the intake screen was connected on.\n\n3 - Lowering Pipe.\n\nAfter demolishing the cofferdam the new pipe was propped into an upright position and lowered, by means of a rope over a tripod, into place. The pipe was worked down into a mud bar in the bed of the river but it extends beyond the mud bottom into the current where the river bed is composed of limestone. The end of the pipe, i.e., the intake screen, is held up one and a half feet above the bed of the river by the above mentioned bar.\n\nADDITIONAL MATTERS.\n\n1 - Examination of Intake Well.\n\nDuring the construction of the concrete intake well two short lengths of pipe were placed through the wall to drain ground water away from the unset concrete mix. It\nwas stated that these ground waters were contaminated by manure placed around the outside of the well. The water was tasted but no taste of manure was found. Father Doyen, the principal of the school, was most emphatic that no manure had been placed around the well. The pipes were then plugged with tamarack wood.\n\n2 - Bank Slide along Suction Pipe.\n\nDuring the construction of the intake a small gully, which crosses the suction pipe, was filled in to make a road. The consequent damming of water at this point was probably the principal cause of the slide for since the placing of a culvert at this place last year no sliding has occurred. Photographs showing the present conditions are appended.\n\n3 - Condition of Sewerage System.\n\nThe principal of the school was interviewed regarding the condition of the sewerage system, the cess pools and the outlet examined. Everything was found to be in good working order. A photograph of the outlet is appended.\n\n4 - Water Pipe from School to Barn.\n\nThe water pipe which supplies the barn with water is out of commission on account of being frozen last winter. This line is a three-quarter-inch galvanized iron pipe which was laid five feet below the ground surface. The ground through which the pipe runs is a hard-packed sandy soil being part of the boys' playground. It was suggested to the principal that the pipe should be laid nine feet below the surface, boxed and insulated.\nCONCLUSIONS.\n\nThe intake well and tank were cleaned out and, after a thorough flushing, the water was found to be clear and palatable.\n\nIt is noted that since the section of the intake pipe from the eight-inch valve to the double elbow joint was not laid to grade, extra precautions will have to be taken each fall to protect this section from freezing. The principal of the school was advised of this condition.\n\nE. B.

Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nAs there is no more mosquitos......in the country, I have a good chance to obtain what I am aiming at; not an automobile, but something necessary for our school.\n\nThe carpenters are on the job since one month. The hen house is quasi completed; the carpenter shop is not so much advanced. The cement foundation and the frame-work are done. The work is very good though slow, I imagine. However I think that you will be satisfied, as I am until now.\n\nI am going to ask you today if it will be possible to have pretty near half of the second floor well finished so that we could make a sheemaker room. This will be the only place we can find for. Mr Rush told me that he can make that room very comfortable for wintertime. Also would you allow us with having electricity in carpenter shop?\n\nFew days ago I ordered at The Pas some lumber for ordinary use around the school; and I see that I will be obliged to order some more: 40 2x4x14; 40 2x4x14; 500' rough lumber; 300' ship-lap; 8 4x4x16 oak; 8 1x4x16 oak (to make a bench saw); 250' flooring 250 lin.ft (round for repair).\n\nCan I order the lumber necessary to double the implement shed? and have Mr Rush and Hoey to built it?\n\nCan I order one swing at Eaton's for the sisters as it will cost less than to have it made here?\n\nAbout the cement apron we were talking about on your last visit and fixing the walks in front of the building, would you agree with me if I put Mr Dush as the foreman and the Dept. will pay the three other hired man? I have 70 bags of cement left for that pur-\nGuy Indian Residential Boarding School,\nSturgeon Standing, SASK.\n\n---2---\n\npose, and enough gravel, I think. I hope this will be satisfactory to you, because you know that I have lot of other expenses to stand with, for in the fall I would like to open at least two acres of land to advance the work and continue the progress of this school. Our hay is all flooded this year; so I will be obliged to go and have hay cut at seventeen miles from here.\n\nAbout the barge, you know the necessity of having one. The Pas Canoe would charge $438.50 for one kind and $375.25 for another kind. Will it be possible for your Dept. to stand that expense?\n\nI hope, honorable Sir, that you will continue your kindness to me knowing that I am doing my very best for the prosperity of the school. With your kind support, I did very much as everybody says, and I am very willing to go farther yet. This school is yours; also I want to put my share in it, remembering what you told me: help us and we will help you. This is the hardest time for you bearing expenses of all kinds; but it would not be very long now, as I can see.\n\nHoping to hear favorably from you, I beg to remain yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 24, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, addressed to Mr. Ferrier, with reference to progress on the outbuildings at the Guy Indian Residential School. I note that you would like to finish the second storey of the carpenter shop for a shoemaker's room and that you would like to light the building by electricity. You might let me have an estimate of the cost of this special finishing and the electric wiring.\n\nYou may purchase the lumber necessary to complete the implement shed and you may have the two carpenters do the work. You may also engage three labourers who, under the direction of your Mr. Fuch, will use the 70 bags of cement which you have for the cement apron around the building and the walks in front.\n\nI regret there are no funds available for the purchase of a barge at the present time. You may order one swing for the playground from the T. Eaton Company and, when the equipment is received, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, to the Department for payment.\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the labour return which you enclosed, which covers the wages paid for the painting of the barn. A cheque in reimbursement will be directed to you.\n\nI have also your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the two carpenters who were engaged for the henhouse and carpenter shop at the school. From the time they commenced boarding themselves across the river, it will be satisfactory if you pay Charles Rush and Sam Roey $1.00 and 75\u00a2 respectively, per hour. You should put them on the labour returns, commencing August first, at the new rate. Under separate cover, there is being directed to you a supply of labour return forms.\n\nI regret that potato diggers are not supplied to Indian residential schools, but I am pleased to authorize you to purchase a lawn mower at an estimated cost of $30. A properly certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded to Ottawa for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. N.

As I am going to receive 100 chickens at the beginning of Sept., I would be grateful if you could possibly arrange everything for that purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 30th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant, in which you state that you can secure the necessary chicken wire for the henhouse at the Guy Residential School at an approximate cost of $180. In reply I beg to say that you may purchase the wire necessary and submit to the office of Mr. Agent MacKenzie a certified account, in duplicate, covering its cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Honorable Mr Ferrier agreed with all those expenses when he came and visited the school in June.\n\nWe used the saw dust for the root-cellar and the hen house. The lumber was used for ordinary needs of the school. In fact the carpenter took pretty near all for the outbuildings.\n\nMr Ferrier advised us to buy the granery.\n\nAbout the transportation of children during holidays, I made out to the Dept. in July an account for $100.00. As I did not receive any payment yet, I put the whole account today.\n\nHoping to hear from you, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find enclosed the account for the engineer house that was built last fall and painted lately. When Mr. Perrier was here I explained to him the reasons why we had that building fixed up and he agreed for payment of the expenses. About the labour, I did not want you to pay the work of Mr. Fuchs, engineer, who worked over one month on that house. I am sending only the account of those who help him. I hope you will be satisfied and will be glad to pay me back those expenses.\n\nYours obligingly,\n\nRev. Napoleon Doyon, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 28, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWhen I was at the Guy Indian Residential School this summer, the Rev. Principal asked if the Department would reimburse him for expenditure in connection with a house for the school engineer. This building was erected in the fall of last year. I advised that he forward his receipts to the Department for our consideration.\n\nReceipts are now to hand, showing the following expenditure:\n\n| Item     | Amount   |\n|----------|----------|\n| Lumber   | $645.80  |\n| Hardware | 20.00    |\n| Paint    | 23.50    |\n| Freight  | 96.87    |\n| Labour   | 101.57   |\n| **Total**| **$787.74** |\n\nFunds can be found to assist with this expenditure, and I wish to recommend that the Department reimburse the Principal for the cost of the materials used\u2014a total of $689.30. The Principal would then be responsible for the freight and the labour, amounting to approximately $200.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSup't. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, September 29th, 1928.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant enclosing receipts showing the expenditure in connection with the engineer's house at the Guy Indian Residential School. I am pleased to inform you that the Department has decided to reimburse you for the materials used and a cheque for $569.30 is being directed to you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He also asks for oak to amount of about $40.00 for making swings for the children and to make a bench for the wood saw.\n\nHe also asks for a visit by a dentist to attend to the children, many of whom require the service of a dentist.\n\nHe also requests that a toilet and basins be placed in the boys dormitory on the first floor, plan of same is enclosed. This matter was taken up with the Department before, but we could not see where these repairs could be put in without tearing up too much of the building. The mechanic at the school has figured out how this can be done and I have got an estimate from a plumber of $200.00 for the material and work as per list given me by the Principal, this should cover the work, but repairing torn out part of the building will add to the cost. However, the boys in this room should have basins and toilet and I beg to recommend that these be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 5, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 57-153 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to requests of the Rev. Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School. You may order $140 worth of lumber for the general repairs, for making swings and for benches. You may also arrange for the installation of a toilet and wash basins in the boys' dormitory on the first floor, at an estimated cost of $200. The school should be responsible for repairing the carpenter work after the equipment has been put in position. I am returning the plan which you forwarded with your letter. When the work has been satisfactorily completed, you should forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W.

The septic tank, which is close to the river, was exposed this year by the running water, and at the time of my inspection, the Rev. Principal was having a stone wall erected some 10 ft. away from the tank and intended to fill this in with dirt so as to protect it.\n\nThe school is provided with a staff of 10 Sisters, 2 Brothers and one mechanic, besides the Principal. Excellent work is being done and I believe the children receive the best of care. \n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI beg to submit the following report on the schools of The Pas Agency, which were inspected between September 8th and September 24th, 1928.\n\n**GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.**\n\nThe school is situated close to the river at Sturgeon Landing, which is a trip up the Saskatchewan of about 24 hours by steamboat from the town of The Pas. The building was erected some two years ago, and is under the supervision of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe school building is a very fine structure and modern in every respect. The dormitories are large and bright and were well ventilated. There are three classrooms, which were bright and well furnished. The sewing room, laundry, dining room and playrooms are all bright and airy, and the building throughout was spotlessly clean.\n\nThe children enrolled number 108, there being 44 girls and 64 boys. The children were all clean and tidy and appeared quite healthy. The Rev. Father Doyon informed me that during last winter he had a great deal of sickness at the school, but at the present time the children were in good condition. Some children, I understand, have been discharged; the Doctor considered these unfit to stand school life.\n\nThe three classrooms were visited and I was delighted with the work. The children spoke out well.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nGUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nwell and appeared to understand their studies. The windows were not open in some of the rooms and I took the opportunity to point out the necessity of keeping plenty of fresh air provided, even in the cold weather.\n\nThe school is well supplied with fire equipment, all of which is in good condition. I would, however, point out that the low platform of each fire escape is about 8 ft. from the ground and the children must jump off this on to the ground. This would be very dangerous in case of a fire as the children would no doubt be shoved off by those coming behind and would pile up on the ground beneath the fire escape. An extension reaching to the ground should be provided and this could be hinged on to the platform and raised when not in use.\n\nThe barn is situated about 200 ft. south of the school and is in good repair. The chicken house is new and is well built. A machine shed and workshop was under construction and no doubt would be completed within a few days.\n\nThe root cellar is built about 100 ft. north of the school. The walls are cement and the roof is covered with poles and dirt, over which is a board roof, covered with roofing paper. Apparently the cellar gives satisfaction as there still remained a few old potatoes and these were quite good.\n\nThe school garden consists of about five acres, largely potatoes, although practically all other vegetables were to be found. The garden was well kept.\nkept and the vegetables showed excellent growth. No frost had occurred at the time of my inspection.\n\nFive cows are kept at the school, but they were in poor condition and, in fact, appeared to be a poor dairy type. Hay is hard to get as the country is all bush and swamp. The Principal claimed he had 60 loads, but in order to get it he was obliged to go a distance of nearly 20 miles. It is impossible for the five cows to provide milk sufficient for 108 children, as well as a staff of 12 or 14. If more cows cannot be kept, the milk supply could be supplemented by powdered milk. I believe milk added to the children's diet would be of great benefit.\n\nFish are caught and stored for winter use and, in addition, the children sometimes get moose and beef.\n\nIn the summer it is practically impossible to keep meat as there is no ice house. Here, where food must be secured in quantity, an ice house is badly needed.\n\nThe Rev. Father pointed out that many of these children come to school a distance of from one to five hundred miles, and when the parents come, as they sometimes do in the winter, there is no building in which they can be accommodated. A small house consisting of two rooms would be ample and would not entail a large expenditure.\n\nI would also point out that the river bank in front of the school is washing away and before long...\na building could be put up at little expense. I should think the school would be glad to do this for their own satisfaction, but a small grant might be made. A log house would be much better than a frame building and $200.00 should supply this if the school would render some assistance.\n\nSigned\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to forward herewith a report on the various schools in The Pas Agency, which were visited by Mr. Inspector Hamilton during the month of September.\n\nIn connection with the Guy Indian Residential School I note what the Inspector says regarding the height of the fire escapes from the ground. This, no doubt, is in accordance with the Department's regulations. I would particularly draw your attention to what the Inspector says regarding the type of cows that are kept at this school, and also the small number that are kept. This, to my mind, is a very important matter. Indians are subject to tuberculosis and unless they get proper and nourishing food, milk in particular, they will fail. As a matter of fact, under the best of conditions they cannot stand confinement as well as White children, so the Department should insist on the proper number of cows being kept at this School. Of course, if there is no way of producing feed for these cows it is another matter, but I have no doubt there is a means of supplying the necessary feed or the Department would never have built a school at this point. These children will be undernourished unless they get milk, especially where fish forms a large part of the diet. You will note the Inspector points out that they have no means of providing storage for meat in the summertime. I do not know that there would be much meat kept there if there are no animals around the place, and if the meat comes in in small quantities in the summer months an ordinary ice house built of logs would meet the requirements. I would also draw your attention to the Inspector's remarks regarding accommodation for Indians visiting the school. This is a small matter. There are all kinds of logs close to the school and\u2014a building\u2014\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your 205-11 of the 7th instant, enclosing Mr. Inspector Hamilton's report on the schools in The Pas agency. Arrangements are being made to supplement the milk herd at the Guy Indian Residential School. An item will be placed in the Estimates for an ice house.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, November 15, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nIt is represented that a house for visiting Indians is needed at the Guy Indian Residential School. The Department considers that a log building would be suitable for this purpose, and I have to ask you to suggest to the Rev. Principal that he get out the logs, erect the building and then requisition to the Department for the necessary finishing lumber and hardware.\n\nThe need of an ice house at this school is known to the Department, and an item is being placed in our Estimates for submission to Parliament. Please inform the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. M.

This hay could be hauled part in the fall and in winter time. Will this solution be satisfactory to the Dept?\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Waddy, Indian Agent.\nThe Pas MAN.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs I was requested last Summer by Honorable Mr Ferrier to make cement rails in front of the school, I would ask the Dept. if he is ready to send to the school the necessary material: 125 bags of cement, so that I pay the labour work, so that we could start on the work as soon as possible in May. To say that I am ready to do my share on this kind of work, I am ready to freight from The Pas 75 bags of that cement.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev. Napoleon Logan, D.D.S.\nPrincipal.\nThe Pas, Man  \nJan 11th 1929.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose two letters from the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nOne letter refers to his solution of the shortage of feed at the school in the future; he asks for a large boat and barge. He was talking to me about this; he would also use the outfit to haul his freight from The Pas. I asked him if he had a boat in sight and he said that Mr. Hayes at Sturgeon Landing wanted to sell his boat and barge for $3,000.00 some time ago but would now accept less. The cost of such an outfit would therefore be about some such figure.\n\nThe other letter asks for supply of 125 bags of cement to make railing around the front of the school; he offers to haul 75 of the sax of cement. Further expense would be the supply of gravel and the labor. He states that this was approved by Mr. Ferrier at time of his visit. I will supply the cement if authorized but have nothing on record about it in the office so far.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

May I point out that, in future, accounts that are authorized, as the Ashdown's account for $85.30, for poultry fencing, and their account for $14.90, for a lawn mower, should not be paid by the school management but should be certified as correct and forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Waddy, who would transmit them to the Department for payment. Our cheque would then go direct to the firms in question. This information is for your future guidance.\n\nThe Department is making reimbursement on account of the labour in erecting the poultry run, the freight, the cost of the fencing, the lawn mower and the repairs to the engine, and a cheque for $299.94 is being directed to you in reimbursement.

He also asks for a 16 H.P. steam boiler to make steam for the dryer and to operate the electric light plant and the pump.\n\nThe Principal states that when Mr. Ferrier visited this school last summer these matters were discussed and that favorable consideration was promised by Mr. Ferrier.\n\nA dryer is required at the school, and a steam plant would cut down the operating expenses, as fuel oil as used there now is very expensive.\n\nI enclose a booklet with the dryer described on page 39. The book could be returned here when this item is noted as I only borrowed it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMarch 4, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th ultimo with reference to the request from the Principal of the Guy School for a drying machine for his laundry, I beg to say that the Department of late years has been installing a Junior Drying Tumbler, as shown on page 45 of the Catalogue. This machine, although more expensive, has proven much more satisfactory for drying clothes.\n\nWith reference to the 16 H.P. steam boiler asked for there will, of course, be required an engine in connection with this boiler if it is their intention to use same for operating the electric lighting plant and pump. Will you please advise me if the Principal would prefer the Junior Drying Tumbler in place of the drying room, also the type of steam boiler and engine required, and if possible an estimate of the cost of the engine and boiler.\n\nI am returning herewith the Catalogue as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Mr. Waddy,\n\nMr. Edmonton made a very good report in the school during the first and second in the senior boys' dormitory. He finished yesterday afternoon at 2 o'clock. I thank you very much for having sent him. To make sure Mr. Finch will make the report in detail.\n\nAll the children are well now. It would be time for the dentist to come if possible.\n\nWould you kindly please to get Dr. Grayson at the Pigeon House. I think him that Mr. Grayson is in town rather than send me the mail.

Bishop Charlebois has received lately from the Department of Indian Affairs a copy of plan and specification of a Cold Storage Plant which has been successfully operated in connection with Schools in the North-West Territories as a means for the freezing of fish and meat.\n\nRev. Father Doyon, Principal of the Guy School, had the occasion to look over these plans and he approved them accordingly.\n\nLast year, it was question between The Indian Dep. and Rev. Father Doyon to have such a Cold Storage Plant installed at the Guy School this year.\n\nOn reception from the Department of the approbation necessary for the same, we shall be glad to have local contractors tender on this building.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMay 3rd, 1929\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention of Mr. Carrier.\n\nBishop Charlebois has asked me to place the following requests before the Department of Indian Affairs:\n\nFor the [signature] School\n\n1.- A steam engine of sufficient power to work the dynamo and the machinery of the laundry. This would replace the gasoline motor which is now in use at the School. It is found that when this motor gets out of order, and new pieces have to be procured for its repair, the house is without light and cannot use the laundry machinery for whole weeks. The motor would be kept at the School and could be used in cases of emergency.\n\n2.- A steam boiler large enough to run the engine and to furnish steam for the drying machine.\n\nIt is pointed out that, inasmuch as fuel wood is very cheap in those parts, the expense of running the steam engine would be much less than that of running the gasoline motor.\n\nIt would also be a great advantage for the boys at the school to learn how to operate a steam engine.\n\nThe installation of the boiler and engine will be done at the expense of the directors of the School.\n\n3.- A drying-machine is also needed at the same school. The machine of the rotary type is not suitable for the drying of blankets, while the machine with compartments can be used for all purposes. Accordingly, this latter machine would be preferred.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 4, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 632/153 of the 9th ultimo, with reference to a drying machine and an engine and boiler for the Guy Indian Residential School. The engine and boiler requested by the church authorities cost approximately $1,900, with an additional $500 for bricklaying in and installation. A drying room is worth approximately $600, or a total for this proposed equipment of $3,000. This amount is all that is available for improvements at the Guy School this year, and, if the Rev. Principal is willing to wait for the ice house, the Department is prepared to proceed with the supplying and installation of this machinery. I should be grateful for an early answer in this connection.\n\nRelative to the cold storage, the plans that were left with Bishop Charlebois call for a building which will cost approximately $5,000. This is much more expensive than is usually allowed Indian residential schools, but it provides equipment for freezing fish and meat. The ordinary ice house and cold storage that the Department generally builds at these schools cost from $1,200 to $1,600. You might enquire if the church authorities are willing to bear a portion of the cost of this special ice house if the Department arranges for an appropriation for next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. W. Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, May 4, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to a steam engine and boiler and a drying room for the Guy Indian Residential School. The Department has been in correspondence with His Lordship Bishop Charlebois and with Mr. Indian Agent Waddy in this connection. I am enclosing, for your information, a copy of my letter of today's date to Mr. Waddy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Macdonald\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. A. Lajeunesse, O. M. I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nMay 21st 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reference to your letter #132-7-5 of May 4th regards engine, boiler and drying room for the Guy Indian Residential School, I beg to say that His Lordship Bishop Charlesbois has informed me that he wishes the above supplied and will carry on at the school without the new ice house until next year.\n\nI will be leaving here in a short time and will be absent about three months on work in the Isle a la Crosse Agency, so any answer to this request could be directed to the Principal of the school to avoid delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThere is now available $3,200. for improvements at the Guy Indian Residential School. When the Estimates were prepared, there was an item of $2,000. for laundry machinery and $1,200. for an ice house. The school authorities and Mr. Indian Agent Waddy are urging the provision of a dry room, $600.; a boiler, $1,374.; and engine, $508. - a total of $2,482. The school authorities are willing to let the ice house stand for another year, provided the machinery mentioned is supplied. The boiler and engine are needed to run the dynamo and other machinery, as it is extremely difficult to get gasoline at times, and, further, the gas engines and motors occasionally need repairing and the school is somewhat distant from machine shop facilities. If you will authorize the expenditure, Mr. Orr will place the order for the machinery.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, June 7, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir,-\n\nWith reference to the improvements requested at the Guy Indian Residential School, you may purchase a boiler and steam engine of the type quoted on to you by the Fairbanks Morse Company, and enclosed with your letter of April 8th. You may also purchase and have installed at the School, a suitable drying room. When the equipment has been received at the School, properly certified vouchers in duplicate should be forwarded to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas,\nMan.\nHonorable Sir:\n\nBy Mr J.W.Waddy's letter dated Jan.31st, 1929, the Department was authorising me the buying of 125 bags of cement for making cement borders around the lawns in front of the school. But as I didn't have the cement before the first boat came, I did all the best to ornament the front part of the school so that today I think it will not be necessary to put any cement borders. Otherwise, with eight and ten hired men, and the boys, I cleared six acres of new land in front of the school, along the river and the lake; so that if you are of my opinion, I would like to be authorized to buy, in lieu of 125 bags of cement, 185 rods of good woven wire fence to embellish the place. If the Dept. could do it I would be very glad and thankfull.\n\nAlso our electric batteries are all filled up with dirt and should be emptied and refilled. Could you authorize me to have it done as soon as possible during the Summer, or would you like to buy the material for them?\n\nWishing to hear soon about these two questions, I beg to remain yours very truly,\n\nRev. Napoleon Boyce, C.D.L.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 26, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, and, in reply, I have to authorize you to expend $175 for woven wire fencing for the Guy Indian Residential School. It is understood that this is in lieu of the earlier authority concerning the purchase of cement.\n\nI note that the electric batteries are requiring attention. You should send them in to a competent man in The Pas and have him report direct to Ottawa concerning their condition and what is necessary to put them in good shape. In his first letter, he should let us have an estimate of the cost. Consideration will then be given to authorizing the improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

In addition to this, our men are not battery experts, and for this reason we would suggest that, if possible, you send it in to the Globelite Battery Company for examination and repairs.\n\nThis battery we understand has been in service for about four years, which is the life of an average battery, and it may not be possible, or worth while, to dismantle it for shipment to Winnipeg. A new 200 Ampere Hour 110 Volt Globelite Storage Battery would cost $766.50 f.o.b. Le Pas, Manitoba.\n\nRegarding the Fairbanks-Morse 10 H.P. Type \"Z\" Engine now at the school, Mr. Pederson suggests that this engine be overhauled for which the following new repair parts would be required:\n\n1 - #18 A.C. connecting rod, complete..................$55.40\n1 - #202 A.C. Butterfly Valve casing....................6.20\n3 - #6 Piston Rings........................................4.60\n\nTotal Price f.o.b.

However, they do make a two door and a\nfour door dryer in both wood and steel, on which we are\npleased to quote you the following prices:\n\n1 - Canadian Laundry Machinery Company 2 door Wood drying\nroom, complete with coils, fan, and trucks, as per\nspecifications attached hereto.\nShipping weight 3600 lbs.\nPrice f.o.b.

Guy School, Letter 132-7-5.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of June the 7th, approving the purchase and installment of Boiler and Engine for Guy School, I made a special trip to Sturgeon-Landing to see for a proper place for these machines. I came back rather dubious as to the place where we could have the Boiler installed. I thought then it was advisable to ask the Fairbanks-Morse to send an expert to investigate on this matter. This was done at the Company's expense, and Mr. Pederson, the man who was sent to Sturgeon-Landing, is actually preparing two different Blue-Prints which I will submit to you as soon as I receive them.\n\nDrying Room.\n\nYou will see by the enclosed letter received from the Fairbanks-Morse that a 3 door Drying Room, as desired by the Mother Superior, is no longer manufactured, but according to information I had from the hospital here, I am inclined to believe that a 2 door Drying Room of the size of the one quoted on will suffice. We would prefer the metal Drying Room to the other and would like to have your advise as soon as possible.\n\nStorage Battery.\n\nThe same letter of Fairbanks-Morse will also tell you about the Storage Battery. Please advise if you approve of the suggestion.\n\nGas Engine.\n\nI would also thank you for giving instructions in regard with the overhauling of the Gas Engine in operation at the Guy School.\n\nThanking you for the attention you have already given to this matter and awaiting your answer, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The first is our drawing No. F.M.1101 showing the boiler installed in the present wood supply shed with a 7ft 6 inch by 6 ft. pit extension directly behind the boiler to make room for cleaning the tubes. If this plan is adopted it will not be necessary to make any extension to the building, with the exception of the pit excavation as mentioned above. This would of course leave no room for the wood supply inside of the building.\n\nDrawing No. F.M. 1102 shows the installation of the boiler with a 12 ft. addition to the present building, and if this plan is adopted it would leave sufficient room for the wood supply inside of the building.\n\nMr. Pedersen stated that it is your desire not to make any extension to the building if at all possible, in which case the first mentioned drawing should be used, where it will only be necessary to have a small pit extension directly behind the boiler as mentioned above.\n\nYou will note that Mr. Pedersen has made some changes in the arrangement of the material in the powerhouse in order to install the new engine in line with the present Generator. After you have had an opportunity of checking over these drawings we would ask that you kindly return to us the one which meets with your approval.\nJuly 24th 1929.\n\nThe R. C.

As there were no fire rangers in the vicinity, I told the Principal to procure some help and try to put out the fire, which had jumped the river to the Sturgeon Weir Indian Reserve, on which the school is located. I beg to recommend that $50.00 be allowed for this work as the men should be paid for their labor and if an allowance is granted the Principal of the school can supply details and receipts for his expenditures.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Either yourself or the Principal should arrange for the purchase and forwarding of the parts required, obtaining an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost. After this equipment has been received, you should certify the account in the usual manner and send it to the Department for payment. It is presumed that the labour required in making the repairs will be carried out by the school authorities without cost to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Waddy, Indian Agent.\nThe Pas, MAN.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am sending herewith account for the Dept. re work on the river at the intake. According to the low water, as you saw it yourself, there was hardly any water coming out from the channel made last year and three years ago. I had to make it deeper with dynamite and to enlarge it at the opening in the rapid. So I succeeded to draw half of the rapid on the school side. It required lot a work and as the water was cold last week, I had to increase the wages. I do not think that the Dept. would object to pay this account, because it was very necessary to get water during the winter and to hinder the pipe from freezing.\n\nI hope you come and see the work done.\n\nI remain your always truly,\n\n[Signature]\nRev.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMarch 3rd, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to reply to your letter #132-7-5 of the 13th ultimo, and I beg to inform you that I have just returned from inspecting the Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask.\n\nWith reference to the Requisition For School Material, you returned, I took the matter up with the Principal, and he pointed out to me what he required the materials for. Part of the lumber is required as a reserve, on account of the difficulty of getting stuff in, in the summer time.\n\nYou will note he has put in the column \"Remarks\" the purpose for which repairs are needed.\n\nI pointed out to him that the Dept. expected him to procure some of these out of his per capita account, but his actual figures show that the school was run this last year at a loss.\n\nThe place is such in good order I am sure that nothing is wasted. May I recommend that the enclosed requisition receives favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nMarch 3rd, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report on inspection of the Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask., I found the school in first class shape, due to the efficient management.\n\nThere are a few suggestions however which I would make.\n\nThe pipes from the furnace in the basement are too near the ceiling, and I would suggest asbestos sheets attached with hangers for attachment to the ceiling. This would require about 50 lin. feet of asbestos with \u00bd inch iron hangers. The bins for flour, tea, sugar etc., are infected with little white moths and in spite of all the efforts of the Nuns, breed there and spoil all the contents. I suggest these be lined with tin or zinc. The corridors to the height of four feet should be painted white so that they could be washed.\n\nEverything around the out buildings are in splendid shape and reflect credit on the outside staff.\n\nAll of which I respectfully submit for your consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, March 8, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your two letters of the 3rd instant, relative to the request of the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School for various items of lumber, paint, hardware, etc., and for asbestos covering for the furnace pipes and lining for the flour, tea and sugar bins.\n\nIn connection with these requests, I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the following amounts in the purchase of the various supplies requisitioned for by the Principal:\n\nLumber $200; Paint $40; Hardware, etc., $60.\n\nThe Department will also approve of the supplying of the asbestos sheets with the hangers required in covering the pipes from the furnace which are near the ceiling. Approval is also granted for the purchase of the quantity of tin or zinc required in lining the flour, tea, sugar and other bins in which food supplies are stored at the school.\n\nBefore making the purchase, you should consult the Principal as to the type and quantity of the various supplies he requires, but it is to be understood that the above authorized amounts are not to be exceeded. After the purchase has been made, itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost. All work is to be performed by the school authorities without expense to the department.\n\nRegarding the painting of the corridors to the height of four feet, I have to say that this work will have to stand for the present.\n\nYou might inform the Principal it is expected in future that all materials and labour required in making replacements of a minor nature are to be supplied by the school authorities without expense to the Department.\n\nIt is noted that the general conditions around the outbuildings and the school are in good order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have explained that it is necessary for the Department to have your recommendation, with estimate of the cost, before any authority can be granted. Parts for two gas engines are requested. As these will not be very expensive, and apparently are necessary, you may make purchase to the best advantage and have the materials shipped to the school.\n\nPlease ascertain the cost of the items marked in blue and report if these are really required at present. It is necessary to safeguard the Appropriation for Indian Education this year as it is already over-assigned. Only really urgent improvements can be effected at this time.\n\nYou might discuss with the Reverend Principal the lumber, cement and roofing. Ascertain just how urgent these last items are and let the Department have your recommendation, with estimate of the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Ltd of Winnipeg, stating that they are going to ship, in a few days, the material bought last year from their firm for the Guy School. At the same time they ask me if the services of their engineer will be requested to make the complete installation. Their price for such an engineer would be $12.00 per day plus transportation and expenses.\n\nThere is no doubt that the services of an engineer are needed, as there is nobody at Sturgeon-Landing and even in The Pas who knows enough about steam and electricity to undertake such an installation.\n\nI would ask you then to let me know as soon as possible if the Department approves the prices asked for by the Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd for the services of their engineer.\n\nAs the water is liable to go down very quick this year, it would be advisable to give prompt attention to this matter.\n\nWith kindest personal regards, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

An electric light battery, a steam engine, a boiler, laundry machinery and all fittings were purchased. This was done through the church authorities, and recently, Rev. M. Lajeunesse, O. M. I., of Bishop Charlebois' staff, got in touch with the company concerning the installation of the equipment this year. He has written the Department that the Company will send an engineer for $12 per day, plus transportation and expenses. As the services of the Company's officer are highly desirable, considering the amount of expensive equipment that is being installed, I have today wired Father Lajeunesse that the engineer may be engaged and that the account, in duplicate, should be presented to your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It would be cheaper to cut and weld the tires.\n\nThe cauldron is for the laundry, and is required, owing to there being 120 scholars now resident at the school, some having been transferred from the Cross Lake Indian Residential School.\n\nThe tube expander is necessary, also rings for fire-hose.\n\nThe carbon brushes are expensive, and I cannot see why two dozen should be purchased at once. I understand that there are four brushes to a set, and that the life of a set is from five to ten years and with care much longer, so I should say a set of four be ample.\n\nShould you consider the articles recommended by me required may I suggest these be bought by you, as Wood Vallance Ltd., would have to send out for these, and are not certain if these could be got here in time for the boat to Sturgeon, as there is no regular service to this point.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to:\n\nOttawa, July 3, 1930.\n\nRev.

You may purchase the emulsion kettle at a cost of $69.25, the zinc expanders, and the rings for the fire hose. You may also purchase one set of four carbon brushes for the dynamos. The Department agrees that a tire upsetter is not necessary. I understand that the boat for Sturgeon Landing leaves on the 5th instant, and, as it is impossible to have these materials all there, you should order them locally, in the regular manner, and get them in when possible.\n\nLater, please let me have a recommendation regarding the lumber, cement and roofing that is requested.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No.132-7-5 of the 3rd, instant, I beg to say that the quantity of lumber etc., requisitioned for is excessive.\n\nNo doubt some lumber is required for repairs from time to time, but Father Doyon, Principal of the school, has received quite a quantity of lumber already and will, I think, have enough to keep him going for a considerable time.\n\nThe 125 bags of cement would cost approximately $145.00 here, is not really necessary, also the oak for wagon tongues. These are not often broken, and anyway can be made of tamarac, which is available at the school.\n\nThe 30 rolls of 3 ply roofing paper, would cost approximately $115.00 here. As far as I am aware, the condition of the roof of the school, only requires at the most 5 rolls, and this I would recommend.\n\nThe total cost of building material in the original requisition would be around $438.00\n\nTrusting this will have your approval,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, July 30, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 195-153 of the 25th instant, enclosing accounts in connection with the Guy Indian Residential School. These are returned herewith, as they should be certified to by either yourself or Father Lajeunesse, to whom the authority was directed. It is the general practice to have all orders go through your office, but it was necessary to make an exception in this case, for quite satisfactory reasons. When returning the accounts, only two copies are required by the Department. The freight bills, with the Ross Navigation accounts, etc., should be returned with the other papers.\n\nI have also your 193-153 of the 25th instant, stating that lumber, cement, etc., are now urgently required at this school.

Tweedell\nIndian Agent\nThe Pas.\n\n27th July 1930\n\nSir,\n\nThe roof over the laundry and engine room is in a very bad shape. The engine room has half a dozen leaks. If we should start on the dynamo or batteries it might cause serious damage.\n\nOn further request I wrote my roofing firm who advise as follows:\n\nTo supply asphalt roofing material would cost $31.00 for one coat.\n\nMaterials for two coats would cost $56.20.\n\nWe would have to warm this, put it on hot, afterwards put gravel and sand on, which material we already have on hand.\n\nCheap help could be hired locally to do this work.\n\nAs the leaks are so bad I would strongly advise applying two coats.\n\nKindly advise what you wish we should do in this matter.\n\nTruly Yours,\n\nO. Peterson\nDirector, Fairbanks House\n\nGuy Indian School.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nJuly 31st, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nPlease find herewith bills for material for the Guy Indian Resid. School, at Sturgeon Landing, Sask., goods ordered by Bishop Charlebois's secretary, Father Lazennesse, one for $21.57 and the other for $20.75, also a letter received by me from Mr. O. Patterson, erector for Fairbank Morse Co., and requisition for school material from the Principal, who has run out of the regular forms.\n\nI have been in consultation with Father Lazennesse in regard to the roof of the boiler house, and am of the opinion that the roof could be repaired at a less cost than that quoted by Mr. Patterson, and does not require an expert for the work.\n\nFather Lazennesse showed me another list of supplies for the installation, which included 1000 feet of Metalic Sheeting for the boiler room. This we agreed was not essential and will be eliminated.\n\nI am, in as far as possible trying to keep unnecessary costs, and trust this will be to your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 5, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, enclosing accounts covering the cost of material supplied the Guy Indian Residential School. I am returning these accounts, as it is necessary that they be properly certified before payment can be made. I may add that these accounts are only required in duplicate. When they have been returned, properly certified, payment will be made.\n\nRelative to the quotation which you forwarded from O. Patterson for repairs to the roof of the laundry and engine room, I have to say that it is considered the school authorities should undertake the work without calling in the services of an expert. You may arrange to supply the quantity of asphalt roofing material necessary, forwarding accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nIt is noted that, after consultation with the Principal, it is not considered necessary to supply 1000' of metallic sheeting for the boiler room.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n| DATE | PARTICULARS                  | Folio 768 | CREDIT 24-30 DAYS NET | DEBIT DAYS | BALANCE |\n|------|-----------------------------|-----------|-----------------------|------------|---------|\n|      | 9 Rolls Kraft Tarred Paper   |           |                       |            |         |\n|      | 13 Rolls Kraft Plain Paper   |           |                       |            |         |\n|      | 9' Sand Screen 4 x 4 per yd.|           |                       |            |         |\n|      | 50 only 3/8\" Square Nuts    |           |                       |            |         |\n|      | 6 Bars 3/8\" Round Iron      |           |                       |            |         |\n|      | 6 Bars 5/8\" Round Iron      |           |                       |            |         |\n|      | 100' 14 ga.

Lazennesse. There has been so much expense attached to the installation of the boiler and engine, that I thought it right to see how the work was progressing before ordering the last list of material received by Father Lazennesse from the Principal, Father Doyon.\n\nI found that the boiler and engine are in place, and looks like a good job, though all connections are not completed such as the drain from exhaust, which in the old system used to run water all over the floor. Mr. Paterson is using the exhaust steam for heating the drying room and other rooms instead of it going to waste.\n\nHe asked for metallic sheeting for the boiler room. I suggested instead asbestos sheets over the piping, same as was put in at the MacKay School, which he agreed would do as well.\n\nThe Principal had him plan a Fish Table for the cleaning of fish. Rather a good but elaborate thing, and as it does not impair the efficiency of the plant, I decided not to have it.\n\nIn the boiler room, Mr. Paterson was going to build a cement wall 12\" thick, 8' high and 15' long, reinforced with 4\" steel rods, and a similar wall in the new boiler room 7x5x12, to protect the boilers from wood being thrown in through the shutes. I informed Mr. Paterson that this could be done later if necessary as I did not consider it was work for an expert.\n\nThe principal wrote me asking that Mr. Paterson be instructed to repair the pipe in the water tower, which had frozen last winter and burst. I answered his letter, stating that if it would not entail much cost it could be done, otherwise he must submit the estimated cost for your approval. He merely answered that it would not cost much and that Mr. Paterson had started on the job.\n\nIn my absence at Treaty he ordered lumber for making another casing and sawdust for filling in between, so as the material is on the ground, I thought it as well to have it done and save further trouble in the winter or in case of fire.\n\n/Over\nI told Mr. Paterson that I did not object to him using an hour or so, seeing that the work was done right, but that the cheaper men must do the work.\n\nI may say that Father Lajeunesse was thoroughly in accord with my decisions.\n\nThe necessary material being ordered is, No.8 wire for connecting old and new batteries, 4 sheets asbestos for between the pipes and rafters, 4 sheets asbestos for heater in boiler room, 1 half inch reducing valve to reduce maximum pressure of 125 lbs to 2 or 3 lbs to be put on high pressure steam line to dryer.

LAJEUNESSE, O.M.I., Ottawa University, dated Sept. 10, 1930.\n\nOriginal on 132-7-9.\n\nRe: Ice house and list of Requisitions:\n\nThe Department had decided last year to build an ice house for the Guy School, and the building was to be put up this summer. Nothing has been done as yet. In the list of requisitions which we presented to the Department last spring, and which was sent back to our agent for approval, many articles were crossed out by the agent which we need badly and which, I am sure, the Department would have been disposed to grant us. It seems that the agent is over-zealous in these matters. Besides, none of the things that were asked for and approved by the agent have been received so far.\nOttawa, September 12, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nFather Lajeunesse has brought to the Department's attention your request for an exchange of land at the Guy Indian Residential School. I may say that this was granted two years ago, and I cannot do better than enclose a copy of the official letter to His Lordship Bishop Charlebois.\n\nConcerning a road from Sturgeon Landing to the Flin-Flon Railway, a distance of 16 miles, I may say that the Department would be favourably disposed to provide some assistance next year. It will be necessary to know, however, what the work will cost and what proportion would be expected from us.\n\nA note is being taken for next year's Estimates in connection with the ice house. You might let me know, in a separate letter, whether the school would be satisfied with an ordinary ice house or whether you are hoping to secure a freezer. If a building equipped for freezing fish and meat is really needed, the Department will expect the church authorities to bear a portion of the cost. The ordinary ice house and cold storage that the Department generally builds at Indian residential schools costs approximately $1500. The plans that Bishop Charlebois had some time ago call for a building which would cost approximately $5,000.\n\nI trust that the articles which have been allowed by the Department on recent requisitions have now been purchased and have reached the school.\n\nEnclosed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

BUSHARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 16th instant, concerning improvements to the heating plant at the Guy Indian Residential School, I may say that this institution is 135 miles by water from The Pas, Man. The School is located in Saskatchewan and is really not in the agency of Mr. Tweedell, our representative at The Pas. The reason Mr. Tweedell is asked to assume some responsibility is that all transportation to the school is via The Pas.\n\nIn the case of remote Indian residential schools, of necessity, the Department must deal direct, in part, with the school principal or the church authority that is directly responsible for the management. With particular reference to improvements at The Guy School, instructions are sometimes given to Mr. Indian Agent Tweedell and sometimes to the Roman Catholic Bishop, the Right Reverend O. Charlebois, O.M.I., who is also at The Pas.\n\nA Mr. Patterson, an engineer of the Fairbanks-Morse Company, of Winnipeg, has been at the school in connection with the installation of a steam engine, a boiler, laundry machinery, an electric battery and necessary fittings which were purchased from the Company. Bishop Charlebois was given the authority direct from Ottawa to engage the company's engineer. I wanted the installation of the mechanical plant to be done by an expert and to be entirely satisfactory to the church authorities. For this service, the engineer is to receive $25 per day. His accounts for his services have yet reached the Department; but, when they are before us, they will be scrutinized with the usual care.\n\nThe accounts for fittings and other materials used in connection with the installation of the new equipment were certified by the Reverend Father M. Lajeunesse, who is Bishop Charlebois' business executive. Indian Agent Tweedell's attitude in the matter has been entirely correct. He could not certify to some of the accounts in connection with Mr. Patterson's services and the improvements themselves, because the authority was not directed to him and he was not being held responsible for the work.\n\nRegarding the necessity for the improvements, I may say that they were recommended by our own Architect. Some additional repairs to mechanical plant have been authorized since Mr. Patterson arrived at the school, following the recommendation of the Indian Agent. If the School Principal has had any further work done, of course, he will have to meet the costs.\n\nDuncan C.

The work actually started on June 30th and finished August 31st. Blue prints will be forwarded on to you from Winnipeg as soon as printed, with any additional information you may require.\n\nRegarding the machinery.\n\nThere is one locomotive return tube type of boiler installed for supplying a 16 horsepower Climax Engine with steam. 125 lb. pressure.\n\nAlso a complete new set of Globelite Batteries, And one steam dryer for the laundry.\n\nTaking the boiler first.\n\nThere is one Duplex steam pump for supplying water to the boiler. Water can be taken by the pump from:\n(1) The heating return mains\n(2) The hot water tank\n(3) Cold water from the water tower.\n\nThere are also two steam Penberthy injectors, either one of which can be used to supply water to the boiler; the water being drawn from a separate tank in boiler room.\n\nA cold water supply is also directly coupled up to the boiler from the building water main; this can be used when the steam pressure is below 20 pounds.\n\nSo there are five different ways of supplying water to the boiler:\n(1) By Steam Pump\n(2) By One Injector\n(3) By a Second Injector\n(4) By cold water direct from water system when pressure is below 20 pounds.\n(5) By hot water direct from hot water storage tank when pressure is below 20 pounds.\nMr. Waddell - 2.\n\nTaking the 16 HP Steam \"Climax\" Engine next.\n\nIt is capable of running all the following at the same time:\n\n(1) Charging the batteries and supplying the building with light.\n(2) Pumping Water\n(3) Running laundry machinery\n(4) Running baking machine.\n\nThe exhaust piping from the engine has been installed to:\n\n(1) Heat the radiators in the water tower.\n(2) Heat the radiators in the laundry steam dryer.\n(3) Heat the hot water\n(4) Supply the building with heat.\n\nBy this method, no heat is wasted in the exhaust steam, so making the plant a most economical one.\n\nThe steam dryer in the laundry is heated with exhaust steam from the engine. There is also a line steam connection from the high pressure steam pipe that can be used when the engine is not running.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nO. Pettersson,\nErector for Fairbanks-Morse.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, September 16, 1930.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThe attention of the Minister has been drawn to certain work in connection with the heating plant now under way at the Guy Indian School in northern Manitoba. It has been stated that the changes are more extensive than was reported as necessary by the Agent on the Reserve; that the man now employed on the work is from Winnipeg and is being paid at the rate of $12.00 per day; that the Agent refused to certify to the accounts, and that the accounts have been paid upon the certification of an outside party.\n\nWould you please let the Minister have a report dealing fully with the attitude of the Agent in the matter, the employment of the help from Winnipeg, and also as to the name of the party who has been certifying to the accounts and what connection he has with the Department.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nSeptember 19, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 16th instant, concerning improvements to the heating plant at the Guy Indian Residential School, I may say that this institution is 135 miles by water from The Pas, Man. The School is located in Saskatchewan and is really not in the agency of Mr. Tweedell, our representative at The Pas. The reason Mr. Tweedell is asked to assume some responsibility is that all transportation to the school is via The Pas.\n\nIn the case of remote Indian residential schools, of necessity, the Department must deal direct, in part, with the school principal or the church authority that is directly responsible for the management. With particular reference to improvements at The Guy School, instructions are sometimes given to Mr. Indian Agent Tweedell and sometimes to the Roman Catholic Bishop, the Right Reverend O. Charlebois, C.M.I., who is also at The Pas.\n\nA Mr. Patterson, an engineer of the Fairbanks-Morse Company, of Winnipeg, has been at the school in connection with the installation of a steam engine, a boiler, laundry machinery, an electric battery and necessary fittings which were purchased from the Company. Bishop Charlebois was given the authority direct from Ottawa to engage the Company's engineer. I wanted the installation of the mechanical plant to be done by an expert and to be entirely satisfactory to the church authorities. For this service, the engineer is to receive $12 per day. No accounts for his services have yet reached the Department; but, when they are before us, they will be scrutinized with the usual care.\n\nThe accounts for fittings and other materials used in connection with the installation of the new equipment were certified by the Reverend Father M. Lajeunesse, who is Bishop Charlebois' business executive. Indian Agent Tweedell's attitude in the matter has been entirely correct. He could not certify to some of the accounts in connection with Mr. Patterson's services and the improvements themselves, because the authority was not directed to him and he was not being held responsible for the work.\n\nRegarding the necessity for the improvements, I may say that they were recommended by our own Architect. Some additional repairs to mechanical plant have been authorized since Mr. Patterson arrived at the school, following the recommendation of the Indian Agent. If the School Principal has had any further work done, of course, he will have to meet the costs.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSeptember 17, 1930\n\nRev. Father M. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nSecretary,\nR. C. Episcopal Corporation,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Manitoba.\n\nReverend Father:\n\nMr. O. G. A. Patterson, our Engineer who made the installation of the machinery, etc., at the Guy Indian Residential School-Sturgeon Landing, has now returned to Winnipeg. On his way back, he called on you at The Pas, but unfortunately you were away.

Mr. [signature]\n\nDear Sir,\n\nPlease find enclosed the last accounts in regard with the installation of Boiler, Steam Engine, Dryer, Batteries, repairing of Water Tower etc at The Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nThe expenses are somewhat higher than it was expected, notwithstanding my constant efforts to keep them down. I do not want to boast about my work but I think you would like to know what I have done in the interest of The Department.\n\nFirst of all, in July 1929, I have obtained from The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Co. Ltd., absolutely free of charge, the services of an expert who went to Sturgeon-Landing to take all the measurements and made out blue print of the work to be done. It was calculated that both expenses and labor amounted to $152.20.\n\nRegarding the time, the Engineer, Mr. Petterson spent on the job, there was one whole week, from September 1st to 8th, inclusive, for which no charge was made. In addition to this, as I represented that we should not be charged for the sundays, though they were practically spent in checking up material, making orders, keeping time etc... I have been granted $58.00 credit note for this.\n\nI have also obtained from the Beaver Lumber Co. Ltd., $60 discount on the lumber though their account is due since three months. At my request, the Rev. Father Principal has also passed $58.00 credit note for the work done by his team and charged for on the Return of Labour.\n\nFinely, with the approbation of His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, I have also discarded an account for $93.00 presented by Rev. Father Doyon for the board of Mr. Petterson for the 62 days he was at the School.\n\nYou will find enclosed a blue print and a complete report of the work done, showing the time spent on each job, as well as the number of hours spent by additional labor which was deemed necessary.\n\nHoping that you will find this satisfactory and thank you for your courtesy in this matter,\n\nI remain, Yours very truly,\n\n[signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, November 14, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing accounts in connection with the installation of the mechanical plant at the Guy Indian Residential School. I note with satisfaction that you have effected savings for the Department. This is appreciated. It is also my duty to state that more work was undertaken than really authorized. I find that a new boiler room has been prepared. There is no record that this was authorized. However, the accounts are now receiving consideration. I am returning, for certificate, the account of The Pas Lumber Company, in duplicate, for $2.00. All accounts should be certified correct. When this is returned, a cheque will issue in favour of the Company.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

It will be used this coming winter. Its cost will be about $1,500.00. The Provincial Government has promised to pay a part of the expense, and it is expected that the Department of Indian Affairs will pay at least a part of the balance.\n\nRe Refrigerating Plant -\n\nThe plans of the refrigerating plant have been received, and Father Doyon would undertake to build it for the sum of $5,000.00.\n\nRe Mowing Machine and Rake -\n\nThe mowing machine and the rake which were furnished to the School some years ago are now out of order. New ones will be needed for the coming year.\n\nPresented by J.A. Lajeunesse, O.M.I.\nOttawa, December 6, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReverend Father Lajeunesse has brought to the Department's attention your request for next year's estimates. I have noted that you beg the Department to give a grant toward the cost of the road from Sturgeon Landing to the railway; and that you would like a refrigerating plant. I may say that I am not hopeful that the refrigerator can be supplied next year as our funds are and will be needed for really urgent improvements.\n\nWith reference to replacing the mower and the hay rake I may say that this will have to be done from the per capita or other school earnings. When the Department builds a residential school a full complement of agricultural implements and livestock is supplied but all replacements have to be made by the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Doyon, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing, Sask., called here with a Requisition for repairs, which I inclose for your approval.\n\nRe the first item. 22' x 1 11/16 Shaft. This shaft has been damaged slightly, through contact with an iron rod, which in some way was out of place. The shaft is 1 11/16\" in diameter, and the weight of the rod coming in contact with the shaft has worn or cut a slight groove in the shaft, about 1/16\" deep. Father Doyon fears it might break. Not being quite satisfied that the shaft might break, I called upon Mr. Williams, The Pas Superint. of Utilities, and he advises me there is no necessity for a new shaft, but in case of a break we should purchase and have on hand a Ribbed Compression Coupling from the Fairbank Morse Coy., for 1 11/16\" shaft, catalog No. 2377, costing in the neighborhood of $7.60. By putting this coupling on the same shaft would be O.K.\n\nThe 1100 ft. of wire is for connecting the lights to the workshop and barn.\n\nThe items Connecting Rod and Piston, complete, I have deleted till I receive further information as to immediate necessity. I presume that these are meant to be spare parts.\n\nThe other articles on the Requisition are for minor repairs principally, all of which I would recommend and submit for your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

We are not prepared at the present time to authorize the wiring of the outbuildings for lighting purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Tweddell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Manitoba,\nDecember 22nd, 1930\n\nDear Sir:\n\nBefore Mr. W.G. Tweddell, the Agent, left for Cumberland House, he requested me to write you re our letter 434-153 of the 13th instant, in connection with the Connecting Rod and Pistons.\n\nMr. Tweddell received a letter from Father Doyon, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, stating that these parts were required as soon as possible, and were not for spare parts. Father Doyon has hung off ordering these from last year as he was trying to economize, but now both parts are worn out and the whole machine is shaking are wearing out, so at last the Father is forced to request spare parts.\n\nI have received an estimate on these, which I list below:\n\n| Item                  | Price   |\n|-----------------------|---------|\n| 1 only No.18C Connecting Rod Complete | $55.70  |\n| 1 \" \" 5-A.C.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ontario.\nOttawa, December 27th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with further reference to the requisition of the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, forwarded under cover of your letter of the 13th instant, to be supplied with connecting rod and pistons. Your communication has crossed our letter of the 19th instant, in reply to yours of the 13th instant. In our letter, it was stated that it is considered the school authorities themselves should provide the expenditure required in supplying the above equipment from their per capita earnings or other receipts. Please inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G. Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, February 27, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your attention, Return of Labour, in duplicate, which has to do with a repair to the water line at the Guy Indian Residential School. It is stated that you were unable to give favourable consideration to this account. The Department believes that this may have been an emergent expenditure, which was quite justified, and, as the Guy Indian Residential School had no means of ready communication with your office, they had no opportunity of securing the necessary authority. Further, digging during the late fall is fairly heavy work, and it is possible that Father Doyon was not going beyond reason when he engaged two men to supplement the work of the boys. Please give this further consideration, and, if you believe that the account is a fair charge against Parliamentary Appropriation, you should certify to it and return it to Ottawa for payment.\n\nThe Department commends you for your desire to economize wherever possible; but you should remember that emergent expenditures are sometimes necessary and that the Department wishes to assist our institutions with special expenses, provided funds can be found for the purpose and provided the repairs or improvements are not occasioned by inefficient management. Whenever you are in doubt about an account at an Indian residential school, you may forward it to the Department with a covering letter of explanation.\n\nI am also enclosing a quotation of the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, to put in good condition the gasoline engine at the Guy School, which is used as a supplementary unit. I should be pleased to have your report regarding the need of the repair parts mentioned in the enclosure.\n\nEnclos. 2.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. G.

Elle n'a pas \u00e9clat\u00e9 mais peu s'en est fallu. J'ai fait une description qui vous montre ou elle est perc\u00e9e trois pouces de large. C'est ni plus ni moins qu'un d\u00e9faut dans la construction. Le fr\u00e8re Guimette dit m\u00eame apr\u00e8s l'avoir bien examin\u00e9e que cet endroit perfor\u00e9 a \u00e9t\u00e9 r\u00e9par\u00e9, et tr\u00e8s mal, apr\u00e8s le travail de la bouilloire fini. Il dit aussi que c'est l'endroit le plus difficile dans la construction. C'est un collet autour du chapeau. Ce collet renferme deux rang\u00e9es de rivets; et c'est entre ces deux rang\u00e9es de rivets que se trouve l'ouverture. Il faudra faire venir un expert de la compagnie pour r\u00e9parer. Comment s'arranger pour faire venir un expert? C'est la question. Je suppose que la bouilloire est garantie et j'aime \u00e0 croire que la compagnie sera oblig\u00e9e de faire les frais de la r\u00e9paration.\n\nEn venant vous pourriez aussi constater que notre four \u00e0 pain est de nouveau en branle et devra \u00eatre r\u00e9par\u00e9 le plus t\u00f4t possible.

Tweedell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, June 5, 1931.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe Department has received a report on the condition of the boiler installed by your Company at the Guy Indian Residential School and which shows a very serious defect in the collar around the dome. The Principal, in his report, states that this boiler came very near exploding and that there is a hole, which he considers is the result of faulty construction, at the place mentioned. The engineer at the school states that, after a thorough examination, the place where this hole occurred was found to have been patched or repaired and the work very badly done at that. He states the collar around the dome is riveted with two rows of rivets and that the hole is between these two rows of rivets. Our Agent at The Pas states that this boiler was installed some three months ago by your firm and results show defective workmanship or material.\n\nIt is considered that your firm should undertake the necessary repairs, sending an expert to do the work, and without cost to the Department or the school authorities. I shall be pleased if you will give this matter your prompt attention, as it is necessary that these repairs be carried out as soon as possible. The Department will be pleased to hear from you as to what action you are prepared to take regarding the carrying out of the repairs required. For your information, I enclose a sketch made by the Principal, showing where the defect occurred in the boiler.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, enclosing a communication which you received from the Secretary to His Lordship Bishop Charlebois, regarding the defect that occurred in the boiler at the Guy Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that the Department is taking this matter up with the Canadian Fairbanks-Morse Company, Limited, Winnipeg, who installed the boiler, requesting them to arrange at an early date to send an expert to carry out the repairs required. This firm is being told that, owing to a defect in the boiler or in the workmanship, it is expected they should make the repairs without cost to the Department or the school authorities. It is hoped that they will attend to the matter at an early date.\n\nWith reference to the material required for the bake oven, also requirements for the dynamo, I have to request that you will arrange for the purchase of the materials required for both these services and have them forwarded to the school. It is hoped that, when the materials are received, the engineer will be able to carry out the repairs without cost to the Department. Please forward an itemized account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the materials supplied for repairing the bake oven and the dynamo. In the purchase of these, you should keep all expenses as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. G. Tweddell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nJune 15, 1931.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nWe have your letter 5th instant and regret that from reports received by you there apparently is some defect in the collar round the boiler which we recently installed for the Guy Residential School. We are taking this matter up immediately with the manufacturers of the boiler, and will advise you results as soon as possible.\n\nThanking you for reporting this matter to us -\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager.\nJune 19, 1931.\n\nThe Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nFurther to your letter 5th and our reply 15th instant, we are now in receipt of a letter from the makers of this boiler which we supplied to your school at Sturgeon Landing, copy of which we attach hereto, from which you will see that they expect to make an inspection within the next couple of weeks, and we will advise you results.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager.\n\nEnclosure.\nWinnipeg, Man.\nJune 16, 1931.\n\nCOPY\n\nThe Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co., Ltd.,\nWinnipeg,\nMan.\n\nDear Sirs;\n\nAttention - Mr. F. W. Miller.\n\nAnswering your letter of June 16th, in connection with our letter of June 17th, re boiler at the Guy Indian School, Sturgeon Landing.\n\nSince receiving your letter I have had a personal interview with Mr. H. A. Stewart, Chief Inspector of Boilers for Manitoba, and he informs me that the boiler on which trouble developed may not be required until fall, as the scholars will be at the homes for the summer, and the boiler may not be required until school is reopened. Mr. Stewart expects to leave for Churchill in a couple of weeks, and would make a personal inspection of this boiler along with his local inspection of that district, if it is in Manitoba. He is in doubt however, as to whether Sturgeon Landing is in Manitoba, as it is near the Saskatchewan border. If it is in Saskatchewan, of course, he would have no jurisdiction, and we would have to make our own inspection.\n\nThe C.W.R. has volunteered to get the boat sailings from The Pas for us, and owing to the lack of this information now, we will be unable to leave by train tomorrow, as gas and oxygen will have to be forwarded and should be on the ground before we arrive there.\n\nIn the meantime, while I could carry out instructions given in yours of June 16th, re details of the trip, I think it would be well to wait in any event until we get some idea as to sailing dates, so that very little time would be lost making connection between the Pas and Sturgeon Landing.\n\nHoping you may be able to advise us as to the Provincial location of Sturgeon Landing, we are -\n\nYours very truly,\n\nVULCAN IRON WORKS LIMITED.\n\n(Signed) J. S. Mowat,\nManager.\nHonorable A.F. MacKenzie, Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir:\n\nI regret to say that my children, leaving finally the school, are going away without having been revaccinated last week I saw at The Pas, Man., Mr W.G. Tweedell, Indian Agent, asking him to send a doctor to treat those pupils; but not one came.\n\nI was waiting for the visit of the same Indian Agent to see and approve the necessary repairs that have to be made during Summer. As he is not coming, after his visit to Cumberland House to pay the treaty, I undertake to write to you directly so that the necessary means shall be taken to repair the roof over the engine room and laundry room. The bad condition of that roof is really a danger for our batteries and the rest. I would not like to be responsible for a new set of batteries next year. I am including a photo re the roof. It is covered with roofing paper. The surface of it is 1764 sq ft. Last Fall I had tar and pitch mixed up to fill the cracks, without any good result. I do not know what you would suggest to have a good roof?\n\nHoping to receive from you a prompt answer, I beg to remain yours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nOttawa, July 8, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 21st ultimo, regarding the repairs required to the roof of the engine room and laundry room at the Guy Indian Residential School, I have to say that the Department will approve of the purchase of the quantity of felt roofing required to reroof this addition. It is considered that one thickness of three ply felt roofing, properly installed, would serve the purpose, and you may, therefore, arrange to purchase the quantity required. It is noted that the surface area of the roof is 1764 square feet. The purchase of this material should be made from the Beaver Lumber Company, The Pas, Man.\n\nPlease obtain an account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and also an account, in duplicate, covering the freight charges from The Pas to the school. These accounts you should certify in the usual manner and forward to the Department, when payment will be made. The school authorities are to be responsible for the installing of the roofing without cost to the Department.\n\nThe picture of the roof which you enclosed in your letter was received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

They have stored about 600 bus. of potatoes, 140 bags of carrots, and 40 bags of beets. They also have about 500 head of cabbage, as well as several bags of onions. This year the tomatoes did not ripen on the vines, but they gathered 15 bags of green tomatoes, many of which ripened after picking.

Hamilton,\nInspector.\nGUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nI was delighted with the improvements made at this school since my last visit. The yards have been well planned, levelled, and proper swings and teeters erected for the children. More land has been cleared and they now have two good sized gardens. The barn yard has been cleared of stumps and rocks, and new fences built and proper roads and driveways arranged.\n\nThe school I found to be spotlessly clean throughout, and the surplus clothes and bedding all neatly arranged.\nGUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) (CONT'D.)\n\narranged in various closets.\n\nThe sewing room is well equipped, and I found a goodly supply of clothes, both for boys and girls, neatly stored away. The clothes are all made by the senior girls assisted by the Sisters in charge, and the work is all well done.\n\nThe laundry is well arranged and the machinery appeared in good repair. The metallic ceiling is badly rusted from the steam and dampness, and needs painting.\n\nThe kitchen work is carried on by the girls, supervised by a Sister, and all food is well prepared and nicely served. This year over 300 jars of wild fruit and rhubarb were preserved, as well as over 250 jars of peas, beans, tomatoes, corn, and squash, all of which had been grown in their own garden. This Sister also supervised the making of 18 large barrels of sauer-kraut.\n\nThe dormitories were clean, the beds neatly made, and the rooms all well aired and bright.\n\nThe fire escapes are all in good condition, and none of the doors leading to them are locked. An alarm bell is fixed on each door, which rings the moment it is opened so that it is impossible for anyone to open the door without an alarm being given. Fire drill is observed regularly, and a night man kept on duty.\n\nThe playrooms were tidy and well aired. All toilets I found in good working order and clean. Excellent care is given to all machinery, all of which appeared to be in perfect working order.\n\nThe meals\nGUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL (R.C.) (CONT'D.)\n\nThe meals served to the children are as follows:\n\nBreakfast:- Fish, potatoes, lard & bread, tea or milk.\n\nDinner:- Meat or fish, potatoes, a vegetable, or beans, bread, tea.\n\nSupper:- Porridge, fish, bread, lard, tea or milk.\n\nPuddings and dried fruit are served for dessert, also syrup.\n\nThe classroom work is carried on at present in three classrooms:\n\nThe junior room with 47 on the roll,\nThe Intermediate room with 36 on the roll,\nThe Senior \" 38 \"\n\nThe work is carried on from Grade I to Grade VII, and the children speak out well and do not appear nervous or backward. I believe good progress is made.\n\nThe children were all clean, neatly dressed, and bright in appearance. There were no children sick, and they all appeared healthy and happy.\n\nThe barn is in good repair, but badly in need of paint. The interior was all nicely whitewashed and the floors were swept clean.\n\nThe chicken house was freshly whitewashed, and the fence in good repair. An average of 100 hens are kept each winter.\n\nThe work shop was tidy and a Brother was busy repairing shoes and moccasins. The Reverend Principal requested that a sewing machine for leather work be supplied as all their repair work, both shoes and harness must be done at home. The old machine is worn out and past repairing.\n\nThere are\nThere are now three root cellars at the school, all of which are in use.

In view of this, and also in view of the fact that the generator is crated and at the station in The Pas, I have arranged to have it shipped to Winnipeg to-night by express, and am sending special instructions through a firm here to have the generator repaired as a rush order. I am hoping I shall be able to have this wound and repaired within two days after its arrival, which should be Wednesday morning, and will probably have it returned to the school and the current on by next Saturday or Monday at the latest.\n\nI am told this procedure will be quicker than if a new generator were purchased as, in all probability, a man would have to go up to The Pas to take measurements, etc. I trust this action will meet with your approval.\n\nIn the meantime, the school will have to carry on for three or four days with coal oil.\n\nA new generator would probably cost over $600.00, and I did not feel that it would be wise to spend this amount at this time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It is considered that the school authorities should provide this equipment from their per capita earnings or other receipts, and you should inform the Principal accordingly. Two copies of the requisition which you forwarded are returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nSamuel Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nGuy Indian Residential Boarding School,\nSturgeon Landing, SASK.\nApril 3rd, 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am informed by Rev. Father Marcotte to submit direct to you the list of Material I deem absolutely necessary for our school. We have already bought and paid at the price of $170.00 the lumber I was asking for in the original list, which lumber will be used for general repairs.\n\nI am asking for bearings for the Dynamo, because the ones in use now have given three years service, and are liable to fail at any time. As it takes weeks to be in communication with Winnipeg, you realize that a new set is not superfluous.\n\nThe same remark applies for the threading tool which would enable us to make all the repairs in that line and thus save the Dept. to pay for wages and travelling expenses to experts from the outside.\n\nAs for the repair parts for the Motor boat, they are not less necessary, as without them we will not be able to use our boat next Summer.\n\nI hope you will see your way to have these granted to our school; and you may rest assured in return that we do not spare neither our time nor our care to save as much as possible and to prevent the buildings and the machineries to deteriorate.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. Napoleon Deyon, Oct. 1st.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 12, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School requesting that certain repair parts for the motor boat and dynamo and a threading tool be supplied. I enclose herewith copy of the requisition giving particulars as to what is required, and would request that you arrange for the purchase and forwarding to the school of same. Should you require any further information, you could consult the Reverend Principal and ascertain definitely the repair parts required. After the purchase has been made, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nWhile these supplies are similar to those on the requisition which you forwarded under cover of your letter of February 29th, last, for which funds could not be provided at that time, the Department has, in view of the recent requisition, decided to authorize the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Father Lajeunesse visited the Department recently in connection with the supplying of an oven. He was to obtain full particulars as to the type of oven required and inform the Department. The quotation which he obtained was much less than that mentioned by the Principal on his requisition. When we hear from Father Lajeunesse, consideration will be given as to whether funds for the supplying of the oven can be provided or not, and you will be informed of the Department's decision in the matter.\n\nYou may arrange for the purchase of the lubricators required for the engine, also, if you consider the same to be absolutely necessary, you may purchase 6 galvanized iron sheets. You have not stated the purpose for which these sheets are required. It is considered, however, that the Principal should pay for this equipment. You should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the lubricators, and if you consider that the Department should pay for the iron sheets, an account, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Oven for Guy School.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I had the pleasure to call to your office, in the last days of October, I promised you to furnish to your Department some informations needed in connection with the above mentioned matter.\n\nRev. Father Doyon, Principal of the Guy School was here yesterday and after considering the matter very carefully he says that the oven No.4 (the largest manufactured) would not be large enough to answer their needs. With this only unit they would be obliged to bake every day or at least every other day this causing a large amount of extra work both for staff and machineries, as in most of the cases they would have to run the engine only for the mixer.\n\nConsequently we would appreciate very much if you could see your way to grant the two units No.4 and No.3.\n\nI enclosed a recent letter from Mr. Daoust where these two units are offered for $800.00 f.o.b. Atik.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, November 25, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication received by the Reverend Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School from Jean J. Daoust & Cie., St. Boniface, quoting a price for the supplying of two oven units, viz., No. 3 and No. 4.\n\nAs our funds this year are extremely limited - no special amount being provided to supply this equipment - it will only be possible at the present time to furnish the school with a No. 4 oven. We are communicating with the above firm, requesting their lowest price F.O.B. Atik Station for the supplying of a No. 4 oven. It is noted that the price quoted in their letter to the Principal is for two units, No. 3 and No. 4, while we will only be able to provide, as stated above, one baking unit, a No. 4, at the present time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Martin Lajeunesse, O.M.I.,\nSecretary,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, November 25, 1932.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nThe Department has been forwarded your letter of the 14th instant, addressed to the Reverend Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Sask., quoting on a No. 3 and No. 4 bake oven. In this connection, I should be pleased if you would advise the Department as soon as possible of your lowest possible price F.O.B. Atik Station for supplying the No. 4 oven, only, referred to in your letter to the Principal. I may say that our funds are extremely limited this year, and this is the only baking unit that we would be prepared to provide.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMessrs.

We have to refinish this Oven because of the damage caused to the exterior of it by smoke. It has never been used and was ready for shipment, being stored in our warehouse.

The price of Five Hundred and Twenty-two ($522.50) dollars and fifty cents was quoted F. O. B., The Pas, as we thought His Grace Monsignor Charlebois, O. M. I. was writing for his own purpose. We learned sometime after, that the same Oven was to be shipped to Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan. We find that we have been quoting according to the mailing points from letters received, for none of them, except yours was specifying where the said Oven was to be shipped.\n\nMoreover, we had quoted this price of Five Hundred and Twenty-two ($522.50) dollars and fifty cents for a No. 4; and Three Hundred and Nine ($309.75) dollars and seventy-five cents for a No. 3; in the case where the Nos. 3 and 4 were needed at one time. We, sometime after, quoted Eight Hundred ($800.00) dollars for a new No. 3 together with a re-polished No. 4, being under the impression they were going to The Pas.\n\nWe are, therefore, justified in maintaining our price of Five Hundred and Fifty ($550.00) Dollars, F. O. B. Atik Station, thirty days, Government tax included; as previously quoted in ours to you, dated November 28th.\n\n\"LIGHTNING SERVICE AT A CURRENT CHARGE\"\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dacust & Cie., St. Boniface, Man., to forward, addressed to you, Atik Station, one No. 4 Economy wood burning oven. The price quoted by this firm for supplying this oven is $550.00, f.o.b. Atik Station, sales tax included. I may say that the oven was slightly damaged by smoke but it will be repolished before shipment.\n\nI would request that you arrange to accept delivery of the oven when it arrives at Atik Station, have it taken and set up for use at the school.

Since then, we have been informed by Reverend Father Doyon that this Oven has reached its port safely and is now giving splendid service; that he has also informed Mr. Lovell, Indian Agent at The Pas and that we will be forwarded with payment of this same Oven. Would you please advise us at what date we could expect payment on this, as have obligations to meet in the course of a few days and we would like to give them definite dates on same.\n\nThe state of business at present will shortly compel us to let off our staff. We are trying to avoid this as much as we can and we would be ready to make special concessions on any orders placed from now on until the First of May, so as to enable us to operate the regular way. If the Department feels the need of any Economy Ovens, and that we could take the order at present on them, we would consider a special discount for this quiet season.\n\nThe matter of course, is left to your discretion, and we only want cooperation so as to curtail unemployment as much as possible.\n\nHoping to hear from you in the near future, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJean J.

I paid $960.00 to Mr Ismael Gauthier in two years for that work. Last week I had to discharge him, for we have no funds for that work. I am disposed to do my best to keep a close watch over the school so that there will be no danger for fire and so on, but to take all responsibilities, I cannot do it anymore. If the Department is willing to pay a night watch-man, I will be glad to hire that same Ismael Gauthier, for he is very good for that kind of work. Please, let me know the Department's decision about this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. N. Deyou, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\n480\nOct 15 - April 30\n#30 a month\nOttawa, October 3, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the necessity for a night watchman at the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will allow a grant towards the salary of the night watchman at the Guy School from October 15, 1933, to April 30, 1934, at the rate of $30 a month. Payment of this amount will be made on receipt of a properly certified voucher, in triplicate, which should be forwarded through the office of Mr. Agent Levell.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. N. Deyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nOttawa, October 3, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nEnclosed, for your information, is a copy of a letter being directed to the Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School. I am enclosing a voucher showing the manner in which vouchers for this service should be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir:\n\nLast week, M.A.G. Hamilton, Inspector from Winnipeg, paid a visit to our school. After a thorough inspection of the school and of the buildings, Mr. Hamilton suggested what is most necessary to me to ask the Department for at the present time. May I call your attention on the following items.\n\n1. Mr. Hamilton noticed that the school needs painting outside and inside as well, and also the other buildings. He suggested that the Department should supply the school with paint.\n\n2. The school would also benefit of a binder if the Department would buy one. We grow enough oats now to make good use of it.\n\n3. I spoke to Mr. Hamilton of an idea that runs across my mind for quite a while. He approved of it and suggested that I refer the case over to the Department. Here is the idea: I want a sawmill. It can be operated at a low cost and both the Department and the school can have a great benefit out of it. Every year, since the opening of the school, an average of $200 is spent on lumber and the Department did not give any financial help to that effect for the last four years. Here the timber is plentiful and the quality of the lumber would satisfy the ordinary requirements. Every year a few thousand feet of lumber can be cut for the general purpose of the school. A good second-hand transportable sawmill can be bought at a very reasonable price and I kindly ask the Department to share with me the burden of the purchase. Let the Department give me $200, and I supply the balance of the purchase price, and I finance the operation and the upkeep of the sawmill.\n\n4. The school has been providing with 8 fire pumps, but four should be replaced at once because they are out of order.\n\nIn the course of next week, you will very likely receive Mr. Hamilton's report; I hope that it will be very satisfactory.\n\nI hope that the Department will take into serious consideration the above-mentioned necessities which the school is facing at the present time and I sincerely wish that\nthey all come to their fullest realization.\n\nMr. Hamilton, while visiting up here, mentioned that very likely a Member of the Department Of Indians will come and pay a visit to Sturgeon Landing during the summer months. I anticipate the pleasure of welcoming the honorable Member. He will then convince himself of the necessities which the school has been asking for.\n\nI remain,\n\nTruly Yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, February 17, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from the Rev. Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, with reference to repairs required to the building.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip to the Guy R.C. Indian Residential School, The Pas Agency, and beg to submit the following report.\n\nThere are 87 children in attendance, which are arranged in three classrooms, as follows.\n\nThe junior room is in charge of Sister of Precious Blood and there are 13 pupils in Grade I and 21 pupils in Grade II.\n\nThe intermediate room is in charge of Sister St. Eusele, with 13 in Grade III and 9 in Grade IV.\n\nSister St. Philip de Marie is in charge of the senior grades with 14 in Grade V, 15 in Grade VI, and 2 in Grade VII.\n\nI spent some little time in all the rooms and was pleased with the work. The children, without exception, can be heard to read from any part of the classroom. They read with expression and understanding.\n\nThe arithmetic, spelling, and oral work was good. I examined their scribblers and work books, which I found to be neat and the work well set out.\n\nI am glad to report that splendid progress is being made in all classrooms; the Sisters in charge speak good English and, I believe, are rendering their best services.\n\nThe children were all well dressed, clean, and neat in appearance. Their hair was well kept and combed.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe discipline is excellent, and yet there is freedom and understanding, which makes the work very pleasant.\n\nThe children appeared in good health, except for two boys who are confined to bed suffering from T.B. They are isolated from the other pupils and receive the best of care and attention.\n\nThe fire equipment is in good condition, except the fire hose. These are cracked in places where they are folded back and forth on the racks. Six new hose should be provided. The dormitory doors are never locked and I found the fire escapes in good condition and free from snow. Electric bells ring if the doors are opened. A night watchman is on duty, but this is never satisfactory unless the school is provided with a punch clock and stations placed throughout the building. I would strongly recommend that a clock be provided. This is a frame building and every precaution should be taken to prevent fire. The small fire extinguishers are in good condition, but the large ones have not been refilled during the past year. I understand the solution should be renewed yearly.\n\nThe dormitories were all well aired, the beds neatly made and clean. The mattresses are homemade. I understand the Department supplied the ticking. These mattresses are almost on a par with those purchased, being filled with cotton and wool. I think the Sisters deserve great credit for this work.\n\nThe sewing room is in charge of a Sister and the girls are taught plain sewing. I saw large quantities\nquantities of clothing made by the girls, and the work was neat and well done. They make all their own dresses and underclothing, also shirts, pants, coats, and underclothing for the boys. The girls also receive a splendid training in cooking and laundry work. In summer all the children do some work in the garden.\n\nThe building was clean throughout, and excellent care has been taken of the school and equipment. It was erected in 1926 and no interior decorating has since been done. The white walls need paint, especially in the kitchen and halls. I see that in the 1933-34 Estimates $600.00 was asked for repairs. If any portion of this is available, I would like permission to buy some paint. The Reverend Principal will see that same is applied without cost to the Department. The Sisters are anxious that some cleaning be done and I trust that a small expenditure may be incurred. A hundred dollars would supply a fair amount and would greatly encourage the staff in their work. The exterior of the school is greatly showing the need of paint.\n\nThe main barn is about 30 ft. by 40 ft. and accommodates both the horses and cattle. At present they have 4 horses and 10 cows beside a number of young stock. The Reverend Principal feels he could do better by killing the present stock for beef and purchasing 4 or 5 registered cows with some record of production. Feed is hard to secure in this country and no doubt a few cattle of a higher class would be more profitable. The barn is badly in need of paint, most of it having peeled off.\n\nThe chicken house is in good repair. The poultry is well cared for, and fresh eggs were gathered daily.\ndaily, although the weather registered 20 to 35 below zero.\n\nThere are four large root cellars; funds for one were provided by the Department, but the other three were erected at the expense of the school authorities. These cellars, even yet, have a bountiful supply of potatoes, carrots, beets, cabbage, turnips, and sugar beets. In fact, although this school is far north, it has perhaps the largest supply of vegetables, with the exception of Brandon, of any school I visited this past year. The children have abundance of food, both vegetables and meat. The menu is as follows:\n\n**Breakfast** - Fish with rice or potatoes; bread and lard. Tea with milk and sugar.\n\n**Dinner** - Soup; meat with beans or macaroni, or fish and potatoes. Once a week, dessert - syrup, prunes, dried apples with doughnuts or cake. Tea with milk & sugar. All the bread they desire.\n\n**Luncheon** - Raw carrots; bread cakes or bannock.\n\n**Supper** - Fish and porridge; bread with lard; tea with milk & sugar.\n\nThe children have all the food they wish, and certainly appear well fed.\n\nIn the warehouse was stored about 4,000 frozen whitefish and trout, and nearly 3,000 lbs. of beef was packed away in ice. The other storehouse was filled to capacity with flour, oatmeal, sugar, rice, and all the other supplies necessary to do until December of this year. All freight now goes over the Hudson Bay railway to Atik and is freighted in some 20 miles during the winter.\n\nThe Reverend Principal has cleared a quantity of land and has made a wonderful improvement in the grounds surrounding the school. Last year, he grew approximately\napproximately 15 acres of oats and hopes to increase this to at least 25 or 30 acres. He requested that a 6 ft. binder be supplied to assist in harvesting. The sheaves could then be stored under cover and no waste would occur. We have very little outlay in machinery at this point and, if possible, I would like to have the binder supplied.\n\nThe garden certainly must have been an object lesson to all who visited the school. In addition to the supply of roots stored, the Sisters have a large quantity of home canned peas, beans, tomatoes (ripe), corn on the cob, as well as all kinds of mixed pickles. This school is doing excellent work and is worthy of any consideration which the Department can give.\n\nThe Principal, Rev. Father Doyon, pointed out the need for lumber, both for repair work and for the erection of outbuildings. He stated that each year the expense in this connection reached $200.00, and felt that it would be to the advantage of all if a sawmill could be provided. He stated if the Department would supply $200.00, he would raise the balance required and pay all other costs. I am quite sure a suitable outfit would cost at least $500.00.\n\nI feel the Reverend Principal has presented a reasonable proposition, and as the school would reap the benefit, in that all the rough lumber necessary could be provided, I would recommend that the Department grant assistance to the extent of $200.00.\n\nIt is perhaps unfortunate that a school of such high standard is so situated that few white people are privileged to see it. Certainly it is a credit, both to the Department and the church, and is undoubtedly doing excellent\nexcellent work in the classroom as well as outside. The children receive a thorough training - the boys, in gardening, care of stock, shoemaking, and carpentering; the girls, in cooking, sewing, laundry work, and also in gardening. The discipline is excellent and I am sure the pupils leave the school much better fitted to cope with whatever conditions they may be obliged to face.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.G. Hamilton\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nManitoba.\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter dated February 17th, No. 132-7-5, I now enclose herewith my report in connection with the Guy Indian Residential School, The Pas Agency.\n\nI visited this school on January 24th, but only returned to Winnipeg on February 22nd, consequently the delay was unavoidable as the intervening time was spent on inspection work at The Pas and points throughout the Manitowapah Agency.

I was most glad to see you and give you references about the Guy School. Since eight years, you agreed with me that I did not ask many things to the Dept.; and I was thankful to you for the good note you gave to the progress of my school. However in the meantime I was asking few articles whose list of requisition you received that same day of my visit. You were going to give to it all your consideration. As I did not receive any details about yet, I dare again to come and ask you if it will be at all possible to obtain from the Department of Indian Affairs that material so much desired for my school.\n\nNot to cause you too much trouble, I include with this letter copy of the list and letter sent on Sept. last to Mr Lovell and to you. I would also draw your attention to my letter of January 28th, 1934 regarding Mr Hamilton's report, to this matter.\n\nI am ready to make the transportation of this material, for it is the best time of the year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

Doyon, O.M.I., the Principal of Guy Indian Residential School, in which he asks that his steam boiler be inspected.\n\nThe Department of Public Works, Regina, state that they do not make regular inspections of boilers in such remote places, but if the Department of Indian Affairs, will pay all the expenses of the inspector from Hudson Bay Junction and the school and return, they will send an inspector up on a special trip. They further state that the trip will take the better part of a week.\n\nThis boiler has been in the school, I believe, for about ten years and has never been inspected by a competent person. I think it desirable that this boiler be inspected periodically so that we can be sure it is quite safe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

While it is, no doubt, desirable that an inspection be made, could not the school authorities, themselves, pay the cost of the inspection? It is hoped that the school authorities have a competent engineer in charge of the boiler and that every care is taken in its management and operation.\n\nFor your information, I may add that a request has also been received from the Principal, to be supplied with certain farm machinery and paint for the exterior of the school building, shop and henhouse, and a quantity of piping, couplings, etc., for the steam boilers. You were authorized, in official letter of the third ultimo, to purchase 6 pieces of 2\", extra strong, galvanized iron piping for the hot water boiler. I would request that you arrange to have this supplied and the accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, forwarded for payment before the end of the present fiscal year, viz.: March 31st, next.\n\nRegarding the other equipment asked for by the Principal, he is being informed that, until our Estimates are passed by Parliament at its next session, we will be unable to state what funds, if any, are available during the coming fiscal year to supply equipment for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

No doubt, this will be forwarded in the near future.\n\nOur Estimates for the next fiscal year have not yet been approved, and I am therefore not in a position to state, at the present time, how much, if any, of the other equipment asked for in the requisition can be supplied. I may add, however, that it is very doubtful if funds will be available to provide the cost of supplying the farm equipment and a small sawmill. It will likely be the first of April before the Department is definitely aware what funds are available to provide equipment, etc., for your school during the fiscal year 1935-36.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It, of course was not a tender.\n\nThe cost of the pipes is $50.46 delivered at Atik, which is considerable more than I said it would cost. This is regretted but I was simply giving you the information that had been given to me by Wood Vallance. The pipes are now installed at the Guy Residential School and there is nothing I can do but certify to and forward the accounts for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTo Reverend N.

The expense in connection with this would only entail the purchase of a quantity of cement, probably around 35 to 40 sacks.\n\nI would also draw the Department's attention to my report of February 24th, 1934, in which I pointed out the need for paint, both on the exterior of the school and barn.

Father Deyon, Principal of the Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing. I regret that I was unable to visit the school, but wish to submit the following requests received from the Rev. Father, which I trust will be given consideration.\n\nIn my last report, written on February 24th, 1934, I pointed out the need for a small binder to harvest the grain crop. This year the crop will amount to approximately 30 acres and unless a binder can be obtained, it would be useless for the Rev. Father to anticipate bringing any further acreage under cultivation. A 5 ft. binder would meet their requirements and would cost approximately $215.00 F.O.B. The Pas. This size binder is not handled in the West and would have to be ordered in time to be shipped with other machinery from the Eastern factories.\n\nLast winter the Principal had a difficult time to keep the pipes from freezing in the room where the pressure boiler is installed. This room is a lean-to from the main building and the roof is covered with corrugated iron. The Rev. Father wishes to put another roof over this with an air space between. The size will be about 18x24 and the material required will be shiplap and rubber roofing. The cost of this work will amount to approximately $40.00. I would recommend that this work be carried out before the cold weather sets in.

G.

No funds were provided to supply a binder. It is considered the school authorities should supply this equipment from their per capita allowance or other receipts.\n\nThe Department will approve of the Principal installing another roof over the room in which the pressure boiler is situated. It is noted that the material required - shiplap and rubber roofing - would cost, approximately $40.00. Itemised accounts, in triplicate properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure.\n\nRegarding the installing of a cement walk around that portion of the school most affected by flooding from water from the roof, I have to say that the Department will approve of the expenditure in the purchase of the quantity of cement - approximately 40 sacks - in having the cement walk installed. The school authorities will have to carry out the labour, without expense to the Department. Accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the cement, should be forwarded for payment. After payment has been made for the cost of installing another roof over the room in which the pressure boiler is installed and the cement supplied, the Department will approve of the balance of $500.00 available being utilized in the purchase of paint, oils, etc., in the painting required to the exterior of the school building. The Department would like to be advised of the amount of the painting that could be carried out for the unexpended portion of the appropriation provided for this school and the quantity of paint, etc., that it would be necessary to supply. You might take up this matter with the Principal, advise him of the expenditure authorized above and request him to inform you regarding the painting. It is presumed that the staff could do the greater part of the work if the painting materials were supplied.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. G.

Payment of this amount will be made upon receipt of a properly certified voucher, in triplicate, from your office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. C. Parker,\nActing Secretary.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nThe Pas, Man.,\nOct. 5, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWhen I was at the Guy Indian Residential School recently, the Principal drew to my attention to condition of the boiler used for heating the water required for the School. This boiler is in very bad condition. In fact it is in a dangerous condition, as it is extremely thin and there are over thirty patches in it.\n\nThe boiler is heated through pipes running through the furnace in winter and by a jacket heater in summer.\n\nI wrote to Inspector Hamilton and reported the matter to him and asked him to find out in Winnipeg what the cost of a new boiler would be. One with black coil pipes would cost $330.00 and one with brass coil pipes would cost $383.00. There would probably be additional cost for installation as there would be other material required connecting it up. The staff could do the actual work of installing it. I think $20.00 in addition to the cost of the boiler would cover everything.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, regarding the condition of the boiler used for heating water at the Guy Indian Residential School. Mr. Lovell states he wrote you, to ascertain the cost of supplying a new boiler, and that a boiler with black coil pipes would cost $330 and one with brass coil pipes, $383.\n\nThe Department has funds available for repairs and equipment at this school, to the amount of $500, and is prepared to authorize the expenditure in supplying a new hot water boiler. I would request, if you have sufficient information on hand to place the order, that you will arrange for the purchase, from a firm on the approved list, of a boiler with brass coil pipes and for the forwarding of same to the school. It is hoped that the cost, including transportation charges, will not exceed the sum of $400.00. If you have not sufficient information to place the order, you should communicate with Mr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, and ascertain definitely the requirements. It is understood that the staff of the school will carry out the work of installing the new boiler.\n\nI would request that you give this matter your early attention. After the purchase has been made, please obtain an account, in triplicate, covering the cost, attach same to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. A voucher, covering the transportation charges, with receipt attached, should also be forwarded.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of purchasing the new boiler in your hands, to make the best arrangements and at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Hamilton, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, October 11, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the condition of the boiler used for heating water at the Guy Indian Residential School and giving an estimate of the cost of supplying and installing a new boiler.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department is requesting Mr. Inspector Hamilton to arrange for the purchase and forwarding of a new boiler. He is being advised that, if he has not sufficient information to place the order, he is to communicate with you.

I would request that you ascertain, from Marshall-Wells, in Winnipeg, the cost of the various items of equipment, as mentioned, from the catalogue of that firm, and advise the Department. You should, also, make enquiry and state the cost of the bearings and brushes required for the dynamo.\n\nRegarding the shiplap and the quantities or the various dimensions of plank required, I would request that you state the best source of supply. Would it be more advantageous to purchase this material at The Pas or have it forwarded from Winnipeg? Could you state, also, the approximate cost of supplying the shiplap and plank.\n\nThe Department is informing Father Plourde that you are being requested to obtain prices on the equipment asked for by the Principal of the School and submit same for consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Owing to pressure of work, Mr. Lovell, has been unable to make a visit to the Guy School this year, consequently he was unable to make a report on the repairs, etc., required, as asked for in your above-mentioned letter.\n\nThe Rev. Father N. Doyon, however, came to the office yesterday and requested that we write to the Department for authority to purchase the following articles to be sent to Atik, Man., so that they can be taken to the school during the winter.\n\n1 Galvanized Range Boiler, extra heavy, size 120, Cap 82 gals Diameter 24 ins. Height 60 ins. with stand and fitting. Price $55.44\n\n8 rolls poultry fencing. (155 feet to roll 72 ins. height Line wire 22) Price $84.40\n\n1 Mower 5\u00bd feet (John Deere) $123.50\n1 Sulky rake, 12 feet 70.50\n1 typewriter $100.00\nApprox. 325 feet of second hand iron pipe from The Pas hospital viz 175 ft. 4 in. 100 ft. 3 in. 50 ft. 2\u00bd in. for repairs and to be kept in case required, as it is difficult to get material of this sort in when repairs are needed. The price quoted is about half the first cost. $250.00\n\nThe above prices were obtained locally. Probably the new goods could be obtained cheaper if they were shipped in from Winnipeg.\n\nI am writing this, on the instructions of Mr. Lovell, who went away to Shoal Lake and Red Earth Reserves early this morning.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Br.,\nMines & Resources\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith our voucher No. 689, amounting to $22.27 in favour of the Rev. N. Doyon, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Lending, Sask. for repairs to generator at Guy School.\n\nI have been holding this account, as it was noticed there were two items for express. I wrote the Rev. Father Doyon some time ago asking him to send the receipts, but I have not yet received any answer. Owing to the roads breaking up, it is very probable that I will not hear from him for some time. If I waited for the express receipts, I would not be able to get the account to Ottawa before the end of the financial year. I thought it best therefore to send the account in without the receipts and ask you to pass it. The account itself, is of course, receipted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 6, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am returning herewith your Voucher No. 659 in favour of Rev.

It is regretted that this account cannot be paid until we have further details.\n\nPlease state the number of hours engaged in replacing the mica and the rate charged per hour. Receipts for the express charges of $3.92 and $3.85 should also be forwarded.\n\nWhen we have received the account, properly itemized, with express receipts attached, Father Doyon will be reimbursed to the above amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nS.

(RG 10, Volume 6314, file 655-5, part 5)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nThe Pas, Man.,\nNov. 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith Requisition for supplies for Guy Indian Residential School, which I have received from the Rev. Father N. Doyon and also prices for these articles, which I have got from Winnipeg.\n\nThe Principal has pointed out that the saw mill would be useful for making lumber for the school and also for lumber for ex-pupils residing around the school.\n\nAt the present time I do not see why the school requires a great deal of lumber. They have, as far as I know, all the buildings they require. As far as supplying ex-pupils who reside in the vicinity of the school with lumber, I do not approve of ex-pupils when they leave school settling near the school. There is nothing for them to do there and the fur is very scarce in that vicinity. A few of them reside near the school now and they are constantly asking for relief. I can therefore see no immediate need for this saw mill and cannot recommend it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 8, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of November 30th, enclosing Requisition from the Principal of the Guy Residential School for supplies.\n\nIn view of the information contained in your letter, the Department is not prepared to supply at the present time the sawmill requested by the Principal.\n\nI regret that you did not comment on the other articles. Presumably some of these are necessary and, if so, you may arrange for the purchase of the following:\n\n| Item Description                          | Quantity | Unit Price |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|------------|\n| Pressure gauge double spring              | 1        | $9.15      |\n| Brass compressor bibbs                    | 6        | 4.50       |\n| Hose \u00bc\"                                    | 6        | 5.85       |\n| Compression stops, size 3/8\"              | 6        | 3.84       |\n| Medium type with adapter 1500 Series      | 12       |            |\n| Bearings                                   |          | 76.80      |\n| Galv. elbows, size 1\u00bd in. and 2 in.        | 6        | 1.68       |\n| Galv. tees, size 1\u00bd in.                   | 3        | 2.70       |\n| Doz. galv. bushings size \u215d x \u00be in.        | 1        | 1.11       |\n| Bronze gate valve, size 1\u00bd\"               | 2        | 1.62       |\n| Galv. sheets - gauge 26, size 36 x 72     | 6        |            |\n| Black sheets, size 48 x 96                | 3        | 21.00      |\n\nThese are the cheaper articles and, if required at the present time, you may arrange for their purchase. If there are any other articles that are absolutely necessary, you should let me know.\nIt is noted that the Principal requests a dough mixer. Funds are so limited that it is doubtful if this can be supplied before the end of the fiscal year. You should let me know the size of the mixer at present in the school and any other particulars that you have in order that an order can be placed if funds are available. When replying you should also state if you consider the plough, mower and additional fire extinguishers are required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I hope however to be able to make a visit within the next two months. I will then look into the whole matter and make a report and recommendation. I do not think any of the articles are urgently required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You should forward two vouchers, one covering the labour and the other covering the cost of the materials. For your information I may say that an amount of $500.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Guy School. However, the Principal should not have proceeded with the work without first receiving authority but in view of the amount available in the current year's appropriation payment of the expenditure will be made on receipt from you of the two vouchers requested above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

I understand from Father Doyen that you had also inspected the Guy School and considered additional fire escapes desirable. Please let me have a report regarding the fire escapes at present on the school and if you consider new fire escapes necessary you should state your reasons. In the latter event you should also let me have an estimate of the probable cost of installing any new fire escapes that you might recommend.\n\nI am also informed that some repairs are required to the roof of the laundry. Full details should be supplied regarding this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nI was asked to go to Guy Indian Residential School this week as they had had an accident with their steam engine. There had apparently been an explosion and it had completely wrecked the engine.\n\nThis engine is the power they use for light, pumping water and all other power required around the buildings. They are using a small auxiliary gas engine at present, but it has not sufficient power and in case of fire it would be practically useless.\n\nI have made enquiries from the Fairbanks Morse Co. of Winnipeg and they tell me they will supply a fifteen horse Vertical Automatic Steam Engine with pulley for $675.00 F.O.B. Winnipeg.\n\nThis engine appears to be essential for the efficient running of the school and also for safety in case of fire and I therefore recommend that it be purchased and sent to the Guy Indian Residential School, as soon as possible. They inform me they will be able to install it themselves.\n\nI could not determine what was the cause of the damage to the engine and none of the staff could give any reason.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Guy Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 12-488\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6314, file 655-5, part 5)\nOttawa,\nDecember 9, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Guy Indian Residential School\n\nI have just been advised by the Indian Agent that as a result of an explosion the steam engine at the above-mentioned school has been completely wrecked. This engine is the power used for lighting, pumping water and all other power purposes around the school. At the present time they are using a small auxiliary gas engine but it has not sufficient power. In the case of fire it would be practically useless.\n\nIt is, therefore, necessary to supply a new steam engine at the earliest possible date and as the cost of this will probably exceed $500.00 I should appreciate it if the Honourable the Minister would approve the purchase. In that event the attached purchase order should be sent to Mr. Bailey.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter 132-7-5, dated Oct. 26th with regard to request of the Principal of Guy Indian Residential School for additional fire escapes.\n\nI visited the School recently and I would say that additional fire escapes are necessary. At the present time they have two fire escapes of the steel stairs and platform style. They are both at the back of the building and extend from the ground to the attic. I think under stress, especially in winter time when they were slippery with ice, it might be difficult to get the children out with any great speed.\n\nI suggest a frame structure be erected on the left side of the building 6 by 8 feet in which be placed a pole fire escape from the first floor to the second story and from the second story to the attic. They would come down on the porch and a slide could be erected from there to the ground. It would be necessary to make doors in the building to provide outlets to the escape.\n\nI also suggest that similar pole escape be provided on the other end of the building. It would not be necessary to build a structure on this end of the building, except from the 2nd storey to the attic as the rest of the way it would come through the verandah.\n\nI got an estimate from Harrison and Leneville, The Pas on this job. They estimate it would cost $1325.00. This firm is the only one doing this kind of work on the preferred list. I do not know how they arrived at their figures, but I think the amount is extraordinarily large.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nDecember 12, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant with reference to the fire escapes at the Guy Indian Residential School.\n\nAs no funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for additional fire escapes it is not possible to favourably consider the matter at the present time.\n\nEvery endeavour should be made to keep the present fire escapes as clear of ice and snow as possible. You should also satisfy yourself that a reliable man is employed as night watchman. In this way the fire hazards will be minimized.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS.

This engine is being shipped from London, Ontario, and the firm has been requested to rush delivery. It is being addressed to Rev. M. Doyon, O.M.I., Principal, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing, Saskatchewan. It would be advisable for you to get in touch with the station agent at that point and have him notify you as soon as the engine reaches there in order that you may communicate with the Principal and have the engine sent to the school.\n\nIt may be a couple of weeks before the engine reaches Sturgeon Landing in view of the fact that it is coming from London, Ontario, but this delay could not be avoided as our Purchasing Agent states that he made very extensive inquiries and this was the only engine suitable for the Guy school that could be secured at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS.

It is noted that the cost of the labour will not exceed $100.00 and it is presumed that Indians will be employed.\n\nFor your information I may say that an amount of $500.00 was included in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Guy school. The expenditure being made at the present time totals $276.10 for material and labour. Consequently there remains the amount of $223.90 which the Department is prepared to allow for other requirements at the Guy school. This is the total amount that can be authorized during the current fiscal year. You should let me have full particulars regarding the manner in which you recommend that the balance be spent if necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS.

N.L.T.L.\nAkron O.\n\nLast November when the steam engine broke in pieces, you were told\nthat the shaft of the generator bent, the shock having been so\nviolent. Since then my engineer was able to make the generator\nwork but with much difficulty. Two sets of bearings are worn out\nsince December. Many a time my engineer wanted to straighten\nthe shaft, but fearing that it might break, and leave us without\nlight for a long time, I refused to have him do it. I do not think\neither that this can be done inhere.\n\nI know very well that at the Dept, they will not be\nglad to have to buy a new generator, but after all, I cannot blame\nmy engineer who, as you know, is very mindful of his work. It was\nsimply an accident.\n\nIf you think it advisable, my engineer may try to\nstraighten the shaft; if not we will have to send the generator\nto Winnipeg or Regina for repair, but I am sure it will cost as\nmuch as a new one, and the trouble....\n\nWhatever you think advisable will be satisfactory\nto me.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith a letter I have received from the Rev. Father Doyen, the Principal of Guy Indian Residential School, who is asking to be supplied with a new generator for the school power plant.\n\nWill you kindly inform me if the Department will supply the generator.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nApril 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 22nd instant with reference to the request of the Principal of the Guy residential school for a new generator for the school power plant.\n\nIn this connection I would refer you to my letter of the 19th instant regarding the amount provided in the current year's appropriation for new equipment, repairs and improvements at the Guy school. A decision regarding the new generator cannot be made until you reply to that letter.\n\nThe Principal describes the generator in the school as follows: The Imperial Electric Co. No. 7703 K.W. 7.5 Volts 125 Amp 60 R.P.M. 1875 Type S.B.S. Volts Adj. N.L.T.L. Akron O.\n\nApparently the generator at present in use was manufactured in the United States. In the event of the Department deciding to supply a generator we would prefer ordering one manufactured either in England or Canada. You should, therefore, let me have detailed information regarding the type of generator that is necessary to do the work required at the Guy school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. Lovell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am enclosing herewith our voucher No. 66 amounting to $74.32 in favour of Rev. Father Doyen, Guy Indian Residential School, Sturgeon Landing.\n\nI knew nothing about this expenditure until I received the receipted account, which Father Doyen sent to me, evidently wanting me to send it to the Department so that he would be reimbursed.\n\nThere is no authority for this expenditure though no doubt the belting is required, though he never spoke to me about it when I was there last month. I thought however it best to forward the account to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nMay 10, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant enclosing voucher No. 66 covering the cost of belting purchased for use at the Guy Indian residential school. This account is being returned unpaid. No authority was given for its purchase. The Department cannot control expenditure if Principals persist in securing material for which no authority has been obtained. From previous correspondence you are already aware of the amount available in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at this school and it is doubtful if the equipment already requested can be secured. You will, therefore, see that it is not possible for the Department to favourably consider payment of your voucher 66.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. Lowell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letters 132-7-5, dated the 19th and 29th ultimo, in connection with our requests for repairs for Guy School.\n\nIn addition to the lumber, roofing, etc., required, I have recently forwarded to you a voucher amounting to $74.32 in favour of the Rev. Father Deyen for belting. This, if paid, would have to be charged to this year's appropriation.\n\nThe generator in the next thing most urgently required and if there is sufficient funds to purchase it, I recommend that it be bought.\n\nA Canadian or English made generator would no doubt serve just as well as the one used formerly which was made in the U.S.A. It must supply 110 Volts direct current. The power used is the steam engine bought from Mumford, Medland, Ltd., Winnipeg, Man. in Feb. 1939, described as follows.\n\n16 horse power Vertical steam engine, cyl. 7\" diameter by 8\" stroke, speed 275 RPM, driving belt pulley 20\" diameter by 10\u00be\", face shaft diam. 2\u00bc\", balance wheel 26\" diam x 6-3/4\" face. Weight 1500 lbs\n\nAs manufactured by London Concrete Machinery Co.\n\nThe above, with the information given in my previous letter, should, I believe, any electric company to know exactly what is required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMay 13, 1939\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF:\n\nGuy Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 76\n\nSHIP TO: Rev.

If the above information is not available, give the number of lamps and size of each supplied with power by the generator. Please advise not only the total number of lamps installed but the estimated maximum number of lamps that would likely be on at one time.\n\n(b) Is the wiring system two or three wire.\n\n(c) Is sliding base required for generator\n\n(d) Is pulley required for generator.\n\n(e) State size of the engine pulley, including diameter, width of face, flat or V belt\n\n(f) Speed and horse power of engine.\n\n(g) Is belt required. If so, give distance between centre of engine and generator pulleys.\n\n(h) Will generator be coupled or belted to the engine.\n\n(i) Will generator be required to charge a battery.\n\n(j) If the generator required is to replace a generator, give details shown on name plates of the old generator.\n\n(k) Give details of switch box in use, if any.\n\nW.M.Bailey\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\nReverend Sir:\n\nIn connection with the generator which you have requested for the Guy residential school it is necessary for us to have additional information before securing tenders.\n\nI enclose a memorandum received from the Purchasing Agent. Please answer all the questions asked in this memorandum and return the letter with your answer at the earliest possible date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. Father Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nThe Pas., Man.,\nMay 17th, 1939.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am returning herewith your account for $74.32 for belting which you purchased from Wood Vallance.\n\nThis account was forwarded to the Department and they have returned it and say they cannot favourably consider the account. They point out that no authority was obtained for this purchase and that they cannot control expenditure if officials and Principals persist in securing material for which no authority has been obtained.\n\nIt is doubtful if the repairs you have already asked for can be obtained. Prices for them are now being got and it is already obvious that it will take the current year's appropriation to pay for the repairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nRev. Father Doyen,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing,\nSask.\nGuy Indian Residential Boarding School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nJune 4th, 1939.\n\nMr R.A. Hoey,\nSupt.of Welfare & Training,\nDept.of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFind enclosed informations required by your purchasing agent for generator requested at our school.\n\nI am also including my account for $74.32 for beltin which account has been returned to me last week by our indian agent. I had to wait three months to get a new engine. At last came the vertical engine, new type which requires only one belt but doubled in thickness. That is why I purchase it at the first opportunity being sure that the Dept.would not refuse to give a belt with the new engine. However, Mr Hoey, if you find out that it is impossible to reimburse it, you have only to throw it away.\n\nCan I ask you, Mr Hoey, how much contribution will the Dept.give to Guy School for the transportation of children during summer vacation?. Water is so low now, it is getting quite impossible to carry children by canoe as in previous years. We find many more advantages in carrying them by planes. We obtained that privilege to double the number of children in plains, so the cost of transportation will be lessened. However the gross total cost charged by the Wings Co, who has the contract, will be $1106.00 for return trip. Would you, please, let me know what will be your contribution, if any.\n\nDuring May I received from Mr W.R. Leslie, Superintendent of the D.Experimental Farm at Morden, some 200 seedlings for my garden, for which I am very grateful to you.\n\nVery few sick children during the year, no death. Very good work performed by the sisters and other members of the staff. Children will be glad to see their parents between the 15 and 20 of June, but also will be very pleased to come back in August.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Plourde a very good news: the restoration of the 5% of the per capita allowances for residential schools. I am pretty sure that you are the one who obtained for us that restoration. That why I wish to come and congratulate you and in the same time to thank you for that favor received.\n\nLast Saturday I received the Guildcraft-Trackery Loom you promised to me last November during my visit to Ottawa. Thanks for that favor also. The sisters of the school are very glad to have it.\n\nTwo months ago, on June 4th, I wrote to you regarding the generator for our school, giving informations required; also what contribution you could give re the transportation of children during summer holidays. I wonder if you ever received my letter?\n\nI received last week the material required for repairing the roof over the engine room and laundry room. Two men are working at it these days.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nAugust 11, 1939.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 1st instant with reference to the generator that you requested for the Guy Indian residential school.

They have been giving service for more than four years.\n\nHe has requested that I write to the Department and ask if another set could be purchased so that it would be possible to get them in to Sturgeon Landing before the ice goes, that is before the end of March.

The Purchasing Agent placed the order for the generator on September 8, 1939, with the Canadian Fairbanks Morse Company. The generator was to be supplied at a price of $390.00, sales tax included, f.o.b. Atik, Manitoba. The attached account has just been received from the Fairbanks Morse Company and it has not been certified either by the Principal or yourself. I should appreciate it if you would ascertain immediately if the generator has reached the school and if it is in good order. If so, you should certify the account and return same for payment. Please give this matter your immediate attention as the Department wishes to pay the cost of this generator from the appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 and we will only be allowed to use this vote for another week or ten days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The Principal has just been in the office and informed me that the generator reached the school about two weeks ago, but he has not yet received the account.

Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 3, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to a request from the Principal of the Guy School for material for a new water tank.\n\nAs you are aware this lumber will have to be purchased through our Purchasing Branch and information supplied by the Beaver Lumber Company and the Monarch Lumber Company is rather vague. You should prepare a formal requisition on the form enclosed and return it together with the quotations from the two companies. It is noted that you are suggesting the use of spruce. Do you feel satisfied that spruce would be suitable for the erection of a water tank? I have been advised that fir or cedar would be preferable.\n\nIt is also noted that the cost of the labour is estimated at $250.00. This seems extremely high in view of the fact that the material can apparently be secured for approximately $160.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. S. Lovell,\nIndian Agent,\nThe Pas, Man.\n\nR.A.

The cost of a cedar tank would be approximately double that of a spruce tank and the life of a cedar tank would not, in my opinion be twice as long.\n\nThe cost of labour is only an estimate, but it is apt to be rather high because we have to send in workmen and Guy School is in a rather remote place. I think it would be best to leave it at that figure, but I would of course endeavour to get the work done as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Guy Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 78 Allotment 13-482\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

It is noted that the cost of labour may amount to $250.00. Every endeavour should be made to keep the expenditure below this point.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Before payment of the voucher can be made it will be necessary for you to forward a receipt from the transportation company.\n\nPlease note that all freight or express charges must be supported by a receipt from the transportation company. It will save considerable correspondence if this detail receives your attention before forwarding vouchers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. S.

The reason I forwarded the voucher was because I understood that you wanted the account in right away so that it could be paid from the 1940-41 appropriation.\n\nThe goods were shipped direct from Winnipeg to Atik by the Ashdown Co. on order of Carroll's. I should add that Carroll's informed me they lost about $17.00 on this order, as apparently the price of the goods had gone up from the price list they figured from. They filled the contract according to the tender they quoted the Department.\n\nFreight bill from Winnipeg to Atik is enclosed herewith. I trust this will suffice.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Your purchase order 7159 of May 12 last has not been filled yet, as we had no road available to freight the material. I have explained the situation to the Indian Agent long before in January, but without success. However as soon after the receipt or your purchase order, the material has been prepared and let at the Monarch Lumber Co until this winter. Last week the Indian Agent told me that the said material will be at Atik to-morrow. This explains why you did not receive yet the account in triplicate signed by me. But as soon as received, you will have it through the Indian Agent who will be here on Tuesday next to visit the school.\n\nThe work of the school is going on with success as ever. Be assured that we do our very best for the children who are all actually in good health.

Doyon, Principal, Guy Indian Residential School:\n\nThree weeks ago I received three sewing machines, small ones; could you tell me if the three larger ones requested have been ordered?\n\nThe painting of the school will be finished during this week. The 45 gals. of oil and the 60 gals. of paint bought by the Dept. have been used carefully for that purpose. I bought myself enough paint and oil to paint the barn, shop, chicken house. This is going to be done soon. After the completion of that work, I will send pictures of the school and other buildings so to invite you to come and visit us, will you?\nOttawa,\nJuly 20, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, regarding sewing machines recently supplied to the Guy Residential School, the Department ordered, from the Singer Sewing Machine Company, two ordinary sewing machines and one machine with oscillating or round shuttle. It is true that in the Agent's letter of May 8 three machines of the latter type were requested, but owing to the fact that they cost approximately $20.00 more than the ordinary type we could only supply one of them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. N. Doyon, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nGuy Indian Residential School,\nSturgeon Landing, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Bread mixer for Guy School,\nThe Pas Agency.\n\nThe enclosed letter has just been received from Ryan Brothers, Limited, Winnipeg.\n\nThe Reverend Father Doyon is urgently in need of a machine due to the fact that his old one is worn out and cannot be repaired. The school is fifty miles from any railway and it is too much to expect the school to bake bread for perhaps 125, and do the mixing by hand. The mixer quoted on was inspected by Father Doyon. It has been in use; but the Father states it is in good repair and happens to be exactly the same as our old machine. Since it is second-hand I presume no priority rating is necessary.\n\nThis is the only machine I know available in Winnipeg and I would urge that the Purchasing Agent be requested to make the purchase by air mail or wire.

The taking down of the old tank and the erection to be under the direction of the Principal Rev. Father Doyon, for the sum of $150.00.\n\nOwing to transportation difficulties, low water in the lake and wet road, which made it impossible to transport lumber for the tank in until after freeze up, it was therefore too late to erect the tank that year.\n\nIn the summer of 1942 I met Ismael Gauthier and the erection of the tank was mentioned as this man was hired by the Father to do the work in 1941.\n\nAt the end of July I was informed that the construction of the tank was underway and intended to notify the department to that effect, owing to the rush at Treaty and other work it slipped my mind. I heard nothing further until I received the account for same; this account has been held until I had the opportunity of going into the school and inspecting the tank. At present there is approximately 10 to 11 feet of water in the tank. The tank will gradually swell and the capacity will increase as the lumber tightens up.\nI would like to draw your attention to the fact that this work was absolutely a necessity as the old tank was rotten and did not hold at any time more than 3 feet of water, which would be useless in the event of fire.\n\nWhile the account as rendered is more than the authority granted in 1941, the price on the whole is very fair in fact 60 cents an hour for that class of work is cheap, and the time taken is very considerate.\n\nI am very sorry that permission was not granted before this work proceeded and will take extra precautions to see that this does not happen again. I strongly recommend that this account be paid.\n\nSamuel Lovell\nS.

The School staff do their own repairs. They are in a remote area and when repairs are required it is necessary to have the material on hand; otherwise it would take weeks and sometimes months to obtain it. In the meantime the School might have their water supply cut off. No new installation of any kind is being made.\n\nThe list of material required was handed to me by the Principal. I think it would be all right to cut this requisition in half, with the exception of the 300 feet of steel pipe, asked for and which is listed at the very bottom.\n\nSamuel Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Guy Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 75 Allotment 09-628\n\nSHIP TO Rev.

They did not use that route for the last three years on account of low water level. But as the water level is rather high this summer and seems to be remaining so for four months they would like to profit again with that route but the difficulty is to have their freight unloaded at the right place by the C.N.R.\n\nThe right place would be Education or Mile 39 on the Pas--Flin Flon C.N.R. Subdivision. The C.N.R. Co. allows the Passenger Train No 63--64 to stop there but not the mixed train No 529-530. There is no road at all between Education and the nearest station where the train stops, namely Simonhouse. Unless the mixed train is allowed to stop at Education they cannot at all have their freight in from the C.N.R. Railroad up to Sturgeon Landing.\n\nHis Excellency has suggested me to come in touch with you and ask you if you would be kind enough to take the matter with the superintendant of the C.N.R. Mr. F.J. Myer, in order to have the mixed train No 529-530 stopping at Education during the months of July, August, Sept. and Oct. Mr. F.J. Myer's address is: Mr. F.J. Myer, Superintendant of Flin Flon Subdivision, Dauphin, Manitoba.\n\nThanking you in advance for your cooperation we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Ringust, Bursar.\nOttawa, July 6, 1943.\n\nDear Father Ringuet:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo, I enclose, for your information, a copy of official letter being forwarded today to Mr. F. J. Myer, Superintendent of the Flin Flon Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway, Dauphin, Manitoba.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend E. Ringuet,\nBursar,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nOttawa, July 6, 1943.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am advised that the most practical way of transporting supplies to the Guy Indian Residential School is a water route on the Goose Lake, from Education or Mile 39 on the C. N. Railroad to Sturgeon Landing.\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, this school is the property of the Dominion Government and is operated for us by the Catholic Church in educating Indian children of that district.\n\nI am further advised that the Canadian National Railway allows passenger train No. 65-64 to stop at Education but does not allow the mixed train No. 529-230 to stop there. It would assist the management of our Guy Residential School to a very great extent if it could be arranged to have the mixed train stop at Education during the months of July, August, September and October, 1943. This would permit the unloading of the goods consigned to the school at Education and their transportation from that point to the school, by water, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will find it possible to meet our wishes in this particular respect.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP. J. Myer, Esq.,\nSuperintendent,\nFlin Flon Subdivision,\nCanadian National Railway,\nDauphin, Manitoba.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of July 6th regarding additional train stops at Education, mile 39 on our Flin Flon Subdivision, for the months of July, August, September and October of the present year.\n\nThe stopping of a freight train on the main line between stations to handle freight, as a general rule, is most undesirable for train operation.\n\nHowever, I will have the matter thoroughly canvassed and communicate with you further at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent.\nCANADIAN NATIONAL RAILWAYS\nOFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT\n\nDauphin, Man.,\nJuly 19th, 1943.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nFurther to my letter of July 12th in reply to yours of the 6th, regarding additional train stops at Education, Mile 39 on our Flin Flon Subdivision.\n\nWould it not be possible to make use of the regular stopping place at Simonhouse, Mileage 41.0, or at the Lumber Manufacturers spur at Mileage 42.2, where we could have the mixed trains 529 and 530 mentioned in your letter, stop to make whatever handling of freight is required?\n\nThe additional stop for this mixed train at the point desired would be detrimental to train operation and in the interests of safety, not desirable.\n\nI trust you can see your way clear to make your arrangements for the freight stops at either Simonhouse or at mileage 42.2.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 23, 1945.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 30 and my reply of the 6th instant, in connection with endeavouring to arrange to have the C.N.R. train stop at Education, Man., I enclose, for your information, two letters which we have received from the C.N.R.\n\nI should appreciate your advising me immediately if the suggestion contained in the railway company's letter of the 16th instant meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. E. Ringuet,\nBursar,\nBishop's House,\nThe Pas, Man.\nJuly 31, 1943.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nWe take great pleasure in extending to you our sincere thanks for your intervention regarding additional train stops at education.\n\nHowever we regret to say that it is entirely impossible to have our freight unloaded at either Mileage 41.0 or Mileage 42.2 because there is no land road of any kind along the way of transportation between Education and Mileage 41.0. On the other hand the freighters for our school cannot reach Simon House or Mileage #2.2 by water road.\n\nTherefore to accept Mr. Myers' suggestion would mean to carry on their shoulders, from mile 41.0 to mile 39.0, the heavy bags or cases or whatever it might be. You agree with us that it cannot be done that way.\n\nWe are wondering if it could not be possible to have the freight unloaded at Simonhouse and have the section-man taking it to destination, mile 39, by gaz-car. We think that's the only way the situation can be help.\n\nAs you see the transportation of our school supply in summer is quite a problem chiefly today when the suppliers cannot guarantee delivery of goods for the time we ask for, that is rather in wintertime.\n\nHoping that something will be done to better the situation, we remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. Ringuet, OMI Bursar\nOttawa,\nAugust 5, 1943.\n\nEX'D.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn receipt of your letter of the 19th ultimo, regarding additional train stops on the Flin Flon Subdivision of the Canadian National Railway, I wrote to the management of the Guy Residential School and forwarded to them a copy of your letter. For your information I enclose a copy of their reply.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. F.J.

Episcopal Corporation of Keewatin\n\nE. Ringuest, OMI\nBursar.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nThe Principal of Guy Indian Residential School has pointed out to me that their steam boiler has never been inspected by the boiler inspector since it was installed. No doubt this is due to the fact that the school is in unorganized territory.\n\nI presume that if we want the boiler inspected we would have to apply to Regina for them to send an inspector and the Department would have to pay for the expense of the trip. I am not sure what this would cost. I think it advisable that we have the boiler inspected and I would request permission for me to write to Regina and request this service and also grant me authority to render to the Department the account for this service.\n\nS. Lovell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nAugust 31, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Lovell, Indian Agent, The Pas, Man.\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, with reference to the inspection of the steam boiler at the Guy Indian Residential School. Please communicate with the Provincial Boiler Inspector at Regina and ascertain if one of his officials will be in the vicinity of the Guy School in the near future. If none of their Inspectors make a regular trip to this vicinity you should also ascertain what it would cost to have one of the Inspectors make a special trip.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr Philip Phelan Esq Chief Training Division\n\nIn answer to your letter dated Aug 31st 1943, file No I32.7.5.\n\nI beg to advise that I received a letter from the Department of Public Works, Sask Steam Boilers Branch, regarding inspection of boilers at Guy Indian Residential School Sturgeon Landing. It stated that the cost for inspection would amount to $26.40 railway fare plus meals.\n\nI would appreciate authority to have this inspection made immediately as it is getting late in the season.\n\nS Levell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 7, 1943.\n\nMr. S.

This certificate is good until the boiler for which it has been issued is inspected for the following year.\nThe Secretary, Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nIt was brought to my attention when I last visited Guy Indian Residential School that the following repairs were urgently required.\n\nRepair for Kitchen Range.\n\nThe top of the range is dropping badly owing to a brace inside the top being broken. The Range is a Gurney Oxford, made by the Gurney Foundry Co. The number on the stove is No. 2030 F. Name on oven door \"John Bull\". The brace has no number but it is underneath the stove top next to the firebox to the right as one faces the stove. I believe the address of the Gurney Foundry Co. is Toronto, though there is nothing on the stove to indicate this. We would like this to be ordered and sent to the Guy Indian Residential School, Atik, Man.\n\nChildrens' Dining Room Tables\n\nThere are four tables in the Childrens' dining room. They are homemade and were formerly covered with battleship Linoleum. The linoleum has been worn out and there is none left, consequently it is impossible to keep the tables clean and sanitary as the food gets in between the boards of the table and it is impossible to get it out. They want the tables re-covered with battleship linoleum. That is 10 square yards of Linoleum. The cost of this at The Pas is about $3.00 per sq. yard. If battleship linoleum could not be procured, a heavy linoleum other than battleship would suffice.\n\nS.
