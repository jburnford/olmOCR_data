The slate roof is also in poor condition. The Indian Commissioner agrees with the Principal and he has submitted quotations from Webster Brothers, Abbotsford, British Columbia and from M.A. Girard and Sons, New Westminster, British Columbia. The quotations of Webster Brothers for material and labour is $1065.00 and is much less than the quotation received from the other firm. The Indian Commissioner recommends the acceptance of the quotation received from Webster Brothers and I would appreciate it if the Minister would give his approval so that the work may be done in the near future.\n\nThis is a church-owned school and funds were provided in the current years' appropriation.\n\nI enclose for your information the quotations mentioned above.\n\nAPPROVED\n\nEncl:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6470, file 890-5, part 6)\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, September 7, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nFather Fleury, the Reverend Principal of Mission Residential School, has called on me advising that a 60-quart dough mixer (No. 6012), which probably cost $800, has been discarded by Shaughnessy Military Hospital and replaced by a new machine as it required some minor repairs reportedly amounting from $150 to $175.00. It is the intention of the hospital authorities to have it \"boarded off\" their inventory as unserviceable. The Rev. Principal has stated that he can put this in repair and would like to have the Department purchase it for him. He considers that its outside sale value would be $600 and probably considerably less as it is now placed outside the building exposed to the weather, and deteriorating.\n\nI would recommend that contact be made with the Department of Veterans' Affairs for the transfer of this equipment to the school as I am informed that there is likely to be some keen competition for local purchase of the mixer.\n\nFor D.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nBFN/MDG\nAugust 12th, 1947.\n\nMr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSup't. Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have been advised about one week ago by Indian Commissioner, Major Mackay, that the Department has kindly authorized the sum of $2700.00 for repairs and equipment at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School for the current year. The sum of $1700 has been marked for repairs etc. and $1000 for the purchase of new equipment.\n\nIt appears from a survey of conditions at the school, that the cost of the minimum amount of repairs, urgently needed, will exceed $1700. These repairs are so necessary that I would like to have permission to use part of the $1000, marked for equipment, to take care of the repairs. There is indeed, much equipment that I would like to have, but the repairs are of a much more urgent nature. One item, for instance, covers repairs to our boilers. On a recent trip, the boiler inspector found that our laundry boiler needed retubing and our heating boiler required a new front. This represents about $300 that we did not expect. To give you an idea of how the money is proposed to be spent, I am listing below, our most urgent repairs with their cost:\n\n- Classroom partition...........$198.00\n- Linoleum in dining rooms.....$1100.00\n- Boiler repairs..................$10.00\n- Repairs to roof...............$50.00\n\nQuotations on the first two items have already been sent to the Indian Agent. I am at present working on the others. The classroom partition is indispensable. We have secured an extra teacher and I must\nnecessarily, provide her with a classroom. Our dining room floors are of soft wood. To keep them clean requires too much scrubbing. Covering these floors with linoleum now will give us long-wearing, easy to keep clean floors. If we let this work go for another year, we will have to renew the wood, even in order to lay linoleum. Moreover the work has to be completed before school opens. The boiler repairs speak for themselves. The roof of the main building is unsightly and long overdue for paint. This work was proposed to be done last year, but it was too late in the season for painting. I trust that this information will assist you in understanding our problem and the reason for my request.\n\nI might also mention that some time ago I applied through the Indian Agent for 24 desks for the senior classroom. Last year some of the pupils were using benches to sit on and tables instead of desks. Many others were uncomfortably crowded into old-fashioned double desks. Even last autumn I requested desks while on a visit to the Commissioner's office. At the time there was some hope of getting some that had been discarded by another school, but I never heard another word about them and we got along as best we could. Now, I understand that if we get these desks, recently ordered, the cost will be taken out of the new equipment grant. I was always under the impression that such equipment, so fundamental to a classroom, would be supplied by the department as school supplies. I would be glad to have your opinion on this matter.\n\nI would appreciate your reply by airmail as there is not much time left in which to make decisions about the above matters.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H.

Father Flurie,\nSt. Mary's Indian School,\nMission City, B.C.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nFollowing the inspection made by our Boiler Superintendent and the writer of your 36\" Vertical Boiler No. 44763-B.C., we beg to confirm our verbal quotation of $190.00 for the complete retubing of this boiler together with a new set of grates, new pop safety valve and the supplying of a new tube cleaner with rod. Our estimate includes sending men to Mission on Tuesday, August 12th for the purpose of disconnecting the boiler and removing the fittings and when repairs have been completed at our Factory, the services of our mechanics in again connecting up the boiler at your School. The boiler would be tested at our Plant under the supervision of a B.C. Boiler Inspector so that you may obtain the highest possible Working Pressure.\n\nIt is our understanding that your truck would take care of transporting the boiler from Mission to our Plant and return and that there would be help available at the School for loading and unloading.\n\nWe greatly appreciate your instructions to proceed and the work will be carried out with all possible speed. Thanking you, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPATTERSON BOILER WORKS LIMITED.\n\nManager.\n\nF.J.Walker/gcr\nAugust 16th, 1947.\n\nMr. J. Gillett,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett;\n\nI am enclosing in triplicate, a quotation of the Patterson Boiler Works, Vancouver, B.C. covering the retubing of our laundry boiler and other repairs as stated on the quotation. We were instructed to have this work done by the government boiler inspector.\n\nInasmuch as this work had to be done in the shortest possible time, I found it impossible to secure any quotation other than this one from the Patterson Boiler Works. At first a tentative quotation of $523.00 was made by the Company. However, after the boiler was dismantled at the school and a thorough examination made, it was found that certain parts were intact that might have been found faulty; consequently, an amended quotation of $490.00 was submitted. Considering the size of the job, I have found the Patterson Company to be most co-operative and anxious to help us in this emergency.\n\nI would be very grateful if you would arrange for the approval of this work as soon as possible. It is imperative that there be speedy action taken if we are to have the laundry in operation for the opening of school.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H.

Also find enclosed receipt for sum of $280.00 as part payment from St. Mary's School on above bill.\n\nThis was a repair that was badly needed and most urgent. To allow the machine to remain in its broken condition would have endangered the lives of the Sisters and the children working in the Laundry. To wait for repairs to be made would have held up our laundry for weeks and at the same time added many hours of extra labour and heavy labour upon the children. I felt that the only thing to do was to get the work done at once. Through the U and I Tinner I had the repairs done and the machine working in four days.\n\nI am asking therefore, that this bill of $454.00 come out of the grant for expenditures and repairs, and that payment be made as follows: a refund of $280.00 to St. Mary's School and a payment of a further $174.00 to the U and I Tinner, listed herein.\n\nI received sometime ago, an OK for an expenditure of some $800.00 for wash basins and new toilets. As I find now that delivery of these cannot be promised or assured, I would ask that this expenditure be cancelled.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(sgd) John W. Hennessy OMI\nW. S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B. C.\n\nAttached are vouchers No. 924 and 925, in favour of U and I Tanners and St. Mary's Indian Residential School, amounting to $174.00 and $280.00, respectfully, for repairs to laundry extract basket. As this matter was urgent, the principal had the work done without seeking authority.\n\nIt will be noted by his letter which is attached, that he will not be purchasing the basins and toilets which were authorized. If in order, that grant could be used to take care of the amounts in the two vouchers attached.\n\nI recommend that this be approved.\n\nJ.

This was a Vancouver Agency Voucher.\n\nIn a recent letter from Indian Commissioner Arneil, he claims that the firm states they have not received payment of this account. Please let me know when this account is paid.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDear Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: New Westminster voucher #924, St. Mary's Residential School\n\nNo doubt you have already taken the above matter up with the Department; however, in the absence of any advice from Ottawa, we are writing again at the insistence of the Manager of the U. & I. Timers, in whose favour the above mentioned voucher was made. The gentleman in question now calls daily at this office enquiring regarding payment of his account which, as you will recall, was submitted last September.\n\nWe should very much appreciate some advice regarding the disposition of this account as we can offer no explanation to the Company as to the reason for the delay in payment nor why no reply has been received to our written enquiries. Any information concerning this matter would be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW. J. McGregor\nRegional Supervisor\n\nW.S.

BOX 494,\nMISSION CITY, B.C.\n\nMay 31st 1949\n\nMr. J. Gillett\nSupt. Indian Agency\nNew Westminster B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett:\n\nIn reply to your request I am listing below the estimates for repairs and equipment for St. Mary's Indian Residential School for this year.\n\nA. A needed piece of equipment for Laundry is a Tumbler Dryer. Lack of drying space plus weather conditions here at Coast makes drying of clothes a long tedious job. Estimated cost of Dryer is about $700.00\n\nB. Likewise needed in Laundry is a Rotary Washer. Present equipment is old and worn and much too small to serve needs of 210 children. Machines are set in motion at 6.30 in morning and work is not completed until 5 at night. Estimated cost of Washer $1000.00\n\nC. Floors in both Laundry and Drying Room are badly worn. Can no longer be repaired and keep both rooms cold. Estimated cost of rough flooring (work to be done by School) is about $150.00\n\nD. Toilet facilities are poor in Boys building especially in the Dormitory, where 8 toilets must serve 105 boys. Also some repairs and replacements are needed for present toilets in Boys and girls buildings. Estimated cost of new equipment and repairs about $250.00\n\nE. There are many repairs to be made to Buildings and Classrooms. Girls Building is looking shabby and trim must be painted; floor in Sewing Room should be sanded and oiled at once; some inside painting and repairs to Girls Building; also two classrooms to be painted inside and out. We would supply the labour for this work; estimated cost of materials about $500.00\n\nFrom your recent visit and inspection of School, I am sure that you will agree that these repairs and equipment are urgently needed, both as an economic measure and for health and wellbeing of the children.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6470, file 890-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nW.

As you are aware, our present gymnasium is but a converted root cellar. Its floor space, and its ceiling height are woefully inadequate to cope with the needs of some 102 boys and 112 girls. Gymnastic sports contribute much to the health and morale of a school. Here on the Coast, where the winter season and early spring are damp and wet, a gymnasium is most essential. And here at St. Mary's, where the efforts of a loyal and courageous staff, have built up a very fine health and physical education programme, a gymnasium is in order, as the Department has turned down repeated requests in the past to build a new gymnasium and auditorium. I would ask that a grant in aid to enlarge present gymnasium be made. At the cost of $800.00, a new floor could be laid in the gymnasium, a makeshift stage be removed which occupies much floor space, and a leanto be built onto the end of the gymnasium which would serve the needs of a stage or auditorium. For a stage we must have to carry on the plays and concerts which are a part and necessary part of any school. In connection with this request and in proof of the fine physical education programme established here, four of the older girls and three of the older boys are able to take complete charge of the physical training required by the B.C. curriculum. Further I believe St. Mary's is one of the few Indian Schools having an Indian boy graduate as full time P.T. instructor on its staff.\n\nI feel therefore that this request deserves the earnest consideration of your Department, who I know are keenly interested in the furtherment of health and physical programmes in the Schools.\n\nVery Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn W.

Gillett  \nBupt. Indian Agency  \nBox 280  \nNew Westminster B.C.\n\nDecember 1st 1949\n\nDear Mr. Gillett:\n\nLast week our laundry mangle burnt out. Upon enquiry I find that it is beyond repair, this machine being over 30 years in use. The loss of the Mangle is an added burden to the already difficult task of washing and laundry. Not only does it prolong this task many hours, it adds much extra work upon the children. For this Mangle does the work of twenty hand irons. Due to our full day class programme all washing must be done on Saturday. I feel this task should be made as simple and quick as possible in order to give the children engaged some relaxation after a full weeks class. I am therefore enclosing in duplicate a quotation on a new Mangle, from a leading and reliable Agency in Vancouver. I respectfully ask that this expenditure be authorized from grant made to St. Mary's School for repairs and expenditures during present year.\n\nHoping that you will do all possible to help realize this needed purchase, I remain\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJohn W. Hennessy  \nPrincipal\nW.S. Arneil, Esq., Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached is a letter in duplicate from Rev. Father Hennessy, Principal of St. Mary's School, regarding the worn-out ironer. Apparently it cannot be repaired.\n\nI recommend that favourable consideration be given to the purchase of a new one. Up to the present there has been $2,068.29 expended on repairs and equipment for the current year.

BOX 494,\nMISSION CITY, B.C.\n\nJune 14th 1950\n\nMr. J. Gillett\nSupt. Indian Agency\nNew Westminster B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett:\n\nIn reply to your enquiry re estimates for needed repairs and equipment at St. Mary's School, I submit the following:\n\n1). New Washing Machine for Laundry:\nPresent washing machines are badly worn and impossible to repair or keep in order. Further they are too small for the work at hand, having only together a capacity of 70 lbs dry wash. This results in a long and tiring day for the children, sometimes carrying well into the evening. I enclose quotation from Stanley Brock Co., for washing machine with capacity of 115 lbs dry wash, motor driven at price of $125.00, f.o.b. Mission. This seems an excellent machine and should cut washing time by 30% or more.\n\n2). Paint for Classrooms etc.\nPaint is needed for Grades 5, 6, 7, 8, classrooms, both inside and out. For trim on Convent and Dining room building; fire-escapes badly rusted; one staff room in convent; bathrooms in boys and girls buildings. I submit estimate from reliable firm in Mission City and also from firm in Vancouver; one for $97.00, and the other for $37.00.\n\n3). Flooring for Dormitories.\nCondition of floor in Junior and Midget Dormitory is poor. Floor is badly worn, very hard to keep clean and impossible to paint. The only remedy seems to be a new floor. I enclose quotations from two firms in Mission. One for $208.00, and the other for $420.00.\n\n4). New Stoker for Hot Water System.\nI enclose quotation for new Stoker for Hot water, already installed, through kind permission of the Department, when old Stoker broke down. Cost of Stoker installed is $35.00.\n\nI will forward estimates for Sports equipment; leather for Craftwork; boiler repairs as demanded by Inspector; needed toilet repairs as soon as received.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nJohn Whiteman\nPrincipal\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6470, file 890-5, part 7)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nW.

Ltd., $1405.00. no competitor.\n\n(2) Paint for Classrooms, etc.\nI recommend that the tender of Alanson Paint Co., Mission, in the amount of $297.46, be accepted. It is $30.52 less than the tender of International Varnish Company Ltd., Vancouver, in the amount of $327.98.\n\n(3) Flooring for dormitories\nTenders from Campbell Builders Supplies Ltd. and Douglas Lumber Co. Ltd., both of Mission, B.C. in the amounts of $408.00 and $420.00 respectively. I recommend that the tender of Campbell Builders Supplies Ltd. be accepted.\n\nThe work outlined above is necessary and I recommend that it be approved providing sufficient funds are available for this year. If it is approved, the total, including the stoker recently installed, will amount to $2545.46.\n\nJ.

O. BOX 666\nVICTORIA, B.C., May 2, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nCould you kindly inform me as to the prospects for the building of a new school at Mission at an early date to replace the old one? I am asking this for the reason that the accommodation for manual training at present is very poor and if a new school is not to be built this year, then I think we ought to put up another outside building to be used for manual training purposes. The outside class room recently erected would be admirably suitable as a manual training room when not required for class room work, but if there is no hope of getting a new school started during the present year, then, as above stated, I feel it would be advisable to erect another outside building for manual training purposes which would cost approximately $1,000.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWED/KD.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 11, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nI have your 15/9/14345 of the 2nd instant, with reference to a manual training building at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School. There are no funds available for a new school this year, and, as the matter of a site has not been definitely settled, I believe we should not consider any capital expenditure. You might inform the Reverend Principal that a temporary arrangement should be made for the manual training activity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nW. E.

I understand that only temporary arrangements can be made, until a suitable building is provided. The Department wishes to know how much material would be needed this year and whether instruction is being given by a member of the staff or if it will be necessary to engage a special teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. A.G. Jamieson, Manual Training Instructor at Chilliwack, could be sent five times or twice a week.\n\nA room now used as a dormitory for workmen could be used for the purpose.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev. Ed. Maillard\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 890-11, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, October 9, 1929.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter with reference to manual training activity at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School. The Department is, of course, aware of the disadvantages under which you are operating at the present time, and I now write to enquire if you believe it advisable to make an effort along manual training lines this winter. If you feel that the difficulties are too great in your present quarters, the work will have to be postponed until the new building is ready for occupation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

McLean\nAss't Deputy Secretary\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nTo your letter No. 153-1-11, Oct 9th, I beg to reply that under the present conditions, it would be advisable to postpone the manual activity at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School until suitable quarters be provided.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nRev. Ed. Maillard\nO.M.D.\nSt. Mary's Residential School\n\nMission City, B.C.\nSeptember 30th, 1930.\n\nDuncan M. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to report that I have taken over St. Mary's Residential School from Reverend E. Maillard, and have commenced the School year with a full pupil list. In addition, we have forty applications which we cannot accept for want of accommodation.\n\nAs you are perhaps aware, I have been a Field Missionary in this territory for some time, and have a thorough local knowledge of all the Reserves our pupils are drawn from, which will, I hope, be of advantage in my present capacity of Principal.\n\nIt is my most earnest wish to co-operate with the Department in the fullest possible manner, and to carry out the views for Indian education laid down. To do this effectually, however, I feel that I must draw your attention to the condition of the School buildings, and the urgent need there is of a new School.\n\nI know of course, and thoroughly appreciate the efforts you have made to have this carried out and in opening the matter afresh, I merely wish to add my mite to the weight of evidence prepared by the Department in support of the undertaking.\n\nApart altogether from the deplorable living conditions we have to contend with in the dormitory portions of the School, I would stress the fact that the Laundry became so dangerous the late Principal was obliged to erect a new building at a cost to the School of $1,032.00. This work was performed in such manner that it can be moved later on and applied to some suitable purpose.\n\nAt the present moment there is no building for Manual Training and as the School has already undertaken, in connection with the laundry, all the expense its finances will bear this year, I would most urgently ask that the Department assist us to this extent, in order that the Training Course may be commenced under flight conditions, as my finances will not admit of the construction of a proper building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.J. Fahlman.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo and I note, with satisfaction, that you are grappling with the problems that confront you at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School. The provision of a manual training building will have to stand until funds can be provided for the purpose. If you will repeat your request next May, if funds are available, the Department will give favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. T. J. Fahlman, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School,\nMission City, B. C.\nSt. Mary's Residential School\n\nMission City, B.C.\n\nJanuary 23rd, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nUnder date of February 20th, 1929, Mr. W.E. Ditchburn, Indian Commissioner for B.C., sent a Manual Training Equipment to this School and at the same time addressed a letter of instructions to the late Principal.\n\nNothing, however, was done at that time, but I have now completed arrangements for the immediate commencement of the Manual Training Course and I note in the instructions of the Commissioner, that a book on Manual Training and also a set of Job Sheets, such as are used in the Public Schools Manual Training Rooms, will be furnished from Ottawa.\n\nI can find no record of these ever having been received, and I shall be much obliged if you will forward them to me at your very early convenience, in order that the training of the children may not be further delayed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.J. Fahlman, O.M.I.\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, February 6th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd ultimo, I beg to say that the Department is forwarding to you, under separate cover, one copy of the Teacher's Manual on \"Manual Training\", also, a set of \"Job Sheets in Woodworking\".\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. J. Fahlman, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Mary's Mission Res. School,\nMission City, B. C.\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to inform you that the new Principal of St. Mary's Mission Residential School, Reverend T.J. Fallman, has taken steps to install Manual Training at that Institution, and will commence classes on the 1st of March next.\n\nI presume it will be in order for the Reverend Principal to requisition each quarter for a Grant, based upon $500.00 per annum towards the payment of the Instructor.\n\nWe had great difficulty in getting a suitable person for the position, but have now made arrangements for a young man to take over the duties on the above date.\n\nIf he proves satisfactory, as we have reason to suppose he will, the Reverend Principal will have him take the Course in Manual Training during the Summer, and include him on his regular staff.\n\nI would, therefore, strongly recommend that the Grant be allowed the Reverend Principal as in other Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 23, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, informing the Department that the Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School will begin manual training classes at that school on the last proximo, and that he has arranged for an instructor to take over the duties on that date.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the Department will allow a grant at the rate of $40 per teaching month towards the salary of the instructor. This grant will be paid to the Principal of the School upon receipt of vouchers, in duplicate, properly certified, for the salary due the instructor at the above rate. These vouchers should be forwarded by you at the end of each quarter.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state the full name of the man engaged as instructor in manual training at this school and also particulars as to his qualifications and experience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. G. N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster,\nB.C.\nSIR:-\n\nIn reply to your letter dated 23rd of February, File No.153-1-11, I beg to inform you that the name of the temporary instructor in manual training engaged at the St. Mary's Mission Residential School, is James McCurrach of New Westminster, B.C.\n\nAs regards his qualifications, these are practical rather than technical, as he has been working with contracting carpenters right along. Owing to the depression at present existing he is filling in his time at Mission, and so far has given every satisfaction. I need hardly point out that it is extremely difficult to obtain an instructor without paying him accordingly, and Mission School is absolutely unable to do so at present.\n\nI hired the man myself and sent him there at $50.00 a month and board, in order that the regulations of the Department regarding manual training might be carried out. The School will board him, but they have no money to do it now, therefore, really think the Department should allow $50.00 for this service under the circumstances. If this man stays he will take the technical training course in the summer, and come in line with other Instructors employed by the Department, but for the time being this is the only arrangements possible to make.\n\nWhile upon this subject, I would most earnestly draw the attention of the Department to the absolute necessity of a new School at Mission. Years have gone by since it was first promised, and I would like to remind the Department that were it not for this promise, the Reverend J. Duplanil, now at Kamloops School, would have repaired Mission School, so that it would have been safe for a good many years to come.\n\nThis Winter has passed without any catastrophe on account of its extreme mildness, but I absolutely refuse to assume any responsibility for anything that may happen to the School and pupils in future. I have warned the Department time after time, and feel that I have done all I can in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR.C.M.

The qualifications which he possesses have been noted.\n\nThe amount of the grant that this Department can provide towards the salary of the manual training instructor will be as stated in official letter of the 23rd ultimo, viz.: $40 per teaching month. This is the same rate as allowed for similar services at other Indian residential schools. The Principal should arrange to pay the instructor each month, obtaining a receipt, and an account, in duplicate, for the amount due in reimbursing the Principal, should be forwarded at the end of each six months period. This account should be forwarded through your office and be certified by you. Our funds are extremely limited, and the above is the full amount we can provide each month towards payment of the salary of the manual training instructor.\n\nYou will receive a further communication regarding the condition of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Having compared it with others, and having regard for the quality of lumber handled by this Company, I think the price is fair and just.

Sept., 19th, 1934\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSome time ago I sent in to our Agent a requisition for Technical School material,\u2014the carpentry department. In the last fourteen months with all the building program here I have used a great deal of lumber which I bought from the Alberta Lumber Company in Vancouver after I had found their prices better than those submitted by the local lumber yard, the Maple Ridge and the Fraser Mills Companies. Quite naturally when setting prices for this requisition I went to them and mentioned my need to procure the materials on the list. They figured on it and it was their figure I sent with my requisition.\n\nYesterday I received a letter from the Agent stating that he had received authority to make the purchase, and adding that the purchase should be made from a firm on the approved list. He gives a list of the approved concerns and I find that the \"Alberta\" is not on it. Now, I had no knowledge of the existence of such a list; I had no political reason for dealing where I dealt, my reason was an economic one solely. Neither do I know the strictness of the necessity of adhering to this list, and therefore I make the request that permission be granted in this case to purchase this material from the Alberta Lumber Company.\n\nThis Company has been very obliging to me in every way; their service has been above reproach and the quality of their lumber unexcelled, and they have been especially considerate in allowing me credit. For these reasons and for the fact that I unwittingly acquainted them of our immediate and urgent need of this material and obtained their prices, I would appreciate it as a personal favour if I were allowed to put the little deal through with them. Should the permission be refused me, I fear my credit with this Company to which I am very considerably indebted may be adversely affected.\n\nTrusting that this matter will not give you too much trouble, and hoping for an early reply, I remain,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, September 26, 1934.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, I beg to say that purchases of material for which this Department provides the funds must be made from firms on the approved list.\n\nIn the case of material required for the manual training classes at the St. Mary's Residential School, you should be guided by the instructions given by the Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Sept., 24th., 1934\n\nMr. A.O'M. Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt:\n\nI am enclosing herewith requisition in triplicate for some sewing-room material required by the Girls for the current year.\n\nIn the past we have not, I believe, sent requisitions for this material, but have paid for it out of the per capita grant. I see no reason, however, why we should have done so; articles of this sort are just as technical in nature for the girls as are hammers, saws, and so forth for the boys, and they should, it seems to me be provided for us from the B.C. Special Grant. I would, therefore, appreciate it if you would be so good as to forward the requisitions for acceptance by the Department.\n\nThe little girl about whom I wrote to you a few days ago was left here by her aunt the day after I wrote, and regarding the leaving it seemed I had no choice. The Aunt simply said that she was not going to try any longer to raise her own and other peoples' children, and to prove that she meant it, off she walked.\n\nThe alteration program is fast drawing to a close. As soon as it is completely finished I shall let you know, and I hope you will favour us with a visit.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nINDIAN OFFICE\nNEW WESTMINSTER\nSEP. 25 1934\nSIR:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith a request received from Reverend A.D.M. Gillen, Principal of St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, for material to be used in the sewing room, for the purpose of giving the girls instruction along domestic lines.\n\nI have obtained local quotations for the articles specified in the requisition, and find that the order would amount to $99.40.\n\nI am aware that there appears to be a difference in the interpretation of technical training as applied to boys and girls, but I must say from a common sense point of view, I am very much in agreement with the Reverend Principal, whom he points out that such training as he now indicates for the girls, is every bit as important to their future home life, as is the purchase of tools for the manual training for the boys. A number of Indian women now keep their homes together by the manufacture of baskets, rugs, sweaters etc., and I would recommend that the Department give this request every consideration possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O'N. Daunt.\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n1-8-A.\n\nOttawa, October 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from the Rev. Principal of the St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, requesting the supplying of sewing material for use in the sewing room, for the purpose of giving the girls instruction along domestic lines, and enclosing a list of the materials required.\n\nIn reply I have to say it is not the policy of the Department to provide materials of this nature for use at Indian residential schools, and I therefore regret that the purchase of the articles requested cannot be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Ft. 2x4, taken for example, was as follows:\n320 Lin.Ft. 2x4 - 8/20' # 1x2 Clear Fir $45 - $14!\nThis does not mean that 8 pieces 20' long were shipped, but is a lumbermen's term meaning that 320 Lin. Ft. made up of different lengths between 8 and 20' were shipped. This term is used to differentiate from 3/7', which means 3' to 7' only, and takes a different price range.\n\nTo make the invoice more clear for the Department at Ottawa we have made up a copy showing the number of pieces and the lengths of each item shipped from our tally cards.\n\nWe trust this will be satisfactory and in future will be careful to show all details when making invoices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRELIANCE LUMBER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nper.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 17th of November, without reference number, under cover of which you returned to me Agency Voucher No.611 for the sum of $186.15, in favour of the Reliance Lumber Company, Limited, and covering material supplied to St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School for manual training purposes.\n\nI have taken this up with the Reliance Lumber Company, and am enclosing a letter of explanation, together with copies of the account giving full details, and showing that the original amount was correct.\n\nThe vouchers, in question, are also returned herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

In view of this, the Department will be prepared to increase the grant allowed towards the salary of the manual training instructor, as from September first, next, by the sum of $10.00 per month. This will make the grant allowed from that date at the rate of $60 per month. Please inform the Principal accordingly.\n\nYou should prepare and forward vouchers, in the usual manner, at the end of each quarter, for the grant at the increased rate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th inst. regarding\nthe order placed by the Department with McLenman, McFeely & Prior\nLtd. of Vancouver for equipment for the manual training class\nof this School. I received the purchase order, which you forwarded\nto me on November 28, and have checked the articles as they have\nbeen delivered to us.\n\nThe reason why I have not yet forwarded to the Department\nthe invoices which the Company has sent to me is that the order\nhas not yet been completely filled. I received invoices dated\nDec. 6th, 7th, 17th, 21st, Jan. 4th. Of the articles received\nand listed on those invoices I had to report shortages. On Dec. 6th,\nthe Company wrote me saying that five items would be sent later,\nsome in December and the remainder in January. To date three of\nthose have not been delivered. I do not know what has been the cause\nof the long delay. I will go to see the Company personally on my\nnext trip to Vancouver in a few days and when all the goods have\nbeen delivered and the invoices received I will send the latter to\nyou properly checked and certified.\n\nMay I take this occasion to thank you personally for the\nspecial Grant allowed by the Department for the re-construction\nof the water reservoir for the School. The work was very ably\ncarried out by the contractor Mr. W.H. Swan of Hatzic B.C.

Father O'Grady has been transferred to the Kamloops school and I have taken the matter up with him and he advises me as follows, regarding the equipment referred to in your letter.\n\nYou will note on the original purchase order the items, one drill press and one mortising attachment, are requested as complete, thus necessarily covering the chisels, bits and bushings, which are essential for the operating of these machines. McLennan, McFeely & Prior did not send these pieces with the equipment and naturally Father O'Grady advised them so, with the consequence that they were delivered. The fact that they were not included in the other account appears to be due to an oversight on the part of the firm, since they should be quite aware of the fact that the drill press and the mortising attachment are unoperable without the chisels etc. If you will kindly refer to our requisition you will note that these items were requested inasmuch as they were asked for complete.\n\nOn the invoice copy, which I am enclosing for your convenience in re-checking this matter there are two items which do not enter into the question. The #9547 4-step cone pulley, which, although necessary, may be excluded and the #976 chisel holder, which is cancelled by a credit note. The other items, without exception, are essential operating parts of the drill press and the mortising attachment and consequently I feel that I am justified in referring this matter again to you. My opinion is that the firm of McLennan, McFeely & Prior are at fault, inasmuch as they did not recognize from the original requisition that the drill press and the mortising attachment were requested as complete.\nI trust that the above information will be of service in taking this matter up with the firm.\n\nVery Sincerely Yours,\n\nA.

If this were added to the Valley Lumber Yard's quotation, their quotation would still be lower by $17.98.\n\nIf funds are available for the purpose, I would recommend that the material be purchased from the firm giving the lowest tender, particularly as they are in a position to supply the required Plywood on which the other firm is unable to quote. Also that authority be given to purchase 500' of 1\" x 14\" lumber from some other source at a cost of approximately $40.00.\n\nI enclose Mr. Indian Agent Daunt's letter of the 7th instant and quotations from the above mentioned firms.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nEnclos.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, the following quotations for Manual Training Lumber required at St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School:\n\nValley Lumber Yards Limited ------------------ $247.30\n\nAlberta Lumber Company, Limited --------------- $289.48.\n\nYou will note two discrepancies in these quotations. The Alberta Lumber Company quote on 500 feet 1 x 14, #2 Clear and Better D.D., whereas the Valley Lumber Yards substitute 300 feet of 1\u00bd x 12, No. 1 and 2 Clear D.D. Also the Valley Lumber Yards submit a quotation on Hemlock Ply-Wood, whereas the Alberta Lumber Company say they cannot quote as the Government has taken over the entire production.\n\nI am attaching a letter from the Reverend Principal in which he recommends that the ply-wood portion of the order amounting to $14.30 be purchased from the Valley Lumber Yards Limited, and the remainder of the supplies obtained from the Alberta Lumber Company, Limited. I do not know whether this can be arranged, but I am passing the matter to you for your decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nH.O.N. Daunt,\nIndian Agent.\n\nEnclos.\n\nMajor D.M.

Daunt,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Daunt;\n\nI am enclosing quadruplicate copies of quotations on manual training lumber, from the Alberta Lumber Co. and the Valley Lumber Co.\n\nI prefer the quotation from the Alberta Lumber Co. inasmuch as they will supply the 1x14 and 1\u00bdx12 lumber which is essential for our manual training needs. Their quotation appears higher, but this is due to the fact that they quote on this lumber, whereas the other firm does not. The lumber that we have received from them in the past has always been very satisfactory. However, the Alberta Lumber Co. cannot supply any ply-wood, so I would suggest that, if possible, the ply-wood be ordered from the Valley Co. in the amount of $14.30, as contained in their letter and noted on the quotation sheets.\n\nI would be pleased if you would kindly give this matter your immediate attention, as we are completely out of manual training material.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H.

In your detail, you show \"account rendered at $109.80\" and in this total is included the amount of $28.20. Then you show Inv. 83087 = $24.48. You will see from this that our Inv. 83087 has, therefore, been paid twice and your account is now overpaid by $28.20. Kindly advise us if you desire us to forward our cheque for this overpayment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMARSHALL-WELLS B.C.

Limited\n\nWe have your letter of the 16th inst., re the above noted cheque and informing us that an overpayment of $28.20 has been made.\n\nThe items covered in the payment above were authorized by Purchase Order 29061A dated March 1, 1944 of which you will doubtless still have a copy. Please note that the first item was for 6 #4 Bailey Smooth planes at $4.05 - $24.30 and the second for 6 #5 Bailey Jack planes at $4.70 - $28.20. Invoice #84661-2 etc. - $109.80 included an item of 6#5 Bailey Jack Planes at $4.70 - $28.20. Invoice #83087 was invoiced originally for the same item but was changed to read 6 #4 Bailey Smooth planes at $4.05 - $24.30.\n\nSince both items were listed in the Purchase Order and the school principal and our agent certified that they had been received payment was made as rendered.\n\nHowever if your shipments included only 6 planes will you please forward to the undersigned a refund of $28.20 in the name of the Receiver General of Canada to adjust the overpayment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMarshall-Wells B.C.

Seniors follow department course as far as possible; are trained in the use of planes, saw hammer; also on wood lathe and drill press. They assist in the construction of small buildings; measuring and estimating lumber; mixing concrete, etc. Juniors are trained in the use and care of tools; their purpose; and do simple operations in construction of small articles.\n\nCobbling: About twelve boys are trained in the cobbling shop, learning to repair shoes and leather articles. So far this year they have repaired about two hundred pairs of shoes.\n\nStationary Engineering: Six chosen boys work with the school engineer learning the operation and maintenance of boilers. Emphasis is laid on safety and the correct reading of gauges.\n\nDairying: The boys excel in this work and are trained thoroughly in the care and upkeep of dairy cattle. Our junior Calf Club won the B.C. Trophy last fall.\n\nFarming: Boys are given a complete course in all branches of farming; care and use of farm machinery, rotation of crops, etc.\n\nLogging: Older boys assist in simple logging operations, mainly to emphasize safety methods as many of them find work when they graduate in logging camps. In spite of the high accident rate in these camps, not one of our boys has been injured since these instructions started.\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nMISSION, B.C.\nJuly 9th, 1945.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING ACCOUNT\n\nApril 50.00\nMay 50.00\nJune 50.00\n\n$150.00\n\nA.H.

March 14th, 1946.\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nNew Westminster Agency,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nTo further the technical training at the St. Mary's Indian Residential School, we are in need of several pieces of equipment, such as a forge and acetylene welding kit. At the present time our technical training has been mostly limited to woodworking as we had no equipment or tools for metal work. Moreover I had no competent instructor. I have been fortunate in securing the services of a highly trained man, who is in a position to instruct our senior boys in blacksmithing and welding. He is a former employee of the school and now a returned soldier. While in the army he completed several courses in metal work and I am anxious that he begin his instructions to the boys as soon as possible. This training should be of great value to the Indian boys; fitting them for employment and enabling them to do their own repair work at home. Eventually we would need additional equipment for the School shop, but for the present, to get things started, we have immediate need of the two above items. Since the Department has always shown such a keen interest in the technical training of the boys, I would request that they purchase the forge and welding kit for use in training the boys. The following prices for immediate delivery have been secured from the Marshall Wells Co. Vancouver, B.C.\n\n1- Welding outfit with Cutter........ 113.30\n1- Blacksmith forge #0728H.......... 35.25\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nA.H. Fleury, O.M.I., Principal.\nNEW WESTMINSTER, B.C.\nMarch 15th, 1946.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI beg to forward you herewith, a letter, in duplicate, received from Reverend A.H. Fleury, Principal of St. Mary's Indian Residential School, in which he requests the Department to supply the School with a Welding Outfit and Blacksmith Forge.\n\nTraining in blacksmithing and welding should be valuable to the pupils of the School, and I would recommend the purchase by the Department.\n\nI understand that the Reverend Principal discussed this matter with you on a recent visit to your office.\n\nJ.D. Caldwell,\nActing Indian Agent.\n\nEnc.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Acting Agent Caldwell's letter of March 15th and letter dated March 14th from the Principal, St. Mary's Residential School, in connection with the proposed supply of a welding outfit and blacksmith forge, for technical training at the school. I agree with the Principal's views with respect to the value of such training and concur in the Agent's recommendation that this equipment be supplied. The estimated cost is approximately $150.00 and the expenditure could be made a charge against the Technical Education division of the B.C. Special Vote of 1946-47 fiscal year.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncl.\nOttawa, March 27, 1946.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant,\nenclosing a request from the Principal of the St. Mary's\nMission Residential School for certain pieces of equipment.\n\nThe Department has no objection to the\npurchase of the blacksmith forge, because even younger boys\ncan make some use of this. However, after giving the matter\nvery careful consideration, we cannot see our way clear to\nauthorizing the acetylene welding outfit. There are few, if\nany, boys in this school over 16 years of age, and we feel\nthat it would be hazardous to allow young children to use\nsuch an outfit.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSt. Mary's Residential School\n\nMission City, B.C.\n\nMANUAL TRAINING ACCOUNT:\n\nJanuary $50.00\nFebruary 50.00\nMarch 50.00\n\n$150.00\n\nMarch 30th, 1946.\n\nA.H.

Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan;\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet visited our school some months ago, he was greatly impressed by our course in automotive and farm mechanics. This course is given to selected older pupils and has produced great results. Our instructor is a well qualified man, a veteran of the last war, who specialized in mechanics while in the army. We have found that the boys take exceptional interest in this work, and I believe it to be of the highest practical value to them.\n\nTo obtain the services of our instructor we have had to pay him a good monthly salary. This has added greatly to the costs of running the school, but the results were so beneficial that I hesitated to stop the course. Mr. Doucet felt that in view of what was being accomplished in this vocational field, the Department would be interested enough to provide a monthly sum to help cover the instructor's salary. The instructor is at present being paid at the rate of $175.00 monthly; I would respectfully request that the Department provide a monthly sum of $100.00 as their share. Furthermore, I would request the sum of $850.00 to repair and extend the building where the mechanics course is being given. It is much too small and requires a cement floor. I would be very pleased if you would take this matter up with Mr. Doucet and then take the necessary steps to have my requests granted. Please let me hear from you at your earliest convenience.\n\nVery sincerely,\n\nJ.W. Hennessy, O.M.I., Principal.\nJuly 2nd, 1948\n\nMr. P.

As this form seems to deal solely with the duties of a Manual Trainor, you will notice that certain qualifications mentioned therein have been disregarded, as not applying to the job in question. I have tried to the best of my ability to give a faithful and true statement of Mr. Veres ability and qualification. The course he has been giving the boys has been both popular and practical. Mechanics is a type of trade that appeals to our Indian boys and for which they have a natural ability. One of the boys who took the course last year has remained with us this summer in order to improve his knowledge of the work. Another has obtained work in a garage at Lillooet.\n\nAll in all I feel that this is a course of training that will be of great help to many of the boys, in the choosing of a career for the future.\n\nThanking you for your interest and encouragement in this matter,\n\nI remain\nSincerely yours\nJohn W Hennessy OMI\nPrincipal\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nP.O.

Hennessy, Principal of the above-mentioned school, requesting an increase in the grant towards the salaries of the instructors employed for vocational training.\n\nInspector Davey has reported favourably on the work of the Instructor conducting the course in Farm Mechanics and feels that this type of work is of considerable value to the pupils who are enrolled at this residential school. It is also understood that Mr. Doucet has seen this class in operation and was favourably impressed. In addition to the Farm Mechanics course, instruction is also given in Carpentry.\n\nIt would appear that the request of the Reverend Principal is most reasonable and I would recommend that the grant of $50.00 per month now being paid by the Department be increased to $100.00 per month.\n\nW.S.

Gillett\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency\nNew Westminster B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Gillett:\n\nOne of the most popular and beneficial courses conducted here in School, is the course in Farm Mechanics. This course is given to a selected group of the older pupils in Grades 7, 8, 9. Our instructor, Mr. T. Veres, a veteran of the last war, holds a Master Mechanics rating, with 12 years experience in Automotive Mechanics, Welding, and Tinsmithing. He has been at the school for 10 years or more, and so knows the Indian boys. The Course followed is that outlined by the Programme of Studies for Industrial Arts in Junior High.\n\nTo obtain the services of our instructor we have had to pay him a good monthly salary. This has added to the costs of running the School. The results have been so beneficial, the Course so interesting and Practical, the vocational training so well adapted to the natural ability of Indian boys, that I feel the Course merits every encouragement. At present, the instructor is being paid at the rate of $75.00 monthly. I would respectfully request that the Department provide a monthly sum of $100.00 as their share. In view of the fact that the monthly grant for Manual Training only partly covers cost of salary for same, I feel the sum requested for the Farm Mechanics Course is not extravagant. I would be very pleased if you would take this matter up with Mr. Arneil so that necessary steps may be taken for granting of my request.\n\nHoping this matter be brought to a satisfactory issue,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nJohn W.

Your file 8-11-6 (153)\n\nOwing to the absence of Mr. Doucet from Head Office on Departmental business, we have been delayed in making a reply to your letter of April 1st regarding the requisitions you forwarded for home economics supplies at the above school.\n\nYour letter does not state if the school has a teacher suitably qualified for teaching this subject. We do not want to discourage teaching home economics at this school, but we feel that the above information should have been supplied and that we should have been informed regarding the room that is available for the home economics class.\n\nIn order not to delay the matter unnecessarily, it has been decided to authorize an expenditure not exceeding $200.00 for equipment. We feel that this amount should be sufficient for a start, especially in view of the fact that the equipment requested is more than is actually needed at the present time.\n\n......2\nIt is difficult to adequately handle a class of more than six pupils at one time, and consequently, we feel that the requisition could be reduced as shown on the copy of the attached requisition. The ink figures show the number which we consider should be purchased.\n\nIn connection with the dishes mentioned on the last page of the requisition, we would point out that there is on the market at the present time, blue Pyrex dishes which would be suitable for the class at this school and are available at a moderate price.\n\nPP/T\n\nBernard F.

I should like to suggest that some of the grades be sold and a few pure bred cows be bought with the proceeds.\n\nAll the milk produced goes to the children. Just now there are 48 gallons a day.

In so acting, I wish to make it clear that I had no intention of appearing forward or demanding. I was prompted to this action from the knowledge that both the High School at Kamloops and the High School at Cranbrook have been receiving this extra yearly grant towards care and keep of the High School children. Just why St. Mary's was never included in this I do not know. There are many extra expenses incurred in running the High School branch of the School. There is the matter of a High School teacher\u2014this year we will have two teachers\u2014whose salary is naturally quite high. Then in the matter of clothing, the High School pupils need something a little different from the general run of the School. Most of our High School boys and girls participate in outside activities such as Gymnastic displays; folk dancing; extra-mural sports etc. On these occasions they are mingling with other High School children and I have felt that in the matter of clothing, expenses etc., nothing should be left undone which would give our Indian children a feeling of inferiority. A High School demands a high standard in every way. To maintain this standard is indeed an extra matter of work and expense.\n\nIn what way either Kamloops or Cranbrook incur expenses not felt here, and so warrant the extra grant denied to us, I do not understand. I feel therefore that my request is within reason and do hope that you will do whatever possible to help us out in this matter. Our High School is progressing very well. I expect about 20 pupils in Grades 9, 10, and 11, this coming fall.\n\nThanking you, I remain\n\nSincerely yours\nSt. Mary's Indian Residential School\nUNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nP.O.

C.\nOttawa, January 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe December quarter return of the St. Mary's Indian Residential School shows that Gorgon Joe, No. 430, left the school on November 2nd and apparently died at home on December 5th. As yet, the Department has not received Form 414 regarding the death of this boy. This form, properly completed, should be forwarded as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nA. O'N. Daunt, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nMemorandum of an inquiry into the cause and circumstances of the death of Lloyd Lee, Pupil No. 385, of the St. Joseph Mission Indian Residential School at Mission City, who died at Mission City Hospital (place) on January 6th, 1936.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS\n\nWhen a pupil of an Indian Residential School dies, the Principal is required to inform the Indian Agent at once.\n\nOn receipt of the Principal's notice the Indian Agent shall convene a Board of Inquiry, consisting of himself as Chairman, the Principal of the Residential School, and the Medical Officer who attended the deceased pupil. These members of the Board shall, in each other's presence, complete this memorandum, which shall then be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, in one copy.\n\nThe Board of Inquiry shall, if at all practicable assemble within 48 hours of the pupil's death.\n\nThe parents or guardians of the deceased pupil shall be given notice of this inquiry and be permitted to attend it or to send a representative. They or their representative shall be asked if they wish to make a statement. In the event of their so wishing, their statement shall be attached to the report. The inquiry, however, shall not be delayed more than 72 hours after the time at which it would otherwise be held, to enable them to attend it.\n\nIf the Indian Agent is located at such a distance from the school as to make it impracticable for him to attend the Board, he shall request a responsible local resident to act for him. A suitable person for this duty would be a Justice of the Peace or a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted or Provincial Police. A more or less permanent arrangement of this kind might be necessary in some cases. The Department is prepared to pay a reasonable fee for this duty, on the Agent's recommendation. The report of the Board, in any case, must reach the Department through the Indian Agent's office.\n\nThis inquiry is not designed to take the place of, or prevent, any other inquiry, including an inquest, which may be required by law.\n\nIf the pupil died as the result of an accident, the Indian Agent is required to take the statements of the witnesses of the accident, and attach them to this memorandum.\n\nFORM No. 414.\nA. STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPAL OF THE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\n1. On what date did this pupil fall sick or suffer injury? Dec 31st 1935.\n\n2. At what time of day? Noon.\n\n3. When and to whom did he or she report this illness or accident? To the disciplinarian; he declared a pain in his side.\n\n4. What means were taken to afford relief? He was put to bed for treatment.\n\n5. What medicines were used for this purpose and in what dose or quantity? No medicines were given; just applications.\n\n6. When was the doctor called? January 2nd 1936.\n\n7. If the pupil was removed to hospital, at what time was this done and by what means of transport? I took him to the hospital in the car.\n\n8. If the pupil was not removed to hospital, what measures were taken for his or her care at the school?\n\n9. Add any other useful information here. He did not appear to suffer much or to consider his pain as at all serious. Its persistence alarmed us and resulted in our calling in the doctor.\n\nPrincipal.\n\nNote: If the deceased pupil dies in hospital at a distance from the school, under the care of the physician or surgeon who attends him at the hospital, a clinical report of the patient's illness and death in the hospital is to be secured and attached to this memorandum.\nB. STATEMENT OF THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED THE DECEASED PUPIL\n\nI attended Lloyd Lee from January 2nd to January 6th. The immediate cause of death was General peritonitis (appendicitis acute).\n\nThe contributory cause of death was Intercal fever.\n\nDo you consider that the Principal of the School, and the members of the School staff exercised reasonable care and judgment in regard to the illness and death of this pupil? Yes.\n\nDid they follow out your professional instructions? Yes.\n\nIf in either respect, you consider them to have been at fault, it is required that you express your carefully considered views as follows:\n\n[Signature]\nM.D.\nC. STATEMENT OF INDIAN AGENT\n\n1. Having heard and read over the statements of the Principal and the Physician, do you consider that all essential circumstances relating to the death of [signature] have been recorded? Yes. If not, you are required to add here any further particulars which strike you as essential.\n\n2.

O'Donnell  \nDept. of Indian Affairs  \nNew Westminster\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI was first called to attend Gordon Jr. at Harrison Mills at the home of Mr. Halls, his grandfather on Nov. 17th. He and his sister had fever, abdominal pain, and general malaise. To me it looked like gastro-intestinal flu. I advised castor oil and enemas which apparently relieved him of his symptoms. The aunt noted that there were apple seeds in the stool and said that he had been eating frozen apples. Apparently he recovered from this and I was again notified on Nov. 17th. Then he had a lower left lobe congestion (of the lung) with a pleurisy. Advised the usual foulness\u2014expectorants etc., and saw him on the 19th and 23rd and then his condition had improved and he was well on the way to recovery but on Dec. 3rd I was again called and the opposite base was congested. The family gave the history that he had got out and two nights before and got very cold. This second infection...\nlasted from Dec 3 to Dec 7th when he died. The cause of death being an pneumonic condition of the lower left lobe of the lung. The infective agent being the influenza bacillus and the contributory cause being the initial infection of the lower right lobe.\n\nHoping this is the requested information and if not sufficient will co-operate to furnish any further details.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 890-23, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSIR:-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated the 17th instant, File No.153-1-23, in which you request me to fill out Form No.414, in connection with the death of Gordon Joe, pupil No. 430, St. Mary's Mission Indian Residential School, registered at Seabird Island Reserve, Lytton Agency, who died at home on the 8th of December, 1935.\n\nThis boy does not belong to the New Westminster Agency, and I was unaware of his death until the School Quarter Return was submitted at the beginning of January.\n\nI, however, got in touch with Doctor P.S. McCaffrey, Medical Officer for the Seabird Island Indians, and am enclosing herewith, his report, which I trust will cover the case.\n\nApparently the boy was sickly at School, and his father took him home, so that his actual final illness was entirely outside the control of the School, and it would, therefore, appear that Form No.414 does not apply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O.N.

Could we please be advised as to whether Mrs. Maxwell wishes to be classified as a teacher on the normal ten month academic year basis or as a welfare teacher for the twelve month calendar year.\n\nIn our Hospital Schools, the Department presents an option to teachers who are appointed, as to the classification under which they prefer to accept the appointment. I note that Mrs. Castleman is at present classified as a welfare teacher.\n\nBernard F.

W. A. Blew for the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th, last, showing that there was only one Indian child in attendance at the Fort Simpson Anglican Day School for a total of 12 days during the above mentioned quarters.\n\nThe Department is forwarding a cheque in full payment of the grant for these two quarters, but considers that for the attendance and days taught that it would not be warranted in making further payments, unless the attendance very materially increases and the school is conducted a greater number of days each quarter.\n\nThe name of the child is Julian Beye and he was only present 9 days in the March quarter and 3 days in the June quarter.\n\nUnless the returns for the balance of the present fiscal year show an increase of attendance and days taught, only a proportionate amount of the grant can be paid for this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nRt.

I deeply regret the fact of the small attendance at the Fort Simpson Day school which you have mentioned. I am afraid that the breakdown in the health of the Rev. Mr. Blow during the last year was responsible for the irregularity of which you rightly complain. This school has hitherto been one of importance in the education of the Indian and half breed children of the district. It is now closed owing to the absence of the missionary, but I hope it will be re-opened next summer and that we shall then be able to report progress.\n\nI thank you for sending the cheque to the Imperial Bank, Edmonton for this school for the half year ending June 30.\n\nWould it be too much to ask you to advise me of any payments made for school work etc., and sent direct to the Bank.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 901-3, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Rev.

J.C. Blow and these have been forwarded to him by our Missionary in charge. I wish to state that Mr Blow left the Mission in July 1921 and no school was kept for the twelve months from July 1, 1921 to June 30, 1922. It was then re-opened by the Rev. F. Clarke, who has, I understand, sent in the Quarterly Returns regularly through the Indian Agent at Fort Simpson.\n\nMr. Blow's present address is, The Rectory, Emsdale, Ont.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJas. R. Lucas.\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\nOttawa, August 3, 1923.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 2nd ultimo, regarding payments of salary to the Rev. J. C. Blow, former teacher of the St. David's Mission, Fort Simpson, Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the last cheques sent, covering the services of Rev. Mr. Blow, were for the quarters ending March 31, and June 30, 1921. A cheque for $100, being the grant allowed for salary for that period was sent on August 18, 1921, to the Imperial Bank of Canada, South Edmonton, for deposit to the credit of the MacKenzie River Diocese. At the same time a cheque was sent the Indian Agent, in favour of the Rev. W. A. Blow, covering the bonus due for the two quarters above mentioned. In this connection I would refer you to our letter of August 18, 1921, and the school was closed until the September quarter, 1922. A cheque has been sent, covering the services of Rev. F. Clark for the September and December quarters, 1922. We were aware that the school was closed from June 30, 1921 to September, 1922. The returns for the March and June quarters, 1923, have not yet reached the Department.\n\nIn view of the above, we are unable, from our records, to find that any cheque has been sent to Rev. Mr. Blow, since his bonus cheque on August 18, 1921.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRt. Rev. Jas. R. Lucas, D.D.,\nBishop of MacKenzie River,\nFort Chipewyan, Alta.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of August 3rd., No.135-5-3, which awaited me upon my return from the North today.\n\nIt gives me much satisfaction to learn the facts of the case regarding the payment of the bonus to the Rev. J.C. Blow, the former teacher of the Day School at Fort Simpson. There is some local misunderstanding which I shall now be able to clear up.\n\nThe Simpson School Returns are now on their way to your Department, as also are those from Macpherson.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Mackenzie River.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\n**TEACHERS' SALARIES**\n\nFor Quarter Ended March and June, 1923.\n\n| Name of Teacher | Name of School | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due |\n|-----------------|----------------|------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

Mr. P. Phelan advised this office, over the telephone, that your Department had paid the Mission a grant of $144.00 in connection with the operation of this school during the quarter above referred to. I shall be glad if you will confirm this in writing so that said information may be available for record purposes.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would also state whether or not the pupils above referred to are Treaty Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nO.

This is the first return received from this school since June, 1925.\n\nIn the past, we allowed payment at the rate of $3. a day for each day that the school was open. The December quarter return stated that the school was open for forty-eight days and a cheque for $144. was issued and sent to the Imperial Bank of Canada, Edmonton, Alta., for deposit to the credit of McKenzie River Diocese. I am informed by the Director of the Northwest Territories and Yukon Branch, Department of the Interior, that a similar return was sent to them but, in view of our payment, they do not intend to make any allowance. Please let me have a full report on this school, stating if you consider, in view of the small attendance, the Department is justified in making any payment. Are you aware why a return containing the same names was sent to both Departments?\n\nPlease state, also, if the two children whose names are mentioned in the first paragraph of this letter are recognized as Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nI arrived home on Sept. 27, but as the plane only stopped for a few minutes I did not have time to get the school returns ready to send by it. A late boat, however, is giving us the opportunity of sending some extra mail out. Enclosed please find returns for our Indian School for quarter ending Sept. 30.\n\nThe school was kept open every school day, but some of the children were not in the Fort all summer and this brought the average attendance down.\n\nKind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFranklin Clarke\n\n* Being a special Summer School for the Indian children, the school was kept open throughout the summer holidays. *\nSt. David's Mission,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.,\nMarch 28th, 1935.\n\nDr. H.E. McGill,\nSuperintendent General,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill:\n\nAfter I returned North last fall I sent you a report of the attendance of Indian children at our school for the quarter ending Sept. 30th, 1934, in accordance with your instructions given to me at the personal interview with you when I was in Ottawa, Sept. 11. I have heard nothing from you since and am wondering if you received it. I have written the Treasurer of the Diocese, Archdeacon Little, and he has not received any grant from the Indian Department for our school. Please let me know if this report was received at your office, and if so whether the grant has been sent in to the Diocese.\n\nThe Department of The Interior is granting us only $25 per quarter instead of the usual $50 although the average attendance of white and half-breed is over the required average of five. As this grant is less than half the amount we are paying our teacher and as I have made myself personally responsible for her salary you will understand my interest in getting all that is due from the Government.\n\nAlthough our school is kept open every day except legal holidays the attendance of Indians is very irregular, due to the fact that there the natives are not living in the Fort. We try however to encourage them to attend while here even for a short visit. There were a few attending early in this quarter but none at present. I have asked the teacher to make out the report for this quarter and shall enclose it with this letter.*\n\nI hope the Department will recognize our efforts on behalf of their native wards and will make our school the usual grant at least for the quarters when there were Indian children in attendance.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFranklin Clarke\n\n* There were no Indians attending the quarter ending Dec. 31/34.\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL GRANT OR SALARY | AMOUNT DUE | ADDRESS TO WHICH CHEQUE IS TO BE SENT |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Mary Gifford    | FORT SIMPSON C.E.

Please let me know if this is correct.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nFranklin Clarke\nOttawa, October 8, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd instant, I have to inform you that the cheque which was sent you, in favour of Mary Gifford, to the amount of $20.00, was in payment of salary provided by this Department for the teacher at the St. David's Mission, Fort Simpson Day School for the month of June, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Franklin Clarke,\nBox 204,\nBurlington, Ont.\nOttawa, November 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a return from the Fort Simpson C. E. Indian Day School (St. David's Mission) for the period ended August 7th, 1936. It appears that this school was open for twenty (20) days.\n\nThe last return received from this school was for the month of June, 1935. If the attendance of Indian children only warrants the school being kept open for twenty (20) days during the summer, the Department does not see much advantage in opening it at all.\n\nPlease let me know by whom Henry G. Cook was engaged, also his qualifications and if he expects remuneration for the number of days he conducted the school. You should, also, state if all the children whose names appear on the return are Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. W.A.M. Truesdell,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., Feb. 12, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of 3rd November, file 135-5-3, in connection with Fort Simpson C. of E. Indian Day School (St. David's Mission) for period ending August 7th, 1936.\n\nI would like to say that this school has been kept open each Summer since my arrival in Fort Simpson in 1926 by the Minister in charge of the Church of England Mission here.\n\nAll the children mentioned in the report are Indians whose parents come to the Fort in Summer for their Annuity payment and remain to fish and hunt from the Fort. This is the only opportunity that some of these children have of receiving a little education, as many Indians are much averse to sending their children to school. Some years this school has been kept open for over two months, but last Summer was exceptional, as fewer Indians stayed in the Fort due to the scarcity of rabbits and fish, and left the Fort shortly after the Treaty payment.\n\nRev. H.G. Cook has been in charge of this school since the Summer of 1935 and is a B.A. of Western University, and engaged for this Parish by Bishop Sovereign who is in charge of the Diocese.\n\nI may also say that this school is kept open from early in September until the following June each year, and is attended by the children of Halfbreeds, Indians and Whites, and is thus a benefit to the whole community.\n\nThe matter of keeping this school open was taken up with Dr. H.W. McGill on his visit here July 31, 1935, by Rev. Franklin Clarke, the then Incumbent and myself, and Dr. McGill then agreed that some compensation was due the Mission for their work in connection with the school.\n\nJ.D.

Greenwood\n(Mrs. Tom)\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to submit my report of Treaty trip 1939.\n\nFort Mac Pherson\n\nJune 26th.\n\nThe meeting was held on the 26th in the Chief's house as agreed and the main subject brought up was their desire for a school of their own at MacPherson, stating that their children all get sick at Aklavik and on being sent home get better, that they will supply the logs and build the necessary buildings, as well as bend all efforts to supply as much food as possible if the department will supply the teachers and their keep. There are now approximately seventy children of school age at the post most of whom have not been to school and they are very adverse to sending them to Aklavik. No promises were made on this point beyond telling them that the request would be put before the department.\n\nJ.P. Harvey,\nIndian agent.\nFort Good Hope,\nN.W.T.,\nJuly 10, 1936.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSect. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe Letter #135-2-3.\n\nRev. Tom Greenwood has resigned as missionary at Fort McPherson and the day school has been closed as from June 30, 1936.\n\nWith the New School opening in Aklavik there will no longer be a day school at McPherson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMedical Superintendent.\nOttawa, February 22, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have discussed with the Director of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, Mr. Roy Gibson, the desirability of providing educational facilities for the Indian and half-breed children at Fort McPherson.\n\nThe last census shows an Indian population at this point of 407. Of these, 402 are listed as Anglican and five as Roman Catholic. It would appear, therefore, that there must be approximately eighty Indian children of school age at this point.\n\nWe are naturally anxious to learn that this matter has been fully discussed with the Anglican bishops concerned. Would the establishment of an Indian Day School at Fort McPherson tend to reduce the enrolment at Aklavik? In view of the fact, however, that the authorized enrolment at this date at Aklavik is only fifty, the effect should not be at all serious.\n\nWould it be possible also to secure from you information with respect to logs and other material available in the district for the construction of a school? The availability of labour locally is also important. Would the Indians be willing to cooperate in the building of a two-room Indian Day School? The construction of such a school, if included in our post-war program, would have to proceed, of course, without any commitment on our part with respect to the establishment of a Residential School later. Our building program is so far behind that it is not at all likely we will be able to secure funds for the construction of Residential Schools at new points at any time during the years immediately ahead of us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-1, part 1)\nFt. McPherson, N.W.T.,\nFeb. 19th, 1945.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am writing you regarding the educational problems in this place. I would be glad to get certain information from you, and any advice or suggestions you can give me.\n\nFirst, let me sum up the situation generally as it stands at present. Then I have certain proposals to make.\n\nAs you may know, when we first came here eight years ago, we carried on a small day school for seven or eight Indian, half-breed and white children. Mrs. Dewdney, who is a qualified teacher, did the main part of the teaching with myself assisting. We gave the children two to three hours daily. After a couple of years some of our pupils felt themselves too old for school, one or two went to the residential school at Aklavik, and others had moved from the Fort. There were no children of school age among the families resident at the Fort, and it was discontinued. A little later I began to teach a halfbreed child and brought her through the first two grades. Last year I started three more children on primary work.\n\nWe could foresee that there would be a number of children ready for school this year, partly because younger families are growing up, partly because one or two families moved into the Fort. Mrs. Dewdney wrote and procured correspondence lessons for these children through the Northwest Territories Branch. We hoped that with the aid of these lessons we could give the children a fair education. Mrs. Dewdney has been taking three children in Grade 3 and one in Grade 5 for an hour and a half a day. I have been taking three beginners for about the same length of time. Two of these children are Treaty Indians. We found the correspondence lessons useful as guides. But we soon found that the parents had not enough education or understanding of methods to be of much help. In spite of this I think the children are going ahead well. Taking the children from October to the end of March, Mrs. Dewdney expects to have pretty well covered the year's work. My beginners are able to read quite well, and should be about three-quarters of the way through the Reader, and about the same distance in Number Work before we have to stop. This is in spite of the fact that all children lost about a month's schooling during the mumps epidemic last fall, and that extra holidays have to be given at mail time, during the times when I am travelling among the camps, and when sickness claims Mrs. Dewdney's attention as Field Matron.\n\nWe realise of course, that while the children are getting the three R's, they are missing much of the general knowledge, the training in language and self-expression, the handwork, and the\ndiscipline that are a great part of the value of school life. We feel this is a serious loss. What we are doing is at best a makeshift and does not go far towards giving these children what they need.\n\nOur problem is made the greater by the fact that next year there will be a number more children ready for school. We shall be faced then with a situation which we cannot handle adequately under the present arrangements.\n\nIn addition to the families who live at the Fort the whole year, there are several other families for whom something should be done. There are several families, halfbreed and Indian who would like to put their children in day school, and who would move their families into the Fort for the winter if there were a regular school with a qualified teacher. Most of these families speak English in the home. They are not willing for various reasons, to send their children to a residential school. They are willing to go to the trouble and expense of building homes here to see that their children get an education.\n\nI sympathise with them. While some form of residential school seems to be the only solution for Indian children whose parents are usually on the move, I believe that a day school usually produces better results, and that it is greatly preferable where the children are able to attend it regularly.\n\nTo let you see the situation in a definite way, I give below a list of families that would have children ready for a day school if one were started next fall. I have divided the list into Treaty and Non-Treaty. Most of the children in the treaty families listed are more white than Indian and speak only English. First, however, I want to meet a possible objection. If a day school were started, might not the attendance again fall off as it did several years ago? Is there any likelihood that such a school could be kept going? I think it could. Most of these families, including the Treaty halfbreeds mentioned above, are native to the district and have their settled traplines near by. These are nearly all young families, with the oldest children eight or nine. From this age they come down in steps of one or two years. The end is nowhere in sight as the wives are young and healthy and likely to have plenty more. I am sure that if we once got started we would have material here for a day school of anywhere from twelve to twenty children or more. In addition I am sure that a number of Indians would leave their families at the Fort if there were a full time school going.\n### Non-Treaty Families\n\n| Name                  | In school 1944-45 | Younger Children | Available for School 1945-46 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|\n| William Firth         | 3                 | 3                | 3                           |\n| Mrs. Joan McDonald    | 1                 | 1                | 1                           |\n| Fred Firth            |                   |                  |                             |\n| Roy Wright            | 3                 | 3                |                             |\n| Mr. Carson (H.B.Co.)  | 1                 | 1                | 1                           |\n| Rev.A.S.Dewdney       | 1                 | 1                |                             |\n\n### Treaty Families\n\n| Name                  | In school 1944-45 | Younger Children | Available for School 1945-46 |\n|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|\n| Andrew Kunnizzi       |                   | 2                | 3                           |\n| (Chief & trader)      |                   |                  |                             |\n| James Simon           | 1                 | 2                | 1                           |\n| Fred Blake            | 3                 | 2                |                             |\n| Edward Blake          | 3                 | 3                |                             |\n| Johnny Kay (Chief)    |                   |                  | 1                           |\n\n**Totals**\n\n|                    | In school 1944-45 | Younger Children | Available for School 1945-46 |\n|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|-----------------------------|\n|                    | 7                 | 17               | 15                          |\n|                    |                   |                  | 4                           |\n|                    |                   |                  | 3                           |\n\nI think these figures speak for themselves. I should mention that under \"Younger Children\" I have not included any of those listed in the last three columns.\n\nNow I would like to outline the general idea we have in mind if we can obtain help to carry it through.\n\nIf possible we want to start a Day School next fall for these children. This school would be in charge of a qualified teacher brought in from \"outside\" on an adequate salary, would be run for ten months on full school hours, and use the full school curriculum for each grade. It would be the aim to give every child exactly the same education as a white child outside in the same grade would receive.\n\nFor the first year at least, school would be held in a large room attached to the Mission which can be adequately heated and lighted (with electricity), and the teacher given board and room at the Mission. The teacher would be found by the Mission, but qualifications would be approved by the Departments concerned who would have control over curriculum, equipment, etc. Only those children would be admitted whose parents would guarantee to keep them at the Fort for the school year. This is necessary to prevent the inconveniences arising from children attending for a few weeks and then leaving. All children would be examined by a doctor in the fall to avoid the presence of T.B. None of the families listed, with one exception (Andrew Kunnizzi) have ever shown any signs of this disease.\n\nLater, when it was proved to the satisfaction of the proper authorities that the scheme was working out, it is hoped that a proper schoolhouse might be erected.\nThe expenses of the school would be met by grants from the N.W.T. Branch, the Indian Department, and the Hudson's Bay Co. In addition a charge is proposed of $50.00 per child per school year to be paid by all parents.\n\nWe feel that the Indian Department, being willing to pay substantial sums for the education of children at the residential schools would be willing to make a grant for any Treaty children who might be attending day school here. By the same mail I am writing to ask the N.W.T. Branch what they would be willing to do on behalf of the non-Treaty children.\n\nThe H.B.Co. Manager has two children and expects to be here for some years. The officials of the Company have told me that it is one of their greatest problems to place their men where they can get schooling for their children. I am sure we shall never lack children for the school from this source. As they pay very generous educational grants to their Managers to enable them to send their children out to school, I feel sure they would help generously if we had a school here. Mr. Carson is writing to get definite information on this point by this same mail.\n\nRe the charge of $50.00 per child. This is a prosperous community. None of these families would find any difficulty in paying this sum. I feel they ought to be expected to pay their share. They have all expressed their willingness to do so.\n\nSince we cannot run this scheme without help from these various sources, I am endeavouring to collect here all the information I can. When we get definite word as to what we can expect in the way of support, we shall be able to see whether there is a chance to get it going, and I then propose to lay all the facts and figures in definite form before Bishop Fleming and see if we can make a beginning. I ought to have mentioned before that all families with children at McPherson, Indian, halfbreed and white, belong to the Church of England, so there should be no religious complications.\n\nI would appreciate your letting me know what assistance we could count on from your Department, and would be glad of your frank criticisms and advice. As early a reply as is convenient would be a help, as the time is short if we are to make a start next fall.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev) A.S. Dewdney.\n\nI should add that a day school would not interfere with the residential school at Aklavik, nor with one here if it were built at some future date. Rather they would supplement one another, both filling a real need. There are plenty of children here for both.\nOttawa, February 22, 1945.\n\nDear Doctor Alderwood:\n\nI have discussed with the Director of the Lands, Parks and Forests Branch, Mr. Roy Gibson, the desirability of providing educational facilities for the Indian and half-breed children at Fort McPherson.\n\nThe last census shows an Indian population at this point of 407.

A certain amount of thought has been given to the establishment of a school at Fort McPherson. We have already had a preliminary discussion with the N.W.T. Council. Before definite action is taken, however, we should have certain definite information with respect to the availability of building supplies, the willingness of Indians to cooperate in the construction of the school and other such matters. In the meantime, I can see no valid reason why instruction should not be given in the temporary building which appears to be available. If a teacher is nominated by the Bishop - the teacher for such a school should be fully qualified - the Department here will assume the responsibility for the payment of his salary. I am not, however, sure that we would be justified in charging a fee in the case of Indians, regardless of whatever arrangement you may or may not make with the half-breed population.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nReverend A.

If, in our judgment, it is desirable to put up a Hostel then that is our affair.\n\nShould I be in error regarding the above, I trust you will let me know.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop.\nOttawa, March 12, 1945.\n\nMy dear Bishop Fleming:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 9th instant, and have noted with interest your reference to your interview with me a few days ago.\n\nIn this connection, I am sending forward herewith plans of a two-room Indian Day School. It is just possible you may find these plans altogether too elaborate for the purpose you have in mind. However, I am sending them forward in the hope that the plans may prove helpful.\n\nIf you can secure a teacher - preferably a fully qualified teacher - to carry on until the school is constructed, the salary of the person employed will be paid by this Branch.

The matter was taken up strongly by Bishop Fleming and once it became a question of a Day School it naturally fell into his sphere of responsibility. We have recently been advised by the Bishop that it has not been found possible to take action this year and that the Missionary has been asked to do his best to care for the children concerned in the meantime.\n\nAs far as our Commission is concerned, we are clear that there are a large number of children in the McPherson area who require fuller educational opportunities than are available now. We are only able to care for a small number of them at Aklavik and it is our hope the post-war program of the Branch may provide some additional facilities at Fort McPherson.\n\nWith kind regards, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n\nHAA/MER\nLessons are required for the following children, whose parents have undertaken to keep them at the Fort for Day School this winter.\n\n| NAME            | AGE | GRADE |\n|-----------------|-----|-------|\n| Walter Firth    | 10  | 1     |\n| Frank Firth     | 9   | 1     |\n| Willie Firth    | 16  | 6     |\n| Annie Firth     | 7   | 1     |\n| Herbert Firth   | 10  | 1     |\n| Billy Carson    | 7   | 1     |\n| Florence McDonald | 11 | 3     |\n| ?

Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner N.W.T.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am enclosing a list of children whom we shall be teaching at Ft. McPherson this winter, and will be glad if you will arrange with the correspondence lessons Dept. in Edmonton to have lessons and all necessary books and materials sent us for these children. I am not sure whether this request should go in to you or to the Dept. of Indian Affairs, as many of the children are in Treaty, but would appreciate your making whatever arrangements are necessary.\n\nIn view of the high postage and air express rates in this country, I would suggest that the lessons and books be forwarded by R.C.A.F. plane from Edmonton, to reach us before the freeze-up.\n\nI would like to make it plain that we wish to have the correspondence lessons and materials for our own guidance and for the use of the children, but we cannot undertake to send so many lessons in to Edmonton for correction. Mrs. Dewdney is a qualified teacher and will give what help she can, though I expect to take the bulk of the work myself.\n\nOur plan is to take the children for three hours every day from October until Easter. We expect to be able to cover half a grade in that time. This is all the time we can give to this work, and more than we can really afford, but the need is so great, and there are so many people asking for day school instruction, that we feel we cannot refuse them. Next year, as you know, we expect to have a day school and full-time teacher, but it has not been found possible to get a full-time teacher this year. I am sure this school will fill a very real need. If we have as many as 24 children, as we expect, with the limited time we are able to give them, I think there will be no difficulty getting twice as many children when we have adequate facilities and staff.\n\nAt the bottom of the list of children, I have put a number of items of equipment which we shall need, which I hope can be supplied. I realize we are pretty late in getting this request in, but it was unavoidable. We were not able to get until this last week the full list of those who would be able to send their children to school this winter. Any lessons and equipment which remain over, will of course be kept over for next year.\n\n2...(over)\nI am asking for a school register, and would like any forms customarily used in reporting on attendance and progress of the children. We want to keep you informed. I might say that with Dr. Hayward's assistance, we are planning to keep a close checkup on the health of the children.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Rev.) A. S. Dewdney\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nRe - Day School at Fort McPherson, N.W.T.\n\nAdverting to previous correspondence respecting the day school at Fort McPherson, N.W.T., I enclose copy of a letter dated August 21 from Reverend A. S. Dewdney who, with his wife, operate this school.\n\nYou will note we are asked to furnish complete correspondence school lessons for all children in this school. In this connection I might advise that the N.W.T. Administration has undertaken to provide correspondence school lessons for pupils of the Territories who are unable to attend the day or residential schools or have progressed beyond the point where they can obtain further education locally.\n\nIt looks as though the pupils will be about half Indians and half children of mixed blood. The policy for our two branches should be about the same. Quite frankly we have never contemplated that a teacher competent to handle a school would require correspondence school courses for each pupil and this would be a bit expensive.\n\nBefore answering the correspondence of the Reverend Dewdney, I would like to get your views on the subject. If you are willing to pay your share of the correspondence school course then we could adopt a similar policy.

My understanding was that I would receive a copy of the Memorandum of our discussion prepared by your private secretary. I have not yet received this Memorandum and I am most anxious to learn whether your Architect has prepared the plans for the Day School at Fort McPherson. If so could I see the blueprints of the same so that the matter might be in good shape before you have to submit your estimates in March.\n\nYour help in this connection would be very greatly appreciated.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBishop of The Arctic.\nOttawa, December 6, 1945.\n\nMy dear Bishop Fleming:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of December 3rd, in which you seek information with respect to the establishment of an Indian day school at Fort McPherson, N.W.T.\n\nI must express regret at my failure to send on to you a summary of the discussion which took place at my office on October 5th. However, even at this late date, I am sending it on to you for your information.\n\nWe have included in the Estimates for next year a sum of $15,000.00 for the construction of an Indian day school at Fort McPherson and the plans will be prepared by the architect of the Surveys and Engineering Branch in due course. It would be appreciated if I could have from you a statement indicating the type of construction you deem most suitable, the availability of labour locally and any other such information you may have in mind.\n\nMany thanks for your kind references to my health.

I note with pleasure that you have included in the estimates for next year the sum of $15,000 for its construction and that the plans will be prepared by the Architect of the Branch in due course.\n\nIn order to give you helpful information I have written to Fort McPherson asking for such information as they can furnish in connection with construction there. I want to know for example, how the concrete posts under the new Hudson's Bay Company's house have stood the test of the cold weather; what their ideas are regarding a basement; whether the Indian leaders are prepared to promise help in connection with native labour in order that the building may be constructed with as little delay as possible. I have asked also that they decide themselves how much per hour they honestly think they should be paid for this kind of work. This information cannot come to us until after Christmas since the people will not be in the settlement until then but I think that most of the leading men will be there at that time and if we can get them to arrive at a definite decision it will things easier in the summer.\n\nOur idea of construction would be a frame building with two layers of boarding outside with building paper between them then three inch rock wood bats between the studding and then the inside having insulating board. The ceiling should have vapour barrier construction strapping. In our judgement it is very important that attention should be given to the floors as well as the ceilings. On top of the floor joist we would suggest for your Architect to put shiplap (diagonally) then tar paper, then two layers of insulating board, a layer of plywood on top of that and finally linoleum on top of everything.\n\nIf there are any other points that the Architect would care to have our ideas about we would be glad to express them but we have\nno desire to tell your Architect how he ought to design the building but only to offer helpful suggestions as a result of what we have seen in the North.\n\nWith all kind wishes,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of The Arctic.\nThe Diocese of the Arctic\n\nTHE CHURCH HOUSE\n604 JARVIS STREET\nTORONTO 5, CANADA\n\n31st December, 1945.\n\nR.A.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have received a reply to my letter sent to our Missionary at Fort McPherson re certain practical points connected with the erection of the building.\n\nFirst, he informs me that the basement in the new Hudson's Bay Company's house has proved most unsatisfactory and each summer it has been badly flooded. He, therefore, does not recommend a basement.\n\nSecondly, re foundation. He informs me that the concrete posts 10\" square and more than 5' in the ground have proved most satisfactory. He further adds that should any shifting occur it is easy with these concrete posts to adjust the building.\n\nAnother point which he makes is that he thinks a mistake has been made when the Hudson's Bay Company had their buildings put high above the ground and cannot be banked. This is a small matter and can be attended to when the new building is being erected. He suggested following the Hudson's Bay Company's practice in using \"Cupronol\" as a protector on the large timbers used in the base of the building.\n\nIn reply to my query about the possibility of securing helpers in the erection of the building he suggests two plans. First, to try and get a fairly large number of Indians to help at .50 - .75\u00a2 an hour with the carpenter overseeing them. In this connection he feels that many of the men are quite good at rough lag work but few of them would be able to do the finer work.\n\nThe second plan is to only employ a few picked men, who are known to be good workers, and pay them at the rate of $1. an hour. This information has just come to hand and I am forwarding it to you at once.\n\nP.T.O.\nTrusting this will be of some service to your Architect\nand with kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of The Arctic.\nOttawa, January 16,\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS and ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Proposed Indian School at\nFort McPherson, North West Territories\n\nAn amount of $15,000.00 is included in our Estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47 to erect a two-room school at the above mentioned place.\n\nRight Reverend A. L. Fleming, D.D., Bishop of the Arctic, visited me recently and discussed the situation at Fort McPherson. He gives the following information, which should assist your Architects in preparing their plans:\n\n1. Owing to the condition of the ground, no basement should be provided.\n\n2. Experience in that part of the country proves that concrete posts, 10 inches square and placed five feet in the ground, are most satisfactory.\n\n3. The building should be kept as close to the ground as possible, in order to allow banking it each winter. The Hudson's Bay Company in that section of the country, in erecting buildings, use \"Cupro\" as a protector on the large timbers used in the base of the building.\n\n4. A fairly large number of Indians will be available to help in the erection of the school. They are...\nprepared to accept fifty to seventy-five cents an hour. Of course, it would be necessary to have a qualified carpenter supervising the work.\n\nBoth the Bishop and the officials of this Branch are extremely anxious that the above building should be erected during the summer of 1946.\n\nDirector.\n14th January, 1946.\n\nR.A.

L. Fleming, D.D.,\nThe Church House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nTORONTO 5,\nOntario.\nDuring the past six years, no organized day school has been carried on at Ft. McPherson. There have never been more than two or at most, three children resident at the Fort during the period when we had free time to give to teaching. These two or three children, however, we have taken each year for an hour or so a day. Florence McDonald, now in Grade 3, has received all her teaching from us. In 1944-45 there were five children of school age at the Fort, three halfbreed, one white, and one Indian. These children were put on Edmonton correspondence courses, and in spite of a long break due to the mumps epidemic, were taken through approximately half the year's work.\n\nThis year it was decided to attempt to run a part-time Day School on a larger scale. This was undertaken for several reasons. Among them:\n\n1. There has been an increasing desire on the part of the Indians to have their children educated, and less willingness to send them to a residential school.\n\n2. It was felt that the Mothers' Allowance would enable many of the men to leave their children at the Fort while they attended to their hunting and trapping.\n\n3. A number of young halfbreed families were reaching school age. These families on the whole have a distinct prejudice against sending their children to residential school.\n\n4. The prospect of a school being built at McPherson next summer made us anxious to do some preliminary work, which would show the need for a day school, and also enable us to get some grasp beforehand of the conditions under which it would work.\n\nDuring the summer the Indians were told that Day School would be carried on this winter, and that we were willing to take any children whose parents would undertake to keep them at school from Oct. 15th at least until the opening of the rat season (March 1st). They were assured that the health of the children would be checked to minimize the danger of any infections spreading. Twenty-three children were definitely promised, and on that basis, we wrote for the necessary supplies. When we opened school on October 12th, however, only 15 of these children attended. Roy Wright had to move his family to Aklavik as his wife required medical treatment. It was decided at the last minute to send several other children to the Residential School at Aklavik, and one family was not willing to come in till after freezeup.\n\nSupplies having been ordered somewhat too late to catch the plane, and an expected \"igloo\" not turning up, new arrangements had to be made in a hurry. A large room in the Mission was used for school. As this had to be used for services on Sunday, desks were constructed, two desks of 12 and 16 feet in length, resting on trestles, so that they could be moved outside. Two senior pupils were given small tables at the back of the room. A roll of blackboard cloth, many years old, was discovered and fastened to one wall over a piece of hardboard. An easel was built to hold reading charts. A supply of readers and textbooks was on hand from other years, some other books requisitioned from our son's library, and some borrowed from Aklavik. The children were required to provide their own note books and pencils. But a great deal of material had to be made or typed by hand, particularly sheets for practice reading to take the place of the workbooks, cards for arithmetic drills, phonics practice other things. The preparation of this has taken from one to two hours extra work each day.\nAt the opening of school there were 16 children, nine of these being Treaty Indians, five from local halfbreed families, and two white children from the Hudson's Bay Co. Of these children only four had ever attended residential school, five had received all their previous teaching from us, and seven had never attended any school before. All spoke English.\n\nThe main part of the work was handled by myself. I have never had normal training, but have had some experience of primary work over the years, and the advantage of the advice and assistance of my wife who holds a teacher's certificate. She took over the whole school for half an hour daily for writing, and three of the senior pupils for half an hour on spelling. This was in addition to her ordinary housework and the constant supervision necessary over our son, doing his Grade II by correspondence.\n\nSchool was held daily from 9.30 to 12.30 with 15 minutes recess. Of this time, ten minutes was usually given to singing, and ten minutes to Bible reading and short religious instruction. The whole of the rest of the time was spent on the three R's, except for the three senior pupils who took spelling, and some language and expression work in connection with their reading. Most children were given assignments to do at home each day.\n\nThe pupils were found to be at very different stages. For instance, one boy who had never been at school and could not read a word, was able to start at once to do the equivalent of Grade 3 arithmetic. He had been taught in the classes by Jessie Bonneplume, a graduate of the Carcross school. Some of those in Grade 1 had already done half the year. Three children of 9, 14, and 16, were very retarded mentally, and it is doubtful if they can ever be taught to read fluently. The impossibility of classifying the children in definite groups made the task of arranging the work much more difficult.\n\nWe soon saw that wood for the schoolroom stove was going to be a problem. Our own woodpile was short, and there seemed no prospect of more. The natives will not cut or haul wood, even at prices that would have seemed fabulous five years ago. Consequently, I felt justified in asking the parents to provide half a cord of wood for each child at school. An exception was made in the case of one or two widows and old people. In most cases this was readily promised, and most of it was brought or will be bought eventually. Only in one case, that of William Firth, one of the halfbreeds, was a difficulty made over this, but I understand that he intends to bring the wood eventually. Except for this one case, all families have been very cooperative.\n\nOur main difficulty arose over the question of health. Lice were discovered on the head of one of the white children. Mrs. Dewdney, as Field Matron, gave the children a talking to on the matter, we saw that two or three dirty children were cleaned up, and by publicly questioning each child, made sure that each had a weekly bath and change of underwear. It was necessary to assist one poor family to get the clothing and the bedding necessary.\n\nSoon after school started, we began to take the temperatures of the children each day. It had been discovered by Dr. Hayward that many of the school children at Aklavik who seemed in fair health, were running a daily temperature, and in many cases were in the first stages of T.B. and should not be allowed to associate with healthy children. We were anxious to know whether that was the case at McPherson, or whether...\nThere was a widespread impression here, which we shared, that McPherson was healthier than Aklavik. Dr. Hayward, who was sceptical of this, encouraged us to test the matter. Temperatures of all children were taken daily for three or four weeks, to avoid any chance that a rise might be caused by colds or mumps (which is still going around). We found that of the 16 children, 9 were running a constant daily temperature between 98 and 100. The whole record was forwarded to Dr. Hayward for his consideration and advice. He immediately ordered the exclusion of three of the children, and of five others if they showed signs of a cough. One of these latter was accordingly excluded, but the other four allowed to continue at school. Three of these were children of William Carson. I felt that he should be told of his children's condition, and did so as tactfully as possible (without telling him what the doctor's orders were). He was extremely unpleasant and uncooperative in the matter and accused me of making up the whole thing. Fortunately, the doctor was able to visit us a few days later, and we took all the school children examined by him in their parents' presence. A number of the children were ordered to come to Aklavik for X-ray. Wm. Firth was again somewhat insolent, and the doctor had to tell him plainly that unless the children were X-rayed within a reasonable time, they would not be able to attend school with the others. After the doctor's departure, these children attended school for about a week, and then were suddenly withdrawn without a word of explanation. It was said that he had stated publicly that there was nothing the matter with his children and that he was not sending them down for an X-ray.\n\nMeanwhile, the Carsons, the white family at the H.B.C.O., had been much alarmed at the result of the doctor's investigations, and when it was found that their own children on one or two occasions were running slight temperatures, where they had been consistently normal before, they felt they were running too great a risk in letting their children attend school with the natives, and they withdrew them, and are teaching them at home.\n\nI had offered to take those children whom the doctor had excluded, privately for teaching, and one boy took advantage of this, but the parents of the other three were somewhat upset over the matter, and withdrew the children entirely.\n\nOur school therefore, was now reduced to seven children, and with these we continued for the two or three weeks that remained.\n\nI propose in the New Year, to offer to take on enough beginners to refill the school, provided they can attend till Easter. I hope to have them examined before the term starts, so as to eliminate any who might be suspect beforehand. This will prevent a repetition of our unhappy experience this winter. A further report will be made at Easter time.\n\nAmong other conclusions, I would draw this one - that when a full time Day School is begun here, arrangements should be made for every child to be examined and if possible, X-rayed before the term starts, both for the early discovery and prevention of disease, and for the protection of healthy children and a reassurance to their parents.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nJanuary 7, 1946.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nHerewith is a day school return just received from Mr. Dewdney of Fort McPherson.\n\nIt is noted that he has included both white and halfbreed children to completely cover the work that he is trying to do there.\n\nI shall advise him to submit, at the end of the next quarter, two separate returns; one for Indians for this department and the other for the whites and halfbreeds for the N.W.T.

Forms \"proposed building data herewith for Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories.\"\n\nFebruary 9, 1946.\n\nYour notation of January 18th on Mr. Hoey's memorandum of the 16th ultimo, asks for a date by which drawings and specifications for the above can be made ready.\n\nIn this connection we may say, that beyond the buildings mentioned as most urgently needed in Mr. Hoey's later memorandum to you dated January 31st last, which were only a few of the 60 projects Indian Affairs included in their 1946-47 estimates, it will be some time before attention can be given to any further work on new buildings.\n\nFor the case in point, the information supplied in Mr. Hoey's memorandum of January 16th last, serves very little purpose. Forwarded attached are triplicate copies of our regular \"Proposed Building Data\" form, for transmission to Indian Affairs. All copies should be completed in detail and two of them should be returned to this office for the use of our Architect when needed.\n\nWhen the information is received, it may be possible to adapt for the purpose, drawings prepared for other types of two-roomed schools, but undoubtedly new specifications will be needed. We have no opinion at present as to when this work can be undertaken.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, March 14, 1946.\n\nMy dear Bishop Fleming:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of February 22 and previous correspondence with reference to the proposed day school at Fort McPherson.\n\nI have discussed the matter with the Architect in our Surveys and Engineering Branch, and I regret that owing to the large amount of work that he is attempting to handle this year and the further fact that he has experienced difficulty in securing sufficient staff, it will not be possible for him to prepare any plan. In your letter of February 22 you intimated that you were having a plan prepared by your own Architect. I feel that it would be advisable to proceed with this plan. I might also suggest that you make immediate enquiries with a view to ascertaining if you can engage a qualified man to proceed to Fort McPherson to supervise the erection of the building. From previous correspondence, I understand that Indians can be obtained to do the rough work. I would also like to know if you could handle the purchase and shipment of the materials required. It occurred to me that you might know someone in the North who is familiar with conditions and could handle this part of the work more expeditiously than we can. On receipt of your reply, I will discuss the matter with the Minister, with a view to obtaining his approval to advancing funds for the construction of the building.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend A.

Right Reverend A. L. Fleming, Bishop of the Arctic, has visited the Department on several occasions during the past few months, urging the erection of a two-room day school at Fort McPherson. An amount of $15,000.00 has been placed in the Appropriation for the fiscal year 1946-47 for the erection of this school.\n\nIn view of the large amount of work that the Surveys and Engineering Branch is endeavouring to handle for this branch during the summer of 1946, it has not been possible for them to prepare plans and specifications for the proposed school at Fort McPherson.\n\nBishop Fleming is thoroughly conversant with conditions at Fort McPherson and he is prepared to proceed with the erection of the building. He has forwarded to us blue-prints of the proposed two-room school, prepared by his Architects, Messrs.

We also wrote to the Transport Division of the Hudson's Bay Company about sending the lumber, etc., down on the first boat. Bishop Fleming will arrange all other details immediately.\n\nBishop Fleming is at the present moment on his way to Calgary and Winnipeg but hopes to be back in Toronto on April 9th.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Miss) Inez Bennett\nSecretary to Bishop Fleming.\n12th April, 1946.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey: Re Fort McPherson Day School\n\nI beg to send you a brief report regarding the situation pertaining to this matter.\n\nI. The materials for the building have been ordered from the Clark Lumber Company of Edmonton. I telephoned Mr. Brown, the manager, from Calgary and he will do everything possible to see that the complete unit is sent forward in time to go down river by the first boat. We have also notified the Hudson's Bay Company, Mackenzie River Transport and they are prepared to accept our shipment.\n\nII. We engaged an experienced Carpenter who has already worked for us at Aklavik so that we have every confidence that the building will be taken in hand properly.\n\nIII. We have communicated with our Missionary at Fort McPherson regarding local labour and rough logs and have every confidence that the situation there will develop satisfactorily because many of the most intelligent people are anxious to have a school established.\n\nIV. We have engaged Miss Catherine Herschel who has a First Class Teacher's Certificate for the Province of Ontario. Miss Herschel will go down by the first boat.\nV. We are in touch with a firm about the desks for the children, etc., and have the assurance that these can be obtained in time, also blackboards, etc.\n\nVI. We are having trouble about oil heaters and have only been able to secure two so far. I am wondering if we could secure a number of oil heaters from the Government from the Can Oil Project down the Mackenzie. Last summer in going down by air I was informed that there were some fifty oil heaters at the Can Oil Project. From Aklavik I wrote to Mr. McKinnon, Manager of the Imperial Oil Refinery at the Oil Wells asking his assistance in order to secure three of these oil heaters for me. Mr. McKinnon was South at the time and my letter was passed on to someone else who wrote advising me that these oil heaters were not for sale and he ventured the explanation the Government had not decided on the sale price of these. This was not very encouraging in view of the fact that the Americans had left Can Oil a year before.\n\nWould it not be possible for you to contact the proper authority in Ottawa and secure four or more of these. We would then be quite willing to take over the two new ones that we have ordered. The main thing is that we must have heaters for the school.\n\nThere are other details that are being attended to but unless something unforeseen happens we have every reason to believe that the School will be erected this summer.\n\nMay I ask for your decision regarding certain practical matters:\n\n(1) Am I correct in assuming that you wish us to pay the bills as they come in and then forward the receipts to you. The alternative of this would be for us to O.K. the bills and send them to you for payment. Will you please give us your decision regarding this matter.\n\n(2) Am I correct in assuming that you wish us to make all arrangements regarding the school teacher; arranging for her transportation, pay her salary, etc., and then send you the official statement of the same OR will you deal with this matter entirely.\n\nWe would be glad to know what your wishes are regarding these matters. Later on I shall communicate with you further regarding\nMr. Obey\n\n12th April, 1946.\n\ndetails and I shall always be most glad to hear from you and be advised by you regarding your wishes.\n\nAnything we can do to facilitate matters we will deem a privilege.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. L. Fleming\n\nBishop of The Arctic\nDictated but not signed by due to absence from office.\nOttawa, April 18, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn co-operation with the Right Reverend A. L. Fleming, D.D., Bishop of the Arctic, this Branch is erecting a day school at Fort McPherson this summer.\n\nBishop Fleming is arranging for the equipment required for the school and in a letter dated April 12 he writes me as follows:-\n\n\"I am wondering if we could secure a number of oil heaters from the Government from the Can Oil Project down the Mackenzie.

Salary will be allowed her at the rate of $130.00 a teaching month, plus bonus. This latter amount was promised in my letter of January 10, 1946. Present regulations do not permit payment of travelling expenses of teachers. When she begins duties, please notify me so that we may place her name on the pay-list and she will receive her salary monthly. I enclose the necessary forms, which she should complete and return when she opens the school.\n\nI have noted paragraph 6 of your letter and an endeavour will be made to ascertain if oil heaters are available.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend A.

Fleming, D.D., Bishop of the Arctic is interested in procuring for the school which is being erected at Fort McPherson.\n\nWe have searched our records here and find that nothing of this nature has been declared surplus. We have, however, sent a copy of your letter to Capt. A.C. Nixon, who is in charge of United States Surplus Moveables in Canada at Ottawa, and immediately we hear from him, we will communicate with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWAR ASSETS CORPORATION,\n\nG.

Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYour kind letter of 18th instant has reached me this morning and I hasten to acknowledge the same.\n\nI note that we are to approve of the accounts for the materials sent to the school and then forward them to you from whence payment will be made.\n\nRegarding local accounts for payment to workers, etc., these will have to be paid either by the Missionary or by the Hudson's Bay Company locally. We will, therefore, ask them to send us the bills for our approval and we will forward them to you.\n\nWill you please send the usual School Attendance forms addressed to Miss Catherine Herschel, Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories, Via Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nI note that as per your letter of January 10th, 1946, the salary allowed Miss Herschel will be at the rate of $150. a teaching month plus bonus. I note further that you do not pay travelling expenses.\n\nI have asked Miss Herschel to fill in the forms that you have sent and she will notify you when her duties begin in due course.\n\nRe Salary Cheques, will you please have them addressed to her in care of the Diocese of The Arctic, 604 Jarvis Street, Toronto, as she has asked us to attend to such matters here while she is away.\n\nWhat about oil heating? Do you wish us to order a quantity of oil such as would appear to meet the need. This should be done with as little delay as possible. If you are ordering the oil will you please order it direct through the Imperial Oil Company, 56 Church Street, Toronto.\nWill you please advise us on two points regarding pupilage:\n\n(a) I note the regulations regarding the school year but this plan is not the most helpful one for a place like Fort McPherson. It would be greatly to the advantage of all to have the school operate in the summer before the people scatter so that they would have some assurance that the work was really active and give them confidence.\n\nWhat I have in mind is simply this. It would be in the best interest of the children if there could be a readjustment of the actual time of the year when holidays are taken. I feel we would miss much by not having the school run during the summer months. The total number of teaching months each year would be the same of course. Our Missionary suggests that the holidays should run from May 15th to July 15th.\n\n(b) Regarding school equipment such as pencils, paper, rulers, etc., do you wish us to send you a list of these supplied by Miss Herschel or will you make the necessary arrangements.\n\nFinally, will you kindly advise us regarding the Attendance Grants. Any further information that you can give us will be appreciated.\n\nWith personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of The Arctic.\nThe Diocese of the Arctic\n\nTHE CHURCH HOUSE\n604 JARVIS STREET\nTORONTO 5, CANADA\n\n25th April, 1946.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nRe: Fort McPherson Day School\n\nI have given some thought to practical details regarding the erection of the Day School at Fort McPherson and there are several small but not unimportant points about which I would like to have your judgment.\n\nAs we are to arrange all matters connected with the erection of the school I presume that means we are to arrange for the Carpenter to travel North and unless I hear from you to the contrary we will do this. We will secure for him his train ticket and reservations, his boat ticket and reservation down the Mackenzie and he will submit a statement of his travelling expenses over and above to us, we will then send you on our own behalf an itemized bill and you will reimburse us accordingly. If there is any special form or voucher which you wish us to use please advise us. There are likely to be small cash outlays for which it will be difficult for us to produce a voucher other than our own statement - what is your wish regarding such matters?\n\nWe are writing to the Hudson's Bay Company, Mackenzie River Transport impressing upon them the need of their keeping all their bills, etc., connected with the Day School at Fort McPherson separate from any of our ordinary freight bills.\n\nWe are having a special order form printed for use at Fort McPherson and as far as possible these will go through the Hudson's Bay Company for cash. The Hudson's Bay Company will then submit them to us for our approval and we will forward them to you for payment as I understand you plan to issue the cheques. I think in this way we will avoid unnecessary complications.

It would appear that extensions to it will be in order in another year or so, once more people of the area equip themselves to live in the settlement for the winter. This insisting that the children to school will require some extra work on our part as in the past all efforts have been to get the people out of the villages and away to their camps. And now policy is being reversed in order that their children may attend the school.\n\nJ.P.

As a consequence, no payment of salary has been made to her.\n\nWhile we sent the usual forms with our letter of April 13, they have not been returned and possibly they have been mislaid. We are therefore enclosing another set which she should complete and return. As soon as we have these forms, her name will be placed on the pay list.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. A.L.

Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nRE: FORT McPHERSON DAY SCHOOL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 24th October, the following is an extract from a letter from our Missionary, the Rev. A.S. Dewdney, under date 16th August which gives a comprehensive report of the building of the new School:\n\n\"You will be expecting news on the progress of the school, etc. Mr. Hayward arrived on the boat along with most of the materials. He started to work at once and has got ahead very quickly. We had no idea the building would go up so quickly. There was some difficulty in getting workers. Mr. Hayward preferred to have only two men and we realized that if they were going to stay at the Fort with their families all summer we would have to pay them well, so we offered a straight wage of a dollar an hour. I went after some of the better workers. Unfortunately some of them had other work to do; several others promised to work but failed to appear. We finally got Abraham Francis and Brian Francis. Neither speaks English very well and neither is very experienced with a lumber building. Mr. Hayward has grumbled a good deal about them, but really I think they have done very well and they have stuck to the job without missing a day, turning up every morning at 8.30. And, as I say, the work has gone ahead very fast. After five weeks the building is almost finished, except for painting and some of the interior finishing. At present we have Fred Flirt and William Edward working as well. I worked for part of two afternoons, but I had quite a bit of other work to do and my help did not seem necessary. As a matter of...\"\nfact Mr. Hayward was hard put to it to keep his two men occupied in the last week or two before the second boat brought the remainder of the supplies. All being well, we hope to open school on September 2nd. If the desks have not arrived we will improvise something for the time being.\n\nThe blueprints have been adhered to except for minor details. A trap door was made in the ceiling of the hall to permit access to the chimneys below the roof, and another in the floor to permit access to the foundations. The cupboard in one of the cloakrooms was changed into a closet for the indoor toilet and another smaller cupboard built in one of the cloakrooms to take the cleaning equipment. One other temporary change has been made. The partition between the two classrooms has been left out. This can be put in later if necessary. But the main criticism I would make of the plans is in the small size of the classrooms. Each classroom will accommodate only about fifteen children. It seems foolish to have two teachers for only thirty children. Miss Herschel is anxious to have a space at the back of the room which can be used for games and more informal types of work so it seemed sensible to leave out the partition. As a matter of fact there was not enough wallboard to build it in any case.\n\nWhile filling in time till the second boat came Mr. Hayward had two small toilets (outdoor) made and a small storehouse for keeping storm windows, extra equipment, etc. Both toilets and storehouse are to my mind too small. We had some spare materials but Mr. Hayward is extremely economical and did not want to build them even as large as they are.\n\nThe school has been built on the northwest corner of the N.T. lot about thirty or forty feet from each boundary. The front door faces the village to the north; the classroom windows face the south to allow maximum light in the winter. Miss Herschel suggests that awnings be procured for the classroom windows instead of blinds. The arrangement of the windows for ventilation makes it difficult to use blinds, but there should be some means of protection from the direct sun in spring and summer. I think that outside awnings are a very good idea. Also, eavestroughing should be procured and sent in at the first opportunity as the water from the roof will quickly undermine the foundations. I am trying to get ditches dug this fall to drain the land as much as possible. The teacher's room has windows giving an uninterrupted view of the river. There is plenty of room left on the property for other buildings and for a playground when we can get the ground levelled and drained.\"\nWe enclose a snapshot of a group in front of the new building. This is the only picture of the School we have at present but we are asking Mr. Dewdney to supply us with a set of photos of the several elevations. It will of course take time to get these.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHonorary-Secretary.\n\nCLF/J\n\nEnc.\n19th November, 1946.\n\nBernard F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nYour letter of 9th instant came to hand when I was absent from the office but I hasten to make reply.\n\nI regret that you have not been officially advised regarding the exact date on which Miss Herschel began her duties at Fort McPherson - but what we do know is that she arrived there on or before 15th August and the school was opened on September 3rd with twenty-five children.\n\nRe Forms sent to me by Mr. Hoey; these were forwarded to Miss Herschel with the request that she fill them in and return them to the Department. As this was a Departmental affair I assumed that Miss Herschel would attend to the matter. However I am forwarding to her the duplicate forms which you have sent in with a covering letter asking her to attend to the matter. It may well be in the rush and turmoil first of getting away and then arriving at Fort McPherson she has delayed attending to these matters.\n\nIt should be remembered that there has been little opportunity for her to send out mail on account of the freeze-up. We have heard nothing from her since September. I expect when the mail comes out next month you will find that she has filled in the forms, etc., as required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of The Arctic.\n\nP.S: Our Honorary-Secretary is writing to you regarding this matter also.\nOttawa, 25 November 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Fort McPherson Indian Day School - No.903\n\nMiss Catherine Herschel has been appointed teacher of this school effective August 15, 1946, at a salary of $157.00 a teaching month. We have not yet received the usual forms from her but we understand that she is single without dependents.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would forward a cheque for the amount due her for the period August 15th to November 30th, 1946. Her name should be placed on the regular monthly pay-list and retained there until further advised by this division. Her post office address is:- Fort McPherson, Northwest Territories.\n\nfor Deputy Minister.\nOttawa, January 31, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Foster:\n\nIn my letter of January 29th regarding the Fort McPherson Day School, I regret very much that we mentioned the name of Bishop Geddes.

The Bishop asks me to advise you that he is glad to contribute the use of the land for this purpose and has no desire to ask for any payment or to transfer it to the Government.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nCLF/b\nOttawa, February 21st, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nAs previously advised Bishop Fleming is slowly recovering from a Coronary Thrombosis and, in his absence, I have opened your letter of 20th instant on the subject of Miss Herschel of the Indian Day School at Fort McPherson. I must confess to no little surprise at the Diocese being approached again because I thought it had been settled that this school was entirely a Government affair and that we, and our missionary particularly, must keep \"hands off\" - see your letter of 29th January, 1947 and my reply of 3rd February, 1947.\n\nHowever your question appears to be quite proper since Miss Herschel was engaged (on behalf of the Government) by Bishop Fleming. I have now looked over his correspondence on the subject and find that his conception of the relationship of the school and its teacher to the Mission was quite different from what was finally laid down in the concluding paragraph of my letter of 3rd February, referred to above. Indeed he refers to her in one letter as \"a member of the staff of this Diocese\" and, in another letter, he lays down, practically as a requisite, that she should consult with and depend on the Missionary in connection with any difficulties with parents. It was in line with this idea that it was arranged that she should equip herself with the Diocesan uniform and also that the Diocese paid for her transportation to Fort McPherson.\n\nMr. Hoey advised the Bishop 18th April, 1946 that salary would be $130. per month plus bonus and that regulations did not permit of payment of travelling expenses. Nothing was said about term of\nMr. Neary\n\n22nd March, 1947.\n\nservice, as far as I can see, in the correspondence but the Bishop had a number of interviews with Miss Herschel and may have discussed such matters as travelling expenses, term of service etc., at one of these.\n\nIn view of the status of the school, as laid down at present, I would see no obligation on the part of this Diocese to undertake the payment of Miss Herschel's travelling expenses from the field.\n\nThe Bishop has recovered to the extent that we can consult him occasionally about non vexatious matters. I expect to see him in a few days and he may be able to recall exactly what his understanding was regarding term of service and also he can probably confirm, or otherwise, my viewpoint on the matter of travelling expenses. I dare say a further delay in your replying to Miss Herschel's letter will not matter very much.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nCLE/b\nDiocese of The Arctic\nFOUNDED 1853\nTHE RIGHT REV.

If this arrangement is to be continued and if the Diocese will be obliged to pay her transportation out, surely we have done the Dewneys an injustice in saying they had no right of supervision.\n\nHowever, for the moment, it will probably be enough to say that the term of service as set by the Bishop with Miss Herschel was the usual one or four years. Payments of passage out, furlough pay and clothing allowance are contingent on completing the four year term of service.\n\nIn view of the lack of sympathy existing between Miss Herschel and the Missionary, would you mind, when answering her letter telling her confidentially that there is every possibility that the present Missionary will not return to Fort McPherson after coming out this summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nCLF/b\nFor Mr. Pherson File\n\nCost of Construction $13,000.00\n(Two small rooms plus teacherage)\n\nTeacher's Salary $1570 per annum\nOttawa, March 7, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- MR.

Herschel who holds a first-class permanent teacher's certificate and has 18 years of teaching experience. She teaches Grades 1, 2 and 4, and there are 25 pupils enrolled, all of whom were present at the time of the visit. They were classified as follows:\n\n|       | Boys | Girls |\n|-------|------|-------|\n|       | H.B. | White | H.B. | White |\n| Beginners | 3    | 3     |      |       |\n| Grades 1 | 3    | 1     | 3    | 1     |\n| Grades 2 | 3    | 1     | 2    | 1     |\n| Grades 4 | 3    | 1     |      |       |\n\nI tested the children to obtain some idea of the progress they had been making. The reading was average, the writing fair, but the children appeared to be very interested in their school work. I had a meeting with all of the Indians at the settlement. They spoke very highly and with appreciation of the work which Miss Herschel has been doing. Personally, I gathered the impression that Miss Herschel's interests were not fully with her work. However, this may be an unfair judgment. She is soon to be married, and she has requested to continue her teaching post until the end of March, 1948, when her husband will be returning from his trapping line in the Yukon.\n\nThe school receives radio broadcasts from Edmonton and Watrous. There is no film projector available. The children receive a medical examination at the beginning of each school year and some have been X-rayed for T.B. One of the local residents has donated to the school a small organ, and it is a great asset. While at the school I listened to some very fine singing by the children. The High Roads to Reading series of readers is used in this school. I am of the opinion that more satisfactory results would be obtained with basic readers, and would suggest that the school be furnished with same.\n\nI noticed that there were no fire extinguishers in this school, and would suggest that the same be furnished as soon as possible, since there is considerable danger of fire due to the fact that gasoline lamps are used. The children have been placing the fuel oil in the burner, with the result that the floor about the stove is being ruined. This chore should be attended to by an adult. I noticed that there\nwere four window ventilators which are useless because there are no hinges attached thereto, so I would suggest that hinges be procured and installed on same. There are a considerable number of cracks in the floor as the result of shifting in the foundation caused by frost pressure. This item should also receive attention.\n\nJ. W.

SPECIAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\nList any special qualifications you have for Indian work:\n\nPatience and interest in the welfare of the Indians.\n\nVI. REFERENCES and INSPECTOR'S REPORTS\n\nPlease attach copies of references and your latest Inspector's Report (if any).\n\nVII. I therefore request, in view of my qualifications and experience as detailed above, that I be classified as a Grade teacher and that my salary as a teacher in the Indian Day School for the 1947-48 academic year be set at $ according to the salary schedule.\n\nI understand (i) that all salary increases are clearly described in the schedule regulations as for \"satisfactory service\", (ii) that therefore it will be necessary for the Indian Affairs Branch to carefully consider School Inspectors' and other reports concerning my teaching service.\n\nNote: Details of our salary schedule are available in our offices. If the application is sent in, we will inform you of the salary you will receive.\n\n(date).\nThe school at Telegraph Creek\u2014while not an Indian school, was, with the exception of two white children, entirely Indians and half-breeds. There was an enrollment of forty-eight.\n\nI have no inspector's report for this school as the inspector did not visit the school. However, the district nurse was there and I feel sure that either she or the government agent\u2014at that time\u2014would give me good references.\n\nThe Indian agent in Telegraph Creek\u2014Mr. R. Sampson\u2014was the one who suggested that I might enjoy teaching under the Indian Dept.\u2014and stated that at any time I could get a reference from him.\n\nOwing to the length of time it takes to get references from this town (at the present time there is no mail service until the river freezes) I will not wait to enclose any. However, if they are needed later, I will send for them.\n\nI am not sure of my classification under the new scheme. My certificate was an Academic Permanent\u2014First Class. As I was out of the teaching profession for a few years, I do not know what my classification was. This can be verified by writing the...\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe your telegram of 8th instant concerning application of Joan Adams, Protestant school teacher. This matter was taken up with Canon L.G. Chappell, local Anglican minister. Excepting Old Crow, it was thought that Teslin warranted a day school more than any other place in the Yukon.\n\nAt this point there is a Roman Catholic and a Church of England seasonal school, both school rooms being in fairly good condition. There is an unoccupied Anglican teacheage in good condition. At this date there are very few Indian school-age children in the village - possibly four or five. Most of the children are out on trap-lines with their parents. It is thought that possibly a dozen children would remain behind with relatives if a day school were to be conducted.\n\nThere are, however, some 13 or 14 white and half-breed children without any school facilities whatever. I am informed that a petition was forwarded to the Territorial Government requesting a school at Teslin. In view of the situation at Teslin, I sent the following telegram to Archbishop W.R. Adams, Vernon, B.C.:\n\nHAVE APPLICATION FROM JOAN ADAMS FOUR YEARS EXPERIENCE TEACH PROTESTANT INDIAN SCHOOL STOP SUGGEST TESLIN BUT INDIAN SCHOOLAGE POPULATION THERE CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN WHITE AND HALF-BREED STOP POSSIBLE SOLUTION IN JOINT SCHOOL WITH TERRITORIAL GOVERNMENT ............\n\nThe following reply was received on 14th instant:\n\nHOPING CLERGY APPOINTMENTS TESLIN OLD CROW NEXT SUMMER SUGGEST TEMPORARY APPOINTMENT IF YOU PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH CREDENTIALS STOP SUBJECT TO ABOVE AGREE TESLIN JOINT SCHOOL WHERE ARE ADAMS AND EVANS NOW WOULD MYSELF INTERVIEW THEM IF POSSIBLE\n\nI do not know the Department's policy re joint schools, but in this case it appears to be a possible solution.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nEX'D.\n\nJanuary 9, 1948.\n\nDear Archbishop Adams:\n\nI have for answer your letter of January 5 concerning Miss Adams. If Miss Adams still wishes to go into the Yukon next September, I would advise that you consider her for the position of teacher at the Fort McPherson Indian Day School. We have just been advised by our Indian Superintendent at Fort Norman that Mrs. Miller, the teacher at McPherson, is resigning at Easter. As this school has been a great success, Mr. Hunter has suggested that every effort be made to replace Mrs. Miller.\n\nThe other teacher whom we have in mind for this school is Mr. Evans who formerly taught near Moose Factory, James Bay. He has just accepted a position at Chassawin, in northern Manitoba. I wrote recently to the Bishop of Brandon and asked if we could be definitely informed as to whether Mr. Evans still wishes to go into the Yukon as he originally requested. I will write you further when I hear definitely about Mr. Evans' plans. He has a Bachelor of Education degree from the University of Alberta and is particularly anxious to teach in the Yukon or Northwest Territories. He was sent to Chassawin because of the urgent need there for an Anglican teacher to finish out the winter.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMost Rev. W. R. Adams,\nArchbishop of Kootenay,\nVernon, B. C.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nJan 5th, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't. Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRe; Resignation of (Mrs.) C. Miller, Teacher,\nFort McPherson Day School.\n\nFurther to my wireless message to you of Dec.\n31st, I am attaching hereto the official letter of resign-\nation of Mrs. Miller, as received at this office to-day.\n\nAs may be noted Mrs. Miller asks that her\nresignation take effect on March, 31st, 1948.\n\nI may suggest, as plane schedules to and from\nFort McPherson are rather infrequent, that should a replacement\nfor Mrs Miller be obtained that it would be well to have\nthis teacher at Fort McPherson well in advance to Mrs.\nMiller's departure. In this regard I may mention that\naircraft leave Edmonton, Alta., on the first and third\nFriday of each month.\n\nIt may be mentioned that the above school has\nbeen very successful since opening and every effort to\nhave a replacement for Mrs. Miller would be greatly appre-\nciated by the Natives of Fort McPherson Settlement.\n\nL.C. Hunter,\nIndian Agent.\nJanuary 29, 1948.\n\nL. C. Hunter, Esq.,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nIt seems very unlikely that we will be able to obtain a replacement teacher for Mrs. C. Miller until September, 1948. The two teachers mentioned in our letter of January 9 should be available about that date. Miss Adams is now teaching and will not be free until June. Mr. Evans has also a post at our school at Chenaawin. However, we will do everything possible to locate another teacher.\n\nA copy of this letter is being sent to Archbishop Adams, in the event that he has someone else in mind for this school.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nCopy sent to Most Rev. W. R. Adams, Archbishop of Kootenay\nVernon, B. C.\nFebruary 9, 1948.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nMr. L. C. Hunter,\nSupt., Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nWe have now been advised that Mr. John Evans intends to remain at the Chenaawin Indian Day School and therefore he is no longer interested in the schools at Old Crow or Fort McPherson.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Archbishop W. R. ADAMS, VERNON, B.C.\nMarch 8, 1948.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nDear Archdeacon Marsh:\n\nLast summer we had some correspondence with Mr. Foster with regard to obtaining the services of another teacher for the above Indian Day School. At that time the teacher, Miss Catherine Herschel, was intending to get married and resign her position. However, we persuaded her to stay on as teacher after she was married.\n\nWe have now been advised by our Indian Superintendent at Fort Norman that she is resigning as of March 31, 1948.\n\nWe have been corresponding with Archbishop Adams with regard to the above school, due to a misunderstanding on our part that he was responsible for it. We have now been advised that we should correspond with your office concerning a replacement teacher.\n\nThe only teacher we have in mind who is willing to go in to the north is Miss Joan E. Adams of Kelowna, B.C. Miss Adams is 31 years of age and has five years' teaching experience in the B.C. Provincial Schools. She is a graduate of the University of British Columbia and holds a permanent high school teacher's certificate. She is particularly anxious to go into the north country and therefore we wrote to Archbishop Adams and requested that he interview her. Unfortunately, she is now teaching at a B.C. provincial school and will not be available until next summer. Therefore, we are faced with two alternatives with regard to this school -\n\n(a) to have it closed from April 1 until June 30, 1948, and to then employ the services of Miss Adams or some other teacher as from 1 September, 1948,\n(b) that we now try to obtain the services of a teacher from April 1 to June 30, 1948.\n\nI would appreciate your comments on the situation at this school and would suggest that you write Archbishop Adams if you wish any further references with regard to Miss Adams.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nVenerable Archdeacon Donald B. Marsh,\nDiocese of the Arctic,\nThe Church House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\nMarch 10th,\n1948.\n\nDr. Bernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Services,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Neary:\n\nMany thanks for your letter of 6th instant regarding the Fort McPherson Day School.\n\nBishop Fleming feels that as the period between April and June is the time when the Indians are ratting there would not be any point in sending a teacher to Fort McPherson for two or three months.\n\nWe are taking up the question of Miss Joan Adams and will advise you accordingly in due course.\n\nThanking you,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(D.B. Marsh)\nArchdeacon.\nOttawa, March 15, 1948.\n\nMr. L. C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nYou will recall that I recently wrote to Archdeacon Marsh, of the Diocese of the Arctic, with regard to the nomination of another teacher for the Fort McPherson Indian Day School. I have now received a reply from him reading as follows:\n\n\"Many thanks for your letter of 8th instant regarding the Fort McPherson Day School.\n\n\"Bishop Fleming feels that as the period between April and June is the time when the Indians are ratting there would not be any point in sending a teacher to Fort McPherson for two or three months.\n\n\"We are taking up the question of Miss Joan Adams and will advise you accordingly in due course.\"\n\nBernard F.

Miller in charge. In my opinion this could be classed as a model Indian Day School for this country, as far as attendance is concerned. The natives of this Settlement appear to do everything in their power to assure the attendance of their children. This can be accounted for in two different ways. Firstly, the financial circumstances of the native of this district are better than average, secondly the Loucheux is considered the most intelligent type of Indian in the N.W.T.\n\nIn regard to the McPherson school, I have two suggestions to make for your consideration. The first is that a male teacher be obtained if possible, as it is believed he would be more capable of teaching handicraft and guiding in Welfare work. The second is that arrangements be made whereas the school term could start at June 1st, and continue until March 31st, the remaining time to be classed as holiday. This suggestion regarding the school term applies to all Indian Day schools in this part of the territory. During the months of April and May it is practically impossible to have the children attend school, this being the time when the Indians move with their families to the bush to take part in what is known as the Spring hunt. The results of this hunt could be classed as approximately seventy-five percent of the natives' yearly income, therefore this too, is an essential part of the children's education.\n\nL C Hunter\nIndian Agent\n\nCopied:\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-1, part 1)\nRETIREMENT FUND APPLICATION FORM\n\nDepartment: Mines and Resources, Indian Affairs Branch\nSuperannuation Division,\nDepartment of Finance,\nNew Post Office Building,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDate: March 31, 1948\n\nRETURN OF THE AMOUNT AT CREDIT OF THE UNDERMENTIONED EMPLOYEE IN THE RETIREMENT FUND IS REQUESTED.\n\nName: Miller (Surname)\nMrs. Catherine (Christian name in full)\n\n(In the case of a female employee married while in the service give maiden name also.)\n\nEmployed at Ft.

This school was erected three years ago and the Indians in the vicinity have been doing quite well under the former teacher. This teacher has now left our service due to the fact she is now married. It is noted from your application that you hold an Elementary Intermediate teaching Certificate, and have had four years teaching experience. On our revised salary schedule, this would entitle you to a salary of $168.00 a teaching month. For a school in the Northwest Territories you can also make application for the Northern living allowance of $100.00 a teaching month. It is necessary to provide such an extra allowance because of the very high cost of living.\n\nIf you are interested in this school at Fort McPherson, I would be pleased to hear from you and will gladly furnish further details.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

We have already appointed a teacher to this school since I last wrote you.\n\nWould you be interested in a school at Masset, Queen Charlotte Islands, British Columbia. This is a two-room school and we will have a vacancy for a junior teacher there. If you would like any further details, I would ask you to write to Major R. F.

Skjeie,\nStrathmore, Alberta.\nMy Lord:\n\nYou called me by telephone on Monday and read me the following wire you had received from Archdeacon Marsh at Aklavik:\n\n\"Between church and old mission definite fire hazard to all property STOP Graveyard is end of Lot 5 STOP Survey shows road allowance between this lot and Lot 3 STOP Suggest apply for allowance in return for part of Lot 3 which government record shows as on our land and which with Lot 4 has native houses on it STOP School is on Lot 2 STOP Quick reply desired.\"\n\nIt appears that the message from Archdeacon Marsh has reference to the Indian day school at Fort McPherson, N.W.T., and was prompted by our letter dated May 17th last addressed to Mr. H. L. Alcorn, Honorary Secretary, Diocese of the Arctic, copy of which is attached. The object of this letter was to ascertain whether additional land could be obtained as a playground and school gardens for the school in question.\n\nThere seem to be two matters requiring attention. The first is the site of the school. We understand that, when the Indian Affairs Branch paid the cost of the erection of the school, the Branch did not insist upon getting title for the site because it was understood you were to obtain title from the Hudson's Bay Company, the owner of Lot 2. The matter of the title has not been stressed because you had made the arrangement and the Indian Affairs Branch was awaiting your return to health so that this item could be settled in accordance with the understanding the Branch had with you. I believe that they will now correspond with you about the title.\n\nRight Reverend A.L. Fleming, D.D.,\nBishop of the Arctic,\nThe Church House, 604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\nThe second point is the grounds for recreation for the school children, and what we wanted to know was whether there was land available for this purpose. Our School Inspector seems to think that there should be about three acres to be used for recreational facilities and school gardens. You will know whether any part of the land which stands in the name of the Anglican Mission can be made available. A plan of the Fort McPherson settlement is enclosed.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.A.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated 7th instant File No. 135-2-1 (E.1) re the site on which the Fort McPherson Day School is situated.\n\nFirst, let me say that in reply to your letter dated 3rd February my Honorary-Secretary wrote to you on 17th February, 1947, stating that we would be glad to contribute the use of the land for the purpose intended but that we had no desire to ask for any payment or to transfer it to the Government.\n\nThe land was donated to us by the Hudson's Bay Company for the purpose of erecting a day school thereon. At that time the Government did not see its way to establish a school on its own responsibility and therefore it was necessary for us to take the initiative. Very soon, however, the Department of Indian Affairs agreed to pay for the cost of the school, etc., provided we assume all responsibility in connection with the same.\n\nMy Archdeacon is at Fort McPherson at the moment and will return in September. Perhaps then you would be kind enough to take the matter up with me.\n\nWith all kind wishes,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA. L. Fleming\nBishop of The Arctic.\nThe Diocese of the Arctic\n\nThe Church House\n604 Jarvis Street\nToronto 5, Canada\n\nJuly 6th, 1948.\n\nR. A.

I am sending a wire to Archdeacon Marsh to confer with your representative and then submit a plan likely to be agreeable both to you and to us.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention to the matter and with personal regards.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n'sgd' A.L.

The names of only two children, Bertha and Margaret MacDonald, are shown on this return. In reviewing previous returns, I find that on the return for the quarter ended December 31st, 1925, the names of only three children were shown and on the return for the quarter ended September 30th, 1925, only the same names appear as on the return for the quarter ended March 31st.\n\nThe very small attendance at this school hardly justifies the Department in making an allowance for a teacher at Fort MacPherson. I should be pleased if your Lordship advises me if you are conversant with conditions at this place and at the same time let me know, if possible, whether or not the MacDonald children are Indians.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

You have not mentioned the June Quarter which I understand show a much better average attendance and which I hope has now reached you. While it is true that the numbers actually attending the day school is oftentimes very small, it must be remembered that the school is kept open every day for all in the vicinity and that help is given to the children who are living at a distance by providing them with school material which is made use of by other members of the family who have passed through the school either at Macpherson or at the Hay River Boarding School. As a result of the above there is more English spoken at Macpherson than at any other point along the Mackenzie River.\n\nIn reply to your enquiry I have to state that the Macdonald children are not Indians.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nBishop.\nOttawa, October 15th, 1926.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the Fort McPherson Day School.

Sayer, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDiocese of Mackenzie River,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ont.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., Feb. 7, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI attach hereto Day School Return from the St. Matthew's Day School, Fort McPherson for quarters ending September 30th and December 31st, 1934.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 22, 1935.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of a return showing the attendance at St. Matthew's Mission, Fort McPherson, during the quarters ended September 30th and December 31st, 1934.\n\nThe last return received from this school covered the period June 30th, 1930, and, as no returns have been received since that time, the Department presumed that the school was closed and, consequently, no money was provided in our appropriation for the salary of a teacher at this point. Are all the children mentioned on the return recognized as Treaty Indian children?\n\nIn reviewing the December return, it is noted that two of the children are only three years of age; three are four years old; three are five years of age and three are six years old. In other words, eleven out of the twenty-six pupils whose names are shown on the return are under school age.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland.\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. W. A. M. Truesdell,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T. Mar. 25th.1935.\n\nJ.D. Sutherland Esq.,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReceived your letter of February 22nd, F I35-2-3 and note queries therein.\n\nAll the children of the Fort McPherson School under the C.of England Missionary there have always been recognized as Treaty children belonging to Treaty Indians.\n\nYou state that the last return received from this school was for the period ending June 30th, 1930, but I have been sending these returns through our Secretary each year since I became Indian Agent for the Fort Simpson and Good Hope Agencies and perhaps you have obtained them under the name Fort McPherson School. For the two years that I have administered the two Agencies these returns have been sent in under the Reverend Johnston's name but as he was replaced last year they are now being sent in by the Reverend T. Greenwood.\n\nI doubt whether any of the children in this school are as young as three years of age and I believe that if their ages were learned they would all be of nearer the requisite school age. However Dr Urquhart of Aklavik examines these children and would have a better idea of their ages and on my Annuity paying trip I will inquire into this matter fully for you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, August 30, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 25th regarding the Fort McPherson School, I beg to say that no payment has been made pending receipt of a report which you intimated you would forward following the treaty paying trip.\n\nThe last payment made to the Fort McPherson School was in 1930, and no returns are on our file from that time until June, 1934. The Department presumes that the school was closed, and, consequently, no money was provided in our Appropriation for the salary of a teacher at this point.\n\nI am now in receipt of a return for the quarter ended June 30th, 1935. This contains the names of 39 children, but only three of them attended for more than 11 days. I think you will agree that there is not a great deal of value in a school where 36 out of 39 children attend for only 11 days or less during the quarter. Please let me know if the children on the return are all recognized as treaty Indian children. You might also state what amount a month you consider fair to allow the teacher. When your report in this regard is received, the matter of payment will receive further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. W. A. M. Truesdell,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T., September 20, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of August 30th, file 13542-2, in connection with Fort McPherson School.\n\nThis school has been kept open for various periods during the last few years to my certain knowledge, and at various times I have sent quarterly returns signed by myself to the Department.\n\nOn visiting McPherson this Summer I found that the school had been kept open from New Year's until the end of June and I have already forwarded to the Department the quarterly return for the Fort McPherson School for the quarter ending March 31, 1935, and the record for that quarter seems to be a very good one.\n\nI believe the present Incumbent of the position as Church of England Missionary at Fort McPherson is a sincere, capable teacher, and very earnest to make the school a successful and profitable one for the Indian children. As his wife a graduate of Toronto University in medicine of 1935 is now with him I am sure we can expect a very successful school to be maintained there. Therefore, I would recommend that a salary of $25.00 per month be allowed Reverend T. Greenwood for each month on which the school is kept open. This, of course, to be dependent on the number of children attending regularly.\n\nThe children attending this school are all recognized as Treaty Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. Sutherland, Esq.,\nActing Sup't. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nFor some years a day school was conducted under the auspices of the Anglican Church at Fort McPherson, but returns were not received from the school from 1930 until the present year. It was, therefore, presumed that the school had been closed and no provision was made for the salary of a teacher at this point in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year.\n\nA recent letter from Dr. W.A.M. Truesdell, Indian Agent at Fort Simpson, N.W.T., points out that the present Church of England missionary at Fort McPherson is a very capable teacher and that he has reopened the Fort McPherson Day School and has been conducting it since January 1st of this year. Returns have been forwarded for the period January 1st to June 30th, last.\n\nDr. Truesdell recommends salary at the rate of $25 a month for the period the school is open. I would appreciate your concurrence in making this allowance.\n\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n### DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\n#### TEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nMarch 31st, 1935.\n\nFor Quarter Ended June 30th, 1935.\n\n| Name of Teacher | Name of School | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to Which Cheque is to be Sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Tom Greenwood   | Fort McPherson Day | $25.00 a month         |            |                                      |\n\nMarch qr. - Amt. due . . . . . . $75.00\nJune qr. - \" \" . . . . . . . . $75.00\nAmt. due for above 2 qrs. . . . $150.00\n\nDraw cheque in favour of teacher and send to:\nDr. W.A.M.

Should Bishop Fleming be interested in obtaining oil heaters on the basis of \"as is where is\" the cost of transportation would appear to be a consideration, as the nearest point where oil heaters are available, according to latest records, is at Fort Nelson in northern B.C., or at Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.\n\nFor your further information heaters have been reported as surplus at the following points:\n\nFort Nelson\nFort St. John\nGrande Prairie\nEdmonton\nPrince Rupert\nWhitehorse\n\nThere are no heaters listed as available at Norman Wells, which is the main source of the Canol Project. I trust this information will be of service to you, but regret we cannot give a more satisfactory answer to Bishop Fleming's request.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWAR ASSETS CORPORATION\n\nAssistant Sales Manager - Regions\n\nTPS: jes\nOttawa, May 10, 1946.\n\nDear Bishop Fleming:\n\nWith reference to your letter to Mr. Hoey, in regard to securing oil heaters through the War Assets Corporation, you were advised in official letter of April 30 regarding the first reply we received.\n\nToday we received the enclosed letter, which is forwarded for your information.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

We have received no acknowledgement of receipt of these accounts, apart from a routine enquiry for particulars of oil heaters by the Welfare and Training service department, and as far as we have ascertained none of these accounts have been paid. Certainly none of the accounts which we thought expedient to pay ourselves, aggregating $822. to-date, have been paid.\n\nSome of the suppliers have been enquiring regarding delay and indeed the delay seems overly great even for a Government department.\n\nI am expecting the Bishop back from the Eastern Arctic in a week or so and wish to be able to bring him up-to-date in this and other matters.\n\nThanking you for information on this subject.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonorary-Secretary.\n\nCLF/b\n12th August, 1946.\n\nR.A.

For example, the T. Eaton Co. Ltd., Edmonton have written and they have kindly agreed to hold the matter until 1st September by which date they expect to hear from you.\n\nI know full well that owing to the holiday season reducing the staff, etc., it must be difficult for your department to keep up-to-date regarding accounts rendered, etc. On the other hand I do think that some attention should be paid to this matter and I would be very grateful to you if you would be so kind as to take such action as will cause these accounts to be paid.\n\nTrusting this will find you in good health and with kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of The Arctic.\nAug. 29, 1946.\n\nR.A.

Before accepting the shipment from the Railroad Company or Trucking Company it is your duty to assure yourself that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages and their condition. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company or Trucking Company will be duplicated free of charge by us on the following conditions only:\n\n1st. The consignee must not give the Railroad Company or Trucking Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is any shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee can give a receipt for the goods if the Railroad Agent or Trucking Agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and the nature of the damage. The original freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company or Trucking Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company or Trucking Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight receipt.\n\n2nd. When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\n3rd. When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced.\n\nNOTE: In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit in the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the piece. If several styles of desks, be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give immediate service.\n\n4th. All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within thirty days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad, Express or Trucking Company, as explained in paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\n5th. We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe furniture manufactured under this contract was constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and was in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp room or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature.\n\nN.B.

The coding is as follows:- 906-76-12-415.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIMPORTANT - Caution Notice\n\nPLEASE READ CAREFULLY\n\nACCEPTANCE OF SHIPMENT AND BREAKAGE\n\nThe goods covered by the attached invoice were receipted for by the Railroad Company or Trucking Company as having been received by them in good condition and properly packed. Before accepting the shipment from the Railroad Company or Trucking Company it is your duty to assure yourself that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages and their condition. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company or Trucking Company will be duplicated free of charge by us on the following conditions only:\n\n1st. The consignee must not give the Railroad Company or Trucking Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is any shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee can give a receipt for the goods if the Railroad Agent or Trucking Agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and the nature of the damage. The original freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company or Trucking Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company or Trucking Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight receipt.\n\n2nd. When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\n3rd. When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced.\n\nNOTE: In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit in the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the piece. If several styles of desks, be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give immediate service.\n\n4th. All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within thirty days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad, Express or Trucking Company, as explained in paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\n5th. We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe furniture manufactured under this contract was constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and was in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp room or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature.\n\nN.B. We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products.

These invoices were sent to you in our letter of 30th May and further referred to as to freight $7.00 in our letter of 12th July, in both of which we pointed out that the cheques should be remitted to this Diocese. We are asking the T. Eaton Company to re-imburse us for the amount.\n\nWe are also endeavouring to get a receipted bill for the $7.00 freight item but we seriously doubt if they can produce it.\n\nThis prompts us to inquire about other accounts which we have paid and for only one of which we have received payment from you. This was for $225.00 covering Architects' fees, account for which was sent to you on 2nd August.\n\nHowever, on 20th June we sent you a receipted C.N.R. invoice for transportation of the carpenter which we asked you to pay to this Diocese.\n\nThere are also of course accounts subsequent to these, payment of which should come to this Diocese as requested in our several letters sent to you, but we thought it well to take the matter up with you in view of the mistake over the Eaton account.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonorary-Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-5, part 1)\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nTREASURY ONLY\n\nPay to: T.

The only item at the present time that we consider unpaid is their invoice of August, 1946, stamped in your office on Sept. 14, for $5. We have not yet received the receipt from the transportation company for this expenditure.\n\nAttached is a statement of the payments that we have made to the Company.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

Will you be so kind as to tell the officer in your department who is looking after this matter that there is nothing in our letter of 28th December which refers to any further payment to the Clark Lumber Company.

This was submitted first in our letter of October 19 and was referred to in our letter of December 12 to which you replied that you had no such letter in your file. We sent a duplicate on December 19 and wrote a reminder on January 20, February 3 and February 6. In addition to these there are several letters regarding a refund of freight which, as finally determined, reduced the original amount of this account from $188.80 to $182.76. No replies have been received.\n\nThis was a thankless task undertaken for the Government but to deliberately ignore our letters is surely to add insult to injury. I know of course that you personally do not attend to every detail of your Department but I must try to find some way of reaching you personally as I know you would not sanction such discourtesy.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nCLF/J\nOttawa, February 27th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Foster:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th inst., I regret very much that there has been some delay in paying the account to which you refer.

Before accepting the shipment from the Railroad Company or Trucking Company it is your duty to assure yourself that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages and their condition. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company or Trucking Company will be duplicated free of charge by us on the following conditions only:\n\n1st. The consignee must not give the Railroad Company or Trucking Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is any shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee can give a receipt for the goods if the Railroad Agent or Trucking Agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and the nature of the damage. The original freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company or Trucking Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company or Trucking Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight receipt.\n\n2nd. When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\n3rd. When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced.\n\nNOTE: In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit in the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark you will find on the piece. If several styles of desks, be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give immediate service.\n\n4th. All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within thirty days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad, Express or Trucking Company, as explained in paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\n5th. We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe furniture manufactured under this contract was constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and was in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp room or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature.\n\nN.B. We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products. If you have any difficulty in the installation and desire further information, your request will receive immediate attention.

Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nReferring to your letter of 6th instant. There was a small amount of lumber left over but I had not understood it to be of anything like the value put upon it by Miss Herschel. How she arrives at such a sum one can only guess. Unfortunately there is a marked lack of good feeling between her and our missionary and while, of course, we would not attribute her report to malice, but rather to her feeling of duty as a Government employee, she would not tend to understate the case.\n\nThe Bishop and I discussed, during the building operations, of asking for an amount to compensate the Diocese for the services rendered in the way of oversight and financing from the planning stage to completion of the building and its furnishing. This to include local supervision by our Missionary. On consideration, however, it was decided not to do so but when, later on, it developed there was a small amount of lumber left over we wrote November 20th to Mr. Dewdney as follows, \"I think we need not press the matter of your work and supervision on the Government. What would you think of taking over the surplus lumber as an offset to that and to the services of the Diocese in financing?\". He does not seem to have answered this query but to have taken it as authority to use the lumber. Later on we learned that there were two kegs of nails left over and, as we were in need of all the nails we could get for the new day school we are building this summer at Tuktoyaktuk, we instructed our Missionary to ship them to that point. We have no information regarding possible surplus of roofing, building paper and paint.\n\nWe are sending a copy of this letter to the Rev. A.S. Dewdney so that he can inform us, as far as he can judge, what would be the value of the surplus material. When I have received this information I shall be glad to account to you for the amount involved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nGLF/b\nOttawa, May 17th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Foster:\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant enclosing invoice for twenty additional desks which you have ordered from the Globe Furniture Co., for the Fort McPherson Day School. Our records give us the following information,\n\n1. Your letter August 12, 1946 - Globe Furniture Co. account $266.79 included 2 teachers' desks, 2 teachers' chairs, 10 desks #3.\n\n2. Your letter September 20, 1946 - Globe Furniture Co. account $313.35 covered 10 desks #1, 10 desks #5.\n\nBoth the above accounts have been paid. It shows that thirty desks have already been forwarded to this school.\n\nIs the account you have forwarded recently a duplicate of the one forwarded with your letter of September 20th, or have you ordered another twenty desks to make a total of fifty?\n\nFor your information, I may say that we recently received the March quarter return from this school and the enrolment is only eighteen. This is the largest number enrolled since the school was erected and, consequently, it would appear that the thirty desks already at the school should be sufficient to meet requirements for some time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard M.

The latter was forwarded to you by us in good faith. I cannot find any correspondence with the Company regarding the increased cost. It would seem to me that the price should be the same but the Company might be able to show cause to the contrary. I suppose the best thing to do would be for you to return the bill for $313.35 and the credit note so that we could go back to the Company with them or possibly your department would do that direct as we are acting only as an intermediary.\n\nI am sorry that it did not occur to us to look up the correspondence before sending this latest invoice to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-5, part 1)\nOctober 4th, 1947.\n\nR.A.

Your order number is 34118.\n\nI understand that these were shipped last year but for some reason or other, arrived too late for the Waterways transportation. These desks were, therefore, reshipped to fill various urgent orders in the west. We have received a credit note of $313.35.\n\nThis latter shipment is to replace, I presume, the previous shipment. However, there is a difference in the invoice of $20.83. This, apparently, is due to increased prices of desk chairs. I feel that since the delivery is uncontrollable by us that this increased price should be absorbed by the company.\n\nKindly let me have your views on this.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Treas. Diocese of The Arctic,\nChurch House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Foster:\n\nYour letter of May 7th arrived last night, and I hasten to answer.\n\nIf you will look over our correspondence further you will see that I did answer the point raised re lumber left over from the school. I quote from my reply dated December 11th, \"I would suggest that it would be very handy if we should take over the balance of lumber and other supplies in lieu of any claim for the work and worry of the office or myself. Lumber can always be used. Incidentally I wrote the Bishop that I had already used some of the lumber to make us benches for the Indian Room. All our chairs had to be lent to the school when the desks did not arrive. But there is still a useful amount left\".\n\nIn reply to this you wrote in your letter of January 6th, \"It had also occurred to me that we should take over the surplus of the lumber and other supplies as an offset to any claim that we might have for your work and supervision and certainly no amount of material so left over could compensate this office for the annoyance and trouble handling the matter so I think we will just let the matter rest unless, of course, the Government should ask us about it. Incidentally I am satisfied that the building cost the Government very much less than if they had undertaken the work themselves but, of course, we need not look to any thanks for that\".\n\nI took it from this reply that we would take over the lumber and other surplus supplies, and let the matter rest there as far as compensation to ourselves was concerned.\n\nI told Miss Herschel, probably some time in March that we were taking over the lumber left from the school building, using the term \"lumber\" in a general sense and without any intention of distinguishing it from paint, tar paper, etc. I mentioned it to her again later on, and neither time did she question my right to do so. She had ample time to wire or write out about the matter, or to consult Dr. Harvey on his visit here before I took the lumber etc., over.\nOnly one incident occurred as we were ready to leave the school. She came out and saw the paint loaded on the tractor, and asked me if I was taking that, as she was supposed to get the outside of the school painted this summer. I replied that I had been told by the office that we were taking over all materials left over from the building of the school. There was only \"inside\" paint left. I added that she might remember that we had lent the school a large amount of Mission paint in order that the work might not be delayed, and it had not yet been returned. She replied, \"Yes, I know that\". This is the sum total of any conversation I have had with her on this matter, and I had no idea that any such question had been raised until your letter yesterday.\n\nI have mentioned already that the paint was ours without any question by reason of our loan to the school. In addition, we supplied two sheets of tentest or donnecona board from our supply here, when the school supply ran out. This has not been replaced. In addition to the hours I spent checking freight, sorting it, hiring the men, and all the rest of it, the school is under an obligation to us for being able to run at all this winter. No desks had arrived, as the boat bringing them was frozen in at Aklavik (they finally arrived today). We supplied the school with a large collapsible table belonging to the W.A., with three smaller tables from the Mission house, and twenty-five chairs, most of them almost new. Many of these are now in bad shape, with rungs broken, and the table is very wobbly. (This was a specially made table with heavy removable plywood top, about 5' x 10', used by the women to sew and cut out, and by us to sort the mail - we have been badly handicapped by the lack of it all winter). In addition, we turned over to them what school materials we had around. I wrote last fall what a ludicrously small supply of materials was sent in. We borrowed Readers from the school at Aklavik. In addition, we turned over to Miss Herschel thirty or forty books of our own, or rather Michael's, most of them children's classics in good condition.\n\nMy own personal reaction is one of some resentment. The Government departments are forgetting the immense debt they owe the Missions for all the educational work carried on by our Missionaries here and elsewhere for many years past with no remuneration whatever. I have been handling the rations for the I.D. for ten years, and other men before me. Mrs. Dewdney handles all the vital statistics here, and carried on the medical work for seven years without remuneration, as well as the first year's work of organizing the Family Allowance. We often have to handle matters that are really the concern of the Police, because there is no Policeman stationed here, and no one else willing to accept responsibility. I do not see why we should continue to do so.\n\nOne further note about the disposal of this lumber and other supplies. How Miss Herschel made her guesstimate of their value, I do not know, but I think it is exaggerated. I have used, in finishing the interior of the Church approximately the following:-\nMr. Foster\n\n6th June, 1947.\n\n1 bdle. Cedar Siding (for baseboards)\n4 bdles. 2 x 2 x 12\n10 bdles. 1 x 6 rough tongue and groove siding\n1 bdle. fir boards 1 x 6 x 12\n1 \" \" 1 x 4 x 12\n1 \" 1 x 6 x 12\n2 or 3 lbs. each of 2\u00bd\" fin., 2\" fin., 1\u00bd\" shingle nails\n2 boards 2 x 6 x 12\na few scraps not bundled.\n\nOn hand at the present time are the following supplies.

DEWDNEY (SIGNED)\nFirst Paragraph of the Rev. A.S. Dewdney's letter dated June 8th, addressed to Mr. C.L. Foster, Honorary-Treasurer, Diocese of The Arctic, 604 Jarvis Street, Toronto, Can.\n\n\"I have written separately and fully on the matter of the building supplies left over from the school, so I will not refer to it further. I would suggest however, that if they disallow our claim to these, that a bill should be put in for the work done at the office and by myself here. I put in many hours of work while construction was going on and afterwards to get the grounds in order, and the schoolroom equipped, in lighting fires for some weeks at 7 A.M. each morning, putting in broken window panes, fixing doors, fixing oil heaters when they got out of order and many other jobs. I did this cheerfully and willingly to help out, with no thought of payment. At local prices of labour, this would amount to a considerable sum\".\nDiocese of The Arctic\n\nFOUNDED 1883\nTHE RIGHT REV. ARCHIBALD LANG FLEMING, D.D., BISHOP\n\nH. L.

I suggest you get in touch with the Government immediately on this, as I remember that Dr. Harvey during the winter, when making our requisitions for the school, included twenty desks, and it looks as though there might be two shipments coming along\".\n\nThis is for your information. We know nothing about Dr. Harvey's requisitions, of course, and think it rather unlikely that an order would be placed at his instance without it coming to our knowledge. At any rate there is as yet no evidence, among the invoices so far presented to you by us, that any desks have been ordered by anyone other than ourselves.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nCLF/b\n12th June, 1947.\n\nB.F. Neary, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nFort McPherson Day School\n\nWith further reference to your letter of 6th May, I now enclose copy of the Rev. A.G. Dewdney's letter of 6th instant and an extract from that of 8th idem. These speak for themselves. As all the invoices for materials are in the hands of your department I am unable to make an estimate of the value of the surplus material nor on the other hand can I place an estimate on the value of mission owned materials, let alone labour, used in and on the school.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that Mr. Dewdney is holding the bulk of this material awaiting further instructions. We had previously asked him to send the surplus nails to Tuktoyaktuk where we are building a Day School the cost of which is to be defrayed by the Government (Department of Mines and Resources) while in a different department from yours I think it desirable that there should be no chance of shortage of nails at Tuktoyaktuk. I am therefore confirming my advices to Mr. Dewdney as the nails must go by the first boat. If you wish me to cancel such instructions please instruct me promptly.\n\nI await your instructions regarding the disposition of the remainder of the materials having due regard to all circumstances.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHonorary-Treasurer.\n\nCLF/b\nEnc.\nMr J W McKINNON  \nInspector of Schools  \nCare of DOCTOR J P HARVEY  \nA K L A V I K Northwest Territories\n\nPLEASE SPEAK DOCTOR HARVEY RE SUPPLIES OF LUMBER AND PAINT LEFT OVER AT FORT McPHERSON DAY SCHOOL -stop- UNDERSTAND MISSIONARY MR DEWINKY INTENDED USING SOME THESE ITEMS AT TUKTOYAKTUK SCHOOL -stop- PLEASE INVESTIGATE SITUATION AND ADVISE AS TO DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS\n\nBernard F Neary  \nIndian Affairs\n\nPhoned to:\nPhoned by:\nTime:\n\nORIGINATOR'S INSTRUCTIONS\n\nSIGNATURE | DEGREE OF PRIORITY | TIME OF ORIGIN\n---|---|---\n\nSIGNED\n\nCOPY 3\nOttawa, June 18, 1947.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nReference - your letter of June 12 -\n\nDear Mr. Foster:\n\nThe invoice for the desks referred to in the above letter is for the lot of 20 desks from the Globe Furniture Company.\n\nWe received a requisition from Mr. Indian Agent Harvey, dated March 21, 1947, for 12 kindergarten chairs and for 6 kindergarten tables.\n\nOur Departmental Purchasing Agent placed this order with the Vilas Furniture Company at Cowansville, P.Q. It was understood that this order was to be filled in early June and that these desks should now be on their way.\n\nIncluded in Dr. Harvey's requisition were items such as plates, cups, saucers, etc. These have also been ordered for shipment north. Once a school is established it is our practice to receive requisitions annually from the agent concerned for the supplies required by the teacher in the operation of the school. These are dealt with directly along departmental channels. I hope this clarifies the point which you have raised. If the desks ordered are found to be surplus, we can arrange to have them shipped to another school in the Northwest Territories for use there. I wish to thank you for your prompt passing along of the information in Mr. Dewdney's letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. C. L.

Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe thank you for your letter of June 3rd with reference to shipment of Movable Chair Desks to Fort McPherson, N.W.T., via Waterways transportation.\n\nLast fall when these desks missed the boat, the Secretary of the Diocese of the Arctic in Toronto called us and wanted to know what to do about it. The Railway Company also called us and said they could either store them or return them. After several phone calls, our Western representative decided to accept these and resold them. This part shipment missing the boat was due to circumstances beyond our control. We did not have the lumber to complete this order and had to make up the desks after receipt of the order, and whatever shipment we did make to this School previously we had in stock.\n\nWe cannot see why we should have to supply these desks this year again, at last year's prices. As you know, all material and labor costs have gone up. Even if the desks were kept out there and stored it would have cost you quite a bit more than the difference in the increase in price.\n\nWe trust that you will be able to take care of the invoice at the current prices.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nTHE GLOBE FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED,\nSales Department.\n\nM.J. Paleczny\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-5, part 1)\nOttawa, July 2, 1947.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 20, 1947, the Department is quite in favour of paying the increased invoice. However, in order that we keep our records complete in the simplest way, it is requested that a refund in cheque for $313.35 in favour of The Receiver General of Canada be forwarded to us. This will liquidate the payment we made last fall. We will then send you a cheque for $334.18 thus completing the transaction.\n\nTrusting that this meets with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBernard F.

McKinnon, Esq.,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nI thought you would like to know that the R.C.A. Victor record playing instrument has arrived in good condition. I am contacting the RCCS at Aklavik to ask them to install it for us.\n\nAfter my first night here I wrote to Mr. Hunter about the contraption which serves as a bed, but so far I have not heard from him about this. It may be that he will deal with the matter when he come to Fort McPherson next month. But in case he does not, I feel that I must tell you that I have not had a proper night's sleep on it ever since I came here. It is composed of two strips, which in the day time form the seat and back of a settee. At night, when they are in position for sleeping, there is a gap between these two strips, were the spring or the seat portion and the spring of the back portion are supposed to meet. In any case the seat strip is higher than the other one, and curves upwards. As there is no real mattress, but just springs with a small amount or padding, the draughts from the floor come up through the \"bed\". But one of the worst things is that it is impossible to tuck in the bed clothes, as the \"thing\" is in one piece and there is nothing to tuck them under.\n\nAt present I am recovering from a chill, and I feel that it was caused by the bed clothes slipping off and leaving me without cover.\n\nWhat can be done about it?\n\nI am sorry to trouble you with this, but I don't want to be ill and it would be lunacy to sleep on this during the winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n'sgd' E.

During his visit in the north country he called on Miss Hinds, Principal of the Fort McPherson Day School. He said that an ice house, storage space for rations and better living quarters were needed at this school. At present the teacher gets her ice from the local Royal Canadian Mounted Police Detachment, which according to Superintendent Martin is most unsatisfactory. He thought that living quarters in the Port Braeant day school were superior to those at Fort McPherson. As both schools are almost identical -- it would be an easy matter to make the living accommodation at Fort McPherson similar to that at Port Braeant.\n\nJ. W.

Hinds, Fort\nMcPherson Indian Day School,\nFort McPherson, N. W.

Hinds, teacher in the Indian Day School at Fort McPherson, N.W.T. This extract has to do with the purchase of an ice-house for school use.\n\nWe might mention that the matter of providing additional privies, referred to in the above extract, is receiving the attention of this Administration.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nExtract from a letter from Miss E. M. Hinds teacher in the Indian Day School at Fort McPherson, N.W.T. under date of November 30, 1948.\n\nAnother serious problem here is that many Indians do not use toilets. I wonder whether a few groups of public toilets might help to solve the problem. I am doing all I possible can to deal with the matter through education, but I expect it would take a hundred years to effect all that is desirable. Without enforcement by the Police I think little can be accomplished and Police are here so seldom that little can be done about enforcement.\n\nThe fact that many use the bushes near the river is one of the worst aspects, for in spring the river floods and those with no ice houses have to drink the flood water. That means me too at present though I hope that an ice house which has been offered to the school for $100.00 will be purchased before the spring floods.\nFort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nJ. W. J.\n\nFile 93.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon, Esq.,\nSuperintendent of Schools,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon,\n\nThank you for your letters of 24th and 26th June, and for the Phonograph Needle.\n\nI am delighted to know that one RCA Victor Record Player has been sent to the school, and also that chemistry equipment is on its way.\n\nI have been talking to Mr. Gilley about a school garden and have already made a small beginning, but we have no tools and I enclose a list of requirements.\n\nI am also sending a copy to Mr. Hunter.\n\nThe harmonium in the school belongs to Sara Linnan and she wants it back. She has had no payment for the loan of it and she says that Mrs. Miller promised payment.\n\nMrs. Dewdney wants to sell her piano for $300. It is a big old fashion, shabby instrument and not worth $300, in my estimation, but it would be useful in the school as the tone is not...\nfor the girls. My own sewing machine is in my baggage, which is coming by boat.\n\nThe idea at the back of my mind is to encourage, by this means, a desire to make their homes clean, new, and attractive. The sewing they do at home is all of one kind.\n\nI am glad some paint boxes arrived. It would be nice to have some large tubes of water colour paint, especially of the primary colours, to use for refilling boxes as colours get used up. These are preferable to refill pans of paint, as they can be used with saucers for palettes when co-operative efforts at painting scenery for plays are undertaken, though powder colours are perhaps better for this purpose.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours very truly,\nE. M. Harris.\nGarden tools required at Fort McPherson.\n\n2 spades\n2 digging forks\n1 scythe\n1 sickle\n1 carburettum stone for sharpening\n2 rakes (for seed bed)\n2 Dutch hoes\n1 draw hoe\n2 weed forks\n1 trowel\n1 hop-pitcher (a heavy tool like a huge nail for making holes for fencing, etc.)\nsmall mesh wire netting for keeping rabbits out. (I saw a rabbit on my doorstep yesterday morning.)\n1 watering can with rose.\nLater on\u2014in a year or two's time\u2014I hope a lawn mower will be required.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nOctober 10, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI refer to your letter of September 20, 1948, with copy of a letter written by Miss Hinds, teacher of Fort McPherson Indian Day School to the Inspector of schools Mr. J.W. McKinnon, attached. As you have requested my recommendations regarding the equipment as asked for by Miss Hinds, I will deal with each article separately.\n\nThe piano referred to by Miss Hinds is the property of Mrs. A.S. Dewdney, wife of the Anglican church Minister who was stationed at McPherson until the past year. I am of the opinion that the piano would be an asset to the McPherson school, but believe that the price of $300.00 is far in excess of the value of the instrument. It is considered that a fair price for this piano would be $150.00. If you are of the opinion that this piano would be useful at McPherson school, Mrs. Dewdney could be contacted at Coleman, Alberta, and an offer of $150.00 made to her for the instrument, which I imagine she would accept, as the cost of moving the instrument to some other point would be exorbitant.\n\nIt will be noted that on the estimates for the fiscal year 1948/50 that the cost of erecting an icehouse has been included. It may be possible to purchase a small building in the Settlement to be used for the purpose of ice storage and as I expect to be in McPherson after the freeze-up period, I will check on this matter and report to your office. I may mention that before any buildings are moved onto or erected on the school property that the matter of title to the property be settled, in this regard I refer to my letter, file C-31, dated Oct. 5th, 1948.\n\n- to page two -\nRegarding the handicraft material as requested by Miss Hinds, I believe that the knitting needles, wool, and cotton material could be purchased locally and if you are of the opinion that these articles should be supplied I will attempt to obtain a small quantity from the local Hudson's Bay Trading Post. Regarding the wood working equipment as mentioned by Miss Hinds, it is impossible to purchase such articles locally but as a quantity of such equipment was supplied to the C.E. residential school at Aklavik, I may possibly be able to obtain one of each article from that school and have it transferred to McPherson, in this way we could requisition for these articles to McPherson School in the coming year and replace the borrowed articles to Aklavik school. As I stated previously, I will be at McPherson and Aklavik sometime in November or December and will see if such arrangements will be possible.\n\nI note from Miss Hinds' letter that a list of garden tools required is attached. I may state that I was of the opinion that it was the responsibility of the Welfare Division of the Indian Affairs branch to supply such tools and therefore in submitting the annual estimates I included garden tools for McPherson settlement. It may be mentioned that these tools will not arrive at McPherson in time for early gardening, but it is believed that arrangements can be made to borrow tools for the planting of a garden and the tools ordered should arrive sometime in July. I may further mention that garden seeds have been ordered through the Welfare Division and that these were for the purpose of having Miss Hinds give the children and adults some instruction in this regard.\n\nMiss Hinds appears to be taking a very keen interest in assisting the natives. The former teacher at this point was unable to undertake any work of this kind, I was therefore not prepared when submitting the requisitions for this school, of the handicraft material etc., that would be required, however I feel that some of this material could be obtained locally and would ask that I be advised if purchase should be made.\n\nCopy, Miss Hinds letter attached.\n\nL.G. Hunter,\nSuperintendent,\nFt. Norman Agency.\nDecember 21, 1948.\n\nMr. L.C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nWe have just received your letter of October 10th and have given careful consideration to the second paragraph regarding the purchase of a piano.\n\nIt has not been our practice to supply a piano at a one room school for reasons that will readily suggest themselves to you. However, we are aware that in some of our one room schools there is a piano but it has been purchased either by the Indians or as a result of the teacher and the Indians combining and holding some kind of entertainment and raising the necessary funds.\n\nIt is noted that we will hear further from you regarding the cost of erecting an ice house. You may purchase a small quantity of handicraft material from the local Hudson's Bay trading post.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nOctober 5, 1948.\n\nCol. P.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI have been informed that the property on which the Fort McPherson Indian Day School is located, is owned by the Church Of England Mission. I do not know whether this information is correct as there is nothing on record at this office in that regard.\n\nAs it is intended to recommend that the property be fenced and that a small building be erected for use as an ice house, I considered before doing so that I would bring to your attention the information I received that the property was not that of the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nMay I please be informed if I am correct in the assumption that the property is not owned by the Indian Affairs Branch.\n\n[Signature]\nL.C.

B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter January 24th, 1949, regarding the living quarters of the Fort McPherson Indian Day School. Recently I visited Fort McPherson taking with me the plans of the Fort Brabant Day School. A comparison was made and little difference could be found between these two buildings other than Fort Brabant School having a cupboard in one corner of the teacher's room.\n\nIn my opinion the living quarters for a Welfare teacher at Fort McPherson are inadequate. It must be realized the teacher now at Fort McPherson is doing welfare work and this must be carried on within her one small room. As it is at the present time the furnishings in this room consist of a kitchen range, a bed, desk, studio lounge and chair. All this being confined within a space eleven feet by sixteen feet. It is very seldom that Miss Hinds has less than three or four Indians visiting her for welfare reasons.\n\nAt the present time there are absolutely no facilities for the teacher to bathe and make her toilet. In viewing the plans of the present school I am of the opinion that rooms of a comfortable size could be added at a minimum cost. In this connection I left the plans that your forwarded to me with Miss Hinds and a Mr. Fred Firth of McPherson with the request that Mr. Firth, who is a carpenter, submit a list of materials necessary for such an addition.\n\nUpon receiving the list of materials as required for this work I will submit same to your office.\nfor your consideration, and possible check and approval by the department engineers. This will be submitted as soon as possible so that the work, if approved, may be done during the summer vacation.\n\nI am definitely of the opinion that these improvements are imperative. On annual estimates this year I stated that it would be necessary to build a warehouse at this point. Should an addition be made to the teacher's quarters this would not be necessary.\n\nL. C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent.\nMarch 21, 1949.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nMr. L.G. Hunter,\nSuperintendent,\nIndian Agency,\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nFort Mohrson Indian Day School\nRef. your 6-31 (142) of March 4\n\nWe agree with your recommendation that the living quarters at this school be enlarged during the coming summer. I note that you are of the opinion that rooms of comfortable size could be added quite easily. I am pleased that you have located a carpenter in Fort Mohrson who will forward a list of materials required for this work. I presume that you will also recommend that Mr. Firth be employed as a foreman carpenter for these alterations. I also note that it will not be necessary to build a warehouse at this point if the addition to the teacher's quarters is made.\n\nAs soon as the bill of materials is received here and approved by our officials, we will send it to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for purchase orders. Therefore, you should include in your requisition complete shipping instructions.\n\nBernard F.

McPherson, N.W.T.\n\nMr. Johnston of the Department of Public Works was passing through Ft. Norman, N.W.T. recently, and his opinion was asked regarding the plans as submitted by Miss Hinds for the remodeling of the teacher's quarters at Ft. McPherson. Mr. Johnston had visited the Settlement of Ft. McPherson a few days previously to our conversation and was aware of the type of building at Ft. McPherson. On viewing the sketch as submitted by Miss Hinds, Mr. Johnston suggested that I allow him to take the original blue print of the school and the sketch, stating that he would have a draughtsman make a regular blue print out of the sketch and also submit an estimate of the cost that it would take to have the material supplied and the addition to the building erected.\n\nI may mention that the Department of Public Works are going to have a crew of carpenters at McPherson this coming summer to erect a building for the Forestry and Wildlife Service. It is my opinion that it would be an advantage to our Branch to have any work that we require at McPherson done while this construction crew are at that point.\n\nAs Mr. Johnston is submitting direct to your office, the original blue print of the school, the blue print of the suggested addition to the teacher's quarters, also an estimate of the cost, I would appreciate being informed of your opinion in this regard.\n\nL.C.

McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware the above school has been supplied by light from Gasoline and Kerosene lamps during the past years. On a recent visit to this school it was noted where a serious fire was averted due only to the quick action on the part of the teacher, when these gasoline lamps suddenly burst into flames.\n\nThis past summer, the Department of National Health & Welfare, Indian Health Services, erected a Nursing station at the settlement of Fort McPherson and installed a 3 K.V., 110 Volt A.C. Lighting Plant. As there is a surplus of power at the Nursing station, I took the matter up with Dr. Proctor of Indian Health Services regarding supplying of Power to our Indian Day school. Dr. Proctor was of the opinion that this could be arranged.\n\nIn this regard, I have attached a requisition covering all the requirements for having Electric power installed in our school. You will note that I have asked that fluorescent lights be supplied for the classrooms. It may be pointed out that during the winter months at McPherson, artificial light is necessary for the entire school day, therefore I hope that the requisition as submitted will meet with your approval.\n\nWith regard to the installation of these fixtures, we can no doubt make arrangements with Indian Health Services Branch, to obtain the services of an employee of theirs a Mr. M.F. Hall, who is an electrician.\n\nL.C. Hunter,\nIndian Superintendent.\n1 April, 1949.\n\nDirector\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nI am enclosing herewith, copy of letter dated March 29th from District Engineer W. J. Johnston. Attached to his letter are three prints showing a proposed extension for the teacher's living quarters for the school at Fort McPherson. There is also attached, blue print showing the school as originally built. Will you kindly let me have your comment and further instructions regarding the points brought up in Mr. Johnston's letter, at your earliest convenience.\n\nAAA/S.\n\nA/Chief Engineer.\n\nEncl 4 plans.\nR. BLAIS, CHIEF ENGINEER, DEPARTMENT PUBLIC WORKS, OTTAWA.\n\nI was recently in the Northwest Territories and, while there, met Mr. L. C. Hunter, Superintendent of Indian Agencies, who discussed the situation regarding the public school at Fort McPherson, N.W.T. Mr. Hunter stated that he had received an urgent request for enlargement of the teacher's quarters at this school and had sketches prepared of what was required. He handed me a blueprint of this school, and I offered to have a preliminary plan prepared incorporating the enlargement which was proposed.\n\nThis enlargement - 12' x 28' - has been included on a plan which is now being sent you. The new addition would provide two rooms as living quarters for the teacher, and leave the room in the existing building as a public office and a place where the teacher could meet the public.\n\nMy offer to have these sketches prepared was due to the infrequent mail service in the Lower MacKenzie area and also the fact that, if anything were to be accomplished in this school enlargement, prompt action would have to be taken by the Department of Education at Ottawa.\n\nUnder the Committee for Northern development, the Department of Public Works has been designated as the construction agency for Fort McPherson, and will this year have a carpenter crew at that place to construct a warden's cabin and auxiliary buildings for the Lands and Development Services branch of the Department of Mines and Resources. Thus, if it is decided to build this addition to the school, the carpenter crew when there could do so. The materials, however, must leave Waterways early in May in order to go on the first barges which are due to arrive at Fort McPherson on or about July 5th. If any materials do not arrive by the first barges, there is practically no hope of carrying out construction this year.\n\nNo Estimate of cost has been made for this proposed enlargement as I did not feel like taking the time to do so, if the scheme itself were not approved. However,\n\n(O V E R)\nif you wish further information in the matter, or have further instructions, would you please advise.\n\nI believe this matter should be drawn to the attention of Mr. Bernard F. Neary, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nThe blueprint of the school, as originally constructed, should also be sent to Mr. Neary.\n\nW. J. Johnston,\nDISTRICT ENGINEER.\nJanuary 6th, 1949.\n\nTWO-ROOM DAY SCHOOL AT TUKTOYAKTUK, N.W.T.\n\nMEMO\n\nSame as that built at Fort McPherson, N.W.T.\n\nPlease note that in these plans the division between the classrooms is shown. This was not built in construction in order to conserve heat through the whole building, while there was only need for one classroom.\n\nThe windows at Tuktoyaktuk are not exactly the same as those called for in the plan as they were obtained from salvaged (Waterways). However, there is an equal area of glass.\n\nFort McPherson is built according to plan.\nApril 8, 1949.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached requisitions covering janitor and teacher's supplies required at the above school. In his covering letter Mr. Indian Superintendent Hunter states as follows:-\n\n\"During past years an incomplete requisition has been submitted for the requirements of the Fort McPherson Indian Day School, which has resulted in the necessity of making numerous local purchases, a system that is not only inconvenient but expensive.\"\n\nEnclosure.\n\nBernard F.

Hunter,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nFort Norman, Northwest Territories.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter to the Department of Public Works concerning the alterations required in the teacher's quarters at Fort McPherson. We are pleased that the Department of Public Works will be able to undertake this addition and you will note that our action is in line with the recommendations made in your letter of March 15.\n\nWe are forwarding the requisition requirements for this school to the Departmental Purchasing Agent so that early action can be taken in forwarding the janitor and other supplies necessary.\n\nEnc.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nOttawa, April 8, 1949.\n\nThe Acting Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of 1 April, with attached prints showing proposed extension for the teacher's living quarters at the Fort McPherson Indian Day School.\n\nWe have been in correspondence with Mr. Indian Superintendent Hunter concerning the addition required to the teacher's residence at this school and appreciate Mr. Johnston's action in preparing blueprints.\n\nWe are quite prepared to have this work carried out by your Department and would appreciate an indication as to the estimated cost, as soon as possible. I note that you will have a carpenter crew at Fort McPherson, constructing buildings for the Lands and Development Services Branch, and that this crew will be available for the alterations to the teacher's quarters.\n\nDirector.\n\nCopy sent to Mr. Hunter\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Fort McPherson Day School\n\nDuring a recent interview with Mr. W. J. Johnston, District Engineer, in respect to our building program in the North West Territories, he showed me plans for a school addition at Fort McPherson. Though I was not familiar with your requirements at that point, I was impressed with the additional quarters which the plans indicated.\n\nMr. Johnston wished me to advise you that he will have a crew erecting a Warden's cabin at McPherson early in the summer, and that this crew would be available for the erection of this addition if you so desire it. Mr. Johnston should be advised at an early date.\n\nG. H.

Bed is the only kind of comfort or relaxation to be had here, so I hope that something really comfortable will be sent here.\n\nIn my opinion a bed is better than a divan for a welfare teacher because:\n\nI. A bed is higher above floor level. I recently took the temperature in several places in the teacher's room with the following results:\n- On floor under bed 32 degrees\n- On top of bed 50 degrees\n- On pillow 51 degrees\n- On shelf over the side of the bed and about five feet above floor level 64 degrees.\n\nAll these readings were taken during one hour.\n\nII. Numerous natives come into my room to tell me their troubles - real or imaginary - and I feel that it would be difficult to keep them off a divan since it is obviously made to be sat on. They would not sit on a bed.\n\nOf course a bed in the room gives it the appearance of an Indian's cabin, especially as there is a cook stove there too, but I think that the comfort of the teacher is of greater importance than the appearance of the room, the circumstances being what they are.\n\nThe west end of the building could well be made into proper living quarters for the teacher by adding rooms to that end of the building. Those who visit the new nursing station and then come to call on me usually make such a remark as this, \"Is this all you've got to live in? Good God!\"\n\nRooms added to the end of the building could include:\n- Bathroom, toilet, bedroom, living room, kitchen.\n\nAt present the toilet is in the most public place in the building. At present the boys' cloakroom is being used, as it was in Mrs. Miller's time, as a kitchen and oil-can room etc. It is needed for its proper purpose. The cupboard where I keep my food etc., and that used as a toilet are both needed for storing school materials. For instance, I keep the Victrola and the projector, records, etc. in my room for safety.\n\nWhen sending furniture etc. to the new school I hope that care will be taken to get harmonious colour arrangement and to have curtains that catch the light, not curtains with a grey background. I would suggest that window panes be fitted inside rather than outside. In cleaning them there is a certain amount of pressure on the glass plate, and the strong sunlight in summer helps weaken the putty so that in winter there are drafts coming in round the edges of almost every pane. The inside arrangement would make re-plugging a simple job that could be done as required, provided a supply of putty were on hand.\nArithmetic Books\n\nCanadian Problem and Practice Arithmetic - Book I\nBy Smith, Luse, Morss and Addison. Pub. Ginn & Co.\n6 copies required.\n\nJolly Numbers\nBook I - 24 copies\nBook II part 1 - 24 copies\nBook II Part 2 - 24 copies\n\nIs there a book III? If so please send 12 copies of each part.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nThese are very good books and screws to be fitted inside top drawers of teacher's desk.\n\nFurniture polish or cedar polish - 6 bottles.\nOne water filter\nSoap - 24 cakes Sunlight\n24 cakes Lifebuoy\nDutch cleanser - 12 tins\nDisinfectant for towels - 12 tins\n1 wick for Aladdin lamp - Nu-type model B\n12 mantles for Aladdin lamp\n3 wicks for Sunflame kerosene 3-burner stove\n1 glass chimney for Aladdin lamp\nGasoline hanging lamps for schoolroom\n3 boxes mantles for the same\n3 boxes generators for the same\n\nThe last seven items may be cancelled if electricity is to be installed. Hudson's Bay Trading Post has a simple electric installation which would be suitable here and easily managed. It seems to be a better system than that at the Nursing station.\n\nContact Office\n\nEaton's Catalogue\n\nFor fire extinguishers:\n2 for Pyrene Foam extinguisher\n2 for Scott fire guard No. 85\n\nPortable emergency heater for use when Enterprise cooker in teacher's room fails, as it sometimes does.\n\nWindow-cleaning material.

Water should run down these pipes into containers and so save valuable water, prevent mud which necessitates much house-cleaning, and help preserve the foundations of the building.\n\nEntrance door - one side was cracked when I came, during high winds in September it cracked still more. It should be replaced with a new one. It is the left half as one faces the door from outside.\n\nDoor handles - six new sets required.\n50 screws for fixing cloakroom pegs.\nWindows require re-puttying\n12 window panes required size 20 ins. by 12\u00bd ins.\nFort McPherson,\nNorthwest Territories.\n\nApril 17, 1949.\n\nCol. E.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI enclose a copy of the requisition which I submitted to Mr. Hunter. You will notice that the requisition which Mr. Hunter submitted is not identical with mine.\n\nThe items which I have marked with an asterisk, should, in my opinion, be sent to the school. I think it would be a good idea in future if requisitions for school supplies were submitted to an educationist in your department.\n\nAs your reply to my enquiry which was made last August did not reach me until February this year I was unable to do anything about purchasing the Dewdney's piano for the school, or to undertake school needlework with the girls as there were no materials.\n\nI have given consideration to a number of questions that have been occupying my attention and I have decided to seek a post in an Eskimo community. Whether I shall find one or not is another\nI am writing to Mr. R.A. Gibb about attendance at this school as he asked me to do. You will probably see the letter and you will notice that estimated attendance for next year is:\n\nTreaty Indians 40\nnon-treaty 10 or more\n\nAll children here receive free books, pencils, and milk or cocoa at morning and afternoon recess.\n\nI think it would be in the best interests of education for the living quarters and furnishing and equipment for cooking, etc. to be of the same standard as that which the nurse and her assistant enjoy at the nursing station.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.M. Hunter\n\nPS. All items on Mr. Hunter's requisition will be useful here, but those he has omitted or substituted should be sent as given on my list.\n**Hudson's Bay Company**\n\n**Fort McPherson - N.W.T.**\n\n**INVOICE**\n\n---\n\n**Department of Mines & Resources**\n\n**Indian Affairs Branch**\n\n**Ottawa, Ontario**\n\n\"Indian Day School Account\"\n\n---\n\n| Date | Description                                      | Amount |\n|------|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| May 6th | To Merchandise as per Slip 1774-5                | $1.35  |\n|       | 3 lbs nails 3\" @ 25\u00a2 per lb                     | $0.75  |\n|       | 2 lbs nails 2\u00bd\" @ .30\u00a2 per lb                  | $0.60  |\n| May 28th | To Merchandise as per Slip 9317-26              | $0.90  |\n|       | 1 Axe Handle @ .90\u00a2                             |        |\n| May 16th | To Order - Cash paid to Fred Firth              | $4.00  |\n| May 25th | To Order - Cash paid to Fred Firth              | $8.00  |\n| May 30th | To Order - Cash paid to Fred Firth              | $2.00  |\n\n**Total** $16.25\n\n---\n\nCertified Correct\n\n---\n\nMiss E.M.

McPherson Indian Day School. In previous correspondence with Col. Neary regarding janitor services, I was advised that it was the duty of the school children to sweep the school each day and that it would be in order to make a purchase of $5.00 per month for candy to act as an incentive to perform these duties.\n\nL.

I agree that the expenditure was not large but it would seem that this work could have been done by the older pupils without cost to the Department.\n\nIf the garden was cultivated under the direction of the teacher it would appear reasonable to have the boys dig the ground so that they would get practice in that type of work.\n\nBernard F.

B.F.

It is presumed that negotiations have been completed regarding its purchase from the Church of England authorities.\n\nThe material required would be sufficient lawn fence to enclose the lot, as shown in Eaton's Spring and Summer catalogue, 1950, Page 532, No. 0445-6230. We will also require a four foot gate. The Posts will be obtained locally.\n\nThe material should be shipped in time to catch the first Northern Transportation Company boat leaving Waterways at the opening of navigation, in order that the fence may be erected this summer. This, of course, if the expenditure is approved. You no doubt have the lot size in your records.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.C.

McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nYELLOWKNIFE, N.W.T.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I was recently at Fort McPherson, Miss E. G. Stewart, school teacher at Fort McPherson, stated that the extension of 12-feet proposed for the school this year was too small. She asked that an 18-foot addition be provided.\n\nMiss Stewart also stated that the schoolroom space was inadequate and that she had had a request for 25 more students to attend school. When I was in Yellowknife on March 13th I mentioned the above conversation to you.\n\nThe above matters are, of course, out of my jurisdiction and I am only passing same to you for what value you may consider they are worth.\n\nPlans were approved for an addition 12-feet long to the school at Fort McPherson and materials were delivered there last year. If funds are made available this year I presume instructions will be received to proceed on this basis. It is evident if more classroom space be provided in the school at any time, that consideration must also be given to providing more space for an additional teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) J. L.

Instead we are ordering farm fencing of standard gauge in 20 rod rolls. We have ordered four of these rolls which should cover 80 rods and therefore should cover an ample sized playground. We have also ordered the staples and two gates.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education\nMarch 31, 1950.\n\nW. J.

McKinnon,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nYellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nDo you know if the Department is considering adding a room to the McPherson School? There are about thirty more children wanting to come in to school here next fall. Also when the D. P. W. man was in here, he was looking over the school, and considering the possibility although he said he had nothing to do about it. Probably he was doing just a routine check up on projects throughout the district. I have been told that I am to have nearly all the furniture that I asked for, and I am wondering if they are going to build the teacher's quarters as I asked, because the addition contemplated will not do for two teachers at all, and will not do for one.\n\nThe generator will not arrive until the boat comes in. Doubtless there will be some one here who will be able to put it all in order for me, if the present constable is not here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed), Ethel Stewart.\n\nEthel Stewart.\nB.F.

The present classroom and living quarters would serve as living quarters for two teachers.\n\nIt is hoped that every endeavour will be made to supply this for this Settlement as the Indians are the most progressive and most advanced on the MacKenzie region.\n\nG.H.

She went so far as to say that she expected 25 more pupils. Her December report showed 36 pupils in attendance. If a survey by Superintendent Hunter indicates that there will be more than 36 children of school age, it does not appear to be good business to make the small extension to the present building. I know this building and I don't think it is adequate, even for 36 pupils and one teacher. Though the material is on the spot to make a twelve foot extension to enlarge the teacher's quarters, I would delay any work until the need for more school space is clarified. Mr. Hunter has been asked to complete a survey as quickly as possible, and report. Mr. Johnson knows this building very well and I am sure you will be glad to get any suggestions that he can give if and when it is known that a larger school is required. You will realize that a two classroom school will require quarters for two teachers.\nFORT NORMAN APRIL 14, 1950.\n\nB? F.

Of this number there are 32 children attending the Aklavik Residential School, leaving a total of 51 pupils to attend day school at McPherson. These figures do not include children of 5 and 6 years of age who will attend school.\n\nLoucheux Band No. 6, at Arctic Red River, N.W.T., according to our statistics, have 48 children between the age of 7 and 16 years. Of this number there are 32 attending the residential school at Aklavik, N.W.T. leaving a total of 18 children to attend day school.\n\nAs you are aware, the present plans include the building of a 2 room Indian Day school at Arctic Red River, this coming summer. This school is to be erected on the same plan as the ones at Ft. Norman and Ft. Good Hope. The matter of having the school divided to act as both Nursing Station and school has been taken up with the Director of Indian Health Services. The Director of Indian Health Services feels that the settlement of Arctic Red River is not large enough to warrant a permanent Nursing Station, therefore the suggestion to have the school divided to serve both school and nursing station has been rejected.\n\nThe Indian Day School that we now have at Fort McPherson was built to accommodate a maximum of 30 pupils, however this past year we managed to have an attendance of 36 pupils. It was necessary to also refuse admittance to a few pupils who would have liked to attend. Miss Stewart, our welfare teacher, in a recent report, states that with a hostel in operation we would have at least 70 pupils attending the McPherson Day School. Our statistics show that there were 22 births from June, 1948 to June 1949, in Loucheux Band 7. With an increase such as this our present school facilities are definitely inadequate.\nMy suggestion to remedy the situation that now exists, would be to move all the materials that are now on hand for the erection of a school at Arctic Red River, to Fort McPherson, N.W.T. and have the large two room day school erected at that point. The present small day school now in use at McPherson could be used as a hostel to accommodate the children while the parents are on the trap lines. That further material be shipped to Arctic Red River for a small one room day school with teacher's quarters.\n\nI believe that if the two room school as planned for Arctic Red River was to be erected at Ft. McPherson, it would solve the schooling problem for many years to come. I further believe that if a small one room school with teacher's quarters combined, was to be erected at Arctic Red River, it would not be overcrowded for many years.\n\nI am attaching herewith a copy of a letter recently received from Miss Stewart, our welfare teacher at McPherson, N.W.T., for your information.\n\nL.C. Hunter,\nSuperintendent,\nFort Norman Indian Agency.\n\nCOPY\nOttawa, April 26, 1950.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nFort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nAs you have probably gathered from Mr. McKinley's reports this day school has proven most successful. Reports received from Mr. Gooderham show that an increased pupilage of over twenty pupils can be expected in September 1950 as there are now thirty-six pupils enrolled. It is obvious that we will have to plan a two-room school at this point.\n\nWhen Mr. District Engineer Johnston of the Department of Public Works visited Ottawa recently he discussed the matter of land at Fort McPherson with the Superintendent of Education. It was pointed out that the R.C.M.P. are planning on the erection of quarters near the present school but that additional land might be made available beyond the school site.\n\nIt would be appreciated if we could have a confirmation from you of this statement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDirector.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDevelopment Services Branch,\nDept. of Resources & Development,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa.\nApril 26, 1950.\n\nMr. G.H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alta.,\n\nBy now you will have received a copy of a letter sent to the Department of Public Works with regard to the Arctic Red River Indian Day School.\n\nMr. Johnston and I discussed the educational requirements of Fort McPherson and Arctic Red River at some length and the information which we have received from Mr. Hunter, Mr. McKinnon and yourself was very helpful.\n\nI would point out that when we discussed Mr. Hunter's suggestion that we send all the materials at Arctic Red River to Fort McPherson, we pointed out the difficulties which this would involve. The materials at Arctic Red River had to be carried up a hill and this was done at considerable expense. He decided that it would be decidedly better to leave such materials as are required for a one-room school at Arctic Red River and remove to Fort McPherson only surplus requirements.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter to both Mr. McKinnon and Mr. Hunter. I would ask that Mr. McKinnon carefully check the number of extra pupils for whom school facilities would be required at Fort McPherson. It seems evident that we will have to plan on building a two-room school similar to those now at Fort Norman and Fort Good Hope.\nIt was decided to make the following proposals:\n\n(a) That the twelve foot addition presently planned be carried out at Fort McPherson as the materials for this are now on hand.\n\n(b) That surplus materials be shipped from Arctic Red River with the intention of erecting a two-room school at Fort McPherson in the summer of 1951.\n\n(c) That the present school be considered as a possible hostel for those children who will require boarding facilities for a part of the school year. Bishop Marsh is willing to try the operation of a hostel at Fort McPherson on an experimental basis.\n\nPlease let me have your reaction to these proposals.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nColonel A.A. Anderson,\nChief Engineer's Branch,\nDept. of Public Works,\nOttawa.\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 27th in reference to Fort McPherson, N.W.T., and the several instructions I received from Col. B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Indian Education:\n\n(a) Regarding the construction of a 12-foot addition to the school as planned for 1950-51, when the letter of authority giving the financial encumbrance is received, this work will be included in our programme for the present season.\n\n(b) Regarding the transfer of surplus materials from Arctic Red River, N.W.T., where a one-classroom school is to be built, this material will be shipped to Fort McPherson during the present season. There are only two sailings of the boats in this area; freight leaves waterways June 3rd and August 5th and the barges would arrive in the Lower Mackenzie river area at Arctic Red River and McPherson about a month later. That would mean that the freight from Arctic Red River would be transferred to Fort McPherson about July 3rd or September 5th. In all probability our operations at Arctic Red River would be completed before September 5th, and every effort should be made for the transfer on or about July 3rd at Arctic Red River. Our plans here will be scheduled for the transfer on this date; that is, July 3rd approximately ex Arctic Red River.\n\n(c) Regarding this item, \"that an educational survey be made of this settlement to ascertain the number of classrooms and sizes required\", it is indicated that a two-room school will be required at Fort McPherson and there has also been a suggestion from time to time that dormitory space is needed at that point. This, however, is a matter which will be covered in the educational survey to be made, as this Department (Public Works) is only the construction agency and is only concerned in carrying out instructions after a line of policy has been formulated and approved.\n\nFort McPherson is a settlement which is crowded, and on which the buildings now there do not wholly correspond to existing lots as per an original survey of some years ago. The settlement was visited by a Dominion Land Surveyor in 1949 and I understand some extensive changes were made in the existing surveyed lots, and also considerable areas of adjacent ground were also surveyed into lots. No doubt, once this enlarged survey of the settlement is approved, there will be numerous requests for lots on the new surveyed ground. At least this situation can be anticipated, as it is known to result elsewhere after a new survey has been made. The point of the matter is this:\n\n(1) That whoever is looking into the educational needs of the settlement will need to act promptly so as to\n\n(OVER)\nhave land reserved before other parties are making checkerboard reservations of lots which would spoil a school layout.\n\n(2) That the grounds selected be sufficiently large for all educational needs of the settlement, both present and future. The area now reserved for school purposes is small with not much space for playgrounds. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police have a lot adjacent to the school and it is possible those looking into the educational needs might consider an exchange of lots necessary so as to have all the school area within one compact block of land.\n\nWhen goods are moved from Arctic Red River, these should be hauled directly to the school property and such as could be stored outside so taken care of and the materials requiring protection placed within temporary buildings. It is impossible to do this unless it is known where the grounds are approved for school purposes and also the exact location of the school buildings on these grounds. Any temporary warehouses are generally improved and allowed to remain as a permanent installation for storage purposes in connection with the school activities. For the above reasons, it is evident that considerable prompt attention will have to be given to this whole project so as to have instructions received here prior to July 3rd when the materials will have been transferred from Arctic Red River. Likewise, any materials which it is necessary to purchase should also be shipped from Waterways so as to reach Fort McPherson on the same barges by August 3rd. The second arrival of the barges about September 5th at Fort McPherson is too near freeze-up, and it might be impractical in some years to properly receive these goods and have them stored while the construction crew is at that place.\n\nAll indications appear to point to some additional accommodations being required for pupils and teachers at Fort McPherson, and the need appears to be quite urgent. The planning and delivery of materials can be done during 1950-51, with construction carried out in 1951-52. However, if there is any delay in receipt of instructions at this office, there might well be a delay in completion of the school at Fort McPherson.\n\nJ. E. Kellett,\nActing District Engineer.\nOttawa, 3 May, 1950.\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration.\n\nEnclosed is copy of letter dated May 1st from A/District Engineer J. E. Kellett with reference to the Indian School at Fort McPherson, and at Arctic Red River, N.W.T. Mr. Kellett covers pretty thoroughly the possible arrangements of transfer of surplus material from Arctic Red River, where a one-classroom school is to be built, to Fort McPherson, during the present season. He also gives dates necessary for shipment of goods from Waterways so as to reach McPherson before the freeze-up. It is necessary that planning and delivery of materials, as far as possible, should be done during 1950/51 so that construction may be carried out in 1951/52.\n\nWill you please study the contents of Mr. Kellett's letter and let me have your comments and further instructions as quickly as possible.\n\nEVG/S.\n\nChief Engineer.\n**Hudson's Bay Company**\n\n**Fort McPherson Post**\n\n**INVOICE**\n\n**Number:** 280-19-2\n\n**Department of Mines & Resources**\n\n**Indian Affairs Branch**\n\n**March 28th 1950**\n\n**No.** Ottaw, Ontario \"Account Fort McPherson Indian Day School\"\n\n| Date       | Description                                                                 | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| March 13th | To Purchase 1 ea A.B.

A careful check of pupil population indicates that there are sufficient only for a one-room school at this point.\n\n(2) All surplus materials now stored at Arctic Red River will be shipped to Fort McPherson, where it is planned to erect a two-room school. Our present one-room school is now seriously overcrowded and extra accommodation is required. Of course it will not be possible to erect this school until the summer of 1951.\n\nIt is requested, therefore, that Inspector McKinnon be asked to carry out an educational survey at Fort McPherson before the end of this present academic year. He has been previously advised of the request from the Anglican Church to operate a small hostel at Fort McPherson in cooperation with\nthis proposed two-room day school.

In that event the Yukon Government and the Department of National Defence might be influenced to set up a larger establishment suited to the needs of an enlarged white population. Provision for married quarters is already being made at the Watson Lake air station and Teslin is, I understand, next on the list for this enlargement.\n\nIn his letter of October 4, the Superintendent of Yukon schools outlines the agreement under which these joint schools are operated. Our Department is somewhat in\narrears in providing the school building. An associated Department is, however, providing accommodation for the teacher. Perhaps we should ask Mr. Superintendent Meek whether we are providing fuel for the school and the residence. Light for the school is supplied by the airport electricity plant.\n\nC.A.F.

Would you\nplease let me know if this has been done at Fort McPherson\nand if not, will you arrange to have it done immediately\nbecause building materials are now arriving at that place\nand information for disposal and storage of these materials\nis essential.\n\nRobert Blais\nChief Engineer\n**PURCHASE ORDER**\n\n**TO THE T.

The ground there is level and high and the new school should be located as close as possible to the southeast corner of Lot 2 so as to provide plenty of ground to the west for a playground.\n\n2. **TEACHERAGE**: I have just received also an army message from the teacher, Miss Stewart, reading as follows:\n\n   \"MR. KELLETT THINKS THAT THE ALTERATION I ASKED FOR IS NOT POSSIBLE SO PLEASE DROP THE MATTER I DO NOT WANT ANY DELAY IN COMPLETION OF THE BUILDING.\"\n\n3. **LIGHTING**: Would it be possible for Mr. Kellett to arrange for the school to be wired while his men are in Fort McPherson? Please return Mr. McKinnon's sketch in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n| DATE   | PARTICULARS                  | DR.  | CR.  | BALANCE |\n|--------|------------------------------|------|------|---------|\n| May 1  | Order No. 57429              |      |      |         |\n|        | 30 lbs.

Lauchlan,\nChief Treasury Officer,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\n\nRe: Purchase Order No. 57429, E.R. 249.\n\nEducation Service officials have submitted an invoice, dated the 31st of March, 1950, from the T. Eaton Company, Ltd., Edmonton, Alta., covering the goods supplied on the above order.\n\nThe prices shown on this order are those of the 1950 Western catalogue. We note that the total cost of the two double-scroll lawn gates is given as $6.65. This is the catalogue unit price, and should have read $13.70 for the two gates. The invoice shows a slight increase in the price of the lawn gates and the fence staples over that shown in the catalogue.\n\nThe total of the invoice, which includes a freight charge of $10.15, amounts to $134.18. Will you kindly increase the amount of Encumbrance E.R.249 by $20.98 so that this account may be passed for payment.\n\nG. V.

BLAIS, CHIEF ENGINEER, DPW, OTTAWA,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 24th concerning the rearrangement of the addition to the teacher's quarters at Fort McPherson, this matter was brought to my attention directly by Miss Stewart, the teacher at Fort McPherson, by radiogram on July 17th.\n\nThe alteration as suggested by Miss Stewart places the kitchen in the room now shown as the bedroom, with a doorway in each wall, and leaves no wall space whatsoever for kitchen cabinets and cupboard space. This condition was overlooked by Miss Stewart in her original recommendation; otherwise I do not think she would have suggested any change.\n\nInstructions have been issued from this office for the construction crew to proceed with the plans as originally drawn. If the Superintendent of Education, Department of Citizenship and Immigration, still considers the alteration desirable, it is not too late for our carpenters to revise the construction. However, in my opinion the addition should be constructed in accordance with the plan as originally drawn.\n\nNo arrangements have been made for the electrical installation in the school, and it was not my intention to send an electrician in this year as there was no electrical plant in the district and no building requiring electrical services. If necessary, I can obtain prices for the electrical installation and have this work done this year, but I point out that the time for northern shipments is rapidly drawing to a close and that this order must be placed immediately if materials are to be delivered this year. Please advise by wire your wishes on this matter so that I can make the necessary arrangements.\n\nYour mention of a small building for a lighting plant is the first indication that this office has had that such a\n\n(OVER)\nstructure would be required. There are no materials on the site as yet, but, if necessary, materials can be obtained from the two-classroom school which is being transferred from Arctic Red River. Please advise if this building is of a temporary nature or is it to be finished off for permanent use.\n\nJ. E. Kellett,\nA/DISTRICT ENGINEER.\nOTTAWA, July 31st, 1950.\n\nMr. B.E. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: File 903-5\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of July 20th in regard to Indian Day School at Fort McPherson, N.W.T. I comment on your letter as follows:\n\n1 - Site\n\nThe instructions regarding the choice of site by your school inspector, Mr. J.W. McKinnon, have been forwarded to Mr. J.E. Kellett, Acting District Engineer, Edmonton, together with two photostat copies of the plan which you have sent. Mr. Kellett has been instructed to issue instructions to his representative at Fort McPherson regarding the site of the schoolhouse and site selected for the new schoolhouse when built, and to send a plan if this would reach there in time to be of use.\n\nThe plan you submitted and two photostat copies of same are returned for your files, or for such use as you may wish to make of same.\n\n2 - Teacherage\n\nAttached herewith is copy of letter dated July 26th received from Mr. J.E. Kellett. This letter points out in paragraphs 2 and 3 that the changes suggested by Miss Stewart, schoolteacher, should not be followed, as the suggested change would leave no wall space for kitchen cupboards and cupboard space, both of which are very important. It may be true that a rug available for some of the rooms may not now fit in the new school addition, but it would appear more important to provide the kitchen cabinets and cupboard space.\n\n3 - LIGHTING\n\nIn the attached letter, paragraph 4, Mr. Kellett reports that no arrangements have been made for the electric wiring in the school addition this year. The wiring involved would be a very small job and the cost would be relatively high to have an electrician call at Fort McPherson for this work. Arrangements could be made next year for wiring in the present school addition to be carried out, when the new two-classroom day school is under construction.\n\nWJJ:DB\n\nCHIEF ENGINEER\nPOWER ELECTRIC AND EQUIPMENT\nCompany - Limited\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nJuly 31, 1950.\n\nMr. H.E.

Gibson concerning the progress of work at Fort McPherson.\n\nThe work at this settlement was delayed in its commencement till funds were available for this work with the carpenter crew reporting to Fort McPherson on the plane of July 14th, and since that date a crew of four carpenters have been employed on the addition to the Anglican Mission schoolhouse. The foreman has advised this office by radiogram of the material shortages, and orders have been placed for replacement of all materials used in the construction of public privies by the August boats which will arrive in Fort McPherson in late August. It is expected that the R.C.M.P. prefabricated building will arrive by the same shipment.\n\nArrangements are underway for the transfer of the materials from Arctic Red River to Fort McPherson of the two classroom school formerly planned for construction at Arctic Red River. Delivery of these materials will relieve the situation in respect to the material shortage on the warden's cabin, and will permit the erection of this building. It is very unlikely, however, that this building will be completed this year.\n\nOn arrival of materials at Fort McPherson the construction crew will be increased, and every effort made to erect the buildings to a point where they will serve as warehouses for housing building materials for the coming winter.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 28th, the last paragraph regarding the wiring installation for the Mission school, I have arranged with Hillas Electric Co. for the supply of materials and these were made up and shipped before receipt of your letter which arrived on August 1st. Attached is a copy of the Hillas Electric Co. quotation for carrying out this work in the amount of $1,121.00.\nThe work included in the tender provides for lighting fixtures in the classroom and service rooms of the school, as well as the 12 ft. extension now under construction. The tender is considered fair and reasonable, and is recommended for acceptance.\n\nNo funds have been set up for this work and I ask that funds in the amount of $1,181.00 be set up to cover this installation. The placing of this order is extremely irregular, and was taken by this office in view of the very short time remaining in which to place orders for materials delivered this year, as your letter of July 24th implied that electric wiring and housing for the electric power plant were required this year. The electrician is carrying out work at Arctic Red River and Aklavik, and under the circumstances it seemed advisable to provide conveniences for the school if at all possible.\n\nThe placing of this order with the electrician was made after despatch of my letter of July 26th and before receiving your letter of July 26th, as the work involved is not very great and fitted in with the electricians movements in this area, and no good reason other than the lack of funds existed for not providing this service.\n\nIn connection with 8'x8' building required for the housing of the electric unit it is considered that ample materials will be on hand for the construction of such shelter for the power plant. Will this building be of a temporary or permanent nature?\n\nJ.E.Kellett,\nA/District Engineer.\n\nJ.E.K/IK\n\nEnc.\nSupt. of Education Services,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letters of July 18th and July 20th concerning Fort McPherson Indian Day School, I enclose copy of letter dated August 4th from Acting District Engineer J.E. Kellett, which gives the information concerning the progress of the work on the former Anglican Mission School and other buildings at Fort McPherson.\n\nYou will note that as the electricians were carrying out work at Arctic Red River and Aklavik, Mr. Kellett has gone ahead and ordered Hillas Electric Company to provide lighting fixtures in the class-room and service rooms of the school, as well as in the 12 ft. extension now under construction. He considers the tender fair and reasonable and recommends it for acceptance. I trust that you will approve of this placing of the order and arrange to forward this Department a financial encumbrance in the amount of $1,181.00.\n\nWill you also give me your reply to the question raised in the last paragraph of Mr. Kellett's letter as to whether or not the 8' x 8' building for housing the electric unit is to be of a temporary or permanent nature.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRobert Blais,\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\n\nEVG/FMN.\nEncl.\nAugust 28th, 1950.\n\nMr. Robert Blais,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Blais:\n\nRe: Fort McPherson Indian Day School. Your File 12967-2\nMisc. 4-1 P.T. 248\n\nWe have received your letter of August 13th with reference to the above school.\n\nIt is noted from the second paragraph of your letter that arrangements have been completed for the installation of lighting fixtures in the classrooms and service rooms of the school.\n\nWe do not understand why you wish another financial encumbrance, due to the fact that you were previously advised that we had arranged a transfer of $36,700.00 from Arctic Red River to Fort McPherson, and you have already received E.R. 383 for that amount.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, it is considered that the building for housing the electric unit should be of a permanent nature.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Your File 12967-2\nMisc. 4-1 P.P. 248\n\nWith reference to our letter of August 28th, you will note that in the last paragraph we referred to the building for housing the electric unit.\n\nWe have now received a letter from Fort McPherson dated September 10th which reads as follows:\n\n\"Wiring for school finished. No provision made as yet for building for lighting plant. Need building 8 x 12 approximately. Well insulated equipment with thermostatic controlled ventilator to be flown in. Will eliminate fire hazard as oil stove will not then be required. Dangerous with gas engine.\"\n\nPossibly the matter mentioned in this letter has already received your attention, but if not, we would appreciate your immediate kind consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept' of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRE: Supplies - Fort McPherson School\n\nReference Mr. Neary's wire of September 13, 1950, please be advised that 2 only 1/2 quart Fire Extinguishers were ordered from Safety Supplies Co., Limited, Edmonton and 12 side blocks from Canadian General Electric Co., Limited, Edmonton on September 14, 1950. These supplies are being shipped via Canadian Pacific Airways Express to the Teacher, Indian Day School, Fort McPherson, N.W.T., in accordance with your instructions.\n\nE.A. Robertson,\nSuperintendent.\nOttawa, September 15th, 1950\n\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 6th, with reference to the probable unexpended balance from funds provided by your Department, for Fort McPherson School, I enclose for your information, copy of letter number 1676 dated September 12th, from Acting District Engineer J. E. Kellett, in which he gives a statement of expenditures to date, outstanding accounts and estimates costs to be met, amounting to $33,750.00.\n\nSince the amount of funds allotted was $39,800., the balance available for transfer, from Mr. Kellett's figures, is $6,050.00.\n\nYou will note that the work at Fort McPherson, must be shut down very soon and that Mr. Kellett will forward the full report later.\n\nRobert Blais,\nChief Engineer.\nR. BLAIS, CHIEF ENGINEER, P.O. - OTTAWA.\n\nAs requested in your letter of September 8th I forward Estimate of the probable expenditures at Fort McPherson this year under Encumbrance Z-318-S, as follows:\n\nExpenditure to Date ........................................ $4,750.00\n\nOutstanding Accounts on hand .................................. $10,000.00\n\nEstimated Paylists and Board ................................... $3,000.00\n\nHandling Materials from Arctic Red River ......................... $3,000.00\n\nNorthern Transportation Company freight on above ............... $3,000.00\n\nMaterials to be ordered (including Light Plant) ................. $10,000.00\n\nTotal .............................................................. $39,750.00\n\nFunds Allotted .................................................... $39,800.00\n\nAvailable for transfer ............................................. $6,050.00\n\nIt is probable that funds in the amount of $6,000 will be available for transfer from this source to complete buildings now under construction.\n\nThe work at Fort McPherson must be shut down very shortly because of the close of the construction season, and a full report will be forwarded later should more funds be available than estimated at this date.\n\nJ.B.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nCapitol Theatre Building,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Day Schools at Fort McPherson,\nArctic Red River, and Fort Good Hope.\n\nFor your information, we are attaching hereto copies of extracts from a report by Mr. I.M. Marshall of the Engineering and Construction Service of the Department of Resources and Development covering inspections which he made during last summer at Fort McPherson, Arctic Red River, and Fort Good Hope.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nEncls.\nExtract from Mr. I.M. Marshall's Report on inspections made at Fort McPherson, Flirt Good Hope and Arctic Red River.\n\nI inspected the school in company with Mr. Cody the new school teacher. The school had just been finished, and the D.P.W. men had just left 2 days before my arrival. The school was not in good condition being dirty. Apart from this I have the following comments to make:\n\n(a) There were many places where the painting and varnishing had been incompleted or improperly done.\n\n(b) Much paint and putty had been smeared on the windows and window sashes.\n\n(c) The glass door in the china cabinet had been broken. This is an ornamental glass and cannot be duplicated at Fort Good Hope.\n\n(d) Paint had been spilled on the varnished baseboards and floors.\n\n(e) Paint pots and brushes had been left scattered throughout the building.\n\n(f) The diesel and generator had a marked vibration and that vibration was quite perceptible in the teacher's living quarters above.\n\n(g) I counted 13 light bulbs either missing or broken. These of course cannot be replaced in Fort Good Hope.\n\n(h) The wall plug was on the wrong side of the kitchen, it should be on the chimney side.\n\nThe vibration in the power unit could be due to the crank shaft being ill fitting or having a slight bend. It may not be important as a power line is being strung from the R.C.C.S. Station, but there will be complaints if they have to use this plant. I question the advisability of placing the concrete floor of the furnace room in either this or any other school. The power plant should be in a separate building with no connecting concrete slab or walk.\n\nThe under-structure of the school was examined very\ncarefully - this is another of the type where the insulation is half in place by shiplap - and no masonite or plywood used. With the shiplap it is difficult to make it tight particularly around the bridging.\n\nI would recommend that all pipes and plumbing be carefully covered with as much moss as can be tucked in. At this school the pipes were quite bare even though there was no water on.\n\nAll doors and windows in this school were found firm and well fitting. The Warden's cabin was inspected. This has a full basement which stood up well last winter. The Warden seemed quite satisfied with his house and with the full basement. There was only one door that did not fit properly. The Warden's ice-house has been moved, but has not been levelled, and no fill put in. The roof needs completing, and the D.F.W. left an order for 3 rolls of roofing with the Hudson Bay Company. The door of this ice-house is not really suitable. It is only made of 1 inch material and should be of the refrigerator type.\nExtract from Mr. I.M. Marshall's Report, covering inspections made at Fort McPherson, Fort Good Hope, and Arctic Red River.\n\n11. Fort McPherson.\n\nI inspected the school. This is a one-room school purchased some years ago from the Anglican Mission. The present school teacher, Miss Stewart, has been there a year. This school is a definite fire hazard, and having only one door, is dangerous. The door is in the centre of the building and opens directly into a hallway containing an oil heater immediately in front of and close to the door. Oil has been spilt on the floor. There is another heater directly behind this heater in the classroom making really a double hazard. If a fire occurred from either of these 2 heaters, I do not see how between 30 and 40 children would ever get out. A doorway should be cut in the south east corner of the classroom. I would recommend that this door be cut before school opens, and a porch with a second door added.\n\n14. Arctic Red River\n\nOnly one building was under construction at Arctic Red River, this is a one-room school. It is started directly on permafrost, and when I was there only the footings had been poured. The site is on a hill with about a 7% grade. The foreman in charge of the P.W.D., Mr. Dean Hawkins, told me it took him 3 weeks to thaw and drain this for the footings. The deepest point was about 7 feet below the original grade. It will be interesting to note the effect of permafrost on this building. The soil here had in spots a full 2 feet of moss and peaty material directly above the permafrost which contained a great deal of ice. I discussed with Mr. Hawkins the various measures he would take to have the ground come back to its original frost condition. I believe he had a very good knowledge of permafrost conditions and will follow the best practice.\n\nThe quarters of the R.C.M.P. are the only other...\ngovernment buildings. These consist of a single men's quarters and the usual storage houses. The house was one of the few seen that has been banked by a low housing of shiplap and roofing paper enclosing moss well packed for over two feet of height and nearly two feet in width. The resident member of the R.C.M.P. was away on patrol, and I could not obtain his comments on the effectiveness of this type of banking.\nSeptember 25, 1950.\n\nDepartment of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nAttention: Mr. H.

Neary\nSupt. of Indian Education\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe wish to thank you for your letter of October 6th.\n\nPlease be advised that we will appreciate anything that you can do to get this account paid.\n\nWe appreciate any business that you can give us very much and trust that our request for payment will not jeopardise our chances of obtaining any future business from your Department. We are not a large Company and therefore are unfortunately not able to wait for payment as long as some of the larger Companies probably could. We trust you will understand this.\n\nThanking you very much for your co-operation in this matter, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPOWER ELECTRIC & EQUIPMENT COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nJ. P. Motherwell.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIn reply to your letter of October 5th concerning the lighting plant provided for the Fort McPherson school, I advise that this is a Kohler fully automatic 5 kw., 110 v. single phase unit, which has been housed in an 8 x 10 shelter, fully insulated and connected to the building. To date no invoice has been received on this unit, nor any correspondence to indicate who placed the order, nor the supply house, although it is known that the lighting plant came from Calgary. No provision has been made to include the cost of this plant as an item of cost against the funds allotted for this year.\n\nIt is believed the Kohler Lighting Plant is gasoline operated and I am not familiar with what stocks of fuel have been provided for this unit. I presume, however, that this item of operation has been considered and provided for by the same party who ordered the light plant.\n\nNo specific item is being entered in the estimates for the purchase of a lighting plant for the Two-Classroom School that will be erected next year, as it was considered that the 5 kw. unit now in use would be adequate to handle both the Two-Classroom School and the Mission school if necessary, and that no additional power should be provided until a heavier power load has developed in this area. The $10,000 for material purchases during the present fiscal year was to cover building materials only, which will be required to replace materials used on other construction in Arctic Red River and Fort McPherson.\n\nJ.K. Kellett\nA/District Engineer.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 13, 1950.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your telephone enquiry of October 5th, I wrote Acting District Engineer J.E. Kellett, Edmonton, enquiring about the electric lighting plant for the existing mission school at Fort McPherson, N.W.T. He replied by letter of October 11th, copy of which is attached for your information, stating that a Kohler 5 kw, 110 volts, single phase unit, has been delivered to Fort McPherson and has been housed in an 8' x 10' shelter fully insulated and connected to the building. Mr. Kellett has no record as to who placed the order for this machine nor the supply house from which it came beyond that it came from Calgary.\n\nHe also points out that no provision has been made to include the cost of that plant as an item of cost against funds allocated for construction of schools at Fort McPherson this year.\n\nYou will also note that Mr. Kellett considers the 5 kw unit will be adequate to handle electric requirements at both the mission school and the two class-room school which may be built in the near future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRobert Blais,\nCHIEF ENGINEER.\n\nEVG/FMN.\nEncl.\nOctober 18, 1950.\n\nMr. Robert Blais,\nChief Engineer,\nDepartment of Public Works,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Fort McPherson Indian Day School\n\nReference your 12967-2 PP-248 of October 13th.\n\nI have for answer your above letter and regret that there has been a misunderstanding with regard to the electric lighting at this school.\n\nInsofar as I can now ascertain, our officials did not realize that Mr. Kellett was undertaking the electrical work at the school along with the addition to the teacherage. Therefore, a requisition was submitted for the Kohler plant and we placed an order for it through the Purchasing Agent and also for the wiring, fuse boxes, etc.\n\nThe funds for these items came from our general equipment vote, and are not charged against the money provided previously to Mr. Kellett.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

As your letter of August 18th stated that the Dept. of Public Works were to erect the building I presumed that all arrangements had been made and therefore I proceeded to McPherson on Sept. 6th. However on my arrival I found that the building had not been started and D.P.W. not authorized to go ahead with this building. Nevertheless Major White was at the site and through him, after several wires authority was received to go ahead with the job. In the meantime I finished the wiring of the school and had this work completed on Sept. 10th, in order for the school to open on Monday, Sept. 11th. At this date there had been no start on the above mentioned building, and instead of waiting for the building to be started and completed, I returned to Aklavik.\n\nOn Sept. 19th I received a wire that the building was far enough advanced for the plant to be installed. I then, with a helper, proceeded to Fort McPherson on Sept. 20th. On the 24th the job was completed. Even at this late date the building was still not completed. You can readily understand from the above why the job was not finished on my first trip, and why I did not wait for the building to be completed. Trusting this will meet with your approval.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6471, file 903-5, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFort Norman, N.W.T.,\nNovember 10, 1950.\n\nCol.

Gardlund, Aklavik Power and Supply, in explanation of his Invoice for $108.00 covering air fare from Aklavik to Fort McPherson and return, for the purpose of installing the lighting plant for Fort McPherson Day School.\n\nIt will be noted that it was necessary for Mr. Gardlund to make two trips to Fort McPherson before he was able to complete the work. We requested Miss Stewart, Welfare Teacher, to inform Mr. Gardlund when the materials were on hand for the installation of the plant, but Mr. Gardlund apparently received this information before the building had been erected by the Dept. of Public Works.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we have no alternative but to pass this account for payment. The original figure of $375.00 covered Mr. Gardlund's transportation to McPherson and return, but he did not, at that time, think it necessary to make two trips.\n\nWe are informed by Miss Stewart that the materials listed on the Invoice for $26.50 were installed at Fort McPherson, and that the lighting plant is now working satisfactorily.\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.C.

NORMAN\n\nCORRESPONDENCE\nFort Norman, N.W.T., May 1936.\n\nMr. J. Lorne Turner, Director,\nDepartment of the Interior, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn account of the increase of the population, of the needs of a better performance in the training of the children, and of other reasons hereafter mentioned, the people of Norman and Franklin in the N.W.T., WHITES, HALF-BREEDS AND INDIANS, consider the establishment of a boarding school at Norman as corresponding to their needs and desires. In accordance with the terms of Treaty No. 11 whereby: \"His Majesty agrees to pay the salaries to instruct the children of said Indians...; in accordance also with the N.W.T. Act, whereby: \"The ratepayers of any portion... of the Territories may establish schools therein as they think it fit... (ch: 142: part I A. 12... the citizens of Norman, whose signatures appear hereunder, respectfully request, through your Department, that required provisions be taken to secure the establishment of a boarding school here, in such manner the Department deem it advisable, during the coming year.\n\nThe request submitted to your benevolent consideration, postulates in its favour the following reasons.....\n\n1. The GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION of Norman:\n   (a) according to its midway location between Providence and Aklavik\n   (b) \" to its natural centre for the gathering of the Hare Indians tribe in the same school.\n   (c) \" to its increasing importance of the town.\n\n2. The POPULATION, of Norman and Bear-Lake is, at present, of 395 Indians including 112 children; of 34 Halfbreed children, of 14 White children, Good-Hope has a population of 371 Hare Indians, of 35 Half-breed and White. The number of children averages to 60. Thence, Norman and Good-Hope with their 140 children at the age of attending school, may secure the recruitment of a Boarding school here.\n\n3. Other PSYCHOLOGICAL Factors require also the said school to promote Education, dispel prejudices against it and secure a more efficient influence on the social life of the Natives.\n   (a) An hostile mentality in the Indians' minds restrains the attendance at the distant school.\n   (b) Antipathetic and indifferent mentalities favoured by the distant school deprive also the children from a suitable training.\n4. The HEALTH OF THE NATIVES shall be favoured with a school.\n\n5. The modern EDUCATION, considering as a general principle the necessity of teaching the child in his mother-language and with IT \"To neglect the native language is liable to the danger of hindering and ruining the productive activity of the scholars\". (African International Institute Postula)...shall find its realization here, by gathering all the Hare Indians in the same one school.\n\nFor the above mentioned reasons, WE CITIZENS of Norman, request that the matter be given all worthily consideration.\n\nWe subscribe, devotedly yours,\n\nM.

Other PSYCHOLOGICAL Factors require also the said school to promote Education, dispel prejudices against it and secure a more efficient influence on the social life of the Natives.\n   (a) An hostile mentality in the Indians' minds restrains the attendance at the distant school.\n   (b) Antipathetic and indifferent mentalities favoured by the distant school deprive also the children from a suitable training.\n4. The HEALTH OF THE NATIVES shall be favoured with a school.\n\n5. The modern EDUCATION, considering as a general principle the necessity of teaching the child in his mother-language and with IT \"To neglect the native language is liable to the danger of hindering and ruining the productive activity of the scholars\". (African International Institute Postula)...shall find its realization here, by gathering all the Hare Indians in the same one school.\n\nFor the above mentioned reasons, WE CITIZENS of Norman, request that the matter be given all worthily consideration.\n\nWe subscribe, devoutedly yours,\n\nM.

He was requested to ascertain the number of children of school age and the denomination to which they belong, of whites, half-breeds and Indians at that point, and to furnish a report on his return, giving as full information as possible, regarding the request of the residents for the establishment of a school.\n\nI may add that no funds are provided in our Appropriation for the current fiscal year to erect a school building at this point, and there is no likelihood of the establishment of a school in the near future. You will be forwarded a copy of Mr. Christianson's report when same is received by this Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. A.

Lorne Turner, Esq., Director, the request having been sent to you through R. A. Gibson, Esq., Deputy Commissioner:\n\n- 3 - SCHOOL AT FORT NORMAN:\n\nIn my opinion there is no question about a school being required at this point: There are 26 children at the Fort, termed as Whites, although some of them are Half-breeds. These children range in age from 5 to 14 years, averaging about 9 years of age. Taking the Indian children in the vicinity of Norman and Bear Lake, there are 66 between the ages of 7 and 16. The total number of children of school age is about 92: I believe the Director has this information. There are so many things to consider in the way of expenses up in that North country, that I believe we should probably endeavour to get a hospital at Norman before even considering the building of a school. However, as I have pointed out, the need is there, especially for the children belonging to White residents of the Fort.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Is a hospital to be provided by either of the Missions. Do you know whether either Mission is going to establish a school?\n\nWe are asking our District Agent, Mr. Austin L. Cumming, for a report. In the meantime we would appreciate any information you can give us.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Gibson.\nDeputy Commissioner.\n\nHarold W. McGill, Esq., M.C., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSeptember 12, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the establishment of a residential school at Norman. This is a matter that has not as yet been given consideration.\n\nMy desire, in the first place, was to have the headquarters of the agency transferred to Norman from Good Hope, but, as you are no doubt aware, the Minister asked that the matter of providing living accommodation for the Agent at Norman be deferred for the present.\n\nI have had no intimation that either of the Missions interested in this district is considering the establishment of a school or a hospital at this point.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. W. McGill.\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nR. A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDeputy Commissioner,\nNorthwest Territories,\nO T T A W A.\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nOn the 29th ultimo the Rev. Dr. Gould, General Secretary of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada, discussed with officers of our Lands, Northwest Territories and Yukon Branch, the matter of the establishment of a residential school or hospital, or both, at Norman.\n\nDr. Gould stated definitely that a recommendation would be submitted to the Executive Committee of the Missionary Society that a residential school be established at Norman in preference to a hospital. He thought provision should be made for thirty boarders the first year. The accommodation would provide for Indians and half-breeds from the Great Bear Lake and Gravel River areas, also for the day pupils of the Settlement.\n\nDr. Gould pointed out that the majority of the parents with children of school age in the Norman area were Protestants. However, he wanted it understood that there would be no objection to boarders or day pupils receiving religious instructions outside the school if their parents so desire.\n\nIn a message dated the 8th ultimo from the District Agent at Fort Smith he stated that Bishop Breynat was not considering the erection of a residential school at Norman.\n\nIn connection with the establishment of a hospital at Norman, Dr. Gould said he thought a separate\n\nH.W. McGill, Esq., M.D., M.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nbuilding near the school could be erected. It could be used for serious cases or as an isolation ward for contagious or infectious diseases. Discussion in this regard was incomplete as Dr. Gould had an engagement with yourself. It is possible that you went into the matter further with him.\n\nThe foregoing is for your information. We would be glad to be kept advised as to what you have in mind in the way of medical service at Norman.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Commissioner.\nEX'D.\n\nNovember 17th, 1936.\n\nDear Mr. Gibson:\n\nIn reply to your letter of November 12th, I may say that our estimates for 1937-38, so far as they have been developed at present, do not contain any provision for assistance in the establishment of a residential school or a hospital at Great Bear Lake.\n\nWe have been trying to arrange to transfer the medical officer at Fort Good Hope to Fort Norman and I have some hope of being able to do so before the end of the coming winter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nR.

Is there a building available or would it be necessary to erect a school? If a new school is required, you should let me know the approximate number of children who would likely attend it. I would like to hear from you as soon as convenient, as we will be preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1946-47 within the next few weeks.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

I have written to the Father in charge of the mission at that point, for information as to the approximate number of children of school age, and other details.\n\nI believe that there is at present no building available for school purposes. It will therefore be necessary to consider the construction of such a building, as well as a residence for the teacher, as I am quite sure that there is likewise no place in the settlement which would serve this purpose either.\n\nAs soon as I have heard from Father Denis at Fort Norman, I will communicate his information to you, so that your report may not be retarded.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n+ J.M.

However, these are only temporary expedients, as the need for new residential schools at the two points mentioned is particularly pressing.\n\nConsequently, I would respectfully suggest that in the preparation of the educational estimates for your Branch consideration be given to the inclusion of amounts adequate to cover the cost of construction of new residential schools at Fort Rae and Fort Norman, each capable of accommodating one hundred children. These points are already served with hospital facilities, and the residents are predominately Indian. Fort Rae and district have 636 Dog Rib Indians who are nomadic and visit the Fort only at intervals.\n\nThe Fort Norman district contains some 350 treaty Indians, and a copy of a petition for the construction of a residential school is attached. In conversation Bishop Trocellier stated that as both the Rae and Norman areas are predominantly Catholic, he would be prepared to staff the projected schools.\nWhile the main estimates that I have prepared should receive priority, the two suggested residential schools mentioned above merit inclusion, if at all possible.\n\nEnclosure\n\nJ.

With respect to this matter, I should like to comment as follows:\n\nOn August 11th I made an investigation of educational facilities at Fort Norman, talked with Constable Hurley of the R.C.M.P., local residents and members of the Roman Catholic mission, and inspected conditions among the natives residing there. The area contains some 350 treaty Indians, together with some whites and half-breeds. I was impressed with the general enthusiasm for a school, and in view of my personal count of more than 70 children of school age I feel that this locality is deserving of immediate attention.\n\nUntil such time as a further investigation is possible, I would suggest the following measures:\n\n(1) That for the year ending June 1947 the igloo owned by the Department of National Health and Welfare be made use of as temporary school premises.\n\n(2) That the local residents be responsible for the provision of heat and light.\n\n(3) That the Bureau of Northwest Territories and the Indian Affairs Branch bear the cost of teaching services and school supplies on a pro rata basis.\nMore detailed information concerning the situation at Fort Rae will be incorporated in the report of the survey trip being prepared by the writer.\n\nJ.

Information could be obtained by wire concerning the equipment needed and someone at that point could be given authority to remodel one of the igloos for classroom purposes.\n\nAs the majority of the children in this area are Indians, we are leaving it with your Branch to take the initiative in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEncl.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 904-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Officer Commanding,\nR.C.M. Police,\nFort Smith, Sub/Division,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Educational Programme -\nFt. Norman, N.W.T.\n\n1. With reference to the above and to the visit made to the settlement of Ft. Norman during the summer of 1946, by Mr. W. J. McKinnon, Superintendent of Education, N.W.T. & Yukon Affairs Branch, I wish to advise the following:\n\n2. As the writer was present with Mr. W. J. McKinnon when natives of this district were interviewed regarding a school being started at this point, many enquiries have been made at this office by residents as to what action has been taken by the Gov't in this regard. The only information that the writer was able to give to such enquiries was that Mr. W. J. McKinnon was of the opinion that a school was badly needed at this point and that every effort would be made to have a school at Ft. Norman.\n\n3. Recently during a visit by the Indian Agent, Dr. J. P. Harvey of Aklavik, it was learned that the Dept. have had difficulty in obtaining teachers for the schools in Northern points. In this regard I wish to report that the writer was interviewed on 28-3-47 by Mrs. R. H. Botten, wife of the W.O.I., 1/c R.C.S. Fort Norman.\n\n4. Mrs. Botten was formerly a school teacher, having taught in the Provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. At the present time Mrs. Botten is teaching the White children of this settlement at her home here at Norman. At the time the writer was in conversation with Mrs. Botten, she stated that she had heard that the Gov't. was planning on starting a school at this point and that further she had been given to understand the main reason for a school having not already been started was due to the lack of a teacher. As Mrs. Botten is already teaching a class of six white pupils she is of the opinion that if the Department would make arrangements to secure a building and equipment for a school at Norman that Half-breed and Indian children could be included in her classes. In this regard Mrs. Botten was given the address of Mr. W. J. McKinnon, Supt. of Education, she stating that she would contact him personally.\n5. In regard to a building being secured at Ft. Norman for a temporary school, I would refer to a suggestion made by Mr. M. Meikle of the Department during his visit with Mr. McKinnon to this settlement in 1946, that a quonset hut (Igloo) which it is believed is the property of the Dept. of Health and Welfare, be temporarily utilized for a school building. Very little work would be required in this regard, the problem of seating and desks being the largest item.\n\n6. This report has been submitted for the information of the Department concerned for whatever action they should deem advisable. It is respectfully requested, that due to the many enquiries being made at this office by the Natives regarding school, that we please be advised of any decision that is being made. This request is being made so as to allow the Indians concerned to make arrangements for their children should a school be started in Ft. Norman this coming summer.\n\n(Sgd) L. C. Hunter, Cst.\n\n(L.

McKinnon,\nSupt. of Education,\nN.W.T. & Yukon Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have recently become resident in Fort Norman, my husband having been posted to the Radio Station here. As we have one child of nine years of age, I accordingly view the problem of schooling, not only for her but for the children of the community at large, as one of prime importance.\n\nI am led to believe that your department has signified willingness to establish a school here and that the chief obstacle has been unsuccessful efforts to procure a teacher. Contingent upon my acceptability I would be more than willing to accept the teaching position, if permitted to do so. I have not practised the profession since my marriage ten years ago but I have, from time to time, rendered assistance and kept in touch. I held a First Class Interim Certificate from Saskatoon Normal School issued in 1924. I taught Ohio School in the district of Imperial, Sask., until the summer of 1935, when I went North to Fort Chipewyan, Alta., and taught a private school there for a year. For a period of four months in 1936 prior to my marriage I taught the school at Camsell Portage, Sask. From these last two appointments it will be seen that I am not unfamiliar with teaching and general conditions in the North.\n\nMy marriage of course eliminated the necessity of applying for a permanent certificate, as I had no intention of continuing in the profession as such. However, in the light of the existing situation here and the fact that I feel myself capable of filling this important need, I would be glad to resume teaching and would appreciate my acceptance in this capacity.\n\nI am, by request of respective parents, currently conducting school in my own home for six of the local children. Unfortunately, this is but a portion of the children of school age, as extremely limited accommodation and facilities will permit no more.\n\n......\nFor reference, if desired, may I submit the names of Mr. Norman Coulter, Chairman of Imperial School Board, and Mrs. Hazel Midgley, former teacher and present resident at Yellowknife, N.W.T.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Helen E. Batten,\n(nee Helen Bahr).\nOttawa, 29th April, 1947.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch, Booth Building,\nOttawa.\n\nFind attached hereto copy of a letter received from Mrs. Helen E. Ratten of Fort Norman.\n\nIn view of the difficulty of obtaining teachers at the present time, it might be advisable to take advantage of her willingness to serve in the community.\n\nYour comments on this matter would be appreciated.\n\nJ.

HARVEY\nIndian Agent Aklavik, N.W.T.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 904-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Meikle\n\nRe: Fort Norman\n\nI carried out an educational survey at Fort Norman on June 13th and 14th, during which time I discussed educational problems with representatives of the R.C.M.P., R.C.G.S., the Hudson's Bay Company, and all the local residents.\n\nI was invited to take part in a meeting attended by all the Indians of this area. During the course of this meeting they requested that the government provide them with a government-operated day school and promised that they would do their very best to see that the children attended school regularly. The local inhabitants informed me that there were 70 children of school age in the vicinity, and that about 40 of them would attend school the first year. Mrs. R. S. Botten, who holds a First Class Teacher's Certificate from Saskatchewan, dated 1934, and who has two and one-half years teaching experience, was the unanimous choice of all the residents as teacher of the proposed school. She has a very fine personality, and I witnessed the excellent training which she has given to a small group of children who are receiving instruction from her in one of the rooms at her home.\n\nMy own personal opinion is that we would have about 15 permanent pupils attending school at this settlement during the first year. The enrolment may reach 40 at various seasons, and doubtless there will be an increase in attendance as the natives realize the need for practical educational training.\n\nIn any event classroom supplies were ordered on June 14th and it is hoped that a permanent school will be opened at this point as soon as possible in order that we may retain the confidence of the local citizens.\n\nI examined the igloo which had been proposed as temporary quarters for a day school and found it to be most unsuitable. Such a building would be greatly damaged during the process of being moved. It has few windows, poor air space, and would be unhealthy for occupation by children. Therefore, I propose that the government either open a school in the garage owned by the Department of National Health and Welfare, procure a Dallas hut from Norman Wells, or purchase a suitable prefabricated building. I am inclined to the opinion that the latter course would prove to be the most satisfactory.\n\nMr. Stensby of the Department of Public Works, who was erecting a R.C.M.P. building, said that he would remodel and insulate the garage owned by National Health and Welfare for about $1,000. Failing this he would be free to renovate a Dallas hut for classroom purposes. Mr. Foster of Imperial Oil Exploration at Norman Wells promised Constable L. C. Hunter of Fort Norman that he would provide a Dallas hut at a maximum cost of $900. As the Northern Transportation Company boats are going from the Wells to Norman frequently, there would be no difficulty in having...\none of these buildings transported there. The Dallas huts are 48' x 20' and it would be necessary to dismantle and erect them with care. They are constructed in sections and Mr. McNiven, a member of the Northwest Territories Council, has advised that it would be necessary to place them on a false studding 2' high, re-cut the windows and thus renovate them into permanent buildings. He is of the opinion that they are no use whatsoever unless this renovation is done, and states that by it they can be converted into comfortable and well-appearing permanent buildings.\n\nI looked over the townsite, and all the local residents agreed that we reserve for school purposes 3 acres of land on Lot No. 17, south of the road and adjoining the west boundary of Lot No. 17. This area should be 6 chains running east and west, and 5 chains running north and south. On June 14th I wired Mr. R. A. Gibson, Deputy Commissioner, requesting reservation of the above site. There should be no difficulty in obtaining this area as it already belongs to the Indian Affairs Branch and since the garage owned by National Health and Welfare is at present located thereon.\n\nShould a new school be planned for erection at this point, a bulldozer should be used to remove the moss from the area in order that the permanent frost would disappear and so that the building could be erected on a firm foundation. Local residents informed me that a bulldozer would be on hand at Norman within the next few weeks, and that we should take advantage of this opportunity to have the work done. This work should be begun after the end of this month so that the ground will dry out in August.\n\nThe most important factor for the welfare and education of the residents at Fort Norman is a good Indian Agent. The Indian Affairs Branch ought to endeavour to obtain an outstanding married man with practical ability in carpentry, gardening, and practical activities, combined with an understanding of Indians, who would act as Indian Agent while his wife served as teacher. With such a combination the financial remuneration could be made so attractive that the Department would have no difficulty in providing this settlement with the best type of government employees.\n\nJ.

As I am a married woman supported by my husband, I am unable to place myself in any of the categories for which form T.D.1 is intended. For income tax purposes I can apparently only be classified as a single person without dependents and therefore am not required to complete T.D.1. However, for record purposes, I return these forms claiming basic exemption only.\n\n3. As for tax purposes my status is single and as, due to my teaching, my husband must of necessity employ a full time housekeeper to maintain a self-contained domestic establishment as per item 4(D) of T.D.1, we assume that his income tax status remains unchanged.\n\n4. If any of the above assumptions are incorrect, may I be advised please, as there is no local authority to consult.\n\n(Mrs. Helen E. Botten)\nOttawa, November 29, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRE: Fort Norman Indian Day School, No. 904.\n\nPlease find attached income tax forms submitted by Mrs. Helen Botten, teacher at the above school. You will find also a letter from Mrs. Botten clarifying her position as a married woman supported by her husband. Mrs. Botten is the wife of the Warrant Officer in charge of the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals stationed at Fort Norman, N.W.T. We were able to persuade her, in view of her teaching experience, to take over the position of teacher at this school.\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nFebruary 14th, 1948.\n\nB.F. Neary,\nSupt. Welfare & Training\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding this note, the monthly Attendance Report of the Fort Norman Day School, for the month of January 1948.\n\nIt will be noted that several more Indian children have been enrolled in this school during this month. The attendance so far has been very irregular due to the fact that the parents of the children necessarily have to go many miles from the Settlement in order to make a living. It will also be noted that several children are enrolled in the school and are unable to attend for medical reasons.\n\nAs this is the first year a school has been in operation in this district, I have not recommended the suspension of any Family Allowance for non-attendance. The reason for not recommending any suspension of Family Allowance is that the parents appear to be making an effort to have the children attend but owing to financial conditions they are forced to leave the Settlement to make a living.\n\nIt is believed that in the coming year a better attendance may be expected, as the natives will be aware of the fact that some measures must be taken, such as having ample fuel supply etc., in order that their children may attend school. It is hoped that the Family Allowance Branch and the Welfare and Training Branch will agree with the procedure adopted and allow me to have another year with the use of persuasion in obtaining a regular school attendance. Should any of the Natives refuse to co-operate, I will not hesitate recommending the Suspension of Family Allowance.\n\nI.C. Hunter,\nIndian Agent.\nFort Norman N.W.T.\n5th February 1948\n\nB.F.

H. Botten, teacher. This school was started in September of 1947, and has been conducted in a temporary building. To date this school has been very much of a success as far as the white and Half Breed children are concerned and also the few Indian children who are able to attend. There are many Indians in this district who should be attending school. It is realized the Indian Act provides all children must attend school where a school is available, however to enforce this for the current year would necessitate most of the families remaining in the settlement and being maintained, at great expense, by the Indian Affairs branch. I do expect to have the Indian pupil attendance increased for the next school term, as financial circumstances, combined with lack of foresight on the part of the Indian have driven them out to their hunting grounds in order to eke out a living. Even the anticipated increase in attendance next term will be small in comparison with the number of school age children.\n\nL. C. Hunter,\nIndian Agent.\nFort Norman, N.W.T.,\nMarch 11, 1948.\n\nI wish to state that I have recently returned from a visit of every settlement in this Indian Agency, at which time I visited all schools, spending as much time as possible with the teachers.\n\nA suggestion in regard to the settlement of Fort Norman, is a hostel be built; operated by the Roman Catholic Sisters to accommodate the Indians who are ninety percent of the Roman Catholic faith, and the school be operated apart from the hostel, as a Government Day School with a lay teacher, to accommodate the white and half breed children, who are mainly of the Protestant faith. This suggestion means one school be operated to accommodate all children.\n\nL. C. Hunter\nIndian Agent\n\nCopied\nJGM\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nApril 20th, 1948.\n\nCol. B.F.

As my letter to you of May tenth, 1948, stated that the school re-opened on that date, I checked with Mrs. Helen Botten and found that she had been teaching the children in her home since the first of the month. In view of this fact, I consider that in fairness to the teacher that the return is correct in showing 20 teaching days.\n\nI further wish to draw attention to the fact that during the month of May there were no children of Indian status in attendance, the thirteen children in attendance being white children. The months of April and May are the main trapping season of the Indian and there were no families in the immediate district who were close enough to the settlement to have their children attend school. As stated in previous letters, I hope to have a better attendance of Indian children for the coming school year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.C. Hunter, Indian Agent.\nJuly 19, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. McKinnon:\n\nFort Norman Indian Day School.\n\nOn June 3, 1948, I sent you a copy of a letter received from Mrs. Mary M. Foss who was interested in the above Day School.\n\nI asked you to write directly to Mrs. Foss concerning certain of the points which was raised in her letter and asked you to send a copy of your reply to me.\n\nWe do not seem to have received a copy of this reply and I was wondering if you have heard anything further from Mrs. Foss.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nJ.W. McKinnon, Esq.,\nInspector of Schools,\nNorthwest Territories Administration,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nNorlite Building,\nOttawa.\n\nBFN/HM.\nJuly 16, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Bellavance:\n\nI understand that you are interested in two of our schools, namely Roche River, in the Northwest Territories, and Seine River, in the Fort Frances Agency, Ontario.\n\nI am now able to advise you that the Roche River School will not likely be completed by the end of the summer holidays and therefore will not likely be open during the 1948-49 academic year. However, we do have a school in the Northwest Territories, at Fort Norman, which might interest you. It has now been open for two years and has been operated by the wife of one of the Signalers stationed there by the Department of National Defence. As pointed out in my letter of June 9, you would be entitled, in all probability, to a Northern Living Allowance if you accepted this school.\n\nI would like to hear from you as soon as possible as to whether you wish to accept either the Seine River School or the Fort Norman School.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nMr. Norbert Bellavance,\n150 Provencher Avenue,\nSt. Boniface, Manitoba.\nP. M. OTTAWA, July 20, 1948.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary, Superintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch, Booth Building, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter of July 19th concerning Mrs. Mary M. Foss who is interested in employment as a teacher in the Fort Norman school, I regret to say that your previous letter of July 3rd suggesting that I write her directly was overlooked on the file.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of the letter which I am today forwarding to Mrs. Foss.\n\nJ. W. McKinnon,\nInspector of Schools.\nOTTAWA, July 20, 1948.\n\nCopy for Col. B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education, Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nDear Mrs. Foss:\n\nOn June 3rd Mr. Neary, Superintendent of Education for the Indian Affairs Branch, informed you that he was referring to me one of your previous letters in order that I might answer some of your questions concerning the new school at Fort Norman. I should like to apologize for the fact that Mr. Neary's letter was overlooked, and this accounts for my delay in getting the information to you.\n\nThe new school now being constructed at Fort Norman contains two classrooms on the ground floor, together with cloakroom and toilets for boys and girls, plus a storage room. On the second floor are the residential quarters for the teacher, consisting of three bedrooms, a kitchen, a living room, a dining room and a bathroom. Present plans call for the employment of one teacher, but it is expected that the school enrolment by another year will justify the employment of a second teacher. Three bedrooms have been provided in the teacher's quarters in order that the second teacher might be accommodated there. The living quarters are furnished, with the exception of linens and bedding.\n\nThe only transportation to Fort Norman is by air. We are at present awaiting a decision as to whether or not the Government will pay air transportation costs for teachers from Edmonton to their destination.\n\nI am sorry that I am not in a position to advise you as to whether or not your husband could obtain employment at Fort Norman.\n\nMrs. Mary M. Foss,\nFurness,\nSaskatchewan.\nThe schools in the Territories follow the Alberta public school curriculum. The enrolment in the Fort Norman school will probably be approximately twenty pupils as a beginning.\n\nIf I can assist you with any further information, I shall be pleased within my power to do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: Teacher - Fort Norman,\nIndian Day School.\n\nI refer to your signal of September 11th, and to my signal of September 14th, regarding a teacher for the Fort Norman Indian Day School. I do not think it would be advisable to move Mr. Allard of Fort Rae, to Fort Norman. My reasons for this are; Mr. Allard has been at Fort Rae since April of this year and is now acquainted with the situation at that point. Your suggestion of Mr. Allard's sister as teacher at Fort Rae is advisable providing she acts as assistant to Mr. Allard but Fort Rae is too remote and rugged a settlement to expect any woman to carry on alone in. Further, I am of the opinion that the Fort Rae School requires the services of two teachers and the only means of accomplishing this would be to have brother and sister, or husband and wife.\n\nAs stated in my signal to you Mrs. Boyce, wife of the local Game Warden, is available as teacher at this point. As you are aware the living quarters of the school under erection at Fort Norman, will be unfinished until December of this year therefore the obtaining of Mrs. Boyce's services would dispense with any problems concerning living accommodation.\n\nThe qualifications of Mrs. Boyce are as follows: One year teaching experience, Province of Saskatchewan Superior First Class Certificate which expired 1940.\nFive years as Civil Service clerk, and one year in the Canadian Women's Army Corps.\n\nMrs. Boyce has stated her willingness to take over this school, at least, until the Christmas Season, and has assured me she will give us sufficient notice to enable us to secure the services of another teacher, should she decide discontinue teaching.\n\nL.C.

The building is closed in with siding in place and a tar and gravel roof has been proceeded with so as to protect the building, but not wholly completed, cold weather in the late fall preventing its completion. Electrical work has been completed, hot-air heating installed and in operation. The carpenter crew will finish, it is expected, during January. At that time the class could be transferred if desired, from the present temporary quarters, to the new school building. The alternative would be to retain the school in its present quarters until the spring or early summer, when the weather would not be too severe for the transfer. This, however, is a matter for local decision. Some work will be needed next year, such as outside painting, installation of plumbing and other small items of unfinished work.\n\nShipping instructions as follows:\n\nTo reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Northern Transportation Company.\nAPPLICATION FOR EMPLOYMENT IN INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\n1.

I regret to report that during this period the attendance of Indian children was practically nil. As you are aware we were without a teacher for the month of September, this being the month when the natives leave the settlements for the bush to obtain fish for the winter. As it so happened that the school was not opened in September, all the Indians and their families moved out to the bush and shortly after the \"freeze-up period\" set in. It therefore made it impossible for any of the children to return to Fort Norman until the month of December.\n\nI am happy to report that since the Christmas holiday season that the attendance of the Ft. Norman School is approximately twenty one pupils, half of this number being Indian children. It may be mentioned that to obtain this attendance of Indian children, it has been necessary for me to place the majority of the families with children on welfare relief. It is becoming extremely difficult to have these families remain in the settlements and be self reliant as the fur and fur prices are on a steady decline while the prices of food are steadily climbing. The attendance as stated above, or slightly higher, will be maintained until the end of March, 1949, at which time I will be obliged to allow the Indians to return to the bush for what is known as a \"Spring Hunt\".\n\nThe largest attendance of Indian children in the Fort Norman School, could be obtained\nduring the months of July and August. I would therefore request your permission to have the Fort Norman Day School remain open for those months for the attendance of Indian children only.\n\nRecently while in Edmonton, Alta., on other duties, I was in conversation with Mr. Johnston, District Engineer of the Department of Public Works. Mr. Johnston assured me that the new school building at Fort Norman, would be ready for opening by the first of July 1949. I would therefore suggest, should you agree that the school be opened for the months of July and August, that the teacher for the school year 1949/50, be at Fort Norman during the later part of June 1949.\n\nL.C.

When I receive your application form I will be able to provide you with other details.\n\nUnfortunately, we will not be able to complete the schools at Arctic Red River and Fort Franklin this year, due to reduced public expenditure. I have therefore written to Mr. Blackburn, suggesting that you discuss with him the possibility of going to either Fort Norman or Fort Good Hope.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Mr. Blackburn, unfortunately, does not hold a teaching certificate but is a good practical teacher after his years of experience. In a way I would prefer that he go to Fort Good Hope as he had had experience in isolated communities.\n\nMrs. Pittman is the sister of Mrs. Blackburn and she and her husband would probably do better at Fort Norman.

Please find attached a list of furnishings being provided for the school at Fort Good Hope. Please find attached also a list of the food supplies required for the personal use of the teacher at the Fort Good Hope School. Refund of the cost of these supplies will be obtained from the amount allowed as a Northern Living Allowance.\n\nAll these supplies have been ordered and are on their way to the school. You will note from the list of furniture that practically every need is covered except blankets, linen and towels.\n\nI am wiring the District Engineer of the Department of Public Works concerning the date on which he expects the school at Fort Good Hope to be completed. I expect that it will be about October first, which will of course be too late for boat transportation. In fact I am not sure that boat transportation for passengers is available at all this year down the Mackenzie. I would suggest you write immediately concerning this to\n\nNorthern Transportation Company, Limited,\n10157 - 99th Street, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nIf you can get transportation by boat as far as Fort Norman, I would be prepared to have you open the school there.\nabout the middle of August and proceed to Fort Good Hope when that school is completed in late September.\n\nI am going to write to your wife's sister, Mrs. Pittman, and offer her the school at Fort Norman. You may of course wish to consult her and decide to take the school at Fort Norman yourself and to allow Mr. and Mrs. Pittman to go to Fort Good Hope. This is a matter of course for future correspondence.\n\nI am sending an application form to Mrs. Pittman and, naturally, cannot decide concerning her employment until I hear from her.\n\nThe school at Fort Norman has only become vacant recently as we have had the wife of the local game warden teaching there until the end of June, but she will not be able to carry on after that date.\n\nFort Norman is a bigger settlement than Fort Good Hope and is the location of our Indian Superintendent, Mr. L. C. Hunter. If you wish any further details concerning Fort Norman and Fort Good Hope, I would suggest you write to him, airmail, at once, as he will be able to provide you with much more information than I.\n\nI would prefer to have you go to Fort Good Hope as your previous experience with the Indians will be of more assistance to the Department there.\n\nPlease write to me as soon as possible concerning the points mentioned above.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

At Franklin there are 33...all Catholic. Whites number about 8 Prot. (4 of whom are leaving soon) and 4 Cath.\n\nFrom these figures it is easy to see that the children are in the vast majority Catholic and although we have no Catholic school for them here as yet, still we wish them to learn something about God in school.\n\nFor this reason we are anxious that a Catholic teacher be appointed to this post. Unfortunately the present teacher, although excellent, is Catholic in name only.\n\nWe understand that the school now being completed here at a cost of around $60,000.00 is being put up for the Indians and therefore it seems logical that they should be served in preference to the few whites who may attend. But these Natives are anxious that the burden of instructing their offspring in the knowledge of God and His laws be taken from their shoulders and put upon those of the better qualified school teacher. During the winter I filled in, in this capacity, for the one half hour of school time per week that was allotted me. We need more time. And this time should not be at the end of the last day of the week...or at the end of any day of the week for that matter, because it gives the impression that they are staying \"after\" school, especially when they see the Protestant children troop out. The Knowledge of God and His law is the most important subject a child can possibly study at school.\n\nAlthough the Canadian Gov. is pouring money into this Fort in the form of a beautiful new school, they seem to be ignorant of the fact that the majority of the Indian children will be unable to benefit by this school because their parents are trappers and cannot afford to stay in the Fort long. As much as they would like to leave their children in school this cannot be done if there is no place for them to eat and sleep. A boarding school is imperative here if the Indians are to benefit by this recent outlay. The Indian agent here agrees that the logical solution is to obtain the services of several of those Sisters who are successfully caring for Indian children at other posts while their parents are in the bush.\n\nSincerely\n\nRev.

I am happy to report that this situation has been greatly relieved if not entirely overcome among the resident population. Great care is exercised in seeing that school children are washed and have their hair combed before arriving at school. During recess period, twice daily, the children receive vitamin pills, milk or hot cocoa and cookies.\n\nOn September 19th, night classes were started in an effort to at least arrive the adult Indian at a point where he can read and write leisurely and do fundamental arithmetic. So far the response has been gratifying. A great deal of difficulty...\nis experienced because of their constantly moving from place to place. As a result, their attendance is irregular and this tends to hold a check on their advancement. I find that the older Indians who actually have a desire to learn experience very little difficulty in doing so. It is not uncommon for one of these people to arrive at school unable to speak or understand a word of English and at the end of the first session be able to entirely recite the alphabet, read and understand thoroughly all of the first of a series of grade one readers.\n\nClasses are conducted from 7:00 - 10:00 P.M. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Those attending vary in age from thirteen to fifty years of age. To date the highest register number is 16. Many natives are beginning to realize that this is an opportunity and during the past two weeks the attendance has raised steadily as is indicated on the attached attendance sheet.\n\nEducational films are being shown to the entire population from time to time. Film strips are shown to the night class students once a week. A great deal of enthusiasm is displayed and this method seems invaluable in getting ideas across to those who have little command of the English tongue.\n\nA program of entertainment is at present being considered so that during the winter months at least the natives will have educational and recreational opportunities.\n\nJ.A.

I am now in receipt of a somewhat similar message which Mr. McKinnon has addressed to me and which reads -\n\n\"Suggest you negotiate for the acquisition of minimum of 15 Dallas huts from Imperial Oil Explorations, Norman Wells, for erection of public day school buildings and staff quarters at various locations. Suggestion is made as action to acquire the buildings may be taken at once lest other interested parties may gain possession of these buildings now in the North. If fiscal year 1947-48 appropriation will not purchase them, suggest arrangements be made with Imperial Oil to retain and earmark for school purposes until payment can be approved through the normal government channel of procedure. Above suggestions have been discussed with Major White B.P.W. and many others.\"\n\nHowever, our experience in buying these Dallas huts has not been particularly fortunate and we find that the longer the acquisition is delayed the more apt we are to get the less desirable buildings. In other words, everything gets picked over pretty well. We have not money to buy Dallas huts this year. You may be more fortunate. If you are interested we can ask Fred Fraser, our Mining Recorder at Yellowknife, who is making a trip down the Mackenzie in his own boat to have a look at these huts and give you a businessman's view on same.\n\nR.A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nJune 23, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nMr. McKinnon, Inspector of Schools, has sent me a copy of a wireless message which he addressed to you on the 21st instant and which reads as follows:\n\n\"Walker Taylor manager Imperial Oil exploration advises that there are available for educational purposes Dallas huts measuring forty eight feet by twenty feet STOP Consider these huts would be suitable for day schools and for teachers residence to meet urgent need in getting schools established for coming term STOP Require two huts each at Fort Norman Fort Good Hope and Fort Franklin STOP Huts estimated cost nine hundred dollars each at the walls STOP Estimated total cost of the project twenty five thousand dollars equipped STOP Recommend Department of Public Works now in country do dismantelling and erecting of buildings STOP Consider buildings will be used as adjunct to permanent school establishment when provided STOP Consider it necessary this program be got underway immediately STOP\n\nWill you please let me know what action you can take on this.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n4 July, 1947.\n\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch Department of Mines and Resources.\n\nI attach hereto, copy of letter from the District Engineer at Edmonton concerning the release of a Dallus Hut for school purposes at Fort Norman, N.W.T. The hut is presently at Great Bear River.\n\nShould you be interested in the acquisition of thus hut, will you kindly so state and also advise if you will assume the cost of transportation from Great Bear River to Fort Norman, and the care and erection of the hut at Fort Norman.\n\nFA/S.\n\nR. Blais\nChief Engineer.\nThe following radiogram, dated June 23rd, has been received from T.Newcomen, Engineer, at Great Bear River, N.W.Ts \u2014\n\n\"REFERENCE DALLAS HUT USED AS COOK AND MESS HUT stop UNLESS OTHER ARRANGEMENTS MADE THIS BUILDING WOULD COME IN USEFUL FOR SCHOOL USE FORT NORMAN stop POLICE ADVISE THAT ALL RE-ERECTING WOULD BE LOCKED AFTER BY LOCAL PEOPLE stop THIS HUT IS NOT SHOWN ON OUR INVENTORY stop SCHOOL ACCOMMODATION AT NORMAN BADLY NEEDED stop PLEASE ADVISE\".\n\nI do not know what has led up to this radiogram beyond that it must be information which Mr.Newcomen obtained locally, as I have had no previous intimation that a Dallas Hut was required for school purposes at Fort Norman, before Mr.Newcomen left here. I discussed with him, however, the possibility that some of the buildings now at Great Bear River would be dismantled by his crew and it was believed at that time none of these would be moved to Fort Franklin for the purpose of a school and teachersage. The Dallas Hut referred to by Mr.Newcomen is a used construction Camp remaining from Great Bear River construction programme.\n\nThe last word I had regarding any buildings at Fort Franklin was a letter received from you with attached copy of letter of May 10th, from R.A.Honey, Director of Indian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources. This letter stated that Mr.J.W.MacKinnon, Inspector of Schools for the Northwest Territories, would inspect conditions at Fort Franklin and advise further. I must point out, however, that if it is intended to have any buildings moved to Fort Franklin, I should know about this very shortly.\n\nFurthermore, the question of moving freight this year is very acute, and if it is intended to move these buildings to another location, arrangements should be made shortly with the water transportation company.\n\nThere are at Great Bear River, in addition to the construction Camp suggested by Mr.Newcomen as being required at Fort Norman, the following:\n\nOne Caboose suggested by Mr.Oldham for Great Bear River, at Franklin end of road;\nOne Caboose suggested by Mr.Oldham for Great Bear River, at head of Rapids;\n2 Igloos, part of which were suggested for Indian School facilities and teachersage at Fort Franklin, but the situation regarding same is now unknown.\n\nI have just received a report from Mr.Newcomen that owing to rainy weather and breakdown in equipment, the work at Great Bear River Road has not proceeded as fast as might have been expected. I have\nno up to date information regarding his prospect of finishing the work this year, and it is just possible that several of these buildings might be required at Great Bear River another year, if \u2014\n\n(a) it is necessary to ask for further funds this year which cannot be granted; or\n\n(b) further work is done on the Road next year.\n\nIn any case, I would suggest the activities of this Department could be consolidated into the two Cabanas and the two Igloos, so that the construction Camp suggested for Fort Norman might be released at once if this decision is made.\n\nWill you please draw the matter of this construction Camp for Fort Norman, as a school, to the attention of the proper authority, and let me know.\n\nW.J. Johnston,\nActing District Engineer.\n\nP.S. The two Igloos are 16' x 32' each instead of the regulation 16' x 40'.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 904-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nARMY SIGNAL\n\nPORT RADIM JULY 10/47\n\nMR.

Hoey, Esq., Director, Indian Affairs Branch, Booth Building, Ottawa.\n\nRe: School Site - Fort Norman\n\nOur District Agent at Fort Smith, Mr. Fred Fraser, recently visited Fort Norman and confirmed the choice of site for the new school previously made by Inspector of Schools McKinnon and District Engineer Johnston. The site selected is Lot 17, which property is already owned by the Indian Affairs Branch. This lot has a road frontage of about 660 ft. and an average depth of 530 ft., giving a total area of 8 acres.\n\nThe District Agent reports that there is a slough at the rear of Lot 17 that can be drained by the excavation of a ditch about one-quarter of a mile long from the easterly end of Lot 17 to the bank of the Mackenzie River, passing through Lot 23 which is vacant Crown land. He estimates that the cost of such drainage would amount to $1400. We are now asking the Department of Public Works to verify this estimate.\n\nThe location of the new school has already been staked out on Lot 17. It is therefore suggested that steps be taken to reserve for school purposes this area which is at present owned by your Branch.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDeputy Commissioner.\nMemorandum to:\n\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRe: Norman Settlement\n\nWe return herewith your file 142-1-5 and also send you file 51-142-5-2. On this latter file in an envelope is Certificate of Title No. 410 for parts of Lot 17 as described in the certificate.\n\nThe site was acquired with the Bishop Bompas Memorial Hospital from the Anglican Church and as the title is now in the Crown Dominion, you could arrange with Dr. Moore for the use of the land for school purposes.\n\nD.

MOORE,\nINDIAN HEALTH SERVICES.\nFort Norman Indian Day School.\n\nPlease find attached a self-explanatory letter from the office of the Deputy Commissioner of Northwest Territories.\n\nAt the present time Lot 17 at Fort Norman is that piece of property on which is situated the former Bishop Bompas Memorial Hospital.\n\nCould I please be advised if it is possible to reserve any of this area for school purposes?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nEncl:\nBFN/HHM.\nOttawa, Ontario\nJuly 30, 1948\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI have your letter regarding the building of an Indian Day School at Fort Norman on Lot 17 which this Service purchased from the Anglican Church. I wonder if you could arrange to get a map of the settlement with buildings which are at present on Lot 17 marked in on their proper location. A sketch showing these and showing the low-lying land which should be drained is almost a necessity for us to make a decision.\n\nAs you know, we are erecting a Nursing Station there almost immediately and we eventually expect to replace the Fort Norman Hospital.\n\nThe Northwest Territories Administration also erected some buildings on this lot and we have nothing to show just what space is available. If there is still room after the Nursing Station is built and a site for the hospital you are certainly welcome to use such space for your Indian Day School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP. E.

Lot 17 was acquired with the Bishop Bompas Memorial Hospital from the Anglican Church and Dr. Moore's reply reads as follows:\n\n\"I have your letter regarding the building of an Indian Day School at Fort Norman on Lot 17 which this Service purchased from the Anglican Church.

The building is closed in with siding in place and a tar and gravel roof has been proceeded with so as to protect the building, but not wholly completed, cold weather in the late fall preventing its completion. Electrical work has been completed, hot-air heating installed and in operation. The carpenter crew will finish, it is expected, during January. At that time the class could be transferred if desired, from the present temporary quarters, to the new school building. The alternative would be to retain the school in its present quarters until the spring or early summer, when the weather would not be too severe for the transfer. This, however, is a matter for local decision. Some work will be needed next year, such as outside painting, installation of plumbing and other small items of unfinished work.\n\nShipping instructions as follows:\n\nTo reach Waterways May 15th for forwarding by Northern Transportation Company.\nOttawa, October 25, 1948.\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nI am attaching copy of a letter of the 20th instant received from the Chief Engineer, Department of Public Works, together with copies of Mr. Johnston's report of the 14th instant and estimate of additional funds required to complete the Fort Norman two-classroom day school.\n\nThis is a matter which the Department of Public Works should have referred to you, as these schools are being constructed by money provided by your Branch. Would you please let me know whether these additional funds will be available and when you expect the building will be ready for occupancy.\n\nEncs.\n\nR. A. Gibson,\nDirector.\n\nP.S. It does seem to me that the cost of this school so greatly exceeds the estimate that we would be warranted in asking for more information.\n\nDirector.\nCopy\n\nDEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS, CANADA\n\nSub: Fort Norman day school\nC.R. File No. 12967-2\nC.E. File No.P.P.\n\n20 October, 1948.\n\nDirector, Lands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources.\n\nEnclosed herewith is a copy of letter dated October 14th, in which our District Engineer states that the cost of the 2 classroom day school and teacher's quarters at Fort Norman, N.W.T., is going to be higher than originally provided for.\n\nAttached to the copy of his letter is copy of the present estimated cost of the school, which amounts to $71,000, approximately.\n\nThe District Engineer points out that the $40,000 as originally estimated was a tentative figure made before complete plans, specifications and bills of materials were on hand.\n\nIn his letter of April 15th last, copy of which was sent to you on April 21st, the District Engineer pointed out that the estimated costs of the schools for various points in the Northwest Territories were tentative and stated, \"It must be stressed that there has been insufficient time to make a detailed estimate here as the working plans and bills of material are just now being received. It will only be possible at a later date to give you a more accurate statement of the expenditure to be incurred this year on the school project\".\n\nWill you please let me know when additional funds required for this work may be made available to this Department.\n\n(Sgd) R. Blais,\n\nR. Blais,\nChief Engineer.\n\nEVG/S\nI am replying to your telegram of October 8th in reference to request that $20,000 be made available immediately for the 2- Classroom Day School and Teacher's Quarters at Fort Norman, N.W.T.\n\nYou ask regarding commitments made to H. Kelly and Company for plumbing; Hillas Electric Company for electrical installation; Barry Sheet Metal Company for hot-air heating; also an Order in Council approval to C. L. Cinnamon for lumber.\n\nAttached is a statement showing details of the expenditure to date, and the balance of funds which will be required this fiscal year.\n\nWhen the school programme was undertaken the project was begun in a hurry before plans and specifications were fully developed and with only partial bills of material. At Fort Norman a tentative figure of $40,000 was given for this work, and this was done without having an opportunity to prepare a detailed estimate. It was not by any means to be considered as an estimate of cost of the structure completed, and this point was stressed at that time.\n\nAccording to the attached statement the expenditure during the present fiscal year will amount to approximately $71,000. As $40,000 has been provided, there will be required an additional $31,000 in order to complete the project.\n\nThe carpenter crew is now remaining at Fort Norman for freeze-up and with the present crew, it is expected work will finish about February 1st, unless more carpenters are provided to speed up the work. The cost, however, of sending in more carpenters would hardly be warranted in view of the air forces involved, unless there were a demand for early occupancy of this building. This hardly seems the case, since school classes are now being carried on in a temporary building in the near vicinity.\n\nWork has been completed under the contracts of Barry Sheet Metal Company for hot-air heating; Hillas Electric Company for electrical installation, and H. Kelly and Company for plumbing. It is not necessary to provide an electric generator (as is the case in some locations) as the current is being provided from the generator (generating plant) of Royal Canadian Corps of Signals. The building will require very little work next season beyond painting the exterior, it not being possible to do such work in the late fall.\n\nMay I enquire if the amount of $31,000 will be provided shortly for this project.\n\n(Sgd) W.

J. Johnston a partial list of Buildings in the Northwest Territories that will not be completed this year and the estimated amount of funds required to complete them in the fiscal year 1949-50.\n\nAs Mr. Johnston points out that the 2-classroom school and teachers' quarters require an adjacent storehouse, the cost of storehouse is included in the estimate of funds required. In connection with the construction of the schools, temporary housing has to be provided for the construction crews and, in some cases, this temporary accommodation can be made into a presentable warehouse.\n\nHere below are the estimates for the school buildings at the points mentioned in your letter, with the exception of Hay River. The estimated requirements for that point are being compiled in the District Engineer's office and will be forwarded as soon as received.

J. Johnston regarding the cost of two-classroom day school and teachers' quarters at Fort Norman, N.W.T. In this he pointed out that it was necessary to raise the original estimated cost of $40,000. to $71,000. and stressed that the original estimate was only tentative.\n\nIt is understood that this letter has been forwarded to your Branch for action and I enclose copy of a letter of November 3rd from the District Engineer saying that if he does not soon receive notification as to whether funds are to be made available for completion of this work, he must shut down the work.\n\nWill you please say whether you can supply the extra $31,000. and, if so, please make it available immediately so that it may not be necessary to close down the work, which would add to its final cost.\n\nR. Blais,\nChief Engineer.\n\nAAA/R\nEncl.\nOn October 14th I sent you a statement in regard to funds required for E-Classroom Day School and Teacher's Quarters at Fort Norman, N.W.T. It was stated that $31,000 would be required additional, in 1948-49 in order to complete this project. This school is one of the projects for which no detailed estimate was submitted by this Department, and in fact it would have been impossible to do so until well in the season on account of the scarce information at first available.\n\nBy Radiogram of October 30th you enquired regarding the amounts of money which will be spent this year on plumbing, heating and electrical contracts, it being indicated that the balance of money under these contracts might be released to pay expenditures this current year. This, however, will not help the school project at Fort Norman to any appreciable extent. I have had no reply to my letter of October 14th and thus do not know whether or not steps are being taken to release additional funds so this project can be completed this year. It is now in the freeze-up period and the carpenter crew at work at that place cannot be removed for about three weeks or a month when ski-equipped airplanes are able to operate and land on the Mackenzie River. However, I would like to be advised shortly, if there is going to be any delay in granting the additional funds asked for, for completion of the project in 1948-49. If these funds are not to be voted I shall arrange to withdraw the carpenter crew and close down the job so as to reduce the expenditure this year as far as possible. I may point out however, that the school project is advancing very satisfactorily, with electrical and heating contracts having been completed. The painting cannot be done until the arrival of materials next season. However, as advised in my letter No. 3140 of October 18th, it is expected the carpenter work will be completed during January. If necessary occupancy could be given of the building, and classes begin any time after that date.\n\nMay I receive your instructions shortly, so I may know what action to take, as I must arrange for airplane reservations for the crew southbound. If, however, I am forced to suspend operations before its completion in January, it is going to cost more eventually to re-open this job and complete it in 1949-50 than if the work proceeded without interruption.\n\nIf this work is to be suspended shortly, I shall submit a corrected statement for Estimates 1949-50.\n\nW.J.

Arrangements have been made with Indian Superintendent Hunter to patrol the buildings during the winter to see that they are not damaged, and work will be resumed as early as possible in the spring.\n\nA wire has been received from A/District Engineer Henderson that the estimate of money required for Fort Norman for next fiscal year should be increased to $16,000 on account of closing out this work.\n\n'sgd' R.

MacKay, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nAs you know, a fire occurred in the Fort Norman two-classroom day school this fall, which necessitated the closing down of the construction work until a full report was received as to the cause of the fire.\n\nWhen Mr. W. J. Johnston, District Engineer, Department of Public Works, was in Ottawa in November, he discussed with architects of our Engineering and Construction Division the details of the plan used for installing this furnace. It was decided that a revised plan should be prepared to provide greater protection from fire hazards, and accordingly, our Engineering and Construction Division has prepared plan No. 860, Sheet S1, copy of which I enclose for your information.\n\nThis revised plan provides for the placing of a 4-inch layer of hollow tile between the brick base of the furnace and the concrete slab with a layer of asbestos board under the concrete. It is to be used for all furnace installations in these two-classroom day schools in the Mackenzie District of the Northwest Territories, and copies have been sent to the Chief Engineer, Department of Public Works.\n\nEncl.\n\nR.

Writer, together with members of the D.P.W. under Construction Foreman O.N. Neilson, Mr. H.C. Hunter, Indian Agent and Mr. W.G. MacKinnon, local Postmaster, R.M., entered the furnace room, when it was noted that smoke appeared to be the thickest in and around the base of the oil furnace.\n\n3. After emptying several extinguishers of pyrene into the smoke, it was found that the oil furnace itself was not on fire but the wooden joists supporting the cement floor and also the furnace were burning.\n\n4. In the absence of a basement under the furnace room, it was quite evident that the only way to get at the burning joists was to remove the oil furnace, knock a hole through the cement and thus extinguish the blaze, which, by this time, was getting worse.\n\n5. The latter course was followed and the fire in the joists was extinguished after fighting same for approx. 2\u00bd hours, pouring everything from pyrene, water and snow into the burning sections.\n\n6. After the fire was out an examination was made to try and determine its origin, and after same was carried out it was agreed by all present that (1) there was insufficient gravel between the actual floor of the furnace to the bottom of same; and (2) that the cement floor was not thick enough (3\"), with the result that the terrific heat generated by the oil furnace had gone through the gravel base and cement floor, and had finally ignited the wooden joists over a period of time.\n\n7. The foregoing points were taken up with Mr. Neilson, D.P.W. foreman on 19th inst. and who advised that the furnace, cement floor, etc., had been built according to specifications on the blue-print, in view of which, origin of the fire itself was the blame of nobody in the settlement.\n\nCONCLUDED HEREAT\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 904-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nFort Norman, N.W.T.\nJanuary 10, 1948.\n\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRE: Fort Norman Indian Day School.\n\nReference your file 904-5(E) correspondence dated October 15th, and December 14th, 1948 also your wireless message dated December 24th, 1948.\n\nAlthough you have stated the Treasury would accept and make payment for this stove on receipt of word that same had been received, for record purposes I am passing the account by voucher although by this time it has no doubt been paid.

This we forwarded to you on October 19th along with additional copies of the original invoice.\n\nIn your letter to us of December 28th, you enclosed a cheque for $175.75, and again requested that you have a receipt from the express Company.

Having been so unsuccessful with the Indian Commissioner at Regina I now, honorable sir, appeal to you direct.\n\nWe have schools at Hay River, Fort Simpson, Fort Norman, Fort McPherson, and Herschel Island.\n\nThe one at Hay River has about twelve boarders besides scholars, and is spoken of very highly by travellers who have passed there lately, including Inspector Routledge of the Mounted Police; and it would soon be much larger and more efficient but for the lack of proper accommodation.\n\nThe others are day schools, and, I think, are equally deserving of praise for the results accomplished under such circumstances.\n\nI therefore earnestly appeal to your Honor for a Grant-in-Aid for each of the above on the usual conditions, making allowances for the difficulty, under our peculiar circumstances, of always maintaining the number usually required; and a Grant to put up a suitable building at Hay River, and provide necessary school outfit, such as books, slates, maps, etc.\n\nThe inrush of gold-seekers is going to affect the condition of the natives very considerably, and I think your Department ought to render prompt aid in the above matters as one of the best ways of benefiting them.\n\nCommending the above to your favorable consideration,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nW.

MacKenzie\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6472, file 905-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs:\nOTTAWA, 25th April, 1898.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nReferring to the communication from His Lordship, the Bishop of McKenzie, I beg to say that all the schools mentioned therein are outside Treaty Limits. The following extracts from the Estimates for 1897-8 and 1898-9 will show to what extent the schools outside Treaty limits are receiving aid from the Department:\n\n| Day schools          | 1897-8 | 1898-9 |\n|----------------------|--------|--------|\n| Rampart House        | C.E.   | 200    | 200    |\n| Buxton Mission       | \"      | 200    | 200    |\n| Selkirk              | Yukon  | 200    | 200    |\n| Moose Fort           | \"      | 200    | 200    |\n| Albany               | Moosonee| 200    | 200    |\n| York                 | \"      | 200    | 200    |\n| Rupert's House       | District| 200    | 200    |\n| Ft.

No returns having been received from the four schools referred to in the second preceding paragraph, nothing has been paid. The names of these schools appear on the list page of this report - are St. Peter's, St. Matthew's and Trinity Mission.\n\nNothing has been paid on account of the five other schools mentioned by the Bishop. No money has been provided for them, only two quarters' costs have been paid, as returns for that period only have been received.

In fact extra expense had to be incurred as nearly everyone was stricken.\n\nAs therefore the low attendance was due to no fault or negligence of the school staff, but entirely to sickness, I think that it would be only fair and just that the Department pay the full Grant for that period, and I would respectfully press for such payment.\n\nThe maintenance of the school is a great tax upon us, and unless we get the full amount of the Government Grant, which comes far short of the actual expense, I fear that we shall be unable to continue it.\n\nWith very kind regards to Your Honor\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Hon. David Laird,\nIndian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg.\n\n(signed) W.D. Mackenzie River.\nSir,\n\nIn answer to your letter of the 9th. of June last in regard to the Hay River Boarding School, I beg to enclose a copy of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop of McKenzie, which explains itself. It appears to me that as the pupils, though sick, were all the time at the school as boarders, the management is entitled to pay for the full number though some were unable to attend the teacher's class.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, 22nd September, 1904\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a copy of a communication from His Lordship the Bishop of Mackenzie River relative to a payment made to the Bay River boarding school for September quarter 1902; and in reply I beg to say that the deductions referred to were made in accordance with the return for that quarter. If, as His Lordship states, the pupils for whom the full grant was not paid, were in residence the full quarter, although sick, a supplementary return covering the time deducted should be made and forwarded in the usual way when the shortage can be paid.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon.
