Walter,\nActing Principal,\nBlue Quill Boarding School,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nExd.\n\nOTTAWA, 18th September, 1902\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose herewith for your report on the applications contained therein, a copy of a letter from the Acting Principal of the Blue Quill Boarding school, in which he asks that moneys be appropriated for the erection of additional buildings and for painting, as well as for an increased number of pupils.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nSecretary\n\nThe Indian Commissioner,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOffice of the Indian Commissioner\n\nfor Manitoba and the Northwest Territories,\n\nWinnipeg, 24 Sept. 1902.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 18th instant, covering copy of a communication from the Acting Principal of the Blue Quill Boarding School in which he asks for certain appropriations.\n\nThe application for aid to erect an additional building for boys dormitory and recreation room, I am of opinion, should to some extent be granted. Mr. Inspector Chisholm in his report on the School last January stated there were 31 boys in attendance, and \"the capacity of the dormitory is properly not sufficient for more than 22 to 24 pupils\". He also remarked that \"the facilities for healthful exercise within doors are not good\".\n\nBut the amount asked for is rather too much. If the Department approve I would suggest placing in the estimates for the next financial year the following items:\n\nBuilding for boys dormitory and recreation room.............$1200.00\nPainting..................................................300.00\nFire protection..............................................100.00\n\n$1600.00\n\nAn increase of 5 boarders, making the total number for the school 50, might also be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary\n\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa.\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6345)\n\nFile 751-1, part 1  Saddle Lake - Blue Quills Residential. 1889 - 1930\nFile 751-2, part 1  Saddle Lake - Blue Quills Residential - Quarterly Returns. 1943 - 1950\nFile 751-4, part 1  Saddle Lake - Blue Quills Residential - Requisitions for Supplies. 1940 - 1952\nFile 751-5, part 1  Saddle Lake - Blue Quills Boarding School - Building, Equipment & Accounts. 1896 - 1902\nFile 751-5, part 2  Saddle Lake - Blue Quills Boarding School - Building, Equipment & Accounts. 1922 - 1930\nSacred Heart P.O., Ottawa,\nOct. 9, 1925.\n\n573285\n\nHonorable D.C.

As you know the conditions of our school, and have tried at different times to improve the school for the interests and benefit of our Indian pupils. We would be most grateful to you, if the Department could supply the school with an Electric Washer complete with the wringer attached to the washer and a quarter horse power motor. The size of the washer inside cylinder 27 x 30.\n\nAnd a Dough Mixer with \u00bd horse power motor, size about 1/2 bag of flour mixing.\nThis would be very necessary for the pupils, to exempt the hard labor of these little ones.\n\nHoping to receive an early reply,\n\nI am Honorable Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB. L. Derryberry\n\nPrince of\nOttawa, Oct. 26, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 6th instant, applying to the Department for an electric washer and a dough mixer.\n\nThe Department is somewhat in doubt as to the advisability of installing this type of equipment in the Blue Quills Boarding School, and we are writing Mr. Agent Pugh for his comment and recommendation. You will receive a further communication in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. R. L. Dauphin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Boarding School,\nSacred Heart P. O., Alta.\nOttawa, Oct. 26, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have to inform you that the Rev. Principal of the Blue Quills Boarding School has applied to the Department for an electric washer, complete with wringer and one-half horse power motor; and a dough mixer with one-half horse power motor. I am informing the Principal that we are writing to you for your comment and recommendation, as the Department is somewhat in doubt as to the advisability of supplying this type of equipment to a small and not modern Indian boarding school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nJ. E. Pugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nAs an incentive to the operation and conduct of the school, such installation would be an asset, and I feel sure would be thoroughly appreciated by the Principal, and staff, whom as I have stated previously are constantly at work.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to submit herewith my report in reply to Departmental letter No.18-1-5, of Oct 26th 22, re the advisability of installing certain machinery at the Blue Quills Indian Boarding School.\n\nI beg to state that I have gone carefully into the matter, and have delayed sending my report in order to get the opinion of The Delco Light Co's expert, who has been out testing and adjusting the plant at that school.\n\nIn regard to the actual necessity of requiring a power washer and wringer, I would state that the work at present is done by hand machines, and requires two days to do the work of the institution, in which there are about 72 pupils and staff. I find that the elder girls have been assisting in this work, but there are only four or five, and three of them are about to be discharged, the work will then devolve on the Sisters mostly, as the girls remaining are much younger and will not be capable of doing much, though able to help in folding etc., and help in the light work.\n\nIn regard to the dough mixer, I find that some 23 lbs. of flour is used at one baking, and this entails considerable work in mixing by hand, and this work is done at present by the kitchen Sister.\n\nFrom information obtained, re the machines asked for, I find that a washer would cost about $450.00 F.O.B. Warehouse, this has a capacity of about 25 sheets, or about 3 times that in clothing etc., and would accomplish the work in about 6 hours, this as will be seen would reduce the work on the staff to a very great extent, where I know are constantly at work. This machine would be run by a \u00bd H.P. Motor, and the power will be taken from the plant already installed. There is also a water supply on hand, so that apart from the cost of installing the machine, there should be no further expense.\n\nIn regard to the Mixer, this will cost about $120.00 F.O.B. Warehouse, and will also require a \u00bd H.P. Motor, this machine would reduce the work to about \u00bd an hour.\n\nThe Delco Light expert assured me that the plant is quite capable of running these machines, provided however that they are run separately, and also when the lights are not in use. In regard to the Motors, if this installation is allowed, I would suggest that the one motor could be used, and so save the cost of an extra motor of $100.00, this I know can be arranged.\n\nIn so far as actually recommended, it is admitted that the school is up to date, though it has all that is needed in machinery, still the cost of such machines would suggest that some firm in Edmonton be consulted, to insure that what is situated as this school is, would make such an outlay.\nOttawa, November 28, 1932.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 14th inst., with reference to the washing machine asked for, for the Blue Quills Indian Boarding School, I beg to advise you that the Department is prepared to give favourable consideration to this request, but is not disposed to allow the machine to be operated by an electric motor obtaining its current from storage batteries, as this has proven in the past a very unsatisfactory method, and resulted in shortening considerably the life of the storage battery. It will therefore require a small gasoline engine to operate the proposed washing machine, and I would ask you to please advise me if the school has a one or two horse power gasoline engine that could be used in operating this machine.\n\nThis information is required before prices can be invited for the proposed machine.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J. D. McLean)\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. E. Hugh, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nBLUE QUILLS INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\n\n1o-ELECTRIC WASHER:- The Principal asks for this washer complete with wringer attached to it and a Century horse power motor. The size of the washer inside cylinder is shown as 27 x 30. The School has a Delco Light Plant which gives complete satisfaction and according to an expert who has made a special examination of the plant a horse power motor of 32 volts direct current could be used for the machine above referred to.\n\n2o-DOUGH MIXER:- A dough mixer holding about 1\u00bd bag at one time complete with a horse power motor would be needed in Blue Quills School. I wish to note that the two machines (washer and dough mixer) would not be used at the same time.\n\nI draw your attention to the above requests and would earnestly ask that they be included in the estimates.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state in reply to Departmental Letter No 118-1-5, dated Nov. 28th, that I find that there is only one Gas engine at the Blue Quilla School.\n\nThis engine is 7 H.P., used for pumping from the deep water well, and is situated some 60 yards from the school building and is a fixture in the pump house, and therefore could not be utilized for the proposed washer.\n\nThere is no other engine at the school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nSacred Heart, P.O.

The Christmas Season coming on, brings with it many distressing problems, and many little hearts are filled with a great desire to receive, at least one gift, from Santa Claus. Here in our school, we have 58 stockings to fill, and our resources being very small, I find it a rather difficult task. Therefore I come to ask if I may count on your generosity to give us a little help, in order to procure for our little Indian children a Happy Christmas.\n\nHoping to receive a favorable reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"Sister Cournoyer\"\nSupt.\nSir:\n\nI enclose copy of a letter I have received from the Sister Superior of the Sacred Heart School in the Saddle Lake Agency, and if there are any funds available which can be drawn upon to make a contribution to this school to assist in adding to the enjoyment of the children at Christmas time, I shall be glad to recommend a grant to the school of $7.00 or $5.00 to purchase candies to place in the children's Christmas stockings.\n\nMay I ask for an early reply as the mail very often takes several days to reach Sacred Heart from Regina.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Fairbanks Engine, and also a cut showing how the machine carries its own countershaft. You will observe that provision is made for the addition of an Extractor without any additional expense except for one pulley; and as we are quite sure these people will find that they need an Extractor this unit would allow them to put this in at any time without making extensive changes in their Laundry. The 3 H.P. Engine would be quite capable of handling both the Washer and 20\" Extractor. If, however, an overhead countershaft is required we would put this in with the necessary belts and pulleys at the same price.\n\nTrusting to be favored with your valued order, we are\n\nYours very truly,\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO.

Ashmont, Alta.\n\nAUTHORIZED\n\n15-3898\n\nFEB 5 1923\n\nThe Purchasing Commission of Canada\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to state, that the Principal of the Blue Quill's Boarding School, has brought to my attention the matter of New Desks, Teacher's desk and a Geography Globe, for this school.\n\nDuring the Inspection of this School by Inspector Murison, it was noted that several children were sitting at forms and tables, and it was found that all the desks were small and hardly permitted of two children working in comfort. It is suggested that 18 large size single desks be purchased, subject to the approval of the Department, and which purchase I would recommend to make the accommodation comfortable at this school.\n\nIn the matter of the Teachers desk, it was noted that the present desk was supported on four pieces of tree, to make it convenient for the teacher to sit at. It was also badly warped, and hardly in keeping with the rest of the class room.\n\nIn regard to the Geography globe, I find that the Department refused to purchase a globe some time ago, but it would appear to me that this is almost a necessity in school, and the suggestion was also made by the Provincial School Inspector, and I would therefore ask the department to re-consider their decision.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDept of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMR.

P. Gasoline Engine.\n\nThe lowest tender received is that of the Denver Laundry Co. Ltd. of Toronto, at a price of $709.00 f. o. b. Ashmont, Alta.\n\nThe purchase of the machine from the above firm has been approved by the Purchasing Commission, but, before the order can be placed, it will be necessary to have the Minister's approval for the expenditure.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPUTY COMMISSIONER.\nFebruary 13, 1923.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart.\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Boarding School, at Saddle Lake, Alberta, applied some time ago for a power operated washing machine for the school. As I considered that this request should be granted, we asked for competitive prices, in accordance with the regulations of the Purchasing Commission. The lowest tender received is that of the Beaver Laundry Company, Ltd., of Toronto, for $709.00 f.o.b. Ashmont, Alberta, which is eight miles from Saddle Lake, and this has been approved by the Purchasing Commission.\n\nI would ask your approval of the expenditure.

D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nThe Beaver Laundry Mohry Co.,\nToronto, Ont.\nOttawa, February 21, 1923.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that an order has today been placed with the Beaver Laundry Machinery Company, for a 36 x 54\" wood-washer operated by a 3 H.P. - Z type engine.\n\nThey have been asked to ship this machinery addressed to the Rev.

O., Alta and Big River, Sask. have been rejected or if the matter is still open.\n\nWe have just discovered a typographical error in the price of the 36 x 54 Washer for Saddle Lake. This should have read $403.00 instead of $503.00.\n\nOwing to the recent decline in some material we would be able to discount the 20\" Extractor for Big River about $75.00 making the price $325.00 instead of $400.00.\n\nWe should be very glad to hear from you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMeyer Bros.\n\nLM\nOttawa, April 4th., 1923.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nIn reply to yours of the 29th ultimo, I have to say that your tender for Saddle Lake laundry equipment was rejected, as it was not the lowest.

The desks are usually set up in the classroom with the smaller sizes at the front and the larger in the rear, and a sufficient number of front and rear desks should be included for each row of desks in the classroom. Full shipping directions should also be given. When this information is received, we will be in a position to place the order here for the supplying of the quantity of desks required.

This device throws out automatically when the machine is at the dumped position or an upright position. The excellent service which this dumping arrangement has given on the great numbers of machines in use is the best evidence of its thoroughly satisfactory operation and construction. This attachment saves much time and much tedious work in the mixing room.\n\nThis mixer is equipped with our special bearing arrangement, which carries the weight of the barrel and contents independent of the beater shaft and which is equipped with our special packing gland that is extremely easy to adjust and therefore practically eliminates the possibility of leakage.\n\nThe belt shifter is conveniently placed on the front of the machine handy to the operator.\n\nAll gearing on this machine is properly guarded and an ample supply of oil cups are provided which save much time in the lubrication of the machine.\n\n| Figure No. | Specifications |\n|------------|----------------|\n|            | Pulley Drive   | Pulley Drive | Motor Drive | Motor Drive |\n| Capacity   | 2-barrel       | 3-barrel     | 2-barrel    | 3-barrel    |\n| Floor Space| 16' x 14'      | 18' x 16'    | 17' x 16'   | 18' x 16'   |\n| Height, dumping | 7' 7\"         | 7' 7\"        | 7' 7\"       | 7' 7\"       |\n| Height, overall | 10' 6\"        | 10' 6\"       | 10' 6\"      | 10' 6\"      |\n| Size of Pulleys | 19\" x 4\"     | 19\" x 4\"     | None        | None        |\n| Speed of Beater | 300 R.P.M.   | 300 R.P.M.   | None        | None        |\n| Speed of Motor | 18 R.P.M.    | 18 R.P.M.    | 18 R.P.M.   | 18 R.P.M.   |\n| Horsepower | 2400 lbs.     | 2650 lbs.    | 2750 lbs.   | 3100 lbs.   |\n| Shipping Weight | $1,500.00   | $1,600.00    | $2,000.00   | $2,400.00   |\n| Price Each | $1,500.00     | $1,600.00    | $2,000.00   | $2,400.00   |\n| Price each with Motor Gearing but exclusive of Motor | $1,700.00 | $1,800.00 | $2,200.00 | $2,600.00 |\n| Shipping Weight | 2,425 lbs.   | 2,675 lbs.   | 3,000 lbs.  | 3,400 lbs.  |\n\nNOTE\u2014Motors furnished are 60 cycle, 2 or 3 phase, but any other motor can be furnished at the difference in price of motors.\n\nPrices in this catalogue are subject to a discount\u2014write for Discount Sheet.\n\nFLETCHER MANUFACTURING COMPANY, LIMITED - - - TORONTO, CANADA\nONE BARREL DOUGH MIXER\n\nFig. 1900-B44\n\nThis is a miniature of our Fig. 1511 machine and as are all our machines is guaranteed fully adjusted to working capacity, construction and finish.\n\nIt is designed to mix bread or cake doughs or cake mixtures of any kind very quickly, thoroughly and efficiently.\n\nThe packing boxes and bearings are the same as used on our Fig. 1511 machine and will not leak if kept adjusted and lubricated.\n\nThe entire weight of the tub and contents is carried on a bearing, independent of the beater shaft, leaving the beater shaft bearings free to do the mixing only.\n\nThe beater shafts are equipped with bronze sleeves which are non-corrosive and last indefinitely.\n\nThis, like our Fig. 1511 machine is so ruggedly constructed that in all the years we have been building it we have yet to find a broken beater arm.\n\nThe gears are machine cut and guarded to remove the possibility of accidents.\n\nThe dumping is done with a hand wheel at the rear engaging a worm and rack attached to the end of the tub. This works easily, quickly and free from danger as the tub cannot change position unless the operator turns the hand wheel.\n\nIf it is desired that the mixer dump into a trough of standard height it is necessary to block it up or place it on a platform and this platform should be 37\" long by 28\" wide by 9\" high, constructed of 2\" plank. The platform of course is not included in the price.\n\nThis machine is used extensively in the smaller bakeries, for bread and cake doughs and as a general utility machine. It is also used in the larger cake plants for rubbing and creaming, and for mixing cake doughs and batters, and on account of the splendid bearing construction it is impossible for oil to leak into the machine and discolor the batch.\n\nThis machine is a wonder for service and durability.\n\nPrices in this catalogue are subject to a discount\u2014write for Discount Sheet.\n\nFLETCHER MANUFACTURING COMPANY, LIMITED - - - TORONTO, CANADA\nSINGLE ARM DOUGH MIXERS\nPULLEY DRIVE\n\nFig. 1511-B44\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\n\n| Figure No. | Capacity | Floor Space | Height Dumping | Height Upright | Size of Pulleys | Speed of Base | Speed of Pulleys | Horsepower Required | Shipping Weight | Price, f.o.b.

O. B. our Toronto factory and should this equipment be required F. O. B. Ashmont Station Alberta, there will be an additional charge of $33.00 for freight.\n\nWe are enclosing Bulletins No. 34 and 35 on which this equipment will be found illustrated and described.\n\nKindly note that the prices shown on the Bulletins are Net F. O. B. our factory.\n\nOur many years of experience in building single arm dough mixers has made it possible for us to offer you a machine unequalled in mixing qualities, construction and durability. The beater designs are correct for the greatest efficiency in mixing and their mixing qualities are unsurpassed.\n\nThere are many exclusive features embodied in the construction of these machines too numerous to mention, but we would particularly point out the special stuffing box with which our machines are equipped and\nwhich insures you against leakage. These stuffing boxes are so arranged that anyone who can handle a monkey-wrench can repack them in a few moments and this is only necessary at very long intervals. Our special bearing arrangement, by means of which the weight of the barrel and contents is carried on a separate bearing independent of the beater shaft, eliminates the breakage of beaters, given longest life and reduces friction and operating costs to the minimum, and we believe we are the only concern building single arm dough mixers who can make the claim that we have never known of one of our beaters (or mixing arms) breaking.\n\nThe widespread use of these machines throughout the whole of Canada and the splendid letters of recommendation which we ultimately receive from our customers are evidences of the superiority of our mixers.\n\nIt is indeed a pleasure for us to quote you prices on this equipment and should we be entrusted with your order, we can assure you of delivery within ten days of receipt of order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFLETCHER MANUFACTURING COMPANY Limited.\n\nJWN-W\n\n[Signature]\nQuotations for\nDOUGH MIXER\n\nReceivable until noon\nJUNE 7, 1923.\n\nThe Purchasing Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT\nOttawa, May 25, 1923.\nReq.

Since that time they have been in great demand by bakers, building up a reputation for efficiency and long service that extends from coast to coast.\n\nThe Mixers described in this Bulletin make up an excellent line of mixers for all classes of work in all sizes of plants. The high standards of workmanship and finish established by Pendrith Products will be rigidly adhered to, and the refinements in design and construction which we have added to the line will add to the fine reputation they already enjoy.\n\nDirect Connected Motor Driven Mixers\n\nThe direct connected idea is rapidly becoming popular and full attention to this feature is paid by all Pendrith Mixers. The advantages are: saving reduction of space required, added safety, reduction in power consumed and freedom from trouble with belts, pulleys etc.\n\nOwing to the great variation in the size of different types of mixers, it is not possible to give full particulars of the current type supplied as follows: (1) Voltage, (2) No. of cycles, (3) No. of phases, (4) diameter after mixing, (5) speed, (6) weight. The selection of proper machines will be greatly simplified if these details are given when asking for prices.\n\nExtended Shafts and Clutches\n\nWhen two or more of our direct connected mixers may be furnished with an Extended Shaft and Clutch, which allows of the running of another mixer from the shaft of another mixer without stopping the mixer. This Extended Shaft and Clutch can be used to advantage in operating a Moulder, a Cake Cutter, Flour Bag Elevator etc. The extra charge is small.\n\nPower Dumping and Raising Attachments\n\nFurnished on Types \"S\" and \"K\" as an extra.\nPendrith Bakers' Equipment\n\nDouble-Blade Mixer\nTypes \"K\" and \"KD\"\n\nMade in Three Sizes: 1/2 Bbl., 3/4 Bbl. and 3 Bbl.\nBelt Drive or Direct Motor Connected.\n\nThe machine illustrated at the left is our latest type of Double-Blade Mixer. Of very heavy design, mechanically constructed, precision-balanced and constructed of the finest materials, it is capable of High-Speed Operation.\n\nIn order to provide the necessary rigidity, both belt drive and direct motor types of this type are mounted on heavy cast iron bases.\n\nBlades revolve in the same direction giving the dough a stretching as well as a mixing operation. The blades are placed in such a position that they intersect, transferring the dough from one to the other.\n\nThe Bottom of the Barrel is shaped to conform to the radius of each of the blades, consequently it is impossible for any part of the contents to remain being thoroughly mixed.\n\nAll gears are machined and thoroughly ground. Celere driving pinions are provided, reduced noise to the minimum.\n\nThe simple stuffing boxes are readily accessible for repacking.\n\nA complete Lubricating System is provided.\n\nThe weight of the Barrel and Contents is carried on a Trunnion Bearing placed at the side of the barrel, consequently the balance is maintained so that the whole is dumped without the strain and power required to lift the whole weight as is necessary in some machines.\n\nWhen using the dumping lever the angle of the blades is such that the dough is thrown out into the trough with pressure in accordance from the operator.\n\nAll shafts running bronze bearings insulated throughout. Shafts are extra large and more than sufficient margin of strength is provided. Barrel ends and blades are machined to scrape closely.\n\nWhere an exceptionally smooth dough is desired in order that the finished loaf may be of the highest quality, this machine is strongly recommended.\n\nThe perfect development of the Gluten in the Flour and the Maximum yield from the materials used is assured by the thorough mixing and stretching process employed.\n\nThe two smaller sizes are recommended for the rapid and efficient mixing of cake doughs and batters in large quantities and nothing finer for this work is produced.\n## Pendrith Bakers' Equipment\n\n### Double-Blade Mixer\n\n#### Types \"K\" and \"KD\"\n\n| Type | Capacity | H.P. | Floor Space | Tilted Height | Shipping Weight | Driving Pulleys | Speed of Driving Pulleys | Standard Drive |\n|------|----------|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------|\n| K    | 1 Bbl. or 50 lb. | 1    | 20x30x48\" high | 54\"           | 550 lbs.       | 8x2 T. & L.     | 350 R.P.M.              | Belt Right Hand |\n| K    | 150 lb.  | 3    | 30x40x52\"    | 58\"           | 1600 lbs.      | 14x3 T. & L.    | 350 R.P.M.              |                 |\n| K    | 3 Bbl.   | 7\u00bd   | 42x90x68\"    | 76\"           | 5500 lbs.      | 24x6 Clutch     | 400 R.P.M.              |                 |\n| KD   | 1 Bbl.   | 1    | 20x30x48\"    | 54\"           | 700 lbs.       |                 |                         | Direct Motor Drive |\n| KD   | 3 Bbl.   | 3    | 30x36x52\"    | 58\"           | 1950 lbs.      |                 |                         |                 |\n| KD   | 3 Bbl.   | 7\u00bd   | 42x90x68\"    | 76\"           | 6200 lbs.      |                 |                         |                 |\n\nPower Dumping and Raising Attachment furnished as an extra on all sizes.\n\nAlso furnished as an extra Type \"KDC\" with Canopy Top, either hinged for hand filling or with openings for Flour Sifter and Water Tank Supply.\n\nSee page 1507 for details of the Canopy Top.\nPendrith Standard Single-Blade Mixer\n\nTypes \"S\" and \"SD\"\n\nThis mixer has forty years successful service behind it.

All gears are fitted with ample cast iron guards.\n\nIn the direct floor type models the motor is placed under the barrel behind the heavy iron shield. The floor space required is small owing to its exceptionally compact design.\n\nThis type is particularly suitable for the small shop and for users of portable ovens. The 1/2 barrel machine making a dough capacity of 30 lbs., for our No. 36 oven. The 1 barrel machine is about the right size for our No. 24 oven.\n\nThe blade on this mixer is most efficient, turning out a smooth dough in very short time. One important feature of this blade is its ability to handle very small batches equally as well as full capacity loads. As can be noted from the illustration the blades extend from both ends, a feature usually found only on the more expensive types. This type of blade is exceptionally easy to clean.\n\nBarrel ends and bearings are machined smooth to secure closeness.\n\nThe special oil box provided is placed at the barrel end of the bearing and effectively prevents any oil from working into the batch, as well as preventing leakage.\n\nThe Main Bearing is of the Trunnion Type, which relieves the blade of the weight of the barrel and contents.\n\nBlade Shafts are of steel and lined in phosphor bronze bushings in the main end, thus resisting corrosion from the action of the dough.\n\nMaterial and workmanship throughout are guaranteed to the Pendrith standard, and we are willing to stake our reputation on this mixer.\n\nTYPE \"MD\" MIXER\n\nType \"M\" is without cast iron base\n\n| Type | Size | Floor Space | H.P. | Shipping Weight | Driving Pulleys | Speed of Drive Pulleys | Standard Drive |\n|------|------|-------------|-----|----------------|----------------|-----------------------|---------------|\n| M    | 1/2 Bl. | 30 x 50 x 52 high | 1/2 | 800 lbs. | 16 + 4 | 150 | Belt Right Hand |\n| M    | 1 Bl.  | 36 x 50 x 52 high | 1   | 1350 lbs. | 16 + 4 | 150 | Belt Right Hand |\n| MD   | 1/2 Bl. | 30 x 50 x 52 high | 2   | 1500 lbs. | 16 + 4 | 150 | Motor Direct Connected |\n\nAlso furnished with Canopy Top, type \"MC\" and \"MDC,\" see page 1\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF THE PURCHASING AGENT\nOttawa, May 25, 1923.\nReq.

These, with the quality materials used, the careful inspection of every piece while in operation, and methods used to secure accuracy in manufacture, add to the well known wearing qualities and efficiency of this Mixer.\n\nEntire leg frame and base is one solid casting, insuring rigidity and avoiding any twisting strain on bearings.\n\nThe mixing bowl is made of a steel sheet riveted to cast-iron ends. The ends are cast with a trunnion or hub which is made to rest on a solid leg frame. These hubs support the bowl and contents and serve as a bearing for the bowl when turned down to dump. This relieves the shaft of any weight upon it, and allows it to work freely in its bearings. The cast-iron ends are planed smooth as are the ends of the mixing arm, enabling it to scrape the ends closely.\n\nThe mixing arm thoroughly mixes the batch without any other assistance, and when bowl is dumped will roll out the batch into the trough with one turn of the mixing arm.\n\nThe patent phosphor bronze stuffing-boxes are frictionless and insure no packing troubles; no leaks.\n\nThe special packing we use is similar to that used on the piston rod of a steam engine.\n\nAll gears and vital parts, including motor, are fully covered and enclosed, protecting them against dust and dirt. This also avoids possible accidents to the bakers.\n\nThe shifting lever, which is always within easy reach, is connected to a friction clutch with which the mixer is started or stopped without shutting off the power, and with this lever the mixing arm can be brought around to be cleaned quickly.\n\nRear of mixer base is open, for easy access to motor.\n\nGears are cut on automatic machines, therefor accurate and noiseless.\n\nA canopy cover usually needed in connection with a flour hopper can be furnished for most sizes of mixers, or a flat hinged top when wanted.\n\nThe powerful and reliable friction clutch we use avoids any shocks and jars in starting up a Mixer and also avoids using a tight and loose pulley on a pulley driven machine.\n\nPower dumps are applied only to the 3\u00bd and 5 bbl. sizes of Gluten Developers and the Heavy-Duty Mixers.\n\nHorsepower listed on each type of Mixer in this catalog is for the usual run of soft and medium doughs. If a very stiff dough is to be mixed daily, additional horsepower is needed.\n\nTo secure a more noiselessly running Mixer we are now using Micarta motor pinions.\n\nThese mixers have been designed by engineers who know the needs of the bakeshop, therefor are built not only for strength and durability, but also to produce a reliable machine simple in operation, requiring the least possible horsepower, one that will produce a perfect mix, and one that is easily cleaned and operated.\n\nThe Triumph service and guarantee are back of each Mixer.\n\nTHE TRIUMPH MFG.

We have had it repaired several times, but still it works very poorly, the inside cylinder being completely worn out.\n\nAs the engine was given by the Department five years ago, I address myself to you, asking the Department if they could kindly help us in procuring a new one.\n\nWe greatly appreciate what has been done for us in the past year and hope that this request will find favor with the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour humble Servant,\n\nLouis Dauphin\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith, a letter recently received from the Principal of the Blue Quill's Boarding school at Sacred Heart, this Agency, relative to the purchase of a new engine for the deep well there.\n\nIn recommending this purchase, I would like to state that although this engine purchased only five years ago, it is now completely worn in the cylinder and piston head, rod and valves and though they have from time to time spent a lot of money in repairs, its performance is very poor and the school is therefore obliged to haul water from the river, some three miles distant.\n\nIt is realized that the Department have spent a considerable sum in machinery at this school and it was with a view to getting a 6 H.P. engine for the pump, that I arranged to run the washer and dough mixer off the one 3 H.P. engine installed and so economize in that line.\n\nThe Department will realize the necessity of having a good engine installed to supply water for the school as the well is 151 feet deep and some 400 feet from the building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, July 31, 1923.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nPlease give me your best price on one Fairbanks-Morse \"Z\" type 6 horse power engine, f.o.b.

We are now informed by our Agent at Sadule Lake that he is satisfied this machine is second hand. He states that he, together with the Sister Superior of the School, examined the machine, and it was noted that the bowl lining appeared to have been renewed, one pulley had a piece broken off and it had been repainted with yellow paint, and to all appearances it was second hand. The Agent states that this mixer has not been put into use, and until further instructions are received, it will not be used.\n\nI would point out that you were asked to quote for the supplying of this equipment in competition with a number of other dealers, and there is nothing to indicate that the quotation submitted by you was for a second hand machine.

The Western Agents for the Globe Furniture Co., Ltd., Waterloo, Ont., from whom the desks were purchased, are the Western Seating Co., 179 Bannatyne Ave., East, Winnipeg.

The Rev. Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School has requested that he be allowed to use this building for school purposes. He proposes turning his own residence into a boys' building and using the old telegraph office for his own rectory. This will allow much needed accommodation at the school and an increased pupilage. Please make enquiries and let me have a recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M.

The distance is approximately five miles.\n\nThe building is lathed and plastered and is not of very sound construction and no doubt, if moved would require replastering throughout. It would be impossible to move this building until there was snow on the ground as I am quite sure that the building would not stand moving on rollers. The dimensions are 22' x 28' by 18' height with an office addition about 15' x 16'. The foundations are very poor.\n\nTaking into consideration the cost of moving and replastering, foundations etc., I am of the opinion that a new school room of frame construction could be built for the same outlay. If however, there is an urgent necessity for further accommodation, I could go over the present buildings at the school with a view to ascertaining if room cannot be made, and I have reason to believe that such can be found.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) Jno.

Pugh, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake, with reference to the condition of the telegraph office building, which has been transferred to the Department. You will note what the agent says in regard to the repairs that will be required if this building is moved onto the school premises. You will also note from the tenor of the last paragraph that he questions the urgent necessity for further accommodation. The cost of moving as suggested by the Principal of the School would appear to be altogether too great if the Department is to bear the expense of the transfer. If however, the school authorities will bear the cost, it remains of course a question as to whether they would consider the expenditure warranted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M.

This matter has already been presented twice before the Department and the Sisters consider that this machine is practically indispensable for their work, on account of the difficulties encountered in washing the clothing and linen of the School.\n\nWould it not be possible to grant the request of those Sisters who have to work so strenuously and who are at times handicapped by lack of accommodation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, School Files (EC 10), Volume 6345, File 751-5, part 2)\nRev.

The only modern machinery that they have in this department at present is a washer, which is driven by a gas engine. Mr. Inspector Hurison, in his recent report on this institution, suggests that an extractor be supplied. Although funds are limited for the next few weeks, I believe this addition should be made to the equipment. The cost of a suitable extractor is approximately $375.\n\n[Signature]\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 13, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 15th ultimo, requesting the Department to supply an extractor for the laundry at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.

This tends to absorb vibration, allows the Machine to balance easily, and to pick up speed quickly.\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP CO., LIMITED, WINNIPEG\nBeaver Heavy Duty Extractor\u2014Continued\n\nThe Wide Square Base distributes the weight over a large area, and allows this Machine to be operated at higher speeds than is possible with a small or round base.\n\nThe Basket is of Perforated Copper, heavily tinned and strongly reinforced by steel bands. The Oversize Steel Spindle operates on a hardened ball point and button running in a long bronze bearing. The bearing is supported by two large rubber springs, so arranged and designed as to make this Machine self-balancing. A large amount of working space has been provided round the bearing, making very easy and quick the adjustment or changing of the rubber springs. An oil retaining well is provided, which requires only occasional filling.\n\nAll Beaver Extractors have countershafts attached to the curb, and may be for straight or angle drive. The angle drive, as shown in the cut, costs a little more than the straight drive, but effects a saving in floor space, and allows the Extractor to be placed in line with the washers. All Extractors have our improved adjustable friction clutch pulley, which gives a gradual increase in speed without strain to any part of the Machine. Motor drive extractors are direct connected with push button control.\n\nA Galvanized wire safety cover is fitted and so arranged that the cover must be closed before the Machine can be started.\n\n| Size   | Drive    | Speed of Counter R.P.M. | Diam. of Counter | Floor Space inches | Shipping Weight |\n|--------|----------|-------------------------|-----------------|--------------------|----------------|\n| 26 inch| Straight | 550                     | 7 inch          | 36 x 60            | 1550 lbs.       |\n| 26 \"   | Angle    | 550                     | 7 inch          | 36 x 36            | 1600 lbs.       |\n| 26 \"   | Motor    | \u2014                       | \u2014               | 36 x 40            | 1700 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Straight | 500                     | 7 inch          | 40 x 64            | 1750 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Angle    | 500                     | 7 inch          | 40 x 40            | 1800 lbs.       |\n| 30 \"   | Motor    | \u2014                       | \u2014               | 40 x 44            | 1950 lbs.       |\n\nTHE BEAVER LAUNDRY MACHINERY CO., LIMITED\nTORONTO\nWESTERN AGENTS: THE BEAVER SOAP CO.

This incident occurred about two months ago, when we saved the Dominion Government an item of about $40.00, for the reason that we gave them carload rate of freight from Toronto to Winnipeg, on two 26\" Extractors, and on two Washers.\n\nIf in future you are in a hurry for prices, we will be pleased indeed to receive enquiries by telegraph, collect, and we can assure you that we are only too pleased to wire you prices on any machines in which you are interested.\n\nThanking you very much for giving this matter your consideration, and trusting that we may hear from you in the near future, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nSTANLEY BROCK LIMITED.\n\nW.H.B./R.\nccM.\nOttawa, March 12th, 1925.\n\nDear Sirs,-\n\nIn reply to yours of the 9th instant,\nI beg to say that in view of what you have stated\nwe will be pleased in future to ask you to quote\nprices.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(F.H.

We are especially in need of rooms for dormitories. Therefore I do hereby suggest the following plan: I can secure the use of one or two buildings for this purpose. One of these buildings is 24 by 22 with two stories; and the other one is 18 by 15; consequently we would be able to accommodate in this way about 30 pupils more, increase the Indian Department's grant per capita will correspond to the number of pupils we will then have, that is 90 pupils.\nhoping you will kindly grant this request by the beginning of the new fiscal year, April, 1st, 1925.\n\nTrusting I may receive a favorable reply,\n\nI am,\n\nYour humble servant,\n\nV. Gabillon\n(Principal)\nOttawa, April 8, 1925.\n\nDear Father Gabillon:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, with reference to the need for a new main building at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. I regret that I cannot give you a hopeful answer, because of the many pressing claims on the Appropriation for Indian Education. The Department is trying to replace the worn out and inadequate buildings as rapidly as possible, but no promise can be made at the present time.\n\nThere has been some correspondence relative to adding small buildings to the present equipment; but such an arrangement is considered unwise, especially when a new main building is not yet in sight.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

It is thought that any expense in connection therewith should be paid by the authorities of the residential school.\n\nI should be pleased to hear later whether the old desks at the Goodfish Lake School are satisfactory, and if you have arranged for their transfer to the Blue Quills School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\nOttawa, March 4, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has been requested to arrange a better telephone connection for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. I understand that there is an old line from the school to the agency and that the Department owns a comparatively new line from the agency south to the Provincial Telephone System. It has been suggested that a switch be placed at the agency, which would permit of a direct connection for the school with the Provincial lines. Please let me know exactly what is required and report briefly concerning the condition of the line between the school and the agency. You should also give an estimate of the cost of any improvement or equipment recommended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E.

I am pleased to have your report that everything is now in order, and you are authorized to expend Twenty-five or Thirty Dollars during the summer in the replacement of poles for the school line.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir:-\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quill's School in the Saddle Lake Agency asks if his institution may be furnished with a new knitting machine. He states that the one in present use is twenty years old and is not large enough to knit stockings for the older children.\n\nI would recommend that a knitting machine be ordered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.

Where residential schools desire this type of equipment they should arrange for the purchase of same from their per capita grant or other receipts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Kindly report.\n\nD. S. G.-I. A.\nMay 14, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT.\n\nWith reference to the request for a truck for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I have to report that this is the first time the request has been brought to the Department's attention. Two or three trucks, which were surplus to D. S. C. R. requirements in 1921 and 1922, were given to Indian residential schools. The cost to this Department was nil. We have given light trucks to two or three of our schools, where there was especial need for such equipment; but, in the main, automobiles and trucks, when required at Indian residential schools, have been purchased by the management.\n\nRussell Beiner\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that at about 11-30 o'clock last night, the stable at the Blue Quills Residential School was completely destroyed by fire. The stable was a frame structure about 80 feet by 40 feet, and at the time of the fire, contained four sets of harness, six head of horses, about 55 loads of hay and a bin full of oats, all of which were destroyed along with the barn. An adjoining building containing a grain crusher and a quantity of chop was also destroyed. The origin of the fire is unknown. The fire had apparently gained such headway when first noticed that it was impossible to save anything in the buildings. I was notified this morning and immediately proceeded to the scene of the fire. I made careful enquiries but was unable to discover the cause. Apparently all of the children and staff at the school were in bed when the fire started.\n\nI have advised building log stables for temporary use, as there is no accommodation for their stock of which about 35 head are usually kept in.\n\nThe Principal, Miss Tabillon, is in hospital at present, and in discussing the matter of the fire with the Sister Superior in charge of the School, she informed me that they had been given to understand that a motor truck was to be furnished by the Department next year. In view of the loss of their work horses she asked if it would be possible to supply them with a truck as soon as possible in order that it may be used for hauling their grain and supplies this fall. The Sister Superior informs me that they now have two small horses only with which to carry on their work, and that while she intends purchasing another team, she considers that they would not at present require any more than a heavy work team and the two small horses, providing a motor truck were furnished.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, September 25, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your SS of the 17th instant, with reference to the recent fire which destroyed the barn with some stock and part of the crop at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. Please inform the Rev. Principal that the Department has learned of the loss with much regret.\n\nI am unable to authorize the purchase of a motor truck for the use of this school, as there are no funds available for the purpose. It is proposed to re-establish this school on another site in the near future, and the Department cannot agree to any expenditure for equipment to be used at the present site.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

E. Gullion, Indian Agent at Saddle Lake.\n\nHe remarks that they have no fire drill at the school and I am writing to inform him that this is most essential and that regular drills should be held so as to familiarize the pupils at the school with the procedure necessary if an outbreak of fire should take place. His remark that the escapes and protection are very poor is too brief to comment upon, but I might observe that when the question of fire protection was taken up with all residential schools in the fall of 1927, the Principal of this school did not report any inadequacy; and I note also that in the report by Inspector W. Murison of his visit to this agency dated the 28th March, 1928, a copy of which was subsequently forwarded to the Department, he evidently looked into the question of fire protection for on the second page of his report you will find that he states, \"a side stair-way at the end of the building, to which access is obtained from a balcony, provides an easy means of escape from the building in the event of fire\". However, I am writing to the Agent to ask him for a more specific report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 407-11 of the 17th instant, enclosing the report of Mr. Agent Gullion on his visit to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School during the month of April, last.\n\nIt is noted that you have written to inform him that regular fire drill should be held, and it is hoped that the school authorities will carry out this requirement. When we have a more specific report as to what is required to place the fire escape facilities in a satisfactory condition, consideration will then be given to the matter.

Mr. Tempest said their Mr. Jennings had the matter in hand, and Mr. Jennings took me to their Mr. French who had been to the site more recently, and who had gathered data bearing on the situation.\n\nMr. French showed me several sheets of drawings showing profiles, contours, etc., of the locality, and unfinished plans of water systems and sewage disposal works. Mr. French said that before completing the plans for these auxiliary services he would like to confer with me on the site, and as I was leaving next day for St. Paul, Mr. French came too.\n\nOn arrival at the school site I found that the well which had been drilled was choked with quicksand. Its original depth of 465 feet now measures only 335 feet by actual test. Had it not been for Mr. French's assurance that he checked the original measurement, I should be inclined to doubt the correctness of the greater depth claimed. Apparently the quicksand has risen 133 feet from the bottom of the well, thus shutting off the water vein at the bottom of the casing. Although there is now 240 feet of water in the well, which comes to a point 95 feet below the surface of the ground, we have a solid column of quicksand below, of 133 feet depth, which at present effectually shuts off the water intake. Moreover, Mr. French informs me that at the end of a 48 hours' test which he supervised personally, the pump raised the water at a rate only slightly over 3 gals. per minute, and that at the end of this period the quicksand choked the cylinder, thus stopping the pumping.\n\nThis well is of very doubtful value, and entirely inadequate even if it functioned at all. The contractors are now on the ground erecting their camp, and the excavating has been let to a local teamster. I asked that no excavating be started until the water supply is assured, and this work is being deferred in consequence.\n\nWe sent for a local driller, and Mr. French arranged with him to commence drilling another well next Tuesday, the 24th instant.\nabout 6 or 8 feet to one side of the existing hole. I am told that water is usually found in the locality at a depth of about 120 feet, but that in the previous case the driller had cased off this vein in order to get softer water at the greater depth. We have a different driller this time, and one said to be much more reliable, and he is very sanguine of getting ample water from a comparatively shallow well. Even if this water from the nearer vein does prove somewhat hard, I should hesitate to incur the expense of deeper drilling in view of the recent experience, and soft water for boiler and laundry purposes could be got by means of a rain-water cistern such as we installed at Old Suns School for this very purpose.\n\nI am leaving today for Gleichen to get things wound up there, and to issue the final Certificate to the Wyndels Co. I aim at returning to St. Paul next Friday, the 27th inst., to be present to put a baling test on the new well, and to satisfy myself of a sufficient water supply before allowing the construction work to proceed. The contractors' representative, Mr. Borgford, Jr. fully concurs in the action I am taking in this regard; in fact he says they could not carry on their work with the present inadequate and precarious water supply.\n\nMr. French is also returning to Calgary, and will go ahead with his plans for water storage on the assumption that sufficient water will be secured from the new drilling. I will advise the Department promptly by wire of the results of the further efforts to secure sufficient water.\n\nThe conditions for sewage disposal are not good, but we shall try to work out a feasible scheme, and I shall make this feature the subject of a later letter.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nI am leaving tomorrow evening for St. Paul. By the time I reach there the drill should be down to water in the well now being drilled for the Blue Quill School, and I wish personally to test the capacity of the well beyond all peradventure. Until a sufficiency of water is assured I deem it unwise to proceed with building construction. I am not anticipating any hitch in this regard, and expect very soon to be able to advise the Department that an abundance of water has been secured.\nGleichen, Alta. June 29th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quill School, near St. Paul, Alta\n\nSir:\n\nAs already intimated, there has been some delay getting the well-drilling rig hauled to the school site. Owing to heavy rains the roads became almost impassable, and the driller was four days hauling his rig the 20 miles to the site. After playing out his horses he finally had recourse to a caterpillar tractor, and finally succeeded reaching the job last Thursday evening, the 26th instant. This information I received by wire and long-distance phone after reaching Calgary on my way north. I therefore returned to Gleichen, as I deemed it useless going there until at least two or three days' drilling had first been done.\n\nI shall leave here for Calgary on the evening train, and take the midnight train for Edmonton, and shall arrive at St. Paul to-morrow, the 30th instant. I shall be on the site on Tuesday, July 1st, and shall make a very careful and accurate check-up of the well which should be brought in by about that time, and shall wire the Department as soon as a sufficiency of water is assured; and shall supplement the wire with a written report.\n\nI duly received the Department's letter sanctioning the use of \"Superior\" windows in the class-rooms and dormitories of the Blue Quill school. I saw a model of these windows in the office of the Gordon Lumber Co. at St. Paul, and this style of window seems to possess some desirable features.\n\nJust as soon as the water supply is proven I shall allow the contractors to proceed with the excavating.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMEDICINE HAT BRICK & TILE CO.

LTD.\nMEDICINE HAT UNIT TILE\n\nThe Greatest Combination in Hollow Tile Construction\n\nThis combination will build any size wall and comprises:\n\n- 5x8x12 Load-Bearing Tile for Wall Construction.\n- 4x5x12 for Wall Construction.\n- 5x8x4 for Pilasters.\n- 5x8x3 for Corners and Jambs.\n\nThese Tile have many advantages\u2014easier to handle\u2014light in weight\u2014perfect alignment of the webs distributes the load evenly\u2014keep the building insulated against heat or cold\u2014reduces coal bills\u2014are economical\u2014will carry a far greater load than is required by the Building By-Laws\u2014few shapes\u2014any size wall can be constructed\u2014can be used for any purpose that brick are, and for carrying the same load per square foot of wall area. The fact that they have been used in some of the finest buildings in Western Canada after all other types were considered, speaks for itself.\n\nSOMETHING TO CROW ABOUT MEDICINE HAT UNIT TILE\n\nManufactured exclusively by ourselves\n\nBACKING TILE\n\nShowing Bond with Face Brick\n\nMedicine Hat Tile for backing face brick works perfectly, as the tile are in brick dimensions. This permits brick header bonds to be made every fourth, sixth or eighth course. Metal tie bonds can be made every other course. The double web alignment of the tile is not disrupted by the brick, and the full strength of the wall is preserved.\n\nThese tile are being used extensively for Schools, Garages, Stores, Residences, or wherever quick, permanent and fire-proof construction is required.\n\nFor the purpose of calculating quantities the following data is given:\n\nAdd the length in feet of all the walls together, and multiply by the height in feet of the building, this will give the area of superficial wall in square feet, next multiply by 2.2, the required number of Medicine Hat Unit Tile to the square foot of wall. This will give the number of tile required.\n\n1 Tile 5x8x12 equals 6 bricks,\n167 Tile 5x8x12 equals 1000 brick in the wall.\nTo lay 167 tile requires 3\u00bd yards of mortar.\nApproximate number pieces to a Car load 3,500.\n\nSMOOTH FACE TILE\n\nShowing how corners seal ends\n\nThe tile is made with a texture finish on both faces, and can be plastered or not as desired. The rough surface of the texture finish makes a better bond for stucco and plaster than the regular kind of scoring used on tile.\n\nThe tile can be had smooth one side and texture one side, or smooth on both sides.\nThe Finest Building Tile ever put into a Wall\n\nMANUFACTURED IN ALL THE STANDARD SIZES\n\nWith the installation of new Hollow Building Tile Machinery we are now in a position to offer all sizes of Hollow Building Tile of exceptionally fine quality. Burnt with Natural Gas, they come to you clean and straight, of the correct degree of hardness.\n\nBurned clay Hollow Tile is the only basic building material which provides low cost and exceptionally economical construction coupled with the many desirable structural features hitherto confined to building of high cost.\n\nHollow Tile economies start with construction. Even the foundation cost may be lower, due to the lighter weight of tile and the more even distribution of load. Yet the Hollow Tile walls have a load-bearing capacity ten times that required for residential construction.\n\n5x8x12\nApprox. No. pcs. to car load, 4,000\n\n3x12x12\nApprox. No. pcs. to car load, 4,000\n\n4x12x12\nApprox. No. pcs. to car load, 3,500\n\n6x12x12\nApprox. No. pcs. to car load, 2,800\n\nOne unit of Hollow Tile takes the place of six to thirteen brick, according to its dimension, reducing mortar requirements by a half or more.\n\nThe larger units of Hollow Tile permit unusual speed in construction, thus saving time, reducing interest and carrying charges; also permitting a definite saving in labor costs.\n\nBurned clay Hollow Tile construction is permanent in the fullest sense of the term. It is unaffected by climatic conditions or ravages of time. Safety is proved by the unexcelled record of burned clay Hollow Tile buildings in areas devastated by hurricane, earthquake and flood in addition to its acknowledged fire-resisting qualities. These insure the highest investment, loan and resale values.\n\n8x12x12\nApprox. No. pcs. to car load, 2,000\n\n4x12x12 Splits\nApprox.

They are known by all who use the best in the building trade. They come in all shades from deep red to the lighter shades. Specifications usually read: IXL Redcliff Reds or Equal.\n\nRow on row, each brick distinctive in outline and color, they become objects of Life and Beauty when laid in the wall.\n\nLargest stock on the Prairies. Samples and prices on request.\n\nThe freight charges on GOOD BRICK are no more (and perhaps less) than the freight charges on ordinary brick, BECAUSE YOU ONLY PAY FREIGHT ON WHOLE BRICK.\n\nThey take no more mortar, they are even easier and quicker to lay, BECAUSE THEY ARE STRAIGHTER.\n\nThe final cost to the Contractor or Owner is about the same, whether he uses a GOOD BUILDING BRICK or \"Just Brick.\"\n\nIXL REDCLIFF REDS FOR THE FACE, AND COMBOS for the backing of any building are EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD BRICK. There is nothing better, if there were WE would be making them.\n\nH-GRADE CHIMNEY BRICK are made especially for the Lumber Yard trade; you will find them in most of the Lumber Yards in Western Canada.\n\nSaint Therese Academy\u2014Medicine Hat.\n\nConnaught School\u2014Medicine Hat.\nMEDICINE HAT BRICK & TILE CO.

A baling test has been made which shows the well capable of producing at least three hundred and five gallons per hour and they could not lower the water below thirty-five feet while bailing at this rate. In order to make a faster test the driller is securing a larger bailer. Efforts are now being made to pull some of the casing from the original well and to blast a hole through the remaining casing at the water bearing strata around the two hundred foot level.\n\nMr. Gardner-Smith, Inspector of Construction for this building, called at this office yesterday morning and was advised of the progress being made by Mr. French towards securing an adequate water supply. He was informed that in our opinion it would be safe to proceed with the constructing of the building as there is an adequate supply of water for the contractor's immediate use and with the second well to be drilled, we do not anticipate any further difficulties.\n\nWe shall advise you from time to time as developments proceed.\"\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I am returning herewith one copy approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. CUMBER OHR.\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nDominion Bridge Co., Ltd.,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCalgary, July 3, 1930.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation,\nDept. of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir,- I beg to submit the following report on my inspection in connection with the proposal to improve the water supply of the Edmonton Indian Residential School near St. Albert, Alberta.\n\nDate of inspection: June 27, 1930.\n\nSince I reported on this water supply on May 10, 1929, several improvements have been made. In the first place an underground rain water tank has been constructed of about 9,000 gals. capacity. Water is drawn from this by means of a steam ejector to supply the small service tank from which the boilers draw their supply by their own injectors; provision is also made for heating the tank by means of a jet of steam; last winter, the rain water supply being insufficient, snow was shovelled into the tank and melted by this jet. This work appears to have been very economically carried out.\n\nThe power head or pump jack which was condemned in my last report has been replaced by a new Myers self oiling power head; repairs have also been made to the drop pipe and pump rods in the well which makes them more accessible.\n\nAdditional hydrants have been provided in the building.\n\nIt has been proposed, and I understand sanctioned, to bring power in from the Calgary Power Company's line which I believe is about 1\u00bd miles away at present. I have not concerned myself with the details of this, but assume for this report that three phase, 60 cycle, 110-120 volt electricity will be available.\n\nI further understand that the purchase of a 7\u00bd h.p. motor to replace the gasoline engine driving the pump jack has been sanctioned.\n\nThe proposed improvements outlined by Mr. Woodsworth are briefly as follows.\n\n1. To drill a new well about 20 feet from the existing well in a position where he feels sure of tapping the same supply at a depth of 165 or 175 feet; the power head at this well to be worked from the same motor as the existing well by means of a line of shafting.\n2. To put in two additional 1000-gallon pressure tanks in line with the existing two and a small one at the pump house to supply the stock watering troughs.\n\nIf we accept the general principle of these improvements I should modify them slightly. The location of the new well is chosen because Mr. Woodsworth feels certain that it is possible to get water there from the same source as the existing well. This is quite true, but I think that if a new well is drilled it is worth while attempting to strike an independent source of supply. Last year there seemed to be good reasons for putting the new well near the boiler house and I think these reasons still hold. I consider that an expenditure up to $400 would be justified in trying out another site before returning to the locality of the original well.\n\nIn any case I should prefer the pumping machinery on the new well to be entirely separate unit. This need not entail increased expenditure as a 12\" stroke power head with air compressor attachment coupled to a 5 h.p. motor with automatic starter equipment can be purchased for less than the price of the power head on the existing well and will be quite sufficient to supply the school. The provision of an automatic starter will ensure the pressure tanks being reasonably full at all times instead of practically empty as they must be in the mornings at present.\n\nThe proposed small pressure tank in the pump house can be almost automatically eliminated. A check-valve will be needed above each well to prevent one pumping into the other; at present there is a check-valve at the pressure tanks in the boiler house which prevents back pressure on the well. If this be removed to just above the well the farm trough can be fed from the pressure tanks.\n\nThe cost of this installation will be as follows:\n\nAllowance for trial well (may not be needed) $400.\nCost of well 175 feet deep with 5 5/8 casing 4\" drop pipe, brass cylinder and cypress rods. $1000.\nMyers 12\" stroke self-oiling working head with 5 h.p. 3 phase motor, air compressor and automatic starter 420.\nTwo 1000-gal. pressure tanks each $500 1000.\nValves and piping 80.\nHousing pump, motor and pressure tanks 400.\nContingencies 300.\n\n$3600\n\nIf a well of good quality and quantity be obtained and this machinery be installed, the school will have a first class water supply for domestic purposes.\n\nI do not feel that the same can be said about fire protection. The two existing pressure tanks and the two new ones will have a total capacity of 4000 gallons but when deduction is made for air space, and the probability of them being partially empty, about 2000 gallons is the\nmost that can be relied on in case of fire. This might give about twenty minutes supply at two nozzles, in which time the two pumps would supply about 400 gallons additional.\n\nThere is the rain-water tank with a capacity of about 9000 gallons; it had to be filled with snow last winter, and is almost empty at present. The water in it is there to be used and is only replaced when rainfall occurs. In the circumstances I do not consider that any expenditure on pumping machinery to make it available in case of fire would be justified. If water is in this tank when the fire brigade arrives from Edmonton it will be available for them to use.\n\nAlthough the main shell of the building is of brick and hollow tile construction this quantity of water appears to be a somewhat meagre provision. If development is to be along the lines set out above further pressure tank storage can be provided at $0.80 to $1.00 per gallon of water actually available for fighting fire up to the limit that the Department is able to spend.\n\nOn the other hand a 20,000-gallon elevated tank 100 feet high (the building is about 50 feet) would cost in the neighbourhood of $8,000 and could be kept practically full so that water would be available at about 40\u00a2 per gallon.\n\nBy the method outlined in my report last year some 20,000 gallons exclusive of rainfall would be available for fire fighting purposes at a cost on an equivalent basis of between $5000 and $6000 or about 28\u00a2 per gallon. This system suffered from the disadvantage that it would be necessary to start up an engine if a fire should occur.\n\nAs regards the pressure, the pressure-tanks would give the best pressure at first, while the pump method would give more than the elevated tank, but the last mentioned method would be the least liable to break down.\n\nIt is very difficult to decide upon a recommendation without some knowledge of how much the Department is prepared to spend and unwise to make partial expenditures which do not form part of a co-ordinated whole.\n\nIf the Department is only prepared to spend some $3,000 or $4,000 then the scheme set forth seems to be the best, but if the amount they have available exceeds $6,000 and particularly if it amounts to $8,000 I should recommend that it be spent upon storage and fire fighting equipment rather than well drilling.\n\nThe existing well is an excellent well; its quality is fair although it contains some soda which makes it unpalatable after storage. In quantity it is quite adequate. It is said to have yielded 40 gallons per minute on test without lowering. When I was there last week the pump was only making 18 strokes per minute or about 10 gallons. Even on a laundry day it would apparently not run more than half time so that there is a large reserve supply.\nThe case for an additional well is based upon the possibility of a break-down. This might happen through the failure of the engine or motor drive or of the power head or of something going wrong in the well itself such as a break of the rods or the drop pipe. I am also informed that sand is coming slowly into the well and that at some date it will require cleaning out.\n\nThe repairs to the well have removed most of the dangers of a break-down there and the existing gasoline engine might serve as a stand-by to the motor already sanctioned, so that the case for an additional well does not seem so strong as it was a year ago.\n\nIf storage is provided the objection to using the stored water for drinking purposes could be overcome by bye-passing it and using directly from the existing system; while the taste might be endured for the time when repairs are being made.\n\nI am not prepared to say that a second well will not be required at some date but my own opinion is that with adequate storage it can be indefinitely delayed.\n\nMy report of last year included a considerable amount for piping separate firelines to the hydrants and for other fire fighting equipment, which may be eliminated if it is not considered desirable to spend so much money. It would also appear that by helping the contractor with labour and cartage Mr. Woodsworth can carry out concrete and building work at a cheaper rate than a direct contract can be let at.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) F. R. Burfield\nSir,\n\nYour file number: 118-1-15.\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 12th instant regarding the Blue Quills Indian school near St. Paul de Metis, Mr. Tempest reports that he has had another wire from Mr. M.H. French, who is staying at St. Paul, in connection with the drilling of the two additional wells authorized on March 28th, which wire reads as follows:\n\n\"Cannot pull casing old well stop\nOnly thirty feet of sand in old well stop\nWill leave it alone stop Discharge new well\nWith twenty-eight feet of water five hundred and fifty gallons per hour stop Will continue\nBaling tomorrow stop Leaving here Thursday\nstop Inform Gardner Smith Gleichen.\"\n\nFrom this it appears that the capacity of the well formerly reported as at least three hundred and five gallons per hour has now increased to five hundred and fifty gallons per hour.\n\nI am also enclosing copy of a report to Mr. Tempest by Mr. F.R. Burfield, dealing with his inspection in connection with proposals to improve the water supply at this school. From this you will note that Mr. Burfield is not altogether in favour of drilling a second well in the vicinity of the one which is now being tested for flow, but prefers to drill at another site first and so have an entirely independent source of supply.\n\nThe drilling of a second shallow well does not appear to be immediately necessary and in Mr. Burfield's opinion, with adequate storage it may be indefinitely delayed. It is pointed out in the report that it is difficult to arrive at any definite conclusion until we are advised what funds can be made available for improving water supply conditions at this site. It would seem that by the construction of an elevated tank of some twenty thousand gallon capacity, one hundred feet high, adequate fire protection would be ensured and no doubt the supply from the wells now drilled would be sufficient to keep such a tank supplied. If, on the other hand, sufficient\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nfunds are not available for this expenditure, estimated at approximately eight thousand dollars, the other changes suggested in the earlier part of Mr. Burfield's report would seem the more desirable.\n\nMr. Tempest is of the opinion that under existing conditions there is not adequate provision for fire fighting. If a fire occurred, especially in winter, an elevated storage tank would ensure greater security than any other method of protection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\nPer M. F.C.\nOblate Fathers\n- House - 16th Street.\n9916-110th Street.\n\nEdmonton, Alta. July 14th 1930\n\nA.F. McKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy,\nIndian Dept. Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI received the blue print copy of the plans of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, now being erected at St Paul, Alberta, and I thank you for same.\n\nIn your letter of June the 11th, you promised to send me a copy of the specifications when one would be returned to your office. I beg to inquire whether one is now available.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\nProcurator.\nSt. Paul, Alta. July 18th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nThe work of construction on the above-mentioned building is now away to a good start, there being at present about 30 men on the McDiarmid Co.'s pay-roll.\n\nThe excavation is now completed, and the top soil has been stacked by itself so as to be available for the top covering of the ground later on.\n\nTo-day a start was made on the running of concrete, and the pier footings were placed, all heavily reinforced with steel, as called for in the specifications.\n\nAn enormous pile of rocks has been hauled by local residents, and the contractors' rock-crushing plant is in daily operation breaking up the stone to suitable sizes.\n\nAfter a good deal of prospecting suitable sand was found about two miles from the building site. The pit is being opened out more, and the top covering of soil removed, and I'm hopeful we shall get sufficient sand from this source to complete the job. It is unusually good sand, coarse, full of tiny particles of disintegrated stone, and in conjunction with the crushed rock should give us excellent concrete. In a careful check-up of the concrete mixture to-day, I found it necessary to add about 20% more sand, reducing about 20% of the rock, and keeping the cement the same, in order to get the best consistency for the footings. The deviations referred to mean, of course, deviations from the proportions mentioned for walls in the specifications, and applies only to the pier footings where we have the reinforcing. For the wall footings, and for the walls themselves, we shall watch the mixture closely, and I think we may get good results with about a 10% increase of sand, and a corresponding 10% decrease of rock, and the same quantity of cement as specified. A large steam concrete mixer is being used.\nThe contractors have erected suitable camp buildings, a good cook and capable helper are providing good meals, for which the men are being charged 45\u00a2 per meal.\n\nBuilding materials are arriving by every train, and being hauled out to the site by tractor power. The steel and stone plans have been sent to me for approval, and I am returning them as quickly as I can, with slight changes asked for in the steel in the basement steel plan, particularly in increasing the reinforcing.\n\nI shall be pleased to learn the Department's intention with regard to the electric service for this school. I understand Mr. Jennings, of the Water & Reclamation Branch of the Department of the Interior has been gathering data on the subject, but I have not heard the outcome.\n\nThe well that was drilled lately seems to be holding up well under present demands, and all the indications point to a sufficiency of water for the use of the school. So far there is a cloudiness in the water which indicates the presence of a very fine sand, but this may lessen as more water is drawn through the vein. At any rate I shall watch it in this regard.\n\nI expect to go to Gleichen for a couple of days the last week in this month to check up on some work that was still to be done when I came away. Also, I shall likely have the two or three accounts of Wyndels Co.'s creditors which had not been confirmed when I sent the rest of the accounts forward, and when these are dealt with the Wyndels affair can be closed out.\n\nOur weather is fine here, and the crops could scarcely look better hereabouts.\n\nWill you please send me a supply of Certificate blanks, and stationery.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSir:\n\nIn reference to the water supply for the Indian School at St.Paul, a report has now been received from Mr. M.H.French. He states that well No. 2 is now completed and at 104' water was obtained and is standing at 57' in the hole. A baling test made produced 305 gallons per hour and reduced the water to a 35' level. A second baling test produced 600 gallons per hour and lowered the water to a 25' level. The water is hard but good for drinking purposes. Some coarse gravel and sand were found at the 104' level and a little fine sand was raised in the water while baling. The contractors are now making preparations to install a temporary pumping plant to use this water in connection with their work.\n\nThe deep test well, it has been revealed, is not filled with quicksand as previously reported. From investigations made by Mr. French it would appear that a boulder had been dropped into the well which lodged at a point 335' from the surface. In an effort to pull the inside casing this boulder became dislodged and fell to the bottom of the well. In all probability, this well will supply all the soft water required and also serve as an emergency well.\n\nThe well driller has now left and settlement for work completed has already been made with him, details of which will be forwarded to you at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Several suggestions were made as to slight changes, viz:\n\n1. No grease traps are specified for the scullery. If we are to provide one for each scullery sink, of the water-jacket type, connected up complete, they will cost $94.00 each.\n\n2. In the specifications the self-closing faucets are mostly in staff rooms, and in the boys' and girls' wash rooms the faucets are the compression type, which are not self-closing. Should we not reverse this arrangement? We did so at Gleichen. The difference in cost would be $112.00\n\n3. Should the vents from the boys' and girls' lavatories not be extended to vent the toilets, as was done at Gleichen. This would cost $50.00.\n\n4. Mr. Reeve recommends that the basement rads be raised to come above the level of the steam mains, so as to heat freely at times when the pressure is low. Mr. Walker, of Dunham Co., holds the same view. There would be no extra charge if arranged for in advance.\n\n5. It is suggested that both chimneys be raised 10 ft. above the highest point of roof in order to get good draft. There is a knoll covered with trees near by which might affect the draft when the wind is from that quarter, and this in conjunction with the circulation around the area walls of the roof, might have an adverse effect on the draft. An extra 7 ft. would give us a 10 ft. clearance above the roof. I have no price on this, but would expect the extra height to cost about $20.00 per foot.\n\n6. Owing to the hardness of the water which we are using from the last well drilled, and which gives no lather at all with ordinary soap, it would seem advisable to provide a rain water cistern. This could be placed either beneath laundry floor, or just outside the laundry, my own preference being inside, covered with a reinforced concrete slab finishing flush with the laundry floor, with manhole opening, and overflow to laundry drain. We followed this plan at Gleichen, with every satisfaction. The\nsoft water would be available both for the laundry and heating boilers, probably about a 4000 gal. cistern would serve all purposes, and while I have no price on this proposed cistern, it would likely cost from $450 to $500 complete with intake and outlet connections. The firm's estimator will give an exact figure when he comes to the job again, but it will be about what I quote.\n\n7. Should we place concrete slabs over any of the ceilings below the roofs? At Gleichen we did so over the ceilings of the rear extension, but Mr. Orr arrived at the job at about that time and decided to omit the slabs over the top ceilings of the main building and residence. Please let me know what we should do here.\n\n8. The roof space between the ceilings and roof should, perhaps, be ventilated to insure against condensation forming on the under side of roof and dripping on to the ceilings immediately beneath. We made small openings into the ventilating flues at Old Suns to provide ventilation, but a better plan would be to do so by means of vents through the roof itself. This will be the more necessary where we omit the top slab. Will you please let me know your wishes in this regard.\n\nThere will be other matters about which I shall write the Department,\u2014for instance, the water supply and sewage disposal\u2014but I shall defer doing so until complete plans are worked out. In the meantime will you kindly instruct me on the 8 points mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMr. D.

Box 157,\nSt. Paul, Alta. Aug. 15th, 1930.\n\nCalgary Power Company, Limited.\nExaminer Building.\nCALGARY, Alta.\n\nRe- Pole Line to Blue Quills Indian School.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nIn compliance with the request in your letter of the 9th instant, I called on the various owners of the land across whose properties the suggested alternative route 1' north or south of the quarter line through Sections 7 and 12 would be built. In order that any arrangements made with the several owners might be legal and binding, and not subject to being revoked by a possible change of mind, I deemed it prudent to have a legal form prepared. As Mr. A.U. Lebel, solicitor, of St. Paul, had previously conducted business for your Company in this locality, I asked him to prepare the legal papers, which he has done.\n\nHaving obtained the names of the owners of the land to be traversed, I called on them in turn. A certain patriarch named Charron, who seems to be father-in-law to many persons in this neighborhood, including one or two owners of the affected land, has advised his \"in-laws\" against consenting to the line crossing their respective properties. This objection applies particularly to his son-in-law, Mr. Chamberland, because of the fact that Mr. Chamberland has no divisional fence, and this suggested line would cross a wheat field, and be a great handicap in the future farming of his half section. I received a message from Mr. Chamberland yesterday to the effect that he will fight it in the Court rather than submit to the proposed pole line crossing the middle of his farm.\n\nMr. Chamberland, however, is quite agreeable to signing an agreement giving your Company the right to place poles on the south boundary of his property contiguous to the main highway to St. Paul, and will consent to the poles being placed up to 10' on his land, if necessary. The other owners of the affected properties are equally willing to sign up for the pole line to come this way.\n\nIn view of this development, I 'phoned your Calgary office.\nasking if it would not be feasible to meet the wishes of the various land owners affected by bringing the line just inside of their south boundaries, and at the same time keeping off the main highway as made necessary by the decision of the Provincial gov't. Your office replied that the matter would be considered, and that I would receive your answer by early telegram. I went to town the next morning, and as no answer had come up till noon, I wired again. About the middle of the afternoon I received your wire in reply, in which you stated that in the event of the main highway being widened at some future time your Company would be under the expense of moving the pole line; and you asked me, if possible, to obtain the consent of the owners to the line crossing their land as per your sketch accompanying your letter of the 9th instant.\n\nMr. Lebel suggests inserting a clause in the agreements providing that in the event of the main highway being widened, the owners will give the right to the Company to move the poles the same respective distance on their south boundaries as applies in their present proposals. As this highway is of the standard width now, the prospect of it being widened seems so remote as to be negligible. In the interests of harmony, and as the extra distance is not serious, my own recommendation would be to fall in with the wishes of the local residents affected, and build the pole line close to their south boundaries.\n\nI may say the Town Council has officially consented to the building of the line within the town limits, as requested, and a copy of the Resolution may be obtained at any time.\n\nI am enclosing the sketch you first sent me, in which I show another possible route to follow which for the most part would follow the road allowance 1 mile north of the main highway to St. Paul. If this route were adopted, we should just require the consent of two owners, viz., Mr. Guimond, and Mr. Lessard, and I believe their consent could be obtained without difficulty. In this case the pole line would skirt the edge of the railway right-of-way until reaching the road allowance along the N.W. quarter of Section 8. In your sketch the railway line seems to be shown too far north of Main Street, and I have indicated in pencil its approximate exit from the town.\n\nFrom the foregoing, you will see that there are two possible routes, to which there are no objections from local residents, and I think you can now go ahead and give the Indian Department a tender for providing electric service to the school by either one of the routes indicated, or alternative tenders in case there should be any considerable difference in the cost as between the suggested routes. The owners whose land the line may cross will accept compensation on a basis not exceeding $5.00 per pole.\nI'm afraid, however, we shall have to abandon the idea of crossing the owners' farms as suggested in your communications on account of the opposition that has developed.\n\nWhatever legal papers you may require to be signed by the land owners affected can either be prepared by Mr. Lebel, or if you have your own regular forms they could be sent to him, as he is now in touch with the owners, and could have said owners call and execute the papers at his office.\n\nAs I am desirous of having the electric current brought to the school site as soon as possible I shall appreciate a tender from you at your earliest convenience. I shall then take the matter up with Ottawa and get a prompt decision.\n\nYours very truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nP.O.Box 157.\nSt. Paul, Alta. August 15, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose a copy of a letter to the Calgary Power Co., Ltd. on the subject of the pole line from their electric plant in St. Paul to the Blue Quills School.\n\nAs you will note from my letter, strong opposition exists to the crossing of farms XXXXXXXXXX, and as there are two other means of reaching the school without adding seriously to the distance to be covered, I am recommending that we respect the owners' wishes and avoid cutting up their farms. Another consideration is that the affected owners may be within their legal rights in opposing the scheme to cross directly over their fields, and another route may of necessity have to be chosen.\n\nI expect very shortly to receive the Calgary Power Company's tender for bringing electric current to our new school here, and as soon as this is received, I will forward it for the consideration of the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE.

Scott Esq.\nDominion Government\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn a number of your specifications which have come out for Indian Schools in Western Canada there has been specified the G&G Telescopic ash hoist.\n\nThis hoist as you are undoubtedly aware was originally designed and patented by Gillis & Goepfgen of New York but for some years shipment of hoists ordered have been made from the factory of the Fairbanks Company at Sherbrooke, Quebec.\n\nWe have quoted on hoists for the various schools including St. Paul De Metis, Birtle etc., but are given to understand that some substitution has been made and that the G&G hoist will not be used.\n\nWe do not know any reason for this excepting that the hoist which will be substituted is probably cheaper and perhaps some claim has been made that the G&G hoist is not of Canadian manufacture.\n\nWe would respectfully point out that in quoting on your specification which did not detail exactly what was required we quoted on the G&G Telescopic hoist type \"A\", on the G&G special steel sidewalk doors, on G&G automatic spring guards and opening and closing device and also an equipment of four heavy swing ball ash cans.\n\nWe quote on this equipment because we considered it was the necessary standard equipment to make the job satisfactory.\nCalgary, Alta. Aug. 14, 1930\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir,\n\nReport on Sewage Disposal Works for the Blue Quill Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nThe Blue Quill Indian Residential School now under construction is located four miles by road west of St. Paul de Metis, Alta., upon a branch line of the Canadian National Railways 127 miles easterly from Edmonton. The school is located in a school section in a well settled community.\n\nTopographically the section is undulating with no decided slope in any direction. There are many small depressions which apparently overflow into the large shallow slough in the SW\u00bc of the section.\n\nA gravity sewage disposal plant was found impossible. A gravel sub-irrigation disposal bed was considered expensive and unnecessary. It was ultimately decided to build a standard septic tank similar with one exception to that used at the McIntosh Indian School at McIntosh, Ontario. The effluent from the main chamber would be discharged intermittently into a sewer pipe by a sump pump instead of by another syphons.\n\nThe sewage would be conducted through a 6-inch vitrified clay pipe, 800 feet to a depression to the southwest of the school. The discharge end of the sewer line will be hidden from the school by 300 feet of poplar bush. The sewage will flow westward to a large slough in the southwest quarter of the section.\n\nGeneral Description.\n\nAs can be noted from the general plan the septic tank is close to the west side of the school. The sewage from the toilets, baths, etc., is carried to the main chamber of the septic tank. The laundry water will be conducted directly to the overflow chamber.\n\nConsiderable thought was expended in devising a suitable method of disposing of the effluent from the septic tank and of the laundry waste. Because of the severity of the winter climate and lack of adequate slope in the land it was found necessary to discharge the effluent intermittently in large quantities so that it would not freeze close to the outlet from the sewer and eventually block it, but flow a considerable distance away before freezing. It is expected that the midwinter sewage will freeze and form ice before it reaches its destination in the aforementioned large slough in the southwest quarter of the section. Hence it was necessary to keep the discharge end of the sewer as high as possible above the bottom of the depression. It was found that two feet was all that the pipe could be raised without getting it above ground. Most of the pipe will be close to the surface of the ground and covered with a fill. To avoid an unsightly fill...\nclose to the school it is intended to encase 300 feet of pipe in a creosoted plank box filled with insulating material and use a shallow earth cover for that section of pipe.\n\nAs before mentioned the main chamber of the septic tank structure is the same as constructed for the McIntosh Indian School at McIntosh, Ontario. The effluent will pass over a weir into a receiving chamber holding close to 900 gals. This receiving chamber will also receive the laundry waste. (The rain water from the roof is not to be handled by this system but run out upon the ground about 200 feet back of the school).\n\nA sump pump will sit upon a reinforced slab above the effluent and discharge intermittently into the sewer pipe. The capacity of this pump will be 40 to 50 gallons per minute and will hence empty the receiving chamber in 20 minutes.\n\nThe sewer pipe projects into the receiving chamber and will receive the effluent as it is received in case the sump pump for any reason should stop.\n\nThis structure has been very carefully designed in order to utilize every inch of fall and yet function properly.\n\nThe grade of the sewer pipe is three-tenths per cent. One manhole has been provided half way along the pipeline for inspection and cleaning purposes.\n\nEntrance to the main chamber of the septic tank may be had through a 16-inch cast iron manhole or through an opening from the receiving chamber. The interior of the receiving chamber will be lighted with one electric globe. The walls should be whitewashed to brighten up the interior.\n\nEstimate of cost.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost.\n\n| Item                                      | Cost     |\n|-------------------------------------------|----------|\n| Sewer line                                | $1,900.00|\n| Septic tank                               | 1,350.00 |\n| Sump pump in place                        |          |\n| 1 - 16\" c.i. manhole cover                |          |\n| 1 - 4'x 4' iron door for top of receiving chamber | 500.00   |\n| Electric conduit, wiring etc.             |          |\n| Total                                     | $3,750.00|\n\nThe first two items were kindly estimated by Mr. Borgford of the McDiarmid Construction Co. which is now constructing the school. The amounts are intended to be considered liberal. When the plans are approved he will submit a tender in the usual manner.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Merritt H.

McDiarmid Co.) their tender of $3470.00 for carrying out the work according to Plan, but with the deepening of the Tank 2' so as to give more storage. I recognize that this estimate is about double the amount usually necessary to install a sewage disposal system, but the conditions here are such as to call for much additional outlay. I think Mr. French's report is sufficiently explicit, and I need not enlarge on what he has said, but might mention that the scheme proposed is specially designed to meet the peculiar conditions existing here, and he conferred with me in the preparation of it.\n\nThe Commissioner of Irrigation took a copy of McDiarmid's tender of $3470.00, to be forwarded to you through their Department at Ottawa, but in case by any mischance this has not reached you, I am enclosing herewith the said tender. The contractors are equally willing to perform this work on the basis of cost plus 10% if the Indian Department prefer this alternative. As the contractors have their men and equipment on the spot, they can undoubtedly do the work cheaper than can anybody else. Other tentative figures procured by Mr. Jennings in Calgary were higher than McDiarmid's.\n\nAs the season is advancing, I am anxious to get this service installed as soon as possible. In a day or two the plumber will be ready for the first water test of the basement drains, and there is no place to which this water can be run after the test; and it will not be long before we shall have frost to contend with.

This material includes 1 - 15 K.W. and 1 - 7\u00bd K.W. transformers, substation structure and service leads. We will also obtain all necessary easements for this line and have them registered. The total cost to your Department will be $4,997.00 if the McGregor Construction Company do the work for us and $5,161.00 if the Brotherston Electric do the work.\n\nYou will understand that our original tender of $5,100.00 was made up on the basis of using 1 - 25 K.W. and 1 - 10 K.W. transformers, but following the suggestion in your wire of September 9th we have revised this as above, the difference in cost between the two transformer banks being $103.00. As mentioned in our previous tender the cost of that part of the line within the Town Limits will be borne entirely by this Company.\n\nIf you decide to have us build this line we will rush the work as much as possible but we would like you\nTHE CALGARY POWER COMPANY\n\nLIMITED\n\nE.

This means that your part of the line will only be slightly over 2\u00bd miles instead of approximately 5 miles as previously mentioned.\n\nWe would also stand the cost of supplying and installing the metering equipment. We understand that this metering equipment will be installed at the point where we tap from our present St. Paul distribution system and that the line losses will be borne by your Department.\n\nWe trust that this estimate will be satisfactory to you and that we will receive your further instructions to proceed with the construction of the line.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCALGARY POWER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nHBL/WF\n\nEngineering Department.\nCALGARY POWER COMPANY, LIMITED\n\nCALGARY OFFICE\nEXAMINER BUILDING\n\nEDMONTON OFFICE\nNORTHERN INVESTMENT BUILDING\n\nCALGARY, ALBERTA\n\nSept. 2nd, 1950.\n\nE.

Sept 9th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Suggested Electric Line to Blue Quills Indian School, near St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nSir:\n\nSince coming to St. Paul I have continued the negotiations with the Calgary Power Co., Ltd. already commenced by Mr. P.J. Jennings, Commissioner of Irrigation, Calgary, on the subject of obtaining electric current from the Company's plant at St. Paul. Being right on the ground I was in a good position to expedite the proceedings, which I have been doing with the approval of Mr. Jennings.\n\nThe first proposal was to bring the line along the main highway from St. Paul for 2 miles, and then northerly for \u00bd mile along the cross road to the school. This proposal was objected to by the Highways Branch of the Provincial Gov't.\n\nThe second proposal was to come direct along the quarter section lines between St. Paul and the school, but as this alternative meant crossing wheat fields, the affected owners refused to grant easements for this route, but they agreed to grant easements if the line were located 2 ft. on their lands skirting the main highway mentioned in the first proposal.\n\nI passed on to the Calgary Power Co. the views of the local land owners concerned, and they agreed to the third alternative of locating the line 2 ft. on private property adjoining the main highway, and then building on the edge of the road allowance a half mile northerly to reach the school. They then sent me legal forms for these various owners to sign, giving the necessary easements on the seven properties involved, and offering compensation on the basis of $5.00 per pole, which is the usual scale when crossing cultivated land. I procured the required signatures to the legal papers, which I returned to the Calgary Power Co, who were then in a position to give the Department a definite tender.\n\nI enclose the Company's tender of Sept 2nd, which you will note is for $5,100.00. I made calls at their office when last in Calgary, and it was suggested that the price might be somewhat reduced if alternative figures were obtained for the work of pole line construction, which they usually sub-let.\nfigures were submitted to the Calgary Power Co. for the pole line construction, viz Brotherston Electric Co. and Mr. McGregor, of Edmonton, the latter now having a construction crew in the vicinity building a telephone line. To-day I received the enclosed telegram from the Calgary Power Co. giving an amended tender of $4997.00, for bringing electric current from St. Paul to our school here.\n\nPerhaps this is as far as I can go in the matter, and it is for the Department to decide whether or not to accept the proposal as now offered.\n\nIt will be noted that the school is being asked to bear the line losses after the current leaves the Company's distribution system at St. Paul, and in answer to my direct question as to the amount of such loss, I was told it would average about 2\u00bd\u00a2. Under the Company's proposal, the line when completed would become the property of the Department. It is probable that several residents along the route of the proposed pole line will apply to the Department for permission to join in this service, in which event they should be chargeable for a proportionate part of the cost of the line, but I am just mentioning this feature in passing.\n\nI have not touched on the matter of rates for light and power, as very probably this has already been discussed between Mr. Jennings, acting for the Indian Department, and the Company.\n\nIf the Department decides to accept the Company's tender, I would respectfully suggest that the work be proceeded with as soon as possible. The days are already shortening noticeably, and it would greatly facilitate the school construction if we had electric light here soon, for which temporary service the contractors would gladly pay.\n\nShould there be anything further that I can do in this matter I shall be glad to receive your instructions.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDepartment of Interior,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nTENDER FOR NEW SEWERAGE DISPOSAL\n\nWe hereby purpose to supply, furnish and erect all material as called for in your plans and specifications for the new Sewerage Disposal Plant to be built at the Blue Quill Indian School near St. Paul, Alberta, for the sum of Four Thousand Two Hundred Thirty-five Dollars. $4,235.00\n\nTrusting this will meet with your approval, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBENNETT & WHITE CONSTRUCTION CO.

McDiarmid Company, amounting to $3,470.00, and Bennett and White Construction Company of Calgary, amounting to $4,235.00. The Commissioner recommends that the J. McDiarmid Company be awarded the contract for this work not only on account of the lower tender but in view of the fact that this Company is constructing the school and has the necessary plant and equipment on the ground.\n\nI shall be obliged if you will advise me as soon as possible of the Department's decision in this matter so that I may notify the Commissioner by telegram.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nSeptember 5, 1930.\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit an alternative proposition in connection with the water supply plans for the Indian Residential School near St. Paul de Metis, Alberta, which apparently merits consideration.\n\nReview of first Proposition.\n\nTwo wells were drilled to 104 feet and 461 feet, respectively; the first, containing very hard water delivered 600 gallons per hour in a two hour test and might even deliver 1,000 gallons per hour. This well is being used by the contractors and appears to be clearing up. Probably by next winter the water will have cleared sufficiently to be pumped directly from the ground into the pressure tanks without first being passed through a sand settling tank and filtering tank. The capacity of this well seems ample for the school requirements.\n\nThe other well, containing very soft water, delivered 200 gallons per hour with a hand pump in a two day test. This is not at all the capacity of this well which appears to be drilled into a very powerful vein of water. In the above test a teaspoon of sand was raised to every gallon of water or about one gallon of sand in every 700 gallons of water. During the two day test 5,000 gallons of water were pumped and about 7 gallons of sand, sufficient to fill 12 to 13 feet of well casing. During the test the sand and mud in the casing was lowered 11 feet by measurement. This sand is not considered ordinary quicksand by two experienced well men but it is somewhat coarser and sharper. Since the finer sand would be raised by pumping the coarser sand would be left behind; hence, the body of sand at the bottom of the well is no doubt considerably coarser than ordinary quicksand. In fact, Mr. Morris, who assisted in the drilling, stated that some gravel and clay were raised from the bottom. Since the sand level in the casing did not rise during the two day test but instead, lowered about 11 feet, the well was considered to have good possibilities of finally clearing up and supplying a fair amount of clear, soft water.\n\nWith this data to work upon, plans were prepared to use the water from the deep well with an air lift system or a deep well pump, and the water from the shallower well with a deep well pump. The water was to be passed into a sand settling tank and then through layers of sand for the removal of the clay in solution and thence into a 5,000 gal. concrete reservoir. From there the top water would be drawn off and forced into two pressure tanks.\n\nThis in brief covers the first proposition.\n\nSecond Proposition.\nSecond Proposition.\n\nThe second proposition is to abandon the deep well entirely and use only the hard water well, and endeavor to pump the water directly from this well into two pressure tanks. The water used for boiler, laundry, bathing and washing purposes can be obtained from rain water and by the use of a softening plant. In this proposition the 5,000 gallon concrete reservoir mentioned in the first proposition would be dispensed with. There would also be a saving in a portion of the remainder of the pumphouse structure.\n\nThis second proposition is estimated to cost $6,000, while the first one will cost close to $8,000.\n\nDiscussion of Two Propositions:\n\n1. Water Supply.\n\nThe installation of either scheme will no doubt supply all of the soft and hard water required at the school. The first proposition, which has in view the development of both wells, would no doubt provide a larger amount of water and hence a larger factor of safety in the water supply.\n\n2. Simplicity of Works and Ease of Operation.\n\nThe second proposition is much simpler, may give little trouble in operation and would be of a fairly permanent nature depending largely upon the future performance of the hard water well. There may be considerable sand raised for sometime which would necessitate cleaning the pressure tanks occasionally. If the shallow well should clog up in time as has occurred to wells drilled in St. Paul for the creamery another could be drilled nearby at a cost of about $500.00.\n\nThe use of a water softener does not present any difficulty since they are in common use when soft water is desired.\n\nIn the first proposition provision is made for three pumps, or two pumps and one air lift system. Since all water was to be passed through a sand settling tank and a filtering tank and into a 5,000 gallon reservoir, it would be delivered to the pressure tanks free of sand and clay. The only trouble that might arise is in connection with the pump or air lift system to be installed in the deep well. A deep well pump might require frequent replacing of washers upon the cylinder and even a new cylinder occasionally until the well cleared up. (It is presumed that the deep well would clear up as other wells in that district have already done). An air lift system might develop leaks in the air pipe requiring attention and also, the air pump (costing about $100.00) might require replacing. If the deep well failed to clear up sufficiently to satisfy the entire needs of the school, there is little doubt but what it would supply in ten hours about 1,500 gallons of soft water. The hard water well would supply all additional water required. There\n\nis also the possibility\nis also the possibility that the deep well would clear up and make an excellent producer and be of a more permanent nature than the shallower well.\n\nSummary.\n\nIn the second proposition there is only one well, one pump, two pressure tanks and a softening tank. There is a simplicity of operation but also the possibility of the occasional cleaning of the pressure tanks of sand, and the possibility that the well might clog. There will be a saving of about $2,000, if the cost of the water softener does not exceed $1,000.\n\nIn the first proposition there will be a complete duplication of units such as two wells, two pressure tanks and two means of forcing water into the pressure tanks. This will insure no interruption in the water supply. If the deep well clears up there will be provided a greater abundance and more certain supply of good water than from the second proposition where the deep well was to be abandoned.\n\nConclusion.\n\nSince there are two wells the nature of whose future performance is still to be proven I must recommend the first proposition although the cost is about $2,000, greater. The deep well does present difficulties but the nature of the sand in the well and the fact that it lowered during a two day test indicates that it is good for at least the soft water requirements of the school. It also has the possibilities of developing into a first class well. Whether it is developed with a deep well pump or an air lift system is immaterial. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. The deep well pump is more efficient and will deliver more water with the same consumption of power. A cylinder pump may require frequent changing of washers until the sand is removed. An air lift system will require more power for the delivery of the same amount of water. Any leaks in the air delivery pipes will further reduce the efficiency. No trouble will arise, however, by the raising of sand. When the well clears up the cylinder pump can be connected directly to the pressure tanks while the air lift system cannot. The cost of a cylinder pump and of an air lift system is about the same. Air lift systems have been used in the Adanac Brewery, the Regina Brewery and the General Motors plants in Kellena with success. Before definitely deciding upon an air lift system some definite assurance is required of the makers of the air pressure pump as regards the permanence of its performance. As regards leaks developing in the air line there is no doubt but that this can be avoided by careful installation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) Merritt H.

St. Paul de Metis.\nAugust 16, 1930.\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nSir,-\n\nReport upon the proposed water supply installation for the Blue Quill Indian Residential School at St. Paul de Metis, Alta.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nThe Department of Indian Affairs is now constructing a residential school four miles by road west of St Paul de Metis, Alta., a town upon a branch of the Canadian National railways, 127 miles north and easterly from Edmonton. This report deals with the methods to be used in providing for an adequate water supply from two drilled wells.\n\nGeneral.\n\nThe school is intended to house approximately 150 people. The water is desired primarily for domestic consumption and the calculations are largely upon that basis. The water required for fire protection is of secondary consideration since the building is strictly of fireproof construction.\n\nTo provide for domestic consumption and any small fire that might occur in the contents of the building, 100 gals. per minute should be ample allowance. Since any fire in the building would be of very short duration only a limited storage has been provided. Two 1500-gallon pneumatic pressure tanks will be operated at a maximum pressure of about 80 to 90 lbs. per sq. inch. This will be augmented by 15 to 20 gal. per minute pumped from a 5000-gallon concrete reservoir nearby.\n\nThe data for domestic consumption for such an institution seems rather meagre. In one school in the West a daily per capita consumption of 40 gals. was reported. This seems rather high, not knowing the circumstances, and would indicate the need for a check-up upon the system in use. At Maple Creek the domestic consumption for 63 residences, housing 187 children and adults, is 13 gallons per day. This water is all carefully metered and paid for upon that basis. The above houses are all equipped with modern sanitary conveniences. The pressure upon the ground floor has of necessity been maintained at 17 lbs per square inch for several years.\n\nHowever, in the present plans provision has been made for a daily per capita consumption of 50 gallons for domestic purposes. (4500 gals. per day). It is suggested\nthat in the building the pipes for fire and domestic purposes be kept separate, and that a pressure reducer and regulator be installed for domestic system. The following pressures are recommended for the domestic system:\n\nSecond floor 20 lbs.\nFirst floor 25 \"\nGround floor 30 \"\nBasement floor 35 \"\n\nThese pressures will decrease the trouble from leaky taps and connections (always a source of annoyance and waste of water where the pressure is 75 to 80 lbs) and reduce the daily consumption.\n\nThe amount of water used by the stock which may be ordinarily kept upon a section farm should not be high.\n\nThe laundry and boiler water will be wholly obtained from rainfall during the greater part of the year and stored in a 5000-gallon concrete cistern under the laundry room. During the winter months soft water may be obtained from the deep well. Since this cistern is now very likely completed it will not be dealt with in this report.\n\nThe pump house structure containing a pump room, a 5000-gal. reinforced concrete reservoir and a room holding two pneumatic pressure tanks is located at the base of a small knoll 370 feet northwest from the school. The water will be obtained from two wells; one 104 feet deep giving good, but very hard, water, and one 461 feet deep giving soft water. The pumps will be electrically driven with power obtained from the Calgary Power Company's plant at St. Paul.\n\nThe nature of both wells has created a difficult problem and the need for a more expensive plant than would otherwise have been required. As, for instance, at the Indian School at Gleichen, Alta., the existence of an old proven well with a capacity of 1000 gallons per hour has simplified the works to the need of only one deep well pump and pneumatic storage. At St. Paul the water supply is from two newly drilled wells, the nature of whose future performance is still an uncertain factor. While the wells are being proven the school must be provided with an adequate supply of good water. The abundance of underground water has never been questioned but the best method of handling it has required much thought.\n\nThe existing wells in the St. Paul district contain more or less fine sand and clay when first drilled but tend to clear up with moderate continued use.\n\nPumping Machinery.\n\nIt was considered advisable to install in the deep well, which has only a 4\u00bd inch casing, an air lift system of which there are several already in operation in the West. It may be possible to obtain a considerable portion, or all, of the daily needs from this soft water well. If the sand ceases to rise it may be possible to replace the air lift system at some future date with a standard cylinder deep well pump.\nIn the shallower well a Crane deep well pump, similar (but smaller in size), to the one now in operation at Gleichen is recommended. This well tested 600 gallons per hour with 25 feet of water standing in the casing. The contractor will be pumping from this well for his requirements all summer. A pump with a capacity of 450 to 500 Imperial gallons per hour is recommended.\n\nThe water from both wells will be turned into a settling basin for the removal of the sand. It will overflow into a filter tank containing layers of fine sand, coarse sand, gravel and crushed stone to remove the clay in solution. Thence it will flow into the 5000-gallon reservoir.\n\nThe water will be pumped from the reservoir to the pressure tanks with a pressure pump (probably a Decatur turbine pump) having a capacity of about 900 to 1000 gallons per hour. Air will be forced along with the water in the same operation in order to maintain the required amount of compressed air in the pressure tanks. The suction pipe will have a loose, or swivel, joint resting upon the bottom of the reservoir and the end of the pipe buoyed up by a float so that at all times the top clean water will be drawn off.\n\nTo provide for the contingency that this pressure pump should for any reason fail to function the Crane deep well pump should also be connected to the pressure tanks so that water may be pumped to them directly from the shallower well under a pressure, say, of about 30 to 35 pounds. This will maintain a supply to the school under a lower pressure until the pressure pump functions properly. By this arrangement the water supply system is supplied with complete duplicate units such as two wells, two pressure tanks, and two means of forcing water into the pressure tanks.\n\nDescription of pump house structure including a pump room, pressure tank room and reservoir.\n\nThe pump room portion of the structure will be 12' 0\" x 16'3\" outside measurements. The floors and that part of the walls below ground will be made of concrete and the walls above ground of brick. The pump room will contain the sand settling tank, filter tank, stove, and the three sets of pumping machinery described above.\n\nThe two pressure tanks will be housed in a room attached to the south side of the pump room and be completely buried for frost protection. The floors and walls will be made of concrete but the roof of creosoted timbers in order to provide for the easy removal of the pressure tanks whenever required for replacement. An overhead reinforced concrete beam supporting the upper part of the wall between the pump room and pressure tank room converts their interiors into one large room.\n\nThe reservoir will be attached to the west side of the pump room from which easy access may be had through an opening in the west wall. The reservoir will be of reinforced concrete throughout, and be covered with two feet of earth for frost protection.\nThe elevations of the floors have all been designed so as to pass the water from one tank to another in the easiest manner and with a view to economy in roof and floor design. Consideration was also given to the lay of the ground, drainage of tanks, etc.\n\nSince a structure of this kind must be frostproof, as much of it as possible is to be below ground and covered with earth. The frame roof over the pump room is to be double boarded so as to create a 4-inch air space. Provision has also been made for a small coal stove and brick chimney in one corner of the pump room. Heat from this stove may reach to all parts of the structure.\n\nAll inside woodwork should be painted white and all concrete and brick work whitewashed in order to brighten up the interior. Suitable provision should be made for electric lighting and convenient switches. Windows will be placed in the door and in the two trap-doors in the roof which are provided for the raising and lowering of well piping, pump rods, etc.\n\nProvision for emptying the reservoir is made by a 4-inch pipe extending from the southeast corner and crossing under the pressure tank room and out to the foot of the knoll. The valve will be located in the floor of the pressure tank room which is also provided with drainage through the same pipe. The sand settling tank can also be emptied into this same pipe.\n\nThe water from the pressure tanks will be conveyed to the school through a 3-inch galvanized iron pipe laid with a 7-foot cover. In the same trench should be laid a 1\u00bd-inch galvanized iron pipe to run water directly from the soft water well (deep well) to the soft water cistern under the laundry room. This is just a provision for a winter supply of soft water and such a pipe would be less expensive than a softening plant, laid in the same trench with the 3-inch pipe.\n\nA 1\u00bd-inch galvanized iron pipe will be required to serve the barn and barnyard which will probably be located about 200 feet northwest of the school upon a level piece of ground.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) Merritt H. French.\nSir,\n\nI enclose herewith two alternative reports on the proposed water supply for the Blue Quills Indian school near St. Paul de Metis received from Mr. Tempest, the Commissioner of Irrigation. The first report, which is dated August 16, deals with the general layout and describes in detail the works of the system proposed, pumping plants, storage and housing arrangements.\n\nThe second report, which is dated September 5, deals with an alternative scheme whereby the deep well is eliminated and the system depends entirely on the recently drilled shallow well. Although there would be a considerable saving by adopting the second proposal, in view of information which has been obtained in the district and particularly in the locality of St. Paul de Metis, it would not appear to be wise to depend entirely on the permanence of the shallow well. A steadily diminishing water supply with ultimate exhaustion would create a very unsatisfactory condition at the school.\n\nAfter reviewing these considerations Mr. Tempest states that he would therefore unhesitatingly recommend that the proposal contained in the report of August 16 should be adopted, the estimated cost of which amounts to $7956.00.\n\nThe plan showing details of the works proposed under the report recommended is also enclosed, and as soon as we are advised that this has been approved, Mr. Tempest will be instructed to call for tenders and endeavour to have the concrete and housing portion of the system completed before freeze-up.\n\nI shall be glad, therefore, if you will advise me as to the decision of the department in regard to this matter as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSept. 23, 1930.\n\nMemorandum\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nIt is the intention in order to provide electric power for the new Blue Quills School to connect up with the power lines of the Calgary Power Co. Ltd. To do this it will be necessary to construct approximately 2\u00bd miles of line. Mr. Gardner Smith has been negotiating with the Calgary Power Co. and they are prepared to install this power line to the school for $4,997.20. I beg to recommend that Mr. Smith be authorized to have the Calgary Power Co. proceed with the power line. It would be advisable to have this work undertaken as soon as possible, as the days are shortening and it would greatly facilitate the construction work at the school if power was available.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nMr. M. asked me to inform you this should wait until fully completed. New funds will be OK because it will be new fiscal year.\nSeptember 24, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Thomas G. Murphy\n\nI beg to attach hereto a report from the Departmental Architect on the tenders received by the Dominion Water Power Branch for the building of a septic tank and sewerage system at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School near St. Paul de Metis, Alberta, and would recommend that the lowest tender be accepted. The McDiarmid Co. are the contractors for the main building.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Sept 18th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nI have had two calls from the Rev. Principal (Father Angin) with reference to a Barn for the above mentioned school.\n\nIn order to get some idea of his requirements, I gave him an old floor plan of a barn drawn for St. Paul's School at Cardston, but never used, and I asked him to amend it to suit the local needs in this regard. I am now sending you herewith the amendments suggested by him as written on the drawing, and amplified in his accompanying letter now enclosed. The red markings are mine.\n\nYou will note he asks for a barn of the dimensions shown on the drawing, but I think one of lesser size would prove sufficient for a one-section farm. I suggest reducing the size from that shown to 36' wide by 90' long. This reduction could be accomplished by omitting two of the double horse-stalls and four cow-stalls, as indicated in my red markings, and a slight pinching of stall-widths, and passages.\n\nRegarding the suggested Root-house crosswise under the centre of the barn, the idea seems commendable, but I would prefer the doorways and steps on the outside of the barn, and protected from the weather. This would prove safer, easier of access to Sisters or pupils, and avoid taking up inside floor space. Possibly one doorway would answer, and a chute could be put at the other side of the barn for delivering the roots. This root-house would require ventilation shafts to the outside air. Electric lights, with switch at stairway, would be installed.\n\nThe Grainary asked for might better be an entirely separate building, and not connected with the barn. The feed-room shown would hold perhaps a week's supply of grain or chop for all the animals, and supplies could be brought in periodically from the regular grainary elsewhere on the farm.\n\nThe water-troughs asked for could be of heavy plank construction, reinforced with iron rods. Concrete troughs often prove leaky, and are not so suitable when ice forms and has to be chopped out. The outside trough should be farther from the\nbarn, to avoid a fire-hazard from the tank-heater. It could be\nfed by an underground pipe with sto-and-waste.\n\nI was absent when the Rev. Father returned the Plan\nwith his notes, or I should have discussed the points with him\nthat I am mentioning in this letter, but I think from the\ninformation now being sent you, you will know pretty well what\nthe needs are. Interior fittings, and hay-unloading machinery,\nsuch as was installed at the Old Suns Barn at Gleichen, should\nprove very satisfactory here.\n\nThe water supply for the barn should be taken from the\nline which will supply the school, and I shall place a Tee in\nsaid line at a convenient place for the branch to the barn\nshould the school water-system be installed before authority is\ngiven for the barn.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nBlue Quills Res. School,\nSacred Heart, P.O.-Alta.\n\nSept 13th 1935.\n\nTo Mr. Gardner Smith,\nInspector for Blue Quills School,\nSt Paul.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have considered your plan of a barn and I approve it plainly. It is not complicated and so, very advisable. I think it is not too big for the School, as now I have 12 cows and 12 horses, to accommodate the needs of the School, and I will need more when I will have 140 pupils. So the barn can be built according to your plan and the very same dimensions kept.\n\nYou will see, on the plan, that I change the direction of the barn, the horses being placed on the south side, instead of the north. It is better to have the horses on the front of the main building.\n\nSome additions have been made:\n1) A cement trough inside, near the feed-room, and placed along it, the dimensions of this being diminished. This trough would have a cover, and would be 8 feet long, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep.\n2) A galvanized iron trough outside with a heater (tank heater) to water animals on summer time and those that will winter outside, dimensions of same being 8 feet long, 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep. It should be placed on the east side, as indicated on the plan, to drain the water.\n\nThose 2 troughs should receive water from the well.\n3) No need of silo, but instead of it and at the same place, a grainery, round or square, containing 1000 bushels of oats, for feeding the horses.\n4) A root-cellar should be provided for, from wall to wall, west-east, under the feed-room and maternity-ward, dimensions of same being 32 feet long, 12 feet wide and 7 feet deep, with traps-doors and stairs at the 2 ends as indicated on the plan, with also vent over and lights. Inside the root-cellar, 4 partitions, every 6 feet, with 4 feet passage, north side, from stairs to the other stairs.\n\nI hope these additions will meet your approval.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nRev.

T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector,\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Sept 20th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nGood progress is being maintained in the construction of the above mentioned school by The J. McDiarmid Co., Ltd., general contractors, of Winnipeg and Calgary, there being between fifty and sixty men now employed.\n\nThe brickwork is up to the window sills of the 1st Floor, of the main building, and up to the window heads of the Chapel, and by the time this Report reaches Ottawa, the brickwork should be completed up to the ceiling of the 1st Floor. Fourteen bricklayers, under an efficient foreman, are carrying this branch of the work forward rapidly, and good workmanship is being done. Oakum is being used around window frames and outside door frames as called for, and a frequent source of draughts should thus be overcome.\n\nThe stonework is being installed as the walls go up, and an experienced stone mason does the setting. The Tyndall stone sent us is generally good, although we have had to ask for a little replacement in a very few instances of defective stones. The stonework of the main entrance looks ornate and distinctive, and will impart dignity to the whole building.\n\nWe have had good success with the floor slabs of Ground and 1st Floors, there not being a single crack in evidence throughout. Within a week or ten days we expect to run the slab of the 2nd Floor, which will be the last one. It is a great advantage being able to get this important work done without having to contend with frost. After considerable deliberation, we decided to defer putting on the finish topping until the roof is on, and the bulk of the traffic over, and unusual care will be exercised to secure a bond, and this work will be done by expert cement finishers, and as called for in the specifications.\n\nNo basement floors have yet been run except in the boiler room. Six inches of additional excavating has been done, and broken stone to this depth is now being spread to cut off the ground dampness of the moist clay sub-soil. Within the next few days the concrete floors of the basement will be laid.\n\nThe drains for sewage and kitchen and laundry waste have been installed, and subjected to the usual water test which in this case revealed a cracked pipe, and several weeping joints, but which was remedied before filling in was done. The sewer\nleaves the building at 7'-3\" below grade, and has been given\nthe prescribed fall of 4\" to the foot run.\n\nWe have installed a soft water cistern, 7'x 7'x 12', at\nthe rear end of laundry, which will contain about 4000 Imp. gals.,\nand which will be supplied by rain water from the roofs of rear\nextension and Chapel. This source of soft water will be available\nfor the heating and laundry boilers, and for laundry purposes.\nThe overflow from the cistern will join the main roof water drain\nand pass to a surface outlet at the rear of the school in a\nslight depression about 150' distant, and not to the septic tank.\nAs taking care of rain water is only a summer condition, we did\nnot have to provide against frost at the outlet.\n\nThe heating boilers have been placed, and steam fitters\nare now installing the basement mains and returns. The boilers\nseem very suitable, and similar in type to the Pascol, Bircho-\nfield, and other boilers recently installed in other Indian\nschools. The high pressure laundry boiler, and the hot water\nstorage tank, have also been delivered. Dunham heating special-\nties will be used, which fact will give us the free inspection\nand cooperation of Mr. Alex. Walker, Dunham's Alberta represen-\ntative.\n\nThe electrician is placing the necessary lines of conduits\nas the work proceeds. There will be additional requirements in\nproviding for power lines to the laundry, bakery and prospective\npumping house, and I have asked him to submit a suitable layout\nwith estimate of cost for these services, and when received, I\nshall forward same to the Department for approval.\n\nMaterial deliveries have kept well ahead of the work,\nand all the Tyndel stone, pressed and common brick, tile, and\nsteel beams, columns, joists, etc., are now on the ground. The\nerection of the steel columns and beams has proceeded with\nremarkable precision.\n\nAbout a week ago I had a call from the Rev. Father Angin\nand Sisters from Sacred Heart, and the first question I was asked\nwas about the much-coveted passageway for the Sisters from the\n1st Floor to the gallery of Chapel. I broke it to them gently\nthat the Department could not sanction this expenditure. They\nbore up bravely under their disappointment, perhaps realizing\nthat there's a limit to what even a beneficent government can\ngrant.\n\nRegarding electric light and power for the school, I am\nhoping soon to receive the Department's decision with respect\nto the tender of the Calgary Power Co. for bringing electric\ncurrent from their plant at St. Paul.\nThe question of septic tank and sewage disposal is also in abeyance. I understand that full data bearing on this service was sent forward by the Commissioner of Irrigation, Calgary, and no doubt the Department will appreciate the desirability of having this essential work done before freeze-up. In my letter of Sept 10th I mentioned that I had collaborated with Mr. French in designing a suitable system to meet the peculiar conditions existing, and I consider the scheme submitted is just what is needed at this place.\n\nThe source of water supply for the school, and the best means of delivering it, is another very important matter awaiting the Department's decision. I have a copy of the Report submitted by Mr. French to the Commissioner of Irrigation, and also the blue print of the proposed building and equipment. Mr. French has gone into the subject so lucidly and exhaustively that it seems that nothing more can be added to what he has already stated, except, perhaps, a little passing comment on his report.\n\nThere seems no question but what the water in the deeper well is of better quality, being soft as proved by it lathering readily with ordinary soap in cold water. This well is 463 ft deep, the casing from top to bottom is only 4\u00bd\", and it would not be feasible to install a pumping plant of large capacity in this well,\u2014probably about 250 gals. per hour being the maximum. The water stands in the casing to within 100 ft. of the surface of the ground, but we have no data as to the level it falls to under pumping. There is also a condition of sand to contend with, which might cause much trouble from cutting cylinder leathers, or even the cylinder itself, thus making necessary the frequent arduous task of lifting the well piping. On the other hand this well might clear itself within a comparatively short time, and give no further trouble from sand.\n\nSept 26th,\n\nI stopped my Report at this point because it occurred to me that something more definite should be known as to the capacity of the deep well before asking the Department to incur perhaps unnecessary expense in a water service. I therefore asked the contractors to change their pumping outfit from the shallow well which they have drawn from since the job started. They did this, adding more drop pipe and pump rod, and lowering the cylinder 175 ft., or 75 ft. in the water. We have now been pumping from the deep well nearly all day for three days. The results are very encouraging. The large amount of sand in this well as indicated in previous reports, and which threatened to choke the well, now seems much less menacing, and the water is already coming almost clear. The main factor of doubt now seems to be the capacity of the vein supplying this well. The contractors were unable to use the same size cylinder as they had been using in the shallow well because of the smaller casing in the deep well (only 4\u00bd\") and the rate of pumping from the deep well under the test now going on is only 115 gals per hour. However, we have procured a special cylinder which I think will about double...\nthe present capacity, and next Sunday while the work of construction is shut down, the contractors will draw the well piping and attach the special cylinder. I shall then check the performance of this well closely, and after two or three days' pumping I hope to be in a position to make an intelligent recommendation regarding the water supply and pumping plant. I think it very probable that we shall be able to dispense with some of the outlay indicated in Mr. French's Report.\n\nEvery man in the Camp appreciated the change of water, as that from the deep well is so much softer.\n\nWhen in Calgary I asked the Commissioner of Irrigation for a copy of the analyses of the water from the wells here, but it could not be found. I have therefore sent samples of the water from both wells to the Provincial Laboratory at Edmonton, and hope soon to receive analyses of the samples, copies of which I will forward you.\n\nIn my night-letter of yesterday's date, asking for authority to dig the trench from the well to the school, and lay the water pipe, I also mentioned that we are testing both wells, and that I expected to make a recommendation within the next few days. As the season is advancing rapidly, I am anxious to get these auxiliary services installed before severe freezing weather sets in. Last night we had 15 degrees of frost.\n\nSince commencing the first part of this Report, the concrete floors of the basement have been laid.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nOct. 3, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 9th with reference to the installing of electric power to the new Blue Mills School, you may arrange with the Calgary Power Co., Ltd., to install the line and power to the school, if they are prepared to undertake this work and await payment for same until after the 31st of March, 1931, as there are no funds available at present.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nE. Gardner Smith, Esq.,\nInspector of Construction,\nBlue Mills School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nOct. 3, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nA full report has been received from the Commissioner of Irrigation at Calgary with reference to the proposed water supply system for the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School, near St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nThe estimated cost of the work is approximately $8,000.00. Will you please advise if it will be satisfactory to obtain prices from the firms submitted in your memorandum of Sept. 26th. These firms are now being used in inviting prices for the septic tank and sewage disposal system.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nSt. Paul, Alta. Oct. 1st, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Sewage Disposal & Water System, Blue Quills School.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the Plan of the suggested Sewage Disposal System for this school, prepared by Mr. M. French, of the Staff of the Commissioner of Irrigation, Calgary, and already dealt with by me in my letter of Sept 10th. The scheme as outlined in Mr. French's Plan and Report is exactly suited to the peculiar conditions existing here, and I have no hesitation in recommending its adoption in its entirety. I have been in daily expectation of receiving the Department's instructions to proceed with this work.\n\nWATER SUPPLY AND EQUIPMENT.\n\nNo doubt you are now in possession of the Plan for Water Service prepared by Mr. French (Plan F4811, Sheet #3) and his Reports of Aug. 16th and Sep't 5th addressed to the Commissioner of Irrigation.\n\nMr. French has devoted much time and very careful thought in designing a suitable Water Service for this school, and the scheme as shown on the Plan, and recommended in his Reports, provides for every possible contingency that might arise. He was guided, of course, by the data and information available to him at the time, and by his deductions drawn therefrom.\n\nAs intimated in my general Report of Sept 20th, and completed on Sept 26th, we have been experimenting with the deep well, and I have had it under close test and observation during the past 10 days, and during this time all the water used by the contractors in their work of construction has come from this deep well. We have drawn and lowered the well piping several times so as to test the well at different depths of pumping, and have experimented with different cylinders, and I have checked the amounts of water delivered under the different conditions. This work has of necessity been an expense to the contractors, but I took it on myself to authorize this necessary experimental work, and a charge for the labour and material involved will eventually be rendered the Department.\n\nWe are now pumping from the deep well at the rate of 250 gals of water per hour, using a 3\"x 12\" cylinder, placed\n175 ft. below the surface of the ground, and with an intake pipe 15 ft long attached to the bottom of the cylinder. Originally, the water level in the casing was within 100 ft. of the surface, but under pumping at the rate mentioned it was found that the water level had dropped only 30 ft. At present the cylinder is submerged 47 ft in the water, and with the intake added, we are drawing from a point 62' below the working level of this well.\n\nWe have raised a good deal of clay in solution, and considerable sand, but this condition is improving steadily. On an examination of the cylinder last night, after 10 days' pumping, no wear was noticeable on the leather washers, which fact removes the fear of excessive wear on the cylinder from the sand content of the water.\n\nI have not yet received the expected reports on the water samples sent to the Provincial Laboratory from both wells, but there is no question as to the superiority of the water from the deep well for all ordinary purposes. Our engineers, however, report this water harder to hold in their high pressure hoisting and concrete-mixer boilers than was the water from the shallow well, but as we are providing the school with a rain-water cistern, water for the heating and laundry boilers in the school will be available from this source.\n\nNow for my recommendation: I agree with Mr. French that both wells should be made available for the needs of the school, which means there should be a pumping plant installed over each well. I would aim at supplying the school entirely from the deep well owing to its superior water, but in the event of an insufficiency of water, the supply could be augmented from the shallow well. (Note: the \"shallow\" well is 104 ft deep, and the \"deep\" well is 463 ft deep) A pump of sturdy design, and a capacity of 300 gals. per hour should be installed for the deep well; and one with a capacity of 500 to 600 gals. per hr for the shallow well, in which there is a larger casing, and an abundance of water.\n\nWhere Mr. French shows the building, or pump house, on his Plan, I would dispense with all the underground part, and build simply a small well-house above ground, of about 8' x 12' in size, of brick and tile, concrete foundation and floor, with door, window and brick chimney. I would place two pressure tanks of 1500 gals each, in an extension from the boiler room of the school, south of the coal bin, and with access through a door from the boiler room, and with a slab roof over. At this point the tanks could be installed at less cost than elsewhere, for two of the walls are already there, and the gauges would be under the observation of the engineer more readily. The pressure tanks should be equipped with man-holes, and so placed as to be readily flushed out. A 2\" galvanized pipe line would bring the water from the pumps in a 7' trench to the pressure tanks; the pumps would be motor-driven, with automatic starters and cut-outs.\nThe water from the deep well would be the main supply, and probably the only supply, piped into the school; there would be no need of a water-softening plant; and as the water under the actual pumping now going on is clearing itself, there would be no necessity for filtering or storage tanks as shown in Mr. French's drawing. Both pumps should be connected direct to the water supply line leading to the two pressure tanks to be located in a chamber extending from the boiler room of the school.\n\nThe foregoing recommendation provides for a simple installation similar in most respects to that installed in other schools, the main difference being that I am recommending two pumping plants, one for each well, instead of the usual single unit. The cost I estimate at approximately $5000.00, including the two pumping units, motors, water line, pressure tanks and chamber, well house, and incidentals. I would respectfully suggest that the contractors be authorized to perform this work at proven cost, plus 10%, in which event I should personally select the mechanical equipment, and obtain from the manufacturers their guarantee of successful performance. Should the Department approve my recommendation, but prefer that the contractors submit a definite tender for all the work complete, I shall gladly carry out instructions to that end, or any other instructions which the Department may see fit to give.\n\nIn departing from Mr. French's recommendations and Plan, I do not wish to appear to be treating his views lightly, for I have nothing but the highest praise for the great pains and care he has exercised in designing a water system for this school, but in view of our more recent findings it would appear that a much simpler and less expensive water service will meet the requirements.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n# DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: E.

Also, when in Calgary I conferred with the office staff of the Commissioner of Irrigation regarding the plans under preparation there for the water and sewage disposal works for Blue Quills School. In addition to this, I made three calls on the Calgary Power Company on the subject of bringing light and power from St. Paul to our school here, and obtained a reduction in price.\n\nOn the 6th and 7th I returned from Calgary to St. Paul in the contractor's motor car, and as I had been saved the purchase of transportation, I paid for my companions' meals en route as my small contribution. I am mentioning this so that in scanning that portion of my Expense a/c the auditor will not deem me a gormand!\n\nI think the other items are sufficiently self-explanatory, except perhaps that of Aug. 24th, viz the purchase of a gas lamp. This is for my office, and as I do most of my correspondence at night after the work has shut down, I require a good light.

Gardner-Smith,\nBuilding Inspector,\nBlue Quill School,\nSt Paul, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe submit the following tender for the installing of the wiring necessary for the power on the Blue Quill Indian School, St Paul, Alberta.\n\nWe will supply all labor and material necessary to make this installation as laid out on the diagram submitted under separate cover.\n\nYou will notice that this includes the bringing of three phase power into the building, constructing of three phase panel, and installing the same on the wall of the shop, close to the lighting feeders, also the running of the necessary conduits to the various rooms, where power will be used.\n\nThis tender does not include the labor and material necessary to connect the motors to the lines, but does include the running of the conduits to the vicinity of where the motors are likely to be installed.\n\nIt would be almost impossible for us to estimate the balance of this work until we know the exact lay-out of the laundry machines, and other equipment.\n\nThis you will notice also includes the placing of the underground conduit to the outside of the building, for supplying power to the motor in the septic tank. It will be undoubtedly necessary to run this under-ground. It also includes the running of the conduit out for carrying the power for the motors at the well over-head, and also conduit for supplying power for outside lighting, barns, etc.\nWe will do this work as stated above and as laid out on our diagram, for the sum of eight hundred and thirty-five dollars. ($835.00)\n\nYou will notice that this price is somewhat higher than the price we quoted on similar work at Old Sun School, but you will also remember that the work we quoted you on there, was a combination lighting and power arrangement, and that there were further extras when it became necessary to change the services to separate power and lighting services.\n\nIn this case the power will be three phase connection, therefore the cost is somewhat higher than single phase, as externally operated switches of this type are about double the cost of externally operated switches of the single phase type.\n\nTrusting that you will find this satisfactory, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nBrotherston Electric Co. Limited.\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\nSt. Paul, Alta., Oct. 6th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose herewith a Blue Print showing the proposed Light\nand Power Layout submitted by the electrical sub-contractors,\n(Brotherston Electric Co., Ltd) and a copy of their letter of\nthe 26th ultimo explaining their proposition.\n\nYou will note the cost is stated at $835.00, and if to\nthis sum is added the general contractors' usual 10%, it brings\nthe total cost of this installation up to $918.50.\n\nIn this Layout provision is made for bringing the power\nto the vicinity of the laundry machines, and to the bakery and\ncold storage rooms. The quotation also includes bringing the\npower underground from the main power panel to the motor to\noperate the sewage lift pump in the 2nd chamber of the proposed\nseptic tank; also for bringing the power to a point of outlet\nfrom the building in readiness for the aerial line to the\nproposed pump house; and an outlet for connection from barn\nand outbuildings. It also includes the necessary installation\nof panels in the room marked \"Shop\" in basement.\n\nAs it is very desirable that these conduits be placed\nin the building during construction, I would respectfully ask\nthat the Department wire me a reply with instruction regarding\nthe accompanying proposal.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n118-1-15\n\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nWith further reference to memorandum from Mr. Buskard of the 26th ultimo and reply of October 3, kindly note that the following additional firms should be asked to tender on the septic tank, sewerage system and water supply system for the new Blue Quill's Indian residential school:\n\nCarmichael Plumbing & Heating Co., Edmonton,\nDobbin Plumbing & Heating Co., ...\n\nActing D.

Oct. 1st, 1930.\n\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith.\nDom. Building Inspector.\nST. PAUL, Alta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following are the results of the bacteriological and chemical analyses of the samples of water submitted by you in our containers B 68, B III and Nos. 43 and 41 for examination:\n\n**BACTERIOLOGICAL**\n\nB. 68- Blue Quills School. Sample from Deep Well.\nNumber of organisms per c.c., or each 15 drops, 100\nPresence of organisms indicating unfavorable contamination -- Negative.\n\nB. III- Blue Quills School. Sample from Shallow Well.\nNumber of organisms per c.c. . . . . . . . . . . . . 300\nPresence of organisms indicating unfavorable contamination -- Negative.\n\n**CHEMICAL.**\n\nResults expressed in parts per million.\n\n|                | Deep Well | Shallow Well |\n|----------------|-----------|--------------|\n| Total Solids   | 1544      | 1662         |\n| Ignition Loss  | 50        | 334          |\n| Hardness       | 65        | 900          |\n| Sulphates      | 85        | 550          |\n| Chlorides      | 531 Common Salt | 17 |\n| Alkalinity     | 465 Carbonate soda - lime | 640 Lime-magnesium |\n| Nitrites       | ---       | ---          |\n| Nitrates       | Trace     | Trace        |\n| Free Ammonia   | 0.04      | 0.02         |\n| Albuminoid Ammonia | 0.10    | 0.24         |\n\nDeep Well. The water represented by the sample submitted in container B 68 does not show any bacteriological evidence of unfavorable contamination. Chemically it is not particularly high in salt contents. It, however, contains 61\u00bd common salt to the gallon\u2014which is about the permissible limit. The alkalinity is equivalent to 31 grains per gallon. The hardness is low and there is a slight sediment of iron. The soda would cause foaming in boilers, and might cause erosion in cheap plumbing. For drinking purposes this water can be used.\n\nShallow Well, chemically this water is hard and shows a considerable sediment of iron. The hardness is equivalent to 63 grains of chalk to the gallon. The organic matter is high. Iron is injurious when there is a distinct taste to it, but if it is allowed to settle out the water can be used. This water would destroy a great deal of soap.\n\nYours very truly\n\n(Sgd) Allan C. Rankin Director.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Oct. 3rd, 1930\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nRe- Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of the analyses of the samples of water from both the wells which I received from the Provincial Laboratory this evening.\n\nYou will note the superiority of the water from the deep well, which is so marked as to be a deciding factor in deciding from which well to supply the school. The one objection noted, viz the tendency of this water to foam in boilers, is met by our having rain water available for the boilers.\n\nWe have just finished a 48 hour, day and night pumping test on the deep well, drawing water at the rate of 250 gals per hour continuously, with no apparent diminution of the supply. Also, this water is now coming almost clear, there being just a little cloudiness which I expect will totally disappear in the course of a few weeks' steady use of the well.\n\nThe recommendation I made in my letter of the 1st instant with regard to the water supply for this school is strengthened by the foregoing analyses and pumping test, and I hope to receive the Department's authority to carry out the proposals submitted.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nM.

Oct. 27th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Blue Quills Indian School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nSince my last Report of Sep't 20th and 26th we have had much broken weather which became progressively worse, and which culminated in a violent snow-storm and blizzard on the 14th instant. Over a foot of snow fell in this locality, and the drifts were so heavy that the main highway to St. Paul was for several days blocked to traffic. The temperature dropped to 10 degrees below zero, and we were plunged into Arctic conditions. For about a week the work of construction was completely halted, and about the only work done was the thawing out of pipe lines of the contractor's temporary water system, and the shovelling of snow from the various floors of the building. On the 20th instant the bricklayers resumed work, the ingredients all being heated, and salamanders being placed on each mortar board. We were even then getting below zero weather, but the storm had subsided, and it was again possible to proceed with the work of construction. The weather is now comparatively mild again, and most of the snow is gone except the drifts, and good progress is again being made.\n\nI have been much concerned in view of the ground becoming frozen, and with nothing yet done in the way of installing the sewage disposal works and water supply. Under these circumstances I took it on myself to authorize the digging of the water trench from the well to the school, and laying the 2\u00bd\" gal. water pipe in same. In places it was necessary to use a sledge and drill to break the frozen crust, but most of the line of digging was protected by the snow from deep freezing, and only required ordinary pick-and-shovel treatment. Apart from the laying of this essential water-line I have not authorized anything further regarding either the sewage disposal works or water system as I am still awaiting the Department's instructions with regard to both these services. Perhaps, however, I may be pardoned for reminding the Department that the longer the delay in performing this outside work, the more costly it is likely to be, as will be readily understood.\n\nThe outside brickwork is now nearing completion, the work still remaining being the completion of the coping walls of the main building, and the carrying up of the chimneys to a height of 10' above the coping of the school walls. Then will follow the building of the interior stair walls, enamel brickwork in kitchen and scullery, and the erection of the gypsum partitions.\n\nCarpenters are now framing for the roof of the main building, and I hope by the end of the month most, if not quite all, of the roofs will be boarded in. The roofing contractor\nis expected to arrive this week to commence laying the felt-and-gravel roofing. His materials are already on the ground.\n\nNo windows have yet arrived, but are supposed to be now on the way from Port Arthur where the order for millwork was placed. No time will be lost in attaching the storm windows, so as to keep out wind and snow, and permit the proceeding with plastering and other interior work.\n\nThe steamfitters have the heating boilers installed, and the mains run, and most of the risers and returns placed, but the breeching to connect the boilers to the chimney has not yet arrived, nor have any radiators yet been received, but these too are supposed to be in transit.\n\nThe plumbers are well ahead with their roughing-in, and are about ready for the second water-test, but we have no place to run the test water to, and we dare not leave the water in the pipes for fear of freezing, so this, also, is having to be deferred.\n\nThe electrician is also carrying his work forward as the progress of the building makes possible.\n\nUnder date of Oct. 1st I wrote the Department with regard to the necessary power wiring, and additional power and light outlets required, for which provision should be made during construction. With my letter I enclosed a blue print and layout submitted by the electrical sub-contractor (Brotherston Electric Co.) and an estimate of cost quoted by him. As it is desirable to have these various lines laid during construction, I asked that the Department wire me in reply, but no word of any kind has come in response. This additional work is being held up pending the Department's instructions, except that I had the electrical contractor lay a conduit from the power room in school to the outside of the building nearest to where the septic tank will be located. It was necessary to place this conduit previous to the laying of the concrete floor in basement. Current will be conducted through this line to operate the motor in the 2nd chamber of the septic tank.\n\nIn recent correspondence I have had a good deal to say about the water from the two wells which have been drilled here, and I'm sorry to advise that the subject has not yet been exhausted. You will recall that the first well was drilled to a depth of 463' in an effort to get a supply of soft water, but that under a pumping test carried out by Mr. French the performance of this well was unsatisfactory, much sand and mud being raised, and the well eventually choked and the water ceased coming. We then drilled a second well, to a depth of 104', and got an abundant supply of water which enabled the contractors to go ahead with their contract, but the water from this shallow well was found to be very hard, strongly flavored with iron, and altogether not very suitable for supplying the school. During an interval when the contractors were not using very much water, I got them to set up their pumping plant over the deep well, and after a good deal of experimenting in the way of getting the most suitable cylinder, and pumping from various levels, we\nwere rewarded by getting this deep well to come into production again. For about 10 days we pumped from this source continuously for several hours each day, and on one occasion we kept the pump going day and night for about 48 hours, allowing the surplus water to run to waste, the intention being to make a thorough test of the capacity of the vein supplying the well. During this long test we found the water steadily clearing, and at the last it was just slightly cloudy. Everybody in the Camp appreciated the change of water, and it seemed that our troubles in this regard were over. I got an excellent report on this water from the Provincial Laboratory\u2014a copy of which I sent you\u2014and in my Report on the water question I recommended that the water from the deep well be the main supply for the school. We had been pumping at the rate of 250 gals. per hour, and it seemed that this rate of delivery might be increased when the permanent pumping plant were installed. During the 10 days' test referred to, all the water used in construction, and in the Camp, came from the deep well, and the supply was abundant for all purposes.\n\nThen trouble came very suddenly. On starting the pump, after standing over Sunday, it was found that something had happened, the water came extremely muddy, and then choked up and stopped! The contractors drew the well piping and cylinder, cleaned the mud from the latter, added 40' more well piping and rods, and tried again. More very muddy water was raised, but in a short time the water again stopped coming. On again drawing the cylinder and piping it was found that the water level had dropped 100', and that the well was choked. On lowering a weight down the casing it was found that there was 80' of mud at the bottom of the well, which had cut off the intake. As the contractors had to have water for their work, they changed their plant back to the shallow well, and have since been drawing all water from that source, and the deep well has been temporarily abandoned.\n\nKnowing that at Elk Point, 20 miles east of here, a well-driller named Frederickson, had just arrived with a modern rig to drill a well for the Municipal Hospital there, and wishing to get expert advice on our water problem, I went to Elk Point to see him. I explained the whole situation to him as fully as possible with regard to the performance of our deep well, and asked his opinion as to what, if anything, could be done to save this well. Mr. Frederickson has had many years' experience in drilling, and perhaps knows the structures in this part of the country as well as anybody does. He thinks the trouble is from a \"squeeze up\" from the water vein itself, and that it may or may not be possible to save this well, but he says we have a good \"sporting chance\" of doing so. His recommendation is that we have a well-driller set up over the well, and drill and bail out the mud until the well is clean, pumping as may be found necessary also. Then when the well is clean, he suggests that screened gravel be poured down the casing to a depth of about 100'. The gravel, he thinks, will not only act as a sort of filter, but its weight will tend to hold back the mud and prevent a repetition of the \"squeeze up\" which has occurred. In answer to my question as to what he would charge to come\nwith his rig and do this work, he estimated the total cost at from $200 to $250. Owing to the smallness of the casing in this deep well (4\") he would be to some expense in getting rigged up for this particular job, and would also have to procure additional heavy rope for drilling, and extra cable for balling. Also he would be under the expense of shipping his rig to St. Paul, and hauling it to and from our job.\n\nAccording to Mr. French, this deep well has already cost somewhere about $3000.00, and it might be good business to spend another two or three hundred dollars on the chance of saving it. Also, if we have to use the hard water from the shallow well for supplying the school, it would seem necessary to install a water-softening plant.\n\nI shall be glad to receive the Department's instructions with regard to this serious situation which has arisen. I have asked the well-driller to hold himself open to come here next, after finishing his work at the Elk Point Hospital, and that I would let him know the Department's decision at the earliest possible date. He expects to be at his present job for a week or 10 days, and if he then moves away to other work we may not be able to get him or any other driller for an indefinite time.\n\nTrusting that I may soon receive the Department's decisions on the various matters still pending,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n| ITEM                                      | Summary of Tender | Previous | This Application | Total   |\n|------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|------------------|---------|\n| General Conditions                       | 2350.00           | 2000.00  | 350.00           | 2350.00 |\n| Excavation Weeping Drains, etc.          | 1500.00           | 1300.00  |                  | 1300.00 |\n| Plain Concrete (Footings, Walls & Basement Floor) | 8900.00         | 8900.00  |                  | 8900.00 |\n| Reinforced Concrete (Slabs, Beams, Cols., etc.) | 4050.00        | 4050.00  |                  | 4050.00 |\n| Cement Finish                            | 1200.00           | 600.00   |                  | 600.00  |\n| Marble Tile and Terrazzo                 |                   |          |                  |         |\n| Reinforcing                              | 22400.00          | 22400.00 |                  | 22400.00|\n| Structural Steel                         |                   |          |                  |         |\n| Brick and Tile Work                      | 43100.00          | 36100.00 | 2400.00          | 36500.00|\n| Rough Carpentry                          | 13000.00          | 4800.00  | 3700.00          | 8500.00 |\n| Finish Carpentry                         | 7000.00           | 1600.00  |                  | 1600.00 |\n| Ornamental and Misc.

In other schools where such columns were round, we did not case and plaster them, but painted them grey for five feet, and white above. In this way they look well, and offer the minimum obstruction. But in the case of the 1 columns in this school where exposed, I shall await your instructions whether just to paint them, or to case and plaster them. I think those in the play-rooms might be more easily damaged, if plastered.\n\nOnly basement sash have been thus far received, and the erection of the gypsum partitions, and the plastering, are awaiting the closing in of the windows. These are expected at any time now, being reported en route from Port Arthur. We are now getting zero weather, but without snow.\n\nThe septic tank and sewer line are being installed, and we are having to break through about a foot of frozen crust. The carpenters should finish the form work of tank to-day, and if the present cold weather continues, we shall have to heat the ingredients for this work.\n\nThe erection of the pump house is being deferred until the well-driller comes and sees if he can bring the deep well back into production. He is still at work at the Municipal Hospital at Elk Point, 25 miles east of St. Paul, and it may be another week or two before we can get him and his rig here. In this connection, will you please inform me as to whom I should go for prices on the pumping machinery. I have the O'Neill-Morkin Machinery Co., of Edmonton, on the list previously sent, but should I get other prices to?\nWith regard to payments to Mr. Batson, of Edmonton, for the septic tank and sewer; to O'Neill-Morkin Machinery Co. for the pressure tank ordered; and later for the pumping equipment and refrigeration installation, will you please inform me how these payments are to be made?\n\nExcept for the delay occasioned by having to wait for windows, the work has progressed very satisfactorily of late.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nBLUE QUILL INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nSEWERAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM.\n\nGeneral Report.\nContract.\nSpecifications.\nCOPY\n\nCalgary, Alta. Aug. 14, 1930.\n\nCommissioner of Irrigation,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nSir,\n\nReport on Sewage Disposal Works for the Blue Quill Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nIntroductory.\n\nThe Blue Quill Indian Residential School now under construction is located four miles by road west of St. Paul de Metis, Alta., upon a branch line of the Canadian National Railways 127 miles easterly from Edmonton. The school is located in a school section in a well settled country.\n\nTopographically the section is undulating with no decided slope in any direction. There are many small depressions which apparently overflow into the large shallow slough in the SW\u00bc of the section.\n\nA gravity sewage disposal plant was found impossible. A gravel sub-irrigation disposal bed was considered expensive and unnecessary. It was ultimately decided to build a standard septic tank similar with one exception to that used at the McIntosh Indian School at McIntosh, Ontario. The effluent from the main chamber would be discharged intermittently into a sewer pipe by a sump pump instead of by another syphons.\n\nThe sewage would be conducted through a 6-inch vitrified clay pipe, 800 feet to a depression to the southwest of the school. The discharge end of the sewer line will be hidden from the school by 300 feet of poplar bush. The sewage will flow westward to a large slough in the southwest quarter of the section.\n\nGeneral Description.\n\nAs can be noted from the general plan the septic tank is close to the west side of the school. The sewage from the toilets, baths, etc., is carried to the main chamber of the septic tank. The laundry water will be conducted directly to the overflow chamber.\n\nConsiderable thought was expended in devising a suitable method of disposing of the effluent from the septic tank and of the laundry waste. Because of the severity of the winter climate and lack of adequate slope in the land it was found necessary to discharge the effluent intermittently in large quantities so that it would not freeze close to the outlet from the sewer and eventually block it, but flow a considerable distance away before freezing. It is expected that the midwinter sewage will freeze and form ice before it reaches its destination in the afore-mentioned large slough in the southwest quarter of the section. Hence it was necessary to keep the discharge end of the sewer as high as possible above the bottom of the depression. It was found that two feet was all that the pipe could be raised without getting it above ground. Most of the pipe will be close to the surface of the ground and covered with a fill. To avoid an unsightly fill...\nclose to the school it is intended to encase 300 feet of pipe in creosoted plank box filled with insulating material and use a shallow earth cover for that portion of pipe.\n\nAs before mentioned the main chamber of the septic tank structure is the same as constructed for the McIntosh Indian School at McIntosh, Ontario. The effluent will pass over a weir into a receiving chamber holding close to 900 gals. This receiving chamber will also receive the laundry waste.\n\n(The rain water from the roof is not to be handled by this system but run out upon the ground about 200 feet back of the school.)\n\nA sump pump will sit upon a reinforced slab above the effluent and discharge intermittently into the sewer pipe. The capacity of this pump will be 40 to 50 gallons per minute and will hence empty the receiving chamber in 20 minutes.\n\nThe sewer pipe projects into the receiving chamber and will receive the effluent as it is received in case the sump pump for any reason should stop.\n\nThis structure has been very carefully designed in order to utilize every inch of fall and yet function properly.\n\nThe grade of the sewer pipe is three-tenths per cent. One manhole has been provided halfway along the pipeline for inspection and cleaning purposes.\n\nEntrance to the main chamber of the septic tank may be had through a 16-inch cast iron manhole or through an opening from the receiving chamber. The interior of the receiving chamber will be lighted with one electric globe. The walls should be whitewashed to brighten up the interior.\n\nEstimate of Cost.\n\nThe following is an estimate of the cost:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Sewer line                                | $1,900.00 |\n| Septic tank                               | 1,350.00 |\n| Sump pump in place                        |        |\n| 1 - 16\" c.l. manhole cover                |        |\n| 1 - 4' x 4' iron door for top of receiving chamber | 500.00 |\n| Electric conduit, wiring etc.             |        |\n\nTotal - - - - - - - $3,750.00\n\nThe first two items were kindly estimated by Mr. Borgford of the McDiarmid Construction Co., which is now constructing the school. The amounts are intended to be considered liberal. When the plans are approved he will submit a tender in the usual manner.\n\n(Sgd) Merritt H.

Gardner-Smith called here recently and presented a tender from Messrs. O'Neill-Morkin Machinery Co. of Edmonton for a pressure tank for the Blue Quill Indian Residential School water supply.\n\nMr. Gardner-smith stated that he had been instructed by Mr. Orr, the architect for the school, to obtain a bid for this tank, as it was the intention to install it in a site adjoining the boiler room in place of those shown on the plan prepared in this office, and as this tank was needed right away he asked us to give an official acceptance so that the work would not be held up.\n\nThe price compares very favourably with that for a similar tank installed at Gleichen and the O'Neill-Morkin Machinery Company were therefore instructed to supply the tank at the price quoted, viz., $1015 f.o.b. Edmonton.\n\nThe original tender for this tank is forwarded herewith.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) J. S. Tempest,\nCommissioner of Irrigation.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydro.

Gardner-Smith, Inspector of Construction at Blue Quill Indian School, that the deep well has become blocked with sand and clay, which has risen in the casing and stopped the flow, and that Mr. Orr had instructed him to have the well cleaned out.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Orr, the school architect, is not in favour of the plan submitted by us for the school water supply system and some changes may be necessary to meet his wishes. As the well is blocked it would be advisable to leave the question of water supply in abeyance until the flow in this well is either restored, or the well abandoned as a source of supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

H. M. S.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MARINE AND FISHERIES\nFISHERIES BRANCH\nOTTAWA\nConstruction Office,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alta. Dec. 11th, 1930.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nSteady progress is being maintained in the construction of Blue Quills School, and the weather during past few weeks has been moderate, and only an inch or two of snow covers the ground. We have had several below zero dips, however, and the ground is frozen to about one foot of depth.\n\nThe septic tank and sewer line are completed as far as can be done at present. This work has been done according to the plan prepared by the Water Branch of the Department of the Interior, Calgary. There still remains the installing of the motor-driven lift pump in the 2nd chamber of the tank, and this apparatus is coming from Ontario. Also, the sewer line has yet to receive its earth covering during the greater part of the line where the tiles come close to the surface, but as the ground is now frozen, this ploughing and scraping work will have to be deferred till the spring.\n\nThe 2500 gal. pneumatic water tank arrived a few days ago and is now being installed in a prepared concrete chamber adjoining the boiler room, access to which will be through a doorway to be cut through the concrete wall of said boiler room. The tank will be covered by a reinforced concrete slab which will finish on the same grade as the adjoining roof of coal bin.\n\nThe well driller, Mr. Frederickson, whom I have engaged to clean out our deep well of soft water in an endeavour to bring it back into production, is still at Elk Point, 20 miles from here, where he is putting down a second well for the Municipal Hospital. In speaking with him by phone yesterday he said he expected to reach a water-bearing strata within another day or two, and to be able to come to our job in about a week from now. Much depends on the effort to save our deep well as its water is infinitely superior to the hard, iron-tainted water we are at present using from the shallow well. I will keep the Department informed as to developments in this regard.\n\nThe principal work now going on is the plastering, this part of the contract now being about one third done, and it gives\npromise of being a first class job. The steam boilers are in operation, and sufficient radiators have been set up to give the necessary heat for the drying of the plaster and keeping frost out of the building.\n\nI am asking Mr. Alex. Walker, Dunham Heating Co's Alberta Engineer, to come and inspect the Dunham system which has been installed here, which service is free to users of Dunham specialties, and I think Mr. Walker will come soon after his return from Lytton, B.C. He advised me that he was leaving Calgary last Sunday in connection with the rearranging of the heating services at St. George's School for the Department. Then before we take over the building from the contractors I shall have the usual inspection made by the Provincial Boiler Inspector.\n\nIn my letter to the Department of Nov. 17th I asked for instructions on several matters brought up in that letter, but no reply to my queries has yet been received.\n\nThe Reverend Principal, Father Angin, has asked me several times about a barn. I suggested that he write the Department direct on the subject.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n| ITEM                                      | Summary of Tender | Previous | This Application | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|------------------|---------|\n| General Conditions                        | 2350.00           | 2350.00  | 1981.00          | 2350.00 |\n| Excavation Weeping Drains, etc.           | 1500.00           | 1300.00  | 200.00           | 1500.00 |\n| Plain Concrete (Footings, Walls & Basement Floor) | 8900.00         | 8900.00  |                  | 8900.00 |\n| Reinforced Concrete (Slabs, Beams, Cols., etc.) | 4050.00         | 4050.00  |                  | 4050.00 |\n| Cement Finish                             | 1200.00           | 600.00   | 150.00           | 750.00  |\n| Marble Tile and Terrazzo                  |                   |          |                  |         |\n| Reinforcing                                | 22400.00          | 22400.00 |                  | 22400.00|\n| Structural Steel                          |                   |          |                  |         |\n| Brick and Tile Work                       | 43100.00          | 39500.00 | 3500.00          | 42000.00|\n| Rough Carpentry                           | 13000.00          | 8500.00  | 1500.00          | 10000.00|\n| Finish Carpentry                          | 7000.00           | 1500.00  | 2500.00          | 4000.00 |\n| Ornamental and Misc.

School,\nSacred Heart, P.O., Alta.\n\nDec. 11th 1930.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Supt of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI paid a visit to the new Blue Quills School near St. Paul yesterday, and I was much surprised to learn that no step has been taken till now by the Indian Department to get the barn built over there. May be you have no money to dispose of now, and this building will be delayed till next spring, or your intention is that the new school be opened only next fall, as I cannot move over there, if there is no barn and no fence. If this work is undertaken only next spring, vid. on May or June, it will not be advisable to move to St. Paul before the summer vacations.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nDecember 24th, 1930.\n\nDear Father Angin,\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to a barn and fencing at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School. It was never the intention to move into the new building during the winter or early spring as the plaster walls would not be sufficiently dry to be healthy. My thought has been to have the outbuildings started some time late in March or early April, as soon as the frost is out of the ground and they can be rushed to completion and everything ready to move over not earlier than June.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Res. School,\nSacred Heart P.

Jan'y 14, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quills Indian School, St. Paul.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to advise that I have today issued a 9th Certificate, for $11,340.00, to The J. McDiarmid Co., Ltd., general contractors for the erection of the above-mentioned building, being for 90% of the value of labour and materials supplied by them on their contract to date.\n\nI enclose herewith a copy of the contractors' 9th Progress Estimate, which shows how the amount of the said Certificate was arrived at.\n\nThe job is now on the home stretch; the plastering should be completed in another week. Plenty of heat is being maintained, and the major part of the building is about ready for the interior trim and painting. Carpenters and painters are following up the plasterers as quickly as the rooms become dry.\n\nI intend writing a complete Report on the job within the next few days.\n\nOur weather continues exceptionally fine and mild for this season of the year, and there is only an inch or two of snow.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Jan'y 16, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nReport on Blue Quills School.\n\nSir:\n\nThe work of construction is proceeding steadily on the above-mentioned building, there still being about 20 men at work.\n\nThe plastering has been the main activity during recent weeks, and it will be quite another week before this branch of the contract can be finished. At this place we have been free of the dust blizzards which were so frequent at Gleichen, and such a tribulation to all concerned. The plastering is looking well, and so far we have scarcely any cracks. Both boilers have been kept going day and night, and the drying of the plaster has been steady and uniform, and during the milder days we have also allowed currents of outside air to pass through the building. Just single windows are so far installed, with the result that a lot of ice forms on the outside window sills from the damp inside air meeting the outside frost. The effect of this ice on two or three Tyndell stone sills has greatly surprised us, it having caused noticeable disintegration. The condition causing this will not arise in the future, it being caused by the excessive moisture from within running down on to the stone and freezing there, in consequence of the plastering in mid-winter. All the sills will be carefully examined for defects before we take over the building; the contractors have already ordered new sills to replace the ones showing trouble. The stonework of the building looks particularly well, especially the main entrance, the latter feature receiving many favourable comments from visitors.\n\nThree painters are now busy staining and painting the inside trim. The ingredients are being supplied by the contractors, and these local painters have been awarded the contract for labour only. The chief painter has worked at the trade most of his life in London, and seems painstaking and efficient. Sometimes while watching him at work I am entertained with descriptions of famous buildings in the world's metropolis painted by him, and of the peers of the realm who often employed him. His two grown-up sons are his helpers, and they, too, are experienced painters, which circumstance would seem to prove that great talent is sometimes hereditary.\n\nCarpenters are setting up trim in the parts of the building in which the plaster is thoroughly dry, and fitting doors and windows. The quality of the millwork supplied for this job by the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. is better than average quality. It is too soon, perhaps, to express an opinion on the merits or demerits of the \"Superior\" windows being installed in dormitories and class-rooms.\nCertainly they are more difficult and costly to install, and more than once I have overheard our carpenters consigning the inventor of them to a region not noted for deep snow! Also, they are not well adapted to work in conjunction with the storm windows specified. The upper part of the storm sash is a fixture, and the lower half opens into the room like French windows. The special feature of the \"Superior\" window is that both top and bottom parts can be tilted into the room, and brought to the horizontal for ease of cleaning, which might work all right with ordinary outside storm windows, but where, as in our case, we have inside storm windows permanently placed and reaching from jamb to jamb, the action of the \"Superior\" window in respect of its tilting feature is blocked. However, we shall meet the difficulty by holding the storm windows in place by means of small neat bolts, so that when the \"Superior\" windows are required to lie down for cleaning, the entire storm window can be unbolted and taken down out of the way in advance. This is not an ideal arrangement, but seems the best we can do to avoid nullifying the special feature of the \"Superior\" window.\n\nThe finishing of the cement floors is proceeding well, and I'm glad to say we are getting excellent floors. The sand we are using is very largely the fine screenings from the rocks that were crushed, which we kept specially for this purpose, and being a hard granite, the residue from such rocks is ideal for cement floors. This semi-pulverized rock crushings, with a small addition of ordinary bank sand, made an excellent aggregate for our purpose, and with skilled cement men doing the work, the result is very gratifying. The floors are about three-quarters laid at present.\n\nThe brickwork is completed with the exception of the enamelled bricks in the kitchen and scullery. The contractors short-estimated the bricks required in these two rooms, and are having to await the arrival of additional bricks from the East before being able to complete this work.\n\nDuring the plastering interim nothing further has been done in connection with heating and plumbing. Next week I expect the steam-fitters back, and they will then move the rads, now used for temporary heating, back to the walls, and set up the remainder of the rads throughout the building, and complete the work in the boiler room. This work and the heating installation generally will be inspected by Mr. Alex. Walker, of the Dunham Heating Co.; and the Provincial Boiler Inspector will also pay us a visit and issue his report previous to our taking over the building from the contractors.\n\nThe plumbing fixtures have been delivered to the job, and the putting of them in place will proceed after the completion of the plastering. Also, the laundry machinery is here.\n\nThe septic tank and sewer line are completed, except that more covering has yet to be placed over the sewer, and the pumping apparatus for the 2nd chamber of the septic tank has yet to be installed. This automatic motor-driven, float-controlled sewage lift pump arrived from the East to-day, and will be connected up soon. Mr. French, of the Water Branch of the Dept't of the Interior, Calgary, was here last week and checked up our septic tank and sewer line levels with an instrument, and found everything to his satisfaction. It was Mr. French who drew the plans for this service. As we have only 15\" fall in 800' run between\nthe septic tank and the final outlet, we have taken extraordinary pains in laying this sewer so as to maintain a uniform fall. The flow will be helped by the initial impulse from the pump, and Mr. French pronounced the conditions satisfactory from an engineering standpoint.\n\nThe well-driller, Mr. Frederickson, has not yet arrived here with his drilling rig. He has been engaged to set up over the deep well, and drill out the sand and mud now lying at the bottom of the casing to a depth of 80', and to do all possible to bring this deep well back into satisfactory production so that the school may have a supply of healthy soft water. Mr. Frederickson has had a whole series of discouragements in drilling for the Municipal Hospital at Elk Point, but in the end he succeeded in getting what is believed to be an ample supply of water for that institution. I am informed that he was commissioned to procure and install a pumping plant, and that after this is done, he will move his outfit here. He is due to arrive at any time now. I shall report promptly to the Department the results of the drilling here. I consider this water question one of extreme importance, and if we can succeed in securing the soft water from the deep vein it will prove a great boon to the school. The water from the shallow well, though ample in quantity, is so extremely hard and so impregnated with iron, that it is unpleasant to use and possibly detrimental to health as well.\n\nYesterday I had a call from the Rev. Father Naessens, of the Order of Oblate Fathers, Edmonton, and he spent most of the day with me in making out the list of cupboards, lockers, shelving, pews, etc., required for the new school. I took notes of all his requests, which follow closely along the lines of what was supplied in other schools, and shall prepare a list with details in readiness for submission for tenders. In this connection I would respectfully ask for instructions as to whom I should go for prices. Should the general contractors also be allowed to submit their figure? No doubt they would be willing to install the additional millwork, either at a stated price, or on the basis of cost plus 10%. I shall take no steps in this matter until receiving the Department's definite instructions.\n\nFrom present indications I should judge that the general contract will be completed sometime in March. I am deferring the building of the well-house until we see what success attends the effort to procure a water supply from the deep well, and this work is not in the contract anyhow. If the weather should turn too cold for outside construction, the building of the well-house could be deferred till spring. Our weather continues moderate, with an occasional snow flurry. The temperature for today is zero to 20 degrees above.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nCERTIFICATE\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCertificate No. 9\n\nSt. Paul, Alta.

H. French, A.M.E.I.C.\nInspecting Engineer.\n\nSeptic Tank.\n\nThis structure has been built materially according to plan and as stated by Mr. Gardner-Smith, Inspector of Construction, a very excellent quality of concrete was poured. The floor of the structure throughout was lowered two feet, thereby giving greater storage for sludge in the main chamber. This change also gives larger capacity to the overflow chamber and permits of a greater volume of effluent being pumped at intermittent periods into the outlet sewer, which will decrease the trouble from ice formation close to the end of the sewer line.\n\nThe pump and motor for the overflow chamber have not yet arrived at the school, but it is understood that they have been ordered.\n\nThe conduits from the school to the overflow chamber for the electric wiring are in place but the moisture-proof switches are not yet installed.\n\nSewer Line.\n\nAs far as constructed the works have been built materially according to plan. The manhole half way along the sewer line was not considered necessary because of the\nclean character of the effluent. It was therefore eliminated. The sewer-pipe was laid according to plan in an excellent manner and true to grade. As specified, the first three hundred feet of pipe was encased in a creosoted box filled with insulation for frost protection. This was done to avoid an unsightly fill across the school grounds.\n\nThe earth cover over the sewer line is only about 70 per cent completed. It was intended that this earth should be borrowed in low ground along the lower end of the pipeline and moved with teams and scrapers. However, the season had so far advanced before the work was authorized that borrow pits could not be opened up upon low ground because of frost. It was found necessary to borrow the earth from a hill about 800 feet distant and haul it with wagons. Even there the earth is partly frozen and has to be picked and loaded by hand.\n\nThe following summary of the state of completion of the various units in connection with the disposal works will serve as a basis for an interim payment.\n\n**Septic tank:**\n\n- Pipe connections from school - completed.\n- Concrete work \" \"\n- Timber work, doors, roof, manhole, etc. \" \"\n- Manhole cover and steel doors - in place.\n- Electric switches - not in place.\n- Pumping machinery - not arrived.\n\n**Sewer Line:**\n\n- Sewer pipe - in place\n- 300 ft. of concrete box insulation \"\nSewer Line (continued)\n\nEarth covering over pipe - 70% completed\nManhole - not to be built\n\nA payment of 70 per cent of the contract price less the cost of pump and motor will make a safe and conservative interim payment.\n\n(Sgd) Merritt H. French,\nA.M.E.I.C.\nSir,\n\nI am forwarding two copies of a report by Mr. M.H. French in regard to the progress of construction of the sewage disposal works at Blue Quill Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta, also my certificate for a payment of $2,400 to the Contractors on account of work done to date.\n\nThe estimated value of the work done to date, based on actual quantities, is as follows:\n\n- 790 feet sewer line, 70% completed - $1,380.00\n- Septic Tank, complete less pump and wiring - 1,570.00\n- Manhole cover, doors & miscellaneous ironwork - 50.00\n\nTotal - $3,000.00\n\nRetention 20% - 600.00\n\nPayment due - $2,400.00\n\nWill you please arrange with the Department of Indian Affairs for this payment to be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

He says there is no room in the basement that could possibly be spared for a Dairy, and yet he deems it essential that a suitable room be provided.\n\nAfter studying the plans jointly with me, the Rev. Father considers that an outside Dairy, 8'x10' inside measure, placed against the S.E.corner of the laundry between the laundry window and the vestibule, would meet the requirements admirably. By a glance at the basement plan of the school you will see at once the place meant.\n\nThis proposed Dairy should be built to match adjoining construction, and should be provided with concrete floor with floor drain, electric light, steam heat, hot and cold water, sink, and with waste connection to the laundry drain; tar and gravel roof, pre-cast copings, a door and two windows, and the interior walls and ceiling plastered. Only three walls would be required to be built, and the floor level would be about the same as that of the vestibule floor.\n\nIf the suggested Dairy Room, as outlined above, meet with the Department's approval, the contractors could build it while their mechanics are still here, which I'm sure they would be glad to do on the basis of proven cost plus 10%.\n\nAwaiting the Department's decision,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S. This room is wanted for the cream separator and churn, and butter-making.\nSir:\n\nThe well-driller, Mr. Frederickson, arrived here yesterday from Elk Point where he succeeded in bringing in a good well for the Municipal Hospital at that place, and under very adverse conditions. To-day he made a test of our deep well here. I'm sorry to say he reports it as hopeless, and that it would be a waste of money to attempt to draw on that source of water supply for the school.\n\nThe reasons he gives are as follows: In the first place the previous driller used \"inset\" casing, instead of the \"screw and socket\" kind, and that under driving it has telescoped and bent. Then the hole has been drilled crooked. The original 6\" casing had become stuck, and a 5\" casing was then used inside the other. This too jammed and stuck under driving. Then recourse was had to a 4\u00bd\" casing, and this has been driven to the bottom of the well and into a formation or strata of \"heaving\" sand, or sand in motion, where also water was met with. The drilling stopped too soon, and should have been continued through the sand to the water below, and the sand cased off. It is now impossible to do this because of the smallness of the 4\u00bd\" casing, in which drilling is not feasible, and this small casing is also badly bent and crooked for the greater part of its length.\n\nMr. Frederickson is convinced that there is a good body of water at the bottom of this well, and we proved the same by ten days' pumping during the building construction when an inflow of sand suddenly shut off the water and we were obliged to change back to the shallow well. Also, both from our own use of the water from the deep well, and from the analysis of the water, we know it is soft and pleasant to use, and immeasurably superior to the water from the shallow well. But we cannot make use of this deep well for the reason stated. To-day after several hours' steady baling the sand was actually higher in the casing than before the baling started, there being almost 100 ft. of it.\n\nI have a good deal of confidence in Mr. Frederickson. He comes highly recommended, he has had many years' experience in drilling and is familiar with the formations of this section of the country, and he has a first class deep-well rig. His advice is to abandon our deep well, not because there is any lack of water there, but because the hole is hopelessly blocked by jammed casings, and under these conditions it is impossible to shut out the sand, or deepen the well. He says the evidence shows that the previous driller started the well wrong, and went from bad to worse as the work proceeded.\nI have an ample supply of water in the shallow well, but I'm very doubtful as to the wisdom of using it for the needs of this large institution. The analysis of it speaks for itself, and from personal experience over several months I know it tastes strongly of iron, especially when freshly drawn, and it lathers scarcely at all unless a hard-water soap is used. It also corrodes and discolors wash basins and cooking utensils, and is ruination on boiler flues.\n\nIt seems to me that the Department will have to choose between making another attempt at drilling for soft water or installing a water-softening plant at the school for treating the water from the shallow well, if this institution is to have a pure water supply. I called the driller in to my room to-night, and in answer to my questioning he told me he is confident he can secure a good supply of soft water from the deeper level by drilling a new well, and by using 6\u00bd\" screw and socket casing, and by following his own methods which have proved successful elsewhere under similar conditions. He refuses to use inset casing at all. His terms for drilling are $1.50 per foot with board and water for self and man, or $1.75 per foot and he supply board and water. An additional 25\u00a2 per foot is charged after 250' depth. The wholesale price of 6\u00bd\" casing is $129.00 per 100' FOB Regina or Calgary.\n\nA new well drilled down into the soft water might be expected to cost from $1200.00 to $1500.00, with an almost assured prospect of securing an ample water supply of excellent quality. On the other hand a suitable softening plant would probably cost as much or more, besides annual upkeep for ingredients. As the question of a pure water supply is of prime importance, I am holding the driller here until I hear from the Department, and I would respectfully ask for telegraphed instructions in reply.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S. I have already sent the Department the gov't analyses of the water from both the deep & shallow wells.\n\nE.G.S.\nFeb. 4, 1931.\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nMemorandum:\n\nAt the new Blue Quills School near Edmonton it will be necessary to sink a new deep well. A well driller by the name of Mr. Frederickson, who has recently provided a good deep well for the Municipal Hospital at Elk Point is now at Blue Quills. He is recommended as a competent well driller, and I would ask you to please advise if he may be employed to drill the new well required. I have been advised by the Inspector of Construction that Mr. Frederickson is remaining at Blue Quills until instructions are forwarded from the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo...E.Gardiner-Smith...St. Paul...Alberta.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| 1931 | BLUE QUILLS SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION, ST.

Mr. Frederickson has endeavored to keep the cost down, and I consider his charge a moderate one.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nSince writing you two days ago I have been visited by our family physician, Dr. G. D. Stanley, and he has ordered me back to bed, and has intimated that it may be a week or ten days before I may return to St. Paul and resume my duties there. In my last letter I expected to make a very short stay in Calgary, but doctor's orders can not safely be ignored.\n\nDr. Stanley is leaving for Ottawa tomorrow to attend the Session of the House, and has arranged with his associate, Dr. Lincoln, to attend me so long as this is necessary.\n\nI was present at Blue Quills School as recently as last Friday. The work is well advanced and with the exception of erecting blackboards, some replacements in toilet bowls which came wrong and the completion of the painting, little now remains to be done to complete the general contract.\n\nMy main concern at present is the drilling of the second deep well recently authorized by the Department. On learning that I shall be detained here so much longer than I had intended or expected I took the liberty of conferring with Mr. J. S. Tempest, of the Water Branch, Department of the Interior, Calgary, and he has arranged to send up Mr. French, a competent hydraulic engineer, to supervise the well drilling operations in my absence.\n\nI trust soon to be able to report back for duty, this illness being unique in my experience as it is the first time since early childhood that I have been attended by a doctor.\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG. Gardner Smith\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMarch 9, 1931.\n\nDear Mr. Smith,\n\nI have your letter of the 4th and am very sorry indeed that you are ill. I am sure, however, that the arrangements you have made for the supervision of the drilling of the deep well will be quite satisfactory.\n\nAs the general contract is practically completed I feel that everything will be all right until you are able to return to St. Paul.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.

However, I am now allowed up for most of the day, and as soon as I become stronger I shall return to St. Paul and take up my interrupted duties there.\n\nI am receiving good reports on the well drilling, and Mr. French advises that this important work is proceeding satisfactorily and gives every promise of successful results.\n\nOn my return I will promptly prepare and forward to the Department sketches of the additional interior millwork required, as requested in the Department's letter of the 23rd ultimo.\n\nFortunately\u2014if any illness can be fortunate\u2014my illness came at a time when the general contract was practically completed, and I have since kept closely in touch with the contractors. No doubt they will soon expect the Department to take over the building, but this will have to await my further inspection of the work and the issuing of the final certificate.\n\nI take this opportunity of expressing my thanks and appreciation for your kind and sympathetic attitude towards\nmy illness and its consequent interruption in the performance of my duties.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nE.

Dr. Stanley, M.P., kindly came to see me during his hurried visit here during the Easter recess, and said he would call on you on his return to Ottawa and explain my prolonged absence from my job.\n\nEverything is progressing well at the Blue Quills School, the painting being nearly completed, and the grading of the ground is now being done. The well driller has brought in an ample supply of apparently good water at a depth of 327 feet, but we are awaiting the report of the Provincial Analyst as to the quality of the water before deciding whether or not to drill deeper.\n\nI hope to be back in St. Paul in time to make the final inspection of the school and to take over the building on behalf of the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

At a depth of 327', a strong vein of water has been struck, which, under a bailing test, yielded over 600 gals. per hour, and the water level in the casing was lowered only a few feet. The quality of the water seemed satisfactory, it lathered well with ordinary soap, and was pleasant to the taste. However, I deemed it prudent to get a report on the water from the Provincial Laboratory at Edmonton, which report reached me yesterday, and is fully satisfactory. After giving an exhaustive chemical analysis of the water the report ended \"From this chemical examination it would appear that this is a good potable water\".\n\nI have arranged with the General Contractors to extend the present tank room ten feet, which will then enclose the new well and pumping plant under the one reinforced concrete slab roof at grade level adjoining the boiler room.\n\nBlue Quills School is now assured of an ample supply of healthful soft water.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nE.

Nobody will stay here who will watch over the old buildings, and I am pretty sure that after one year, they will be burnt, as every spring fire runs all over the Reserve. Furthermore, I will have to build by myself a small house and barn for the Indians who will come to the new School to visit their children.\n\nCould you, then, empower me or Mr. Gullion, Indian Agent, to expropriate these buildings for the profit of the new school. The old material which will not be used in the new school and even the main building itself could be sold. Of course, I don't expect that this will give much money, but it is better to have something for, than to leave the buildings for prey to the fire.\n\nI know also that the Archbishop of Edmonton thinks to have a claim on these buildings, but as they have been erected only with the grant of the Department, I think that they belong to the Department Of Indian Affairs, and so you can dispose of them.\n\nI would be happy to know from you about this, that in order that buyers be found and that the expropriation begin just after our departure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Since my return here I am having a little more grading of the grounds done, and more covering placed on the sewer line owing to settlement of the earth placed there during the winter.\n\nInside the building there remains a little additional painting to be done; some very slight patching of plaster in 2 or 3 rooms; some floor plates to be placed over clear-outs in the basement floor; a pressure-reducing valve to be placed on the steam line to washer in laundry; and a few very minor adjustments here and there throughout the building, all of which can be done within the next few days.\n\nNeither the Provincial Boiler Inspector nor the Wiring Inspector, have yet visited the job, although both have been notified,\u2014the former was reported to be ill with grippe, and will come when better, and the latter is waiting till other inspections in the district can be done on the same trip. I shall make it my business to see that both these inspections are made, and the required certificates issued.\n\nThe new deep well recently completed has stood all tests successfully, both with regard to the quality and quantity of the water, and will prove a great boon to the school in this district of bad water. I am having the water pumped steadily, allowing it to go to waste, and using the contractors' pumping outfit for the purpose. This pumping of water is advised by the well driller rather than allowing the well to remain inactive, and this applies especially to new wells. As previously reported, this well has been drilled just beyond the pressure tank chamber, and by building a concrete extension to said chamber, the storage and pumping equipment will all be accessible from the boiler room and readily observed. I am in daily expectation of the Department's instructions regarding both the pump chamber and the pumping equipment, as outlined in my telegrams of the 7th instant.\n\nReferring to the concrete floors and base in the various rooms of the school, are these to be painted with a concrete paint as was done at Old Suns School? As no concrete hardener was called for in the specifications, I assume it is the intention that these concrete surfaces be painted, both for appearance and to prevent dusting of the surface where exposed to much wear. If the additional painting is to be done, should it not be done previous to the arrival of the school furniture? No doubt the contractors would be willing to undertake this work at cost plus 10%, or if preferred, I could purchase the materials and have the painting done by day labour. The Sherwin-Williams Co., make a special concrete paint that I have found to be better than some others on the market.\n\nShould we not place woven wire guards over the 14 windows of the two recreation rooms in the basement, as done elsewhere? These guards are made to order by The Western Steel Products, Ltd.\nWith regard to the additional millwork required, such as tables, benches, cupboards, pews, shelving, etc., and as enumerated in a list I sent the Department on April 13th, I am daily expecting to learn the Department's intentions. This list represents the requests of the local authorities with regard to their requirements. At the time of sending you the list I was too ill to work over a drawing board, so was just able to send you some rough sketches which I had on hand from previous jobs. However, I think you would have no difficulty in understanding just what is wanted. I shall be pleased to carry out whatever instructions I may receive, and if so desired I could call on millwork people in Edmonton or elsewhere and obtain competitive prices, but shall do nothing of this kind unless definitely told to do so. Possibly you are already doing this from Ottawa.\n\nThe question of a barn is raised each time any of the staff from the old school call here, and only yesterday the matter was referred to again. Under date of Sept 18th last I wrote the Department on the subject, and enclosed a suggested plan for a barn for Blue Quills School. Regarding the request for a root-house under the barn, I am now of the opinion that it would be unwise to build a root-house there. When digging out a sump-hole, which we filled with rocks, at the outlet of the roof-water line at the rear of the school, we encountered water at a depth of 7'. This condition might not apply at the barn site which is on somewhat higher ground, but I should not care to take the chance. I think it would be safer to build the root-house into the side of a knoll about a hundred yards' distance from the barn site. A pigery and hen-house is also being asked for. I am expecting plans from the Dept of Agriculture, Edmonton, of a pigery and hen-house adapted to local conditions of climate, etc., and after receiving them I will write again regarding these subsidiary buildings. I believe that McDiarmid Co. would give an attractive tender as it would give them a chance to use up materials now tied up in their temporary buildings.\n\nTo-morrow I expect Mr. Borgford here, and we shall then go over the accounts pertaining to the additional work authorized, and within the next few days I expect to issue the final certificate, and accept the building on behalf of the Department. I take it that any further work which the Department may authorize may be settled for through the issuing of Vouchers, and that it is not necessary to keep the contractors waiting much longer for the monies now due them. The McDiarmid Co. have given us a first-class job of construction, and I assure the officials of the Department will be very pleased with the building when they have occasion to visit it. They have a good name in the building trade, and their reputation will be further enhanced by the new Blue Quills School. I will, of course, take from them the usual 12 months' guarantee called for in the specifications.\n\nRegarding the shallow well of hard water drilled by the Department for the work of construction, I would point out that we have a water-line laid from this well to the school, a distance of about 550'. Should we not place a small building over this well, and install an inexpensive pumping plant there too? In case of a breakdown of the main pumping system this would then serve as an auxiliary during repair, and save any interruption in the water service. I would further suggest that this proposed auxiliary system be operated by a gasoline engine, and then in case of any interruption in the electric current from the St. Paul plant, the smaller pumping plant would be immediately available. Will you please instruct me in this regard.\n\nAwaiting the Department's instructions on the various matters referred to in this report,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nit is expected that the new school near St. Paul de Metis will be ready for occupation.

INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nSADDLE LAKE AGENCY.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nI visited this school on April 23rd, and found 60 pupils in residence out of an enrolment of 64; four were absent on sick leave. The health of the pupils was good throughout the year until the month of March when they had an epidemic of influenza. At the time of my visit, the general health in the school was very good. The pupils presented a clean and tidy appearance. They are provided with plenty of good wholesome food, including meat, bread, vegetables, fruit, and milk. Eleven cows were being milked at the time of my visit, which is ample for their requirements.\n\nThe junior classroom is in charge of Sister Menard who has had fourteen years experience in primary work in Indian schools. She had had no Normal training, but appears to have a special talent for instructing the small children. The senior room is in charge of Sister A. Gagnon who had had seven years experience. She has had no Normal training; her standing is Grade 12, academic. The pupils appeared to be making fairly good progress.\n\nThey have been operating a farm in connection with this school of over 100 acres of cultivated land, but this land is not being seeded this year as the present school will be evacuated at the end of June when it is expected.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith a report on the various schools in the Saddle Lake Agency, which were inspected by Mr. Murison during April.

With the exception of the two 6 h.p. gas engines, power washer, extractor, combination hand and power washing machine, dough mixer, cream separator and pump, the equipment is mostly old. The Beaver Power Washes and extractor will not be required at the new school and these could probably be disposed of. The Sisters of the St. Therese Hospital at St. Paul have made enquiries regarding the washer and extractor. The two 6 h.p. gas engines, hand and power washing machine, dough mixer and cream separator could be used at the new school.\n\nAs noted on the list, the buildings are in a very poor state of repair. The main building was built in two sections and I am informed that one part of the building is about 30 years old and the other section which was first used at Lac la Biche, 40 years old. Additions were apparently made at different times shortly after the main building was erected. This building is of no practical value in its present location and owing to its construction and present condition, it would be practically impossible to move it. Most of the windows are in fair condition and the Reverend Principal states that he might be able to use some of these in outbuildings at the new school. Owing to the cost and the time that it would take to pull down the old buildings, I am of the opinion that a very low price would be offered if the buildings were offered for sale as they stand. The buildings might be demolished and considerable useful material salvaged. In this connection, I might mention that the Indians of Saddle Lake reserve have been discussing the matter of erecting a council house. It is possible that this building could be disposed of to the Band. I have not mentioned the matter to the Indians but if the Department considered disposing of all or a part of the main building in this manner, I could take the matter up with them. The Indians of James Seenum's Band may object to using Band funds for this\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\npurpose but I am of the opinion that the Indians of the Saddle Lake reserve would be willing to use part of the revenue which may be derived from pasturage dues on the Saddle Lake reserve. Should part of the building only be disposed of in this manner, the other parts might be disposed of in sections and any part or material which may be considered useful at the Agency, might be taken over.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\nNEW SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nfrom each of the two top floors.\n\nA frigidaire plant is provided for cold storage purposes. The whole building appears to be well planned for the purpose for which it is to be used.\n\nA section of land has been set aside for the use of this institution, and at the present time work is being proceeded with in clearing 100 acres of land in preparation for breaking during the coming summer.\n\nI am attaching snapshots of front and rear views of this building.\n\nThe Rev. Father Angin is now in charge as Principal and business manager. This school was formerly managed by the Grey Nuns, but is now in charge of the Oblate Order. He appears to be energetic, and impressed me as having a fairly good knowledge of business methods. He is assisted by a Lay Brother and a Farming Instructor, as well as a staff of 8 Sisters of Charity.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nNEW SCHOOL.\n\nI made an inspection of the new school building near St. Paul, and found the building nearing completion. The painters were at work. It is a fine brick building; the floors and stairways are reinforced concrete, and the building should be pretty well fireproof. I was greatly pleased with the workmanship on this building. It impressed me as being first class; in fact, the best finish I have seen in connection with any of our recently built residential schools.\n\nA good supply of soft water appears to have been obtained in a well 264 ft. deep. The pumping test, at the rate of 600 gals. per hour, did not lower the water level.\n\nThe building is connected with the Calgary Power Company's system, and the laundry machinery will all be run by electricity.\n\nIt was noted that there was a standpipe with hose connections on each floor. Fire escapes are provided at the back of the building, with access to them from each\n| ITEM                                      | Summary of Tender | Previous | This Application | Total   |\n|-------------------------------------------|-------------------|----------|------------------|---------|\n| General Conditions                        | 2350.00           | 2350.00  |                  | 2350.00 |\n| Excavation Weeping Drains, etc.           | 1500.00           | 1500.00  |                  | 1500.00 |\n| Plain Concrete (Footings, Walls & Basement Floor) | 8900.00       | 8900.00  |                  | 8900.00 |\n| Reinforced Concrete (Slabs, Beams, Cols., etc.) | 4050.00       | 4050.00  |                  | 4050.00 |\n| Cement Finish                             | 1200.00           | 1200.00  |                  | 1200.00 |\n| Marble Tile and Terrazzo                  |                   |          |                  |         |\n| Reinforcing                               | 22400.00          | 22400.00 |                  | 22400.00|\n| Structural Steel                          |                   |          |                  |         |\n| Brick and Tile Work                       | 43100.00          | 43000.00 | 100.00           | 43100.00|\n| Rough Carpentry                           | 13000.00          | 12500.00 | 500.00           | 13000.00|\n| Finish Carpentry                          | 7000.00           | 6800.00  | 200.00           | 7000.00 |\n| Ornamental and Misc.

MacKenzie.\nExplanations of Work additional to Contract.\n\nSir:\n\nWith regard to the accompanying list of work performed additional to the general contract, by The J. McDiarmid Co., Ltd., contractors for the above mentioned school, I shall go over the list briefly in the order in which the items are enumerated, and add explanations. You will note I have made a few adjustments in the amounts charged in instances in which the costs seemed excessive, and I have written the contractors at their Calgary office giving my reasons for making the deductions.\n\nItems.\n\n1. **6\" COURSE OF BROKEN STONE UNDER BASEMENT FLOOR.** This was not included in the contract, but after the general excavation was completed it was found that ground moisture was present, so this work was subsequently authorized by the Department. The foundation walls and pier foundations were by this time in place, and teams and scrapers could not be used, so this work had to be done entirely by hand. In checking this account it seemed to me that too much labour had been inadvertently charged for the excavating, hence my adjustment.\n\n2. **CHANGES IN PLUMBING.** The Rev. Principal requested that the Engineer's Room be provided with a wash basin, and the waste and vent connections at this point added to the cost. The sink and lavatory were deemed essential, and a good sized one has been installed. The Principal also requested a wash basin in his bedroom, and as this had been provided in other schools, one was placed there for his use. The ash buckets are for the removal of ashes from the heating boilers. The pump at cistern is for raising the soft water for laundry and heating boilers. The charge of $444.15 is for an entirely separate cast iron roof-water line, consisting of 115' of 6\" C.I. pipe, and 4\" branches, as shown on the plumber's detail sheet attached. This line discharges into a slight depression at the rear of the school, and not through the septic tank. The laundry and kitchen wastes, and the general sewage are discharged to a southerly side sewer, outside the \"water tower\" site. This means we have three 6\" C.I. drains under the basement floor instead of the two drains called for in the specifications. The reason for running the rain water in a separate drain is because of the slight fall in the main sewer, and it was feared that in case of exceptionally heavy rain the main sewer after it leaves the septic tank might not be able to function fast enough. In consultation with Mr. French, of the Water Branch, Calgary, and after taking levels carefully, it was decided to discharge the rain water separately, as stated. The charge of $35.15 is for connecting the 2500 gal. cold water storage tank to the line inside the school. The charge of $79.75 is for providing a vent from the girls' north dormitory on the 1st floor. No vent had been provided in the specifications, and the Principal stated it was equally important that this dormitory be vented too. The charge of $81.00 for \"vents in Chapel\" was incurred in making connection to the roof vents shown in the roof plan of Chapel, and bringing said vents down to near the floor level, exactly as was shown in the Old Suns plans under similar conditions. The cost of $68.40 resulted from the Rev. Principal's earnest request that the staff bath-room on the ground floor be partitioned off, thus giving separate access...\nItems:\n\n2. The charge of $39.10 is the plumber's charge for diverting the rain water from the Chapel and laundry roofs to the cistern under laundry. The local people were desirous to have facilities for lawn watering, hence the charge of $50.65. The last charge of $12.18 is for bringing cold water to the compressor of the refrigerating system.\n\n3. The concrete cistern below laundry was specially authorized by the Department, and provides a large reservoir of rain water from the Chapel and laundry roofs. The cost of $500.00 is less than elsewhere.\n\n4. Further Changes in Plumbing. The 3 items under this heading are self-explanatory, and were authorized at the prices stated.\n\n5. Increasing Height of Chimneys, also specially authorized by the Department because of the proximity of a treed knoll, and to give better draft.\n\n6. Venting Roof Spaces, to prevent the condensation of moisture on the under side of roof during extreme cold weather. Eleven ventilators have been installed, 6 on the main roof, and five on the rear roofs.\n\n7. Plug Receptacles, Light Outlets & Extra Switches, at the special request of the Rev. Father and Sister Superior. These consist of:\n   - Plug Receptacle in Principal's Inner Office.\n   - \" west side of Chancel.\n   - \" Sewing room.\n   - \" Community room.\n   - \" Matron's room.\n   - Light & switch in basement rear corridor.\n   - Pilot Light in Cold Storage room.\n   - 3-way switch in boiler room\n   - Extra switch & light in re-arranged bath room, gr. flr.\n   - Switch for Sun room, 1st floor.\n\n8. Additional Electric Work. The Item of $24.05 under this heading covers the cost of a switch at the outside entrance of boiler room, and for the lighting of the new tank room where the large cold water storage tank is placed. The charge of $52.00 was specially authorized by the Department for special work and material in bringing power current to the laundry machines, bakery, and to the motor in 2nd chamber of septic tank. The charge of $71.90 is for sundry items shown on the attached detail sheet, and including an extra fire gong on the boys' side of the solid partition wall of the top storey.\n\n9. Experimenting with Deep Well Originally Drilled. It would take an entire chapter to explain fully this Item, but I think it will suffice when I say that we exhausted every means to the effort to bring this well into production, and thus secure for the school a soft water supply. There has been much correspondence on the subject, and I think the circumstances are understood by the Department. In the end we had to abandon this well, but the Lord directed us to another spot, and we have now an assured supply of healthy soft water in a 2nd deep well. The charge of $108.90 shown in this account was for boarding the well-driller and helper while working on the 1st deep well in the effort to restore it, and for a short time after they commenced on the 2nd deep well. The total charge of $121.32 for this item is in order, and I may say I much appreciate the cooperation I received from the contractors; on one occasion their men worked nearly all night lowering and raising pipes and cylinders.\n\n10. Drain at Rear of Building. This Item covers digging the trench and laying tile, and back-filling, for the rain water line carried to a depression at the rear of the school.\nItems:\n\n11. Door between Coal Bin & Boiler Room. Because of the fine dust which steam coal gives off when being shovelled into the coal bin, it is necessary to have practically an air-tight door to prevent the dust from penetrating. This is practically a refrigerator door, with door and frame metal covered.\n\n12. Waterline from well to Building. This includes a trench 7' deep and about 300 feet long, and full length of 2\u00bd\" gal. pipe, and backfilling. This work was deferred till the ground was frozen to about a foot in depth, which made it more expensive; also a short part of it had to be cribbed against shifting. This trench connects the school water system with the shallow well of hard water which was drilled before the work of construction was started. It will make a valuable auxiliary supply in case of a temporary break down of the main pumping plant.\n\n13. Pressure Tank Chamber, and Door from Boiler Room. This concrete chamber, 9' x 21', with reinforced slab roof at grade level, houses the low water storage tank. Access to this room is from the boiler room, and this necessitated cutting a doorway through a 10\" concrete wall. This Item also included freight on the storage tank from Edmonton, carriage to the school, and installing the tank on a suitable foundation. The further wall of this chamber is in 8\" brick, with cement mortar, so that in the event of the tank having someday to be replaced, no concrete cutting will be necessary, it being much easier and cheaper to make an opening in a brick wall than to cut through concrete.\n\n14. Erecting Belfrey and Installing Bell. This work has been exceptionally well done, but also exceptionally expensive compared with similar installations elsewhere. I have therefore deducted $45.50 under this heading.\n\n15. Framing Blackboards. This covers the cost of building out a framework so that all the blackboards in the various class rooms may be in a continuous unbroken line instead of being broken where piers are met with. This was stressed as very important by the teachers.\n\n16. Panelling Columns in Recreation Rooms & Wash Rooms. These columns were deemed unsafe by the school staff because of the sharp edges. To lath and plaster them was considered unsuitable in play rooms where certain damage would result. On the suggestion of the contractors' foreman I consented to having them panelled 5'-6\" high, and a splendid job has been made of it, both in strength and appearance. However, here again too expensive work has been done, and I have felt called upon to make a small deduction under this heading.\n\n17. Additional Hinges on Doors. Throughout the interior of this building we have an unusual number of wide doors, and as they are of 1 3/4\" fir stock, they are quite heavy. The contractors strongly advised placing a third hinge to hold these doors securely, to which I assented.\n\n18. Barrel Bolts and Screws on Storm Sashes. These bolts are placed so that the upper storm sash where \"Superior\" windows are in use can be readily removed. By this arrangement the \"Superior\" windows are allowed to function as intended by the inventor, instead of the upper half being blocked by a non-removable storm window. The storm windows can now be taken down out of the way very quickly. The screws are for securing the upper half of the storm windows elsewhere throughout the building, so that for cleaning purposes they can be much more readily removed than if fastened solid with nails.\n19. **Friction Stays on Casement Sash.** These stays are attached to the top of the casement sash, are up out of the way, and the tension is adjustable. After much investigation this is the only type of adjustment I have discovered for use where casement sash open in. The purpose of them is to prevent damage from the sash being blown about in the wind. I'm sure they will pay for themselves in a short time in districts subject to high winds.\n\n20. **Sump at end of rainwater line.** The purpose of this rock-pit is to allow a slow drip or xin roof water in the winter time to get away instead of being frozen at the mouth of the line. At times when the noonday sun causes a slight melting of snow on the roof, it is feared that the outlet of the rainwater line might gradually freeze unless protected. This precaution was specially recommended by Mr. Bongford, Sr., when on a visit here from Winnipeg. However, in the digging of this sump, excessive labour has crept in, and even allowing for winter conditions of digging, the labour cost is disproportionately high. I have therefore made a deduction of $32.00 under this heading. I don't think there was any intention of overcharging, and probably the mistake is a book-keeping or time-keeping one.\n\n21. **Changing Fire Escape Doors to Windows on Ground Floor.** By a glance at the Plans of the building it may be observed that the rear elevation shows the outlets or exits to the fire escapes on the ground floor to be from doors. The ground floor plan shows these exits as from windows\u2014if that they are intended to be. As the Rev. Principal was very desirous to remodel the staff bathroom on the ground floor, from which little room access to the west fire escape could only be had, he asked to change the door shown on the elevation to a window, as shown on the floor plan. As the building is fire-proofed and as exits from the ground floor can be from the main front entrance, and also from the rear stairways, it was not considered necessary to make the change as asked for, which now gives a bathroom subdivided as desired. In both cases on this floor, the windows have replaced the doors shown in the elevation as giving exits to the fire escapes, and the charge of $72.49 represents the extra cost to the contractors, as shown in their detail sheet.\n\n22. **Iron Ladder to Chapel Roof.** Access to the Chapel roof is necessary for inspection of roof hoppers occasionally, and for other purposes. A sturdy iron ladder has been installed.\n\n23. **Extra Concrete of Rear Foundation Walls.** As we raised the grade of the building 22 inches so as to improve the sewage disposal conditions, and as the natural grade fell away at the rear of the building, more concrete was necessary in bringing up the rear foundation walls. The charge under this heading is a fair one.\n\n24. **Extra Work on Septic Tank.** This work consisted principally of installing a weir of iron rods for preventing the possibility of solid crust passing from the septic tank into the sewage chamber, thereby perhaps choking the sewage lift pump. Also under this heading was included some additional woodwork to prevent frost penetration. This additional work was authorized by Mr. French in my absence, and on showing him the bill for same he demurred at the labour cost, which he said was twice what he expected. On the strength of Mr. French's representation, I have deducted $10.00 from the labour charged.\n\n25. **Painting Extra Vents.** This is the cost of painting the extra vent to girls' Dormitory, the extensions to the toilets in basement, and the Chapel vents where exposed.\nSuperior Windows for Class-rooms & Dormitories. This change was authorized by the Department after the main contract was let, and I was advised by telegram of it. On asking the contractors for their authority for charging the $452.00 extra, they replied that the additional cost was agreed to between their Winnipeg office and the Department.\n\nThis brings me to the end of the list of additional charges, and while the grand total aggregates a somewhat formidable figure, it must be borne in mind that the great majority of the work represents substantial and permanent services, and adds proportionately to the value of the general investment. It would be entirely fallacious to regard anything on the list in the light of the proverbial \"extras\" that an unscrupulous or tricky contractor wont to slip over an unwary inspector! The bulk of the additional work was specially authorized by the Department, and a few additional items which I have taken it on myself to order are only such as the Department has approved under similar circumstances in previous schools built under my inspection.\n\nIt would be negligent on my part if I failed to testify to the integrity and efficiency of the J. McDiarmid Co., in the carrying out of this important contract. They have used good materials throughout, and have employed capable workmen, and as a result we are getting a high-class job of construction. Their local representatives have co-operated with me wholeheartedly, and during my enforced absence from the work on account of illness not the slightest advantage was taken.\n\nNow I must close this long-winded review. If, despite my loquacity, there is anything I have omitted to explain, I shall be glad to do so on my attention being called to it.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nCERTIFICATE\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nCertificate No. 12 (Firm)\n\n$619.37 (additional to contract)\n\nI hereby certify that The J.

This head has a 9 inch stroke and design is identical to our Fig. 487. Instead of using plunger tube on the root this is now packed by an exceptionally large Brass Gland which permits the use of a large quantity of packing. The only attention required will be to occasionally tighten the packing nut to prevent water leaking at this point.\n\nThese heads are all made so that motor can be mounted on top as shown by the cut. When fitted for motor drive a single tight pulley and adjustable gravity belt tightened will be supplied. For gas engine drive tight and loose pulleys will be furnished if ordered.\n\nFig. 487B will be same head as illustrated above with 4 foot set length and underground discharge. This permits of the use of this head on installations where the equipment will not be protected from frost.\n\n| Suction | Discharge | Pulleys Tight and Loose | Pulleys Belt Tightener | H.P.

This fitting can also be used with Fig. 477B. Customers will find this arrangement very convenient on motor driven pumps in case of breakdown or power failure. It is of special advantage when pumps are operated by Gas Engine. At times only small quantities of water are needed and no doubt can be secured quicker and easier by hand than by starting engine. The Handle can be attached or detached by placing or removing a hard steel pin provided for that purpose.\n\nFig. 477A with Hand Attachment. Cipher: Lass.

This arrangement considerably reduces the floor space required for this outfit and makes the equipment very neat and attractive.\n\nThe Heads will be supplied fitted with sub-base to which any size motor can be attached. We carry all sizes of motors in stock and these are sold at very best trade prices. As these heads are identical to our Fig. 477 except for top of case, which is finished as shown, the specifications given for Fig. 477 A and B will apply.

May 28, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the water service for the new deep well at this school, I duly received the Department's telegram of the 19th instant giving authority for building the pump house, in which I was also told that I would be further advised concerning the purchase of the pump.\n\nThe pump house is now completed, and the present would be an opportune time for setting up the pumping equipment while the contractors' help is still available. The plumbing and heating contractor (Mr. Rieve) returned here today to make a final check-up on the services he has installed to see that everything is working satisfactorily; and tomorrow he expects the Provincial Boiler Inspector to come and test out the boilers, and issue the required permits. Mr. Rieve is an experienced man on pumping equipment, and has the proper tools for doing this work, and it would be advantageous to employ him for this pumping installation.\n\nI enclose a cut and specifications of the \"McDougall Self Oiling Deep Well Working Head\" that is recommended to us by Beatty Bros., Ltd., Edmonton Branch. The Beatty people stock this pump in Edmonton, and keep the repair parts, and their traveller covers this territory. In case of a breakdown prompt service and repairs would be quickly available. They recommend a 3\" working barrel cylinder, 3\" well piping, and a 5 H.P. motor, and as previously mentioned their price is $475.00 for the complete equipment, F.O.B. Edmonton. This includes octagon hard wood pump rods with forged screwed couplings.\n\nShould the McDougall outfit meet with the Department's approval I shall be pleased to order the same and have it installed very soon; or if some other design is preferred by the Department, I shall be equally pleased to arrange for the installation of same. In the meantime we shall have to depend on the courtesy of the general contractors to allow us to use their temporary pumping plant so as to keep pressure in the building.\n\nHoping to receive the Department's decision by telegram or early letter,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction\nDEPT.

April 20, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Blue Quills School.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith my Time and Expense Account for the months of February and March.\n\nAs previously reported, I have been prevented by illness from giving full time to my work. However, even from a sick bed I have kept in close touch with whatever was going on at the job, and gave directions and instructions as occasion required, besides visiting the work by taxi from the hospital at St. Paul whenever I felt able to do so. As by this time the general contract was well advanced, I feel that nothing suffered in consequence of my enforced absence during the worst of my illness in St. Paul.\n\nOn my arrival in Calgary on March 1st I suffered a relapse, probably caused by my leaving the hospital at St. Paul too soon, and I have been under medical treatment here ever since. However, I still endeavoured to keep in close touch with the work by correspondence and long-distance 'phone. The contractors' representative (Mr. Borgford) called on me frequently, and I believe the final work has gone on much the same as if I had been present all the time in person. My daughter, who is an accomplished stenographer employed in the office of the Hudsons' Bay Co here, came almost daily to take my dictation and write my letters so that nothing was neglected nor allowed to get into arrears. I am now hopeful of being back on my job by the end of the month.\n\nYou will note that I am charging the Department with half-time for Feb'y and March, as this seemed to me to be a fair and honest adjustment under all the circumstances. Should this arrangement not meet with the Department's approval, I can only ask that you adjust the account as seems right to you.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDr. D. O. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,\n\nI have your communication of April 21st in regard to Mr. E. Gardner-Smith. I may say that it will be rather unfortunate if Mr. Gardner-Smith will not be able to draw pay for the duration of his sickness. Personally I am quite convinced that his case was one of typhoid fever or paratyphoid which was contracted in the pursuance of his business in all probability from contaminated water. It would seem rather unjust that he should be called upon to carry the expense of such a protracted illness.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nG.O. Stanley\nNew Blue Quills School.\nSt. Paul, Alta. May 26, 1931.\n\nMr. F.H. Paget,\nChief Accountant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Paget:\n\nUnder date of April 20th I forwarded my Time and Expense Account for the months of February and March, totalling $210.57. In an accompanying letter I explained how the amount charged in said account was arrived at. Up to the present time no reply\u2014and what is worse, no cheque\u2014has been received!\n\nIn my letter I asked that in the event of the account as rendered not being acceptable to the Department, that the account be adjusted as seemed right to the Department.\n\nAs I have had very heavy medical and hospital expenses in consequence of my illness, I am more than usually hard up, and if a cheque is not already in the mails, may I ask that the matter receive your usual prompt and courteous attention?\n\nThanking you in anticipation, believe me, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.

Mr. Tempest, Commissioner of Irrigation, Calgary, kindly loaned me Mr. Goodchild, of his staff, and a Department car, but stipulated that I must pay all expenses as he had no funds available for the purpose.

The walls are constructed with 6\" studding, 2 ply of paper, and 3 ply of lathing. The six inch space between the lathing is packed tightly with cotton waste or shavings. The ceiling is also boarded tightly above which is a layer of paper and insulating material. The cotton waste in the front admits the fresh air from a slant through the ventilation extending from a point 10\" above the floor and through the roof. Double windows of glass are used and arranged that they may be opened and closed easily. Ventilation is provided by a small part of the roof that may be opened and closed by means of the open ventilators.\n\nFittings\u2014Each 100 hens require a hopper four feet long for feeding purposes. Sixteen hens require placed boxes with ventilators to meet the requirements of the birds. Water troughs 4\" long, 6\" wide, and 6\" deep and constructed of galvanized iron are used; one each trough in the small pen and two in the larger. Troughs are installed on the end wall of each room. These may also be used as common seats when not required for feeding. Wherever electricity is available, the buildings should be wired. The design of hanging light globes will be outlined if drop cords are here used to place a right fixture on the ceiling.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, August 6, 1931.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nWith reference to the erection of a barn for the new Blue Quills school at St. Paul, Alta., the advertisement calling for tenders may be inserted in the St. Paul Journal and the Edmonton Journal.\n\nActing D.

I had instructed him to keep up the water pressure in the building.\n\nI am not certain that the Department expected me to issue this Voucher, but on meeting Mr. Gullien, Indian Agent at the Saddle Lake Agency, he told me he had received no advice in the matter, and thought I should forward the account. Mr. Fraser's employment as Caretaker was authorized in the Department's telegram to me of June 22nd.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nOttawa, August 8, 1931.\n\nKindly have a set of plans and a copy of the specifications for the barn to be erected at the Blue Quills residential school mailed to Mr. H. S. Fraser, Contractor, of St. Paul, Alta.\n\nThis is the work which is to be advertised in the St. Paul Journal and the Edmonton Journal.\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, August 8, 1931.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nWith reference to memorandum to you of April 14, last, in which it was stated that Mr. Leon Fraser, of St. Paul, Alta., was to be appointed Caretaker for the new Blue Quills Indian residential school, I have to advise you that we have been informed that Mr. Fraser desires to be relieved of his appointment, and the employment of Mr. Wilfrid Genereux, of St. Paul, in his place is hereby authorized. Kindly take the necessary action in this regard.\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nWeather Report from St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nThe weather depends on the moon I am told\nAnd I'm finding the saying too true!\nAt St. Paul it rains when the moon's at the full\nAnd again when the moon's at the new;\nWhen the moon's at the quarter down comes the rain,\nAt the half it's no better, I ween,\nWhen the last quarter comes it's at it again,\nAnd it seldom stops raining between.\n\nAug. 7, 1931.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Aug. 7, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- New Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my Report of May 15th, perhaps the time is now opportune for bringing to the attention of the Department again some of the matters referred to in said Report.\n\nThe pump chamber, as authorized by the Department in the telegram of May 19th, was completed by The J. McDiarmaid Co., Ltd., some time ago, the account for which will soon be forwarded for payment.\n\nWith regard to the pumping equipment required, I called on the 5 Edmonton firms mentioned in the Department's letter of June 24th, and procured tenders. The best price was secured from Messrs O'Neill-Morkin Machinery Co., so the order was placed with this firm for a Canadian-made \"McDougall\" deep well pump with a 12\" stroke, and with the working parts enclosed in oil. This is a recent addition to the McDougall line. The pump will be driven by a 5 HP motor, with automatic starter and cut-out. This model had to be ordered from Galt, Ont., and my last advice was that it was to be shipped on July 24th, so we are now in daily expectation of its arrival. Through the courtesy of the general contractors, we have been allowed to use their temporary pumping outfit for keeping up pressure in the building pending the arrival of the permanent plant.\n\nIs it the intention to paint the concrete floors and base in the various rooms and passageways? As no concrete hardener was specified or used, it would be a distinct advantage to paint these surfaces with a good concrete paint, such as that made for the purpose by the Sherwin-Williams Co. This treatment would add to the wearing qualities of the cement floors, prevent dusting of the surfaces where exposed to much wear, and add to the appearance of the floors. The concrete is now all thoroughly dry, and in excellent shape for taking the treatment suggested.\n\nIn the two recreation rooms in the basement there are 14 windows which, perhaps, should be protected with wire guards such as have been installed in other schools. If this should be authorized, I should like authority also to include wire guards to protect the exposed belts and pulleys of the laundry machines.\n\nRegarding the additional millwork required to complete the building, such as tables, benches, shelving, pews, etc., I shall be glad to carry out any instructions concerning these\nrequirements. I gathered from a previous letter that it was the Department's intention to prepare a detailed list of these articles, and call for tenders from Ottawa.\n\nNo doubt the Department has in mind the need for a stock barn for the school farm, and I shall be glad to supervise the erection of this important building. One or two St. Paul men are anxious to get this work, but from what I can learn of their performances elsewhere in the district I should hesitate to award important construction to them, unless under very close supervision regarding both workmanship and materials.\n\nThe Rev. Principal states that a hen-house and piggery are also needed. In this connection I wrote to the Alberta Department of Agriculture asking if they could supply plans for these auxiliary buildings, and in reply I received a plan of a poultry building, which I am enclosing herewith. This plan might be reduced in length to keep down the cost, and it could be extended afterwards as occasion required, and as funds permitted. It seems a good design of building for this climate.\n\nIn my Report of May 15th I drew attention to the well that was drilled for the work of construction, situated about 400' distant from the school building. A 2\u00bd\" gal. water pipe has been laid in a 7' trench connecting this well with the school water system, and although this water is very hard and not recommended for general use, it would serve very well as an auxiliary system in case of a breakdown in the main pumping service from the deep well of soft water located close to the storage tank. I suggested that it might prove advantageous to install an inexpensive gasoline-driven pump at the shallower well so that in case of any mishap to the main water supply, or any interruption in the electric current from St. Paul, this auxiliary service could be brought into operation at once. There is ample water in this shallower well too. Should the Department sanction providing this additional water supply, should we not erect an inexpensive frame pump-house, about 8' x 10', to give protection to the pumping plant at this well?\n\nAwaiting the Department's further instructions, which will receive my careful and prompt attention,\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S. Unlike the central prairies, we have had a superabundance of moisture in this district, and the crops could scarcely look better. During the past fortnight excessive and unwanted rains have been frequent, and almost continuous.

Aug. 24, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith a Voucher for $157.50, in favour of Mr. J.E. Frederickson, well driller, for services rendered in connection with the water supply for this school, as shown on his detailed statement enclosed herewith.\n\nIt will be noted that this account includes an item of $90.00 for salvaging the well casing in the well we were obliged to abandon. Owing to an unexpected delay in the arrival of the new pump from Galt, Ontario, and as Mr. Frederickson had in the meantime arrived on the job with his outfit in readiness for installing the new pump and heavier well piping, I took it on myself to employ him during part of the interval in salvaging as much as possible of the casing in the abandoned well. We were successful in recovering casing as follows:\n\n- 230' of 4\u00bd\" casing.\n- 180' \" 5\" \"\n- 60' \" 5 5/8\" \"\nor 470' altogether.\n\nThe Department will recover two or three times the cost of pulling this casing. The R.C. Church, at a parish just west of St. Paul, is taking 100' of the 5\" casing, and I have $74.00 ready to remit to Ottawa as soon as I can get time to go to the bank. Some of this casing is bent and dinted from driving, and otherwise damaged, but the great bulk of it is fit to use again.\n\nThe 2nd item, $67.50, is self-explanatory, and in order.\n\nYesterday I had the electrician here from the town plant to connect the current to the motor of pump, after which the new pumping service was started. For a few minutes everything went fine, then suddenly the water stopped coming, and the pump stuck. The well-driller said sand had choked the cylinder. Fortunately his rig is still here, although it was his intention to pull out today to the R.C. job, but he will remain until we overcome the trouble. Today he is taking up the well piping and cylinder. (He has just come in to say he now has the piping and cylinder raised, and mud and sand has caused the trouble)\n\nApparently the change from the small capacity of the contractors' pump (225 gals. an hour) to one of 600 gals an hour has had the effect of raising mud and sand with the water, with the result mentioned.\nThe driller proposes to clean out the well by drilling and bailing; and then connect up the new pump quickly, and pump continuously day and night for perhaps a week so as to keep any sediment moving. He thinks once the building becomes occupied, with the large daily consumption of water that will then take place, the recurrence of such trouble as we are now having will be much less likely. Of course it will not require the presence of the driller for this continuous pumping which he recommends; the caretaker can look after that. The water will be allowed to run to waste outside until this initial test is completed. Then there will be a little work for the plumber connecting the new pump to the large storage tank, which he can do when here to attend to a few slight adjustments in his other work. I shall notify him when to come.\n\nI shall keep the Department advised regarding developments in restoring the water supply. I have the highest confidence in Mr. Fredericksen, and am much relieved to know that he and his rig are now right on the job. Once the water question is on a satisfactory basis I shall return to Calgary, as it is noted that the Department will be unable to retain my services longer. In another letter I shall testify more fully to my appreciation of the unfailing courtesy and kindness which I have received from the Department officers.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\nP.S.

Sept 2nd, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 24th ultimo, in which I reported trouble in the new well at this school caused by sand and mud choking the cylinder, I am now able to report that the well-driller, Mr. Fredericksop, and helper, after raising the piping and cleaning out the cylinder, drilled and bailed out the well. Two days ago the pump was again started, and has since been running continuously, with most encouraging results. We are now pumping at the rate of 600 gals. per hour, delivering the water outside where it runs to waste. The driller thinks it was the long period of comparative inactivity in the pumping of water that allowed the accumulation of sediment and sand in the well. He recommends that almost continuous pumping take place until such a time as the building becomes occupied, and that then the normal daily consumption of water by the school will prevent any repetition of the trouble we have experienced. Eventually the water vein is expected to clear itself. The water now being pumped is of excellent quality, and only slightly cloudy.\n\nThe plumber is now here making connections from the new pumping plant to the large storage tank in the adjoining chamber. While this work is being done I am having him make provision for the future delivery of water under pressure to the barn, from the pneumatic storage tank. I shall refer more fully to this feature in a separate letter on the subject of the new barn, the plans and specifications of which were received by the last mail.\n\nThe plumber, in addition to making connection to the pressure tank, will provide a branch line outside, so that besides keeping up pressure in the building, the main delivery of water during the next few weeks will be outside, as previously mentioned, in keeping with the driller's recommendation. I do not anticipate any further trouble with this well; on the contrary I expect it to prove of inestimable value in this district where good water is indeed rare.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nInspector of Construction.\nNew Blue Quills School.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Sept 1st, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith the account of Messrs O'Neill-Morkin Machinery Co., of Edmonton, to the amount of $573.92, for supplying the pumping plant recently installed at the above-mentioned school.\n\nIt will be noted that their original tender has been supplemented by additional well-piping and rods; also it was thought advisable to attach a strainer to the bottom of the suction pipe. Then, too, the working barrel supplied had spring valves which I have found less dependable than ball valves, hence this change. The reason for the additional well pipe and rods was because of the possibility of the water level falling to an unusual extent under future demands. These additional goods, less the credit for the returned working barrel, amount to $81.16, as shown.\n\nI am enclosing the 5 original tenders from the 5 firms in Edmonton from whom I had been instructed to obtain prices. The next nearest tender is that from S.L.Dobbin (only 24\u00a2 difference) but on examination it will be observed that Mr. Dobbin quoted on a 9\" stroke pump, whereas the one supplied by O'Neill-Morkin has a 12\" stroke (25% more water) and a more powerful motor, which make their tender much the best received.\n\nThe firms tendering all quoted on the same list of requirements, and F.O.B.Edmonton. The O'Neill-Morkin Co. have apparently overlooked charging the Department for the freight (800 lbs) on the McDougall pump from Edmonton to St. Paul, but I thought it better not to delay forwarding the main account because of this omission, and this small item can be dealt with separately when the bill is received.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nSt. Paul, Alta.

We are allowing this\nsurplus water to run to waste outside the building.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nNew Blue Quills School,\nSt. Paul, Alta. Sept 2, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nRe- Proposed Combination Barn.\n\nSir:\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of the plans and specifications of the proposed new combination barn designed for this school; also the Department's letter of the 27th ultimo instructing me to give tenderers the location of the barn, which I shall be pleased to do.\n\nI also received the Department's telegram of the 25th ultimo asking me to continue as Inspector until Sept 15th, and for which slight extension of employment please accept my thanks.\n\nRegarding the plan of the barn, it will certainly make a most creditable building, and should be most acceptable to the school staff; and prove an object lesson to the farmers of the district.\n\nIt is noted that the barn is to be equipped with water-bowls, and provided with an inside water-trough. This will call for care and experience in the plumbing, and the whole system of water supply should be so installed that the water intake could be shut off and the various lines drained in the event of danger of freezing at times of extremely low temperatures.\n\nNo doubt it is the Department's intention to deliver water under pressure from the school water system. I have had this in mind from the first, and when the water line was laid from the shallow well to the school I had a tee placed at a convenient point in readiness for a branch line to the future barn. The plumber now at work here connecting the new pumping plant at the school to the pneumatic storage tank is being instructed to connect the pipe line from the shallow well to the outlet from the pressure tank. This line is already laid in a 7' trench from the shallow well about 400' distant from the school where it was hoped the Department might authorize the installing of an auxiliary gasoline driven pump and small pump house which would be immediately available in the event of any interruption in the main service. However, as no funds were available for this suggested auxiliary service, we shall cap this line at its farther end below frost line, and should it ever be found necessary or desirable to utilize the shallow well, it would be a simple job to connect up with the line already laid. In the meantime this line will remain full of water; and at the said location of the tee the barn supply will be taken off. A gate valve is being placed on this line close to the pressure tank so that delivery of water to the barn can be controlled.\nThe site of the new barn is about 300' distant from the tee from which the service to the barn water system will be taken off. This will call for the digging of a trench at least 7' deep, and the laying of a galvanized water line of not less than 1\u00bd\". This line should pass under the foundation of the barn, and rise inside the building to feed the regulating tank of water bowls, and with a branch feed line to the water trough in passageway beside the feed room. As already stated, provision should be made for emptying the barn service.\n\nRegarding the electric lighting of the barn, this has also been anticipated, and a service main is in readiness on the outside wall of the school for extending the electric current to the barn. Also, when the Calgary Power Co. built the pole line from St. Paul I got their foreman to leave us sufficient poles for the barn line too.\n\nI have not yet gone over the plans and specifications of the barn very thoroughly, but in glancing over the painting specification I did not see any provision for painting the roof. Should the shingles not be given at least one good coat of oil stain?\n\nA representative of Messrs W.H.Cushing Co., of Edmonton, is here today with reference to the additional inside millwork and I was able to be of some assistance to him in measuring up the places where fixtures are to go, etc. He expects his firm will make delivery of the millwork in October.\n\nAs I have no other employment in view, I should be glad to remain to supervise the construction of the barn, if so desired by the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nBank of Montreal,\n\n$74.00\n\nOttawa, Sept. 3rd 1931.\n\nRECEIVED from E.

Frederickson, well driller, of St. Paul, to the amount of $153.00, for services rendered in connection with the new well at this school, as shown in detail in said account.\n\nAs previously reported, trouble developed in this well, and it was found necessary to drill and bail out sand and sediment which had accumulated, and which stuck the cylinder soon after the larger permanent pumping plant was installed. As this well had been carefully drilled, with a straight hole and large size casing, it was not a difficult task to set up the drill and do this work. The results are highly satisfactory, and the water is coming today perfectly clear and in good volume.\n\nI regret very much that this additional expense has arisen, especially as there had previously been so much money spent on the original well which we had to abandon. When Mr. Frederickson rendered me his account last night for this most recent work, I pleaded with him for a slight reduction in his customary rate in view of all the circumstances, and he has very generously consented to allowing the Department a reduction of 25\u00a2 an hour for the services of himself, tractor, well-drilling rig and hired man, which allowance reduces his account from $170.75 as rendered, to $153.00 as amended.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\nNew Blue Quills School.\nSt. Paul, Alta. Sept 14, 1931.\n\nRev. Joseph Angin, O.M.I.\nPrincipal, Blue Quills School.\nSacred Heart, Alta.\n\nDear Father Angin:\n\nWith regard to heating the new school, I wired the Department on the 8th of August suggesting the desirability of procuring a minimum car of coal in order to safeguard the building against dampness. In reply I received authority to buy one ton only, which, of course, was quickly used up and was quite inadequate for the purpose in view.\n\nI consider it very important that provision be made as quickly as possible to provide heat in this building. The season has been and is still abnormally damp, and this new building is being affected adversely. Scarcely a door or window in the building can now be opened or closed properly because of the swelling of the wood, and the atmosphere in the various rooms is damp and clammy. Cushing Co's representative notified me that they must have heat in the building for the additional millwork which they will soon be installing.\n\nRather than lose time by further correspondence with distant Ottawa, I would respectfully suggest that you order a car of suitable coal at once, and Mr. Fraser, the caretaker, can fire one boiler and keep the building moderately heated. I think the doors and windows will soon respond to the heat, and work freely again.\n\nIt would not be difficult to apportion the amount of coal used previous to your occupancy of the school, and if the Department should deem this a fair charge, you might reasonably expect to be reimbursed. But the main consideration is to get heat into this building at the earliest possible date.\n\nBelieve me, dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\nInspector of Construction.\nSTPAUL ALTA SEPT 20\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENERAL DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS OTTAWA ONT\n\nPROPOSE LEAVING STPAUL FOR CALGARY ON THE TWENTY FOURTH UNLESS THE DEPARTMENT DESIRES TO UTILIZE MY SERVICES IN CONNECTION WITH PROPOSED NEW BARN KINDLY WIRE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nE GARDNER SMITH...\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nSept. 21, 1931.\n\nE.

Also, for installing the automatic starter and cut-out, which regulates the water-pressure at from 20 lbs to 40 lbs.\n\nThe Deputy-Inspector of the Fire Underwriters was also here, and he stated that in addition to the ordinary starting switch, we are required to have also a Magnetic Control Switch where a 5 HP motor is used, as prescribed in the Electric Code, the purpose of which is to act as a sort of \"shock absorber\", and save blowing out fuses when the pumping load is suddenly started, besides safeguarding the motor from damage under sudden strains. At first I demurred at this extra expense, but on being shown that it is required under the Ordinance, I consented to having it installed. This explains the last item of $25.00 on the bill. A few additional fuse plugs were also supplied where needed in the building, and for spares. I think all the other items are self-explanatory, and in order.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Construction.\nMORTIMER H. MARSHALL\nA.M. CAN.

Sept 9, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA.\n\nSir:\n\nRegarding the proposed new barn for this school, no doubt it will be the Department's wish that once the contract is let that the work be proceeded with as quickly as possible. The approaching advent of winter, and the fact that the school people cannot move their live stock here until the barn is completed, prompt me respectfully to make one or two suggestions with a view to expediting the barn work.\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of the 2nd instant, both for delivering water to the barn under pressure as a permanent service, and also for the work of construction, it would be advantageous to get the trench dug and the water line laid for the 300 odd feet necessary, before freezing weather. If so instructed by letter or telegram, I shall lay out this work and have the water pipes laid to the barn site, with the least possible delay, using local common labour for the digging and back-filling, and a plumber for a few hours to do the pipe fitting, and would order the pipe at once from Edmonton wholesale.\n\nAlthough the Department has notified me that my employment as Inspector will terminate on the 15th of this month, I shall wait here a few days longer in case the Department might decide that the construction of the barn should also be supervised.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nInspector of Construction.\n\"Tender for Horse & Cattle Stables, Blue Quill Indian School, Alberta.\"\n\nReceived 9 a.m.\n\nSept. 14, 1931.\n\nDuncan C.

It was not the first time that Mr Smith asked me about that, but I considered it was not to me to make expenses for in this connection. I suppose the Department has to take care of the building till we move into it. However, in visiting the school last Wednesday, I saw that some important damage would be the result of dampness, if there was no heat in the school, and considering that the Department would be obliged to make big expenses again on account of this damage, I then bought 10 tons of coal from the Province Elevator Co., and I had it hauled to the School. After this coal is all consumed, I will send you the bill in triplicate, that you may reimburse the amount of this coal.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nST.

Angin, Principal of the Blue Quills School, in which he states that he was requested by the Inspector of Construction, Mr. Gardner Smith, to buy some coal to heat the new school. He states he did not think he should spend any money in this way before moving into the building, but on visiting the school on September 16th he thought that some damage would be done owing to dampness, and he therefore bought ten tons of coal from the Province Elevator Company and had it hauled to the school. He says he will send in the account for payment. Mr. Gardner Smith evidently thought that the Principal would be responsible for this expenditure and would pay for it from his per capita grant, but I hardly think this would be fair as they have not yet moved into the school, but the Principal if he did not consider himself responsible should have asked for authority before making the purchase. The Province Elevator Company is not on our list.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 14, 1931.\n\nMR. PACET:\nMR.

S. G. I. A.\nFergus, Ont. Oct. 15, 1931\n\nMr. Orr,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nBooth Building,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nYou will, no doubt, remember the writer calling at your Office on Oct. 9th to inquire as to the successful tenders for the Stables at St. Paul's Indian School, in Alberta. You stated that the Minister had not returned the tender to your Department and, for that reason, you were not in a position to reveal the name of the successful Contractor.\n\nIn accordance with your suggestion, we are writing asking if you will please let us know the name of the successful Contractor, as soon as you are in a position to do so.\n\nWe thank the Department and yourself for past business and hope that we will have the pleasure of serving you again. The Stalls, you have specified, will give added comfort and long life. The Rapid Shift Aligning Device with Square Headrail, so that it cannot turn down, assist the stable man tremendously in keeping the cows clean. The Brass Sleeves on the Stall Partitions protect the Galvanizing and Steel from the manure acids and will add years to the life of the Equipment. These features cost very little more, at the time of purchasing, and are well worth the added investment, when the life of the Equipment is considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nBeatty Bros., Limited\n\nPer\n\nT.A.

This work was performed by the McDiarmid Co's plumbing sub-contractor, and when I received the bills I could not make the time charged agree with the entries in my diary made from day to day when the plumber was there. I have returned these bills for adjustment, and hope soon to have the corrected statement in order for transmission to the Department.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nE.

I do not have anything against admitting whoever Father Angin has given permission to visit it. But as it has been made clear to me that there is men in St. Paul waiting for my first break to make me lose my job. Therefore, wish to know if the authority of Father Angin to direct me as per rev. St. Paul is concerned, is acknowledged by your department.\n\nI remain your obedient servant,\n\nLeon Fraser\n| No. | Name     | Sept. | W | T | F | S | W | T | F | S | Total Time | Rate | Amount | Board | Med.

Oct. 20, 1931.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\nOTTAWA\n\nRe- New Blue Quills School, St. Paul, Alta.\n\nSir:\n\nPursuant to my letter of the 10th instant, I am now able to submit for payment the enclosed account of The J. McDiarmid Co., general contractors for this building, for installing a pressure reducing valve for delivering live steam to the washer in the Laundry, and for connecting the permanent pumping plant, recently installed, to the pneumatic storage tank. The total amount of said account is $275.16.\n\nIn the first rendering of this account the full charge of travelling time and expense was included, which was partly occasioned by sending the contractor's plumber from another job which the McDiarmid Co. were doing at Lethbridge. The contractors rightly thought it an advantage to send a man who had worked there before, and was consequently familiar with the layout at Blue Quills School; also while this man was there he had instructions to check up on all the plumbing throughout the building to see that everything was continuing to function thoroughly. Another reason for my delay in accepting this account was that the time on the job chargeable to the Department as rendered by the plumber seemed excessive as compared to my diary entries at the time the work was performed. However, the labour as first charged has been partly absorbed by the contractors.\n\nRegarding the plumber's travelling time and expense, after a good deal of discussion it was agreed that this item of $98.25 be split 50-50\u2014half charged to the Department and half to the contractors. This seemed a fair adjustment.\n\nIn addition to the work mentioned in the 1st paragraph of this letter, a pipe protection guard has been placed beside the large fly-wheel of the pumping plant; and a separate valved outlet from the pressure tank has been connected to the water line that will serve the combination barn; also a little minor work.\n\nI believe the account as now rendered is fair and just.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nE. Gardner Smith\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSacred-Heart.P.O.-Alta.\n\nOctober 2nd 1931.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you the invoices for coal supplied to the new Blue Quills School by the Province Elevator Co. I paid for this coal and I wish you reimburse me of the amount of $74.85, as stated by the invoices, plus $29.35 that I paid for hauling this coal from the station to the school, at $2.00 per ton.\n\nThis coal is nearly all burnt, and in a week or less, some other one will be needed. I can say that there is plenty of time before we move to burn yet 2 carloads of coal, as the Department is very slow in equipping the new school.\n\nThe building is in a rather bad state on account of dampness that has not yet been overcome by heat. Many doors and windows cannot be opened, and those that have been opened cannot be closed. The accordion doors that fit very well when fixed up by the contractor, are now 2 inches too long. You will know by this example if heat is needed in the new building.\n\nHowever, I will not trouble you any more with this question of coal. You have heard enough about it from Mr Gardner Smith and from me, and I will not buy coal any further by myself. If I did it till now, it is because I was nearly forced by Mr Gardner Smith who assured me that I would be reimbursed, and also, to prevent damages to the new building.\n\nI get you remember that a trench of about 300 feet has to be dug and pipe-line laid to convey the water to the barn from the school-system. I will say the same for the electric line that has to be fixed up from the school to the barn.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOctober 20, 1931.\n\nMR. ORR:\n\nWith reference to the construction of the new barn for the Blue Quills Residential School, Mr. H. S. Fraser, of St. Paul, is to be engaged as Inspector to supervise the construction. I think it was considered that two inspections a week would be sufficient, and remuneration was to be at the rate of $6.00 per day for two days a week.\n\nActing D. S. G. I.

It is desired to employ Mr. H.S. Fraser of St. Paul as inspector to supervise the construction. He is to devote two days a week to this work, either in the form of full days or half days and will be paid at the rate of six dollars per day; the voucher for his salary to be submitted by you in duplicate at the end of each month. It will also be necessary for him to submit a fortnightly report to the department on the progress of the work. Would you kindly convey these instructions to Mr. H.S.

The contractors are entitled to payments up to 90% of the value of the labour and material in the building at the time the certificate is issued.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, certificate forms.

There are several items, to which I would call your attention, namely, staining roof which is not called for, no ear troughing, six wooden posts in horse stable which look clumsy, in comparison with iron columns in cow Barn, also loudens, whose stable equipment we are using, suggest that we use their Cupolas Fig 1396 in their Catalogue instead of those shown on plan. We think they could be supplied at the same cost as those shown, and consider that with a horse on one and a cow on the other, would be an improvement. We also think Roof should be extended out over ear track at gable. If you consider any of these changes advisable kindly let us know as soon as possible.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRobert W. Rae\nF. J.

These works could have been condemned.\n\nYesterday, when I was making my first authorized inspection, the walls and beams were placed, up to the rafter plates, and also the first sheeting. The work is being considered building pretty well advanced, I have preferred not to suspend anything, as it would have exposed this institution to be without a stable for the coming winter.\n\nThe Foundation is of good enough quality, but the difference with the plan and specifications is in the dimensions and forms.\n\nI am positive it will resist the building.\n\nAs it is now impossible to alter or repair anything, there will have to be a reduction according to the difference with\nthe specifications.\n\nI think it would be very important to have a more careful watchfulness, as these gentlemen do not seem to be very familiar with the specifications.\n\nHaving been ordered to make the payments according with the Contract, I think it would be necessary that I should be made acquainted with the amount of said Contract.\n\nYours very truly\n\nH.C.

Specification of Carpenter or Wood Works on page 24 of the Specifications in connection with the \"BLUE QUILLS SCHOOL\" at St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nThe question to be decided is this: Has the Floor 7/8 X 6 inch Matched Spruce to be double, and the first or under floor to be placed diagonal? The contractor claims and argues with me that this floor is to be single, and placed at right angles with the joists, and the diagonal mentioned is only for the first 2 inch floor in the Horse Stallis.\n\nI think it is my duty to suggest to your Architect that the wooden posts should be changed to Steel posts, same as on the Cows' side. Should I take under my charge the works of connecting the water and Electricity from the Stable to the School House.\n\nThese three questions: Floor, Posts, and Connection should be answered by Telegram as soon as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nInspector,\nNIGHT LETTER\n\nCANADIAN NATIONAL TELEGRAPH COMPANY\n\nHEAD OFFICE, TORONTO, ONT.\n\nW.

Your telegram fourth instant; barn at Blue Quill's must be in exact accordance with specifications. Do not allow work to be proceeded with until defects are remedied. Take a personal interest in the matter and report.\"\n\nIn this connection, I might state that on receipt of your letter No.118-1-5 of the 27th and letter of the 28th ultimo, I wrote Mr.Fraser advising him of instructions contained therein and in order to avoid delay, I delivered my letter with certificate forms to Mr.Fraser personally on the 3rd instant, the date of receipt of the letters above referred to. During the course of a discussion on the construction of the barn, Mr. Fraser advised me that the foundation was not in accordance with specifications, a considerable saving in material and labor apparently having been made by the contractors in building the foundation.\n\nNot having had any official information as to plans and specifications, I was not in a position to check up on the work being done, but from information given by Mr.Fraser, I came to the conclusion that the contractors had made a considerable change in the plan of the foundation. The information received from Mr.Fraser was based on observations made during a visit to the school site two or three days previous to the date on which he received his appointment as supervisor. In view of this, I suggested that Mr.Fraser wire the Department immediately, advising as to the manner in which the work was being performed, with a request for instructions if he considered it necessary to condemn the work already done.\n\nUpon the receipt of your wire yesterday, I again went to St.Paul to see Mr. Fraser. He had just returned from an official visit to the Blue Quill's school site. Mr. Fraser informed me that he had looked over the work carefully.\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nand although he found that the foundation was not made according to specifications, he was satisfied that it would be suitable for the building. Mr. Fraser advised the contractors that while he did not wish to condemn the work done on the foundation, he would insist on a proper adjustment being made in connection with the saving effected in material and labor. I understand that the contractors agreed to this. The contractors had been at work for about fifteen days and the work had progressed so far that taking weather, etc., into consideration and being satisfied that the foundation, although not according to plan, would prove entirely satisfactory, Mr. Fraser stated that he did not feel that he would be justified in having the work condemned.\n\nThe carpenter work is being proceeded with and on looking this over yesterday, Mr. Fraser found it necessary to instruct the contractors to take up part of the flooring and to replace it with suitable material, diagonally, in accordance with specifications. I asked Mr. Fraser to submit by first mail a written report to the Department.\n\nIn view of the fact that considerable carpenter work can be performed by a crew of men in a day or two, Mr. Fraser intimated that two days per week is hardly sufficient for proper supervision and that more time spent in supervising the construction might avoid delays that might be caused in the event of it being found necessary to have changes made in work done in order to comply with specifications.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\nNov. 17, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd enclosing contract forms for the new barn at the Blue Quills School. It is necessary for me to return these to you as the party witnessing your signature has neglected to sign in the space provided. Kindly arrange to have this done.\n\nAny further correspondence in relation to your contract should be forwarded to the Department through Mr. H. S.

You might advise them that it is not the intention to make any changes. The only suggestion which can be favourably considered is that the roof be allowed to project over each end to cover the car tracks at gable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I beg to inform you that Mr U.I.Thibaudreau of St.Paul, Alberta has made an offer of $250.00 for the three white enamel baths and heating system. The heating system would include boiler, radiators, pipes and fittings.\n\nMr Gibault, Provincial school inspector, also mentioned that he might be able to use some of the desks in one of the schools in his district. No offer was made on these but during the course of the conversation on the subject, I gathered that he did not consider that the desks would be worth more than about $2.00 each.\n\nIf Mr.Thibaudreau's offer is accepted, he would move the heating plant as soon as the old school is vacated. I should be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.M.Hillion,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn Account with CALGARY POWER COMPANY, LTD.\n\na/c covering Blue Quills School at St. Paul for the month of October, 1931\n\nPresent reading - 0074\nPrevious \" 0050\n\nMultiplier - 40\nConsumption -- 40 x 24 -- 960 kilowatt hours\nLess consumption of service #29 --\nDemand - .150 x 40 -- 6 K.

Could you use this money for setting up the bread-mixer? I am in correspondence just now with the Pendrith Machinery Co., to know from them how to adjust this mixer so that it be operated directly from the motor, and they state that castiron base, shifting gears and bearings will be needed, at the price of $100.00 F.C.B.

I understand that the Principal has already made use of some of the out-buildings. It now remains for us to utilize the material of the main-building, and part of this might yet be of some use to the Principal of the new school; but we intend to utilize most of this old material, if worth-while, for other missions.\n\nAs the taking down of this building may take so much time, I hope that the Department will in no way interfere with us doing this work eventually, whenever convenient to us.\n\nI remain, Honorable Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nDecember 31, 1931.\n\nDear Father Langlois:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, with reference to the buildings on the old site of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. I consider these the property of both the Church and the Department. From time to time, we have given grants totalling approximately $10,000, for the buildings and mechanical plant. This suggests that any proceeds should be devoted, as far as possible, to the new school. I have already authorized the Indian Agent to dispose of the old plumbing fixtures and the old school desks and to have the proceeds given to the Reverend Principal, who shall expend them for shrubs, grass seed, levelling and road work at the front of the new school. An enquiry has been received from the hospital at St. Paul, concerning the old laundry machinery. I will have the Indian Agent follow this up and also ascertain if a market can be found for the old bake oven and for the electric fixtures that are not required in the new school. I am authorizing the Indian Agent to distribute the old beds among needy Indians of the reserve.\n\nAll other movable equipment of any value should be taken to the new school. Further, the materials in the outbuildings, some of which are fairly good, should be placed at the new school.\n\nVery Rev. U. Langlois, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Prov. House,\n9916 - 110th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nfor use there. They could be used by the Reverend Principal for repairing or for the erection of small outbuildings.\n\nAs far as the old main building is concerned, you may use the materials in any way for your other missions, unless there is some of it that Father Angin desires. I would suggest that you arrange for the demolition of the old building as soon as convenient. Several reasons suggest early action. I am sending copies of this letter to Mr. Indian Agent Gullion and to Father Angin, for their information.\n\nWith best wishes for the New Year,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nOttawa, December 31, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter to the Very Reverend Father Langlois. You will note that everything that is movable, that can be used at the new Blue Quills School shall be taken from the old site and that any proceeds from sales shall be accepted by yourself and devoted for beautifying the grounds, preparing roads, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nOttawa, December 31, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information and guidance, copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter to the Very Reverend Father Langleis. You will note that the proceeds from the plumbing fixtures, old school desks, bake oven, electric fixtures and laundry machinery, that are not required at the new school, shall be given to the Rev. Principal and that he will devote them to beautifying the grounds, preparing roads, etc. You are also authorized to distribute, without cost, the old beds among needy Indians of the reserve. The old main building is to be considered the property of the church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. E.

I guess this building has no more value than this amount, and then I ask you for the permission to sell it.\n\nAlready I have all the inside doors, cupboards, tables, benches, and in general all the material which would be of no use in the new school, to the Indians of Saddle-Lake, for hauling the material from the old school to the new one. Therefore, there is only the roof and the walls left in the old building.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Anzin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 11, 1932.\n\nVery Reverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to the Deputy Superintendent General's letter to you of the 31st ultimo, concerning the disposal of the buildings on the old site of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. Reverend Father Angin, the Principal, has written, announcing that he has received an offer of $200 for what is left of the old main building, and he recommends the sale. If you concur in this proposal, please let the Department know immediately, so that reply can be made to Father Angin.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T.

ANGIN, O.M.I.,\ndated January 4, 1932. Principal,\nBlue Quills Res. School.\n\nOriginal on 118-1-12.\n\nIn the main building, there is no place provided\nfor a dairy room. Even the house is ordinary too warm to\nkeep milk and to make butter. For that, I ask for a small\ndairy connected however with the main building.\n\nThe painting or oiling the cement floor throughout\nthe school is very needy. We are in a continuous manner in\nthe cement dust... I have got the recreation-room for girls\noiled with linseed oil, because it was impossible to the\ngirls to stay in this room. This has given good result till\nnow, but it would be very expensive to me to oil the floor\nthroughout the school.\n\nMain Building: Painting or oiling floor cement throughout.\n\nOutbuildings: 1 dairy-room connected with main building.\n1 piggery for 50 pigs and 8 sows.\n1 hen-house for 200 hens.\n1 implement shed.\n1 granary with 3 partitions for 3000\nbushels of grain.\n1 galvanized stock trough to water\noutside the cattle.\nOttawa, January 14, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 4th instant, I have to inform you that the Department has noted the difficulty you are having with the cement floors at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. This was expected and remedial measures will be taken next summer, after the building has been thoroughly dried out. You may bring this to the Department's attention again. I have noted that you require certain outbuildings, and I will initiate correspondence with you in this connection when it is determined what funds are available for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

It is, I consider my duty as Inspector, to tell you that this foundation was not at all up to specifications. In the first place the foundation is two inches narrower\u2014\nthinner than called for, and\nyour feet loosen, all round, which\nwould make a difference, in my\nestimation of at least $800.00.\n\nOther differences from specifications\nI mentioned in previous reports,\n\nYours very truly\n\nH.S.

Of course, the painting will be made early in spring, as now it is impossible to do this work. But I must draw your attention on several points concerning this barn:\n\n1) there is no electric lamp placed in the loft, the contractors stating that nothing was asked for in this connection in the specifications or plan of the barn. However, lamps are needed in the loft, and I wrote already to the Department that electric be placed there. I hope the Department will take this remark in consideration and will allow that 4 lamps be fixed up in the loft.\n\n2) on the plan were figured water bowls for horses in number of 9 to fit 13 horses, therefore 4 being missing. This must have been a mistake. The horses, coming back from work must not find water near them, or they will get sick. Instead of these water-bowls, the contractors have put oats-bowls, and they did well. But, these oats-bowls are not in sufficient number to fit the 13 horses. Therefore, I beg to ask you that 4 oats-bowls more be placed in the horses stalls, and I hope yet that this will be allowed by the Department.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos.

Scott\nDepartment Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to inquire as to what is holding back our money for the building of barn at Blue Quills Indian School, St. Paul, Alberta. It has been practically finished since Christmas, as they have been using it for their stock and feed since then. Mr. Fraser, your inspector, told us that he had written your department early in December, asking that we receive payment. He also said he was writing you on Jan 9th asking that we be paid all but $560.00 which he would hold back until painting is done. Now we still have a couple of large bills to pay for material used in barn, and trust that you will have a check forwarded to us at once, covering this balance, also that you will return my marked check which I sent in with tender, and on which I am already out five months interest, as $500.00 should be much more than enough, as a guarantee that painting will be done satisfactorily.\n\nIf you are having the roofs stained, which will have to be done if the barn is to appear as it should, we would like to submit a figure for the work, as we could do it while having the other painting done, and I think that we should be entitled to the first chance, as we have given you a good and well built barn.\n\nTrusting that we will receive a letter from you by return mail, with checks enclosed. I remain yours Truly,\n\nRobert M. Rae\nof Mr. Rae & Turner\n10244 - 113 St Edmonton Alberta\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul-Alte.\n\nJan.23rd 1932.\n\nTo the Honourable Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent Indian Affairs,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nI have the pleasure of the Secretary of the Department concerning my requisitions for the school this year, and he states that they cannot be filled up because they reached the Department too late. It is rather surprising you must have yet my general requisition I sent you last year on January 1931. It is the very same requisition I have made this year for barn and shop, and as to the buildings, the Department know what they give usually to the new schools, and what has been granted to Blue Quills School in this connection till now, with only the barn. As to the items needed for main building, they have been already asked for last year and several times. In fact, I had no need to make a new requisition this year, as it was provided for in my last year requisition. If I made it, it was to call in mind my first requisition.\n\nThe Secretary notes that complementary blankets, bedspreads, towels, etc., are not supplied by the Department. However, I must state these items have been supplied in other schools. If these things are to be supplied from the per capita grant, it is difficult to know when the grant will give enough to buy them. Actually I pay $350.00 per month, only for light and coal, and I doubt if I will finance the school long with a millage of 6s.\n\nAs to the fencing of the play-grounds for boys and girls, and the playground equipment, it must be supplied from the proceeds of the old school. However, you have stated, honourable Sir, that these proceeds be employed to embellish the front of the new school and to level the tram line and make road. I figure the proceeds will not be sufficient to make all this.\n\nNote also the complete equipment asked for barn cannot be supplied this year. You will find enclosed the list of items absolutely needed for this connection. However, I must state that no much work will be made this year on the land. I ask again for the 10 cows and the bull. From a long time, I am unable to supply pupils with milk and butter.\n\n7 wardrobes figure on my requisition. Last year, I was advised that the credit for Blue Quills School was very limited; therefore, I asked for wardrobes very needed that was very needed but the equipment in wardrobes is not complete, and 7 members of the staff have no wardrobe.\n\nHoping, honourable Sir, you will take my letter in consideration, I remain,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Ansir,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, January 30, 1932.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 23rd instant, concerning the needs at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. When future estimates are being prepared, your requests will be given consideration. You will receive separate letters concerning the fencing, the livestock and agricultural implements and classroom desks.\n\nYou may arrange for seven additional wardrobes, the same as already supplied. A properly certified account, in duplicate, should be forwarded in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev.

He claims that the steam from a one way pipe cannot be properly utilized and that a great deal of steam is wasted. It was also noted that no arrangements had been made to carry outdoors, the steam from the pop or safety valves on the boilers. When the steam blows off, the boiler room is filled with a dense cloud of vapor and there is always a certain amount of moisture from this. Suitable pipe should have been installed to carry this out of the building. Piping, which will answer the purpose at least temporarily, was being installed to take care of the escaping steam from the high pressure boiler.\n\nThe building is fairly well heated although I was informed that the fireman was having some difficulty in keeping up sufficient pressure and that three or four pounds was about the maximum pressure obtainable. I have since, however, discussed the boilers with Mr. Alexander, Boiler Inspector for this district, and he considered that four pounds pressure, if properly maintained, should be sufficient. One carload of coal is used in about three weeks and the cost of light and fuel so far, has been about $300.00 per month.\n\nThe Reverend Principal also informed me that owing to lack of tools, none of the boys have started training in the work-shop. I understand that a requisition for necessary tools has been submitted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nW. F. Sullivan\nIndian Agent.\nSir:\n\nI enclose for your information a report received from Mr. W. E. Gullion, Indian Agent at Saddle Lake, with reference to unsatisfactory structural arrangements at the Blue Quills Residential School. As this building was erected under direct instructions from Ottawa, the Department will no doubt know what steps to take to remedy the matters referred to therein.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham\nIndian Commissioner\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nApril 8, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer to your letter of the 5th of February addressed to Indian Commissioner Graham at Regina, with reference to the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nI note your remarks with reference to the one pipe system for the high pressure boiler for use in the laundry. Would you kindly advise me the approximate cost of making the changes recommended.\n\nRegarding the heating boilers, if this system is working properly it should not be necessary to have more than two or three pounds pressure on the boiler.\n\nI may say that owing to the very limited funds available this year it will only be possible to authorize work that is absolutely necessary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

When I returned Mr. J. H. Reive the plumbing and heating contractor for whom I was working sent in my time sheet to The McDiamond Co at Calgary who were the general contractors for payment. The amount on the time sheet was $114.85.\n\nAfter considerable trouble I received a cheque back for $50.00 and they said they thought that this was all they should pay.\n\nI have kept in touch with Mr. Reive who says he hasn't got anything to pay with himself but had instructed the McDiamond Co to pay it out of the price of the job on which I was working as it was an extra.\n\nI have been waiting patiently for them to get it settled but up until the present I have heard no more about it.\n\nI sent a letter to the McDiamond Co at Calgary about two weeks ago but they have ignored it up to now.\nI am in need of the money badly as I am a married man with a family, and it is my wages.

July and August.\n\nHoping you will take step in this connection, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, June 8, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the cement floors in the basement of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. The Department does not authorize the painting of these floors. The initial cost would be very high for a proper job and the painting would have to be renewed periodically in the playrooms and elsewhere, where the wear is great. At certain schools, oiling of the floors has been found the best solution. You might write to Reverend Father Poulet, O.M.I., Principal of the Muscowequan Indian Residential School, at Lestock, Sask., who will give you his experience in this connection. The Department will supply sufficient oil for one application and a sprayer for applying it. Future quantities of oil will have to be met from the per capita allowance or other earnings. The Department understands that the only firm that sells this oil and sprayer is the Shell Oil Company. You may make purchase and submit a properly certified account, in triplicate, in due course.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nDear Sir,\n\nAs we have now completed the work included in our contract\u2014Re building Cow and Horse barn at Blue Quills school, St Paul Alberta.\n\nAnd as you have by now no doubt received the report of your Inspector there.\n\nWe would much appreciate the receipt of the balance due us, together with my check which was deposited with tender.\n\nFormer checks have been sent to St Paul but as we live in Edmonton, kindly send remittance here and oblige. Yours Truly, Robert W. Rae.\n\nRae & Turner\nAddress: 10244 - 113th St\nEdmonton, Alberta\nJune 10, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Messrs. McRea and Turner, stating that they have completed all of their work for the building of the cow and horse barn at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, and asking that payment of the balance due them be made.\n\nThe last certificate received from you was on January 4th last for $1642.85. This leaves a balance due on their contract of $738.00. If this amount should be paid to the contractors will you kindly forward a fourth certificate for the amount due them, also please advise if they have satisfactorily completed their contract.\n\nI would be glad to have this information as soon as possible, as they are desirous of an early settlement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nH. S. Fraser, Esq.,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nSADDLE LAKE, ALBERTA.\n\nMay 30th, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school informs me that owing to dampness in the pit, the sewer motor has been damaged. The fuses have been burned and the electric wiring is out of service and the Reverend Principal considers that so long as the motor is left in the pit where it was installed, there will always be considerable trouble from moisture.\n\nThis might be avoided by having the motor placed on ground level. A small shed could be erected to protect the motor from the weather.\n\nThe Reverend Principal asks that the motor be repaired as soon as possible as he fears that the sewerage may return and overflow in the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

Scott\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nCanada\n\nRe Blue Quill Barn\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Contract given to Mr. McRea & Stewart in connection with said barn, is now completed, and since I had charge of the work, the whole thing was done according to specifications. Therefore the Contractors are entitled to their money.\n\nIn January last, I was asked by your Department for an idea as to a Drainage System for this Barn. I gave you a plan which I thought would be suitable for that\nplace, and I had a notion that it was accepted, but the suggestion was that it would be preferable, on account of severe weather, to wait until spring to do this work.\n\nI see that until now, nothing has yet been done.\n\nThe present condition causes lot of trouble to these people, as all the liquid and drainage stay in the centre of the stable, which is very inconvenient.\n\nPlease consider this matter at once, and if at all possible, kindly see that this drainage is done.\n\nHoping to hear from you in this connection at your earliest convenience,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. G. Moore\nInspector\nSt Paul, Alberta\nJune 17th 1932\n\nDeputy A.C. Scott Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nRe yours No 118-105\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith enclose Certificate No 4 in favour of Mrs McRea & Turner\u2014\nin connection with their contract\nof Blue Quill Barn at St Paul.\n\nThe work is now completed, but\nbefore paying that money, you may\nrefer to my letter of January 4th last,\nin which I explained to you how\nthe work was started at the time I\ntook charge as supervisor, and you\ncan judge by yourselves how to\nsettle with them.\nBesides, there should have been screen wire placed over the ventilator windows, which they did not place after having received order from me to do so, according to specifications. This would be a matter of about $20.00.\n\nI like to give you these details so that you will be able to judge how to settle with these gentlemen.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.S. Harvey\nInspector\nJuly 5, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th ultimo enclosing final certificate for payment to the contractors, McCrae and Turner, for work on the Blue Quills barn.\n\nReferring to your letter of the 4th of January last, you should make whatever deductions you think advisable and fair and these should be shown on the final certificate, as the Department will pay the amount of the certificate as recommended by you as Inspector of Construction.\n\nI am returning herewith the certificate you forwarded with your letter; also kindly forward the certificate in duplicate.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

School,\nSaint-Paul, Alta.\n\nJune 20th 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of June 8th, with reference to the cement floors, and I note that the Department cannot authorize the painting of same, but only their oiling.\n\nIn my letter, I mentioned that the cement floors should be painted or oiled throughout the building, vid. at every floor, and you write about the cement floors in the basement.\n\nThe floors are very dusty everywhere, which asks for oiling everywhere, except of course, in the boiler room, garage.\n\nCan I get oil for all the floors or only for the basement?\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul.Alta.\n\nJune 24th 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that I have received no money from the sold material of the old school. The bake oven, laundry machines, and heating system have been sold and delivered, but no money has come, which was intended to fence the play-grounds, place swings and see-saws in the play-grounds and embellish the front of the school.\n\nJust I read in the paper that Mr Thibodeau who bought the heating system for the sum of $250.00, is bankrupt.\n\nIf you cannot make anything in this connection, please, tell me and I will write to the Honourable Minister of the Interior, explaining him the facts.\n\nThe play-grounds should be fenced absolutely during the vacations as we have trouble to keep the boys without fence.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 7, 1932.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th ultimo, with reference to the oiling of the floors in the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. In this connection I have to say that as you were informed in official letter of the 5th ultimo, oiling of the floors has been found the best solution at other schools. The Department will supply a sprayer and sufficient oil for one application to each floor throughout the building. After the oil has been obtained, you should forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the oil and for the sprayer used in the work.\n\nI have also your letter of the 24th ultimo, informing the Department that Mr. Thibodeau, who bought the heating system which was in the old school building, is now bankrupt and that you have not received payment for same to the amount of $250. Would it not be possible to have this heating system returned? If not, you should put in a claim as a creditor. You should attend to this matter at once.\n\nRegarding the fencing of the playgrounds, please furnish an estimate of the cost, stating the type of fencing and quantity required, also what amount, if any, of the work in erecting the fence could be performed by the school staff and older boys. When we have this information, consideration will be given to authorizing the purchase of the fencing material required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Anglin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nSt Paul, Alberta\nJuly 18th 1932\n\nDuncan L Scott Esq\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nRe yours July 5th 118-1-5\n\nSir,\n\nReplying to the above, I would say that on my letter of January 4th last, I had given you an estimate of the amount of the difference in the cost of the work that was done before I took charge as Inspector, but in view that this contract was taken very low, in fact lower than the work could reasonably be done, I have decided that a\nDeduction of three hundred ($300.00) dollars would be a fair amount to adjust the matter, and I hope this will give you and every one concerned entire satisfaction.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH. H. [signature]\nInspector\n\nAct:\n\nPlease return signed receipt.\n\n[signature]\n\n[signature]\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul-Alta.\n\nJuly 21st 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAs it is question just now to help the Blue Quills School, I must draw your attention to this that the outbuildings are very wanted. In my last estimate, I asked for:\n\n- 1 granary,\n- 1 piggery\n- 1 hen house\n- 1 implement shed\n- 1 dairy.\n\nAs the funds are limited, I know you cannot give all this, but I would be pleased if you could grant some of these buildings. I must state that one granary should be built during next fall.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul-Alta.\n\nJuly 22nd 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference with your letter No 118-1-5th, concerning the oiling of the cement floors, I may say that the oil will be purchased the soonest possible and one coat only will be applied throughout the building, as stated by your letter, and the invoice forwarded to the Department as usual.\n\nRegarding the fencing of the playgrounds, I submit to you the material wanted with the price:\n\n| Item Description | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| 340 fencing posts of cedar, 7 ft high | at 0.15 each | $51.00 |\n| 190 rods of woven fencing, 48 in. high | at 0.83 p.rod | $157.70 |\n| 50 lbs of staples, 1 1/2 long | | $5.00 |\n| 3 roll spools barb wire, 4 points | | $12.00 |\n| 2 plain farm gates, steel wire, 14 ft long, 48 in. high | | $18.90 |\n\nTotal: $244.60\n\nAs fencing material, I have chosen heavy woven wire fence, usually suitable for farm, nothing else being found. However, I would be very pleased to get fox fencing which is used for the schools and playgrounds, but this last material is very expensive and would cost about $500.00 only for fencing our playgrounds. I dare not propose this expense to the Department, though this fence should be of better appearance, and not breakable.\n\nThe prices given above have been taken from Marshall-Wells' catalog.\n\nThe work will be performed by the staff of the school and started as soon as the material is received, even if the pupils have not come back.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul-Alta.\n\nJuly 21st 1932.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI wish to refer to this portion of your letter No 118-1-15, of July 7th, which states that the heating system of the old school, bought by Mr Thibodeau, now bankrupt, should be returned or a claim put in as creditor.\n\nIt seems very difficult to me to take any step in this connection. The heating system has been sold by Mr Indian Agent Gullion with the approval of Mr Inspector Hurison, and directly I have nothing to do in this affair. I know that Mr Gullion has met Mr Thibodeau lately, but I could not say what adjustment has been made.\n\nAnyway, Mr Thibodeau is unable to pay just now, and I would be grateful to you if you could fix up this matter with Mr Indian Agent Gullion.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Williams:\n\nContract of building Barn at Blue Quills Indian School.\n\nJohn F. Turner and Robert McRea of Edmonton were awarded the contract for the construction of a combined cow and horse barn at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School for $7,385.85.\n\nPayments to the amount of $6,642.85 have already been made, leaving a balance of $743.00 from which a deduction of $300.00 has been recommended by the Building Inspector owing to Specifications not having been followed in regard to the foundation.\n\nUnder date of January 4th last (closed file) the Inspector expressed the view that the deviation from specifications for the foundation \"Would make a difference of $800.00.\"\n\nFile has been passed to this office with final certificate calling for the payment of $443.00 and the return of security deposit cheque.\n\nMay I be informed if the Department approves of this action being taken in view of the conflicting reports received from the Inspector as to the amount that should be deducted from the contract price?\n\nRepresentative of the Treasury.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF REV. JOS. ANGIN,\nPRINCIPAL, BLUE QUILLS RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, ST.\nPAUL, ALTA., DATED AUGUST 26, 1932.\n\nOriginal on No. 118-1-14.\n\nThe pump is working very badly and I fear it breaks sometime. Mr. Indian Agent Gullion has been advised two months ago and I asked at this time that the pump be taken off and fixed up again. Would it be possible that the man who has settled down this pump come again to see about it.\n\nOur wheat is already cut and pretty soon it will be the turn of the oats to be cut and afterwards the threshing will take place. I get you remember that we have no granary and no other place to put our crop. Therefore a granary should be built very soon. I hope you will take steps in this connection.\nOttawa, September 1st, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School has drawn attention to the condition of the pump, which he states is working very badly. He advises that he has taken up this matter with you and requested that this pump be repaired and placed in good condition. Would it be possible to have the man who installed the pump repair same? In any event, you should make the necessary arrangements at the earliest possible date, to have this pump repaired and placed in a good serviceable condition. Please keep all expenses for the purpose as low as possible and, when the work has been completed to the satisfaction of the Principal and yourself, you should forward an account in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThe Principal has also directed the attention of the Department to the need of a granary. I regret that we will have no funds for the purpose. However, I should be pleased to have a report from you as to the size and type of building required and the approximate cost of same. You might discuss this matter with the Principal and furnish the information requested in order that it will be available when our Estimates are being prepared for the next fiscal year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\nInspector's\nCOMMISSIONER'S OFFICE,\nCalgary, Alta.,\nREGINA, SASK., August 24th, 1938.\n\nDear Mr. Williams:\n\nI have the honour to report that while inspecting the Saddle Lake Agency I also inspected the Blue Quills School which is run under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. At the time of my visit there were, of course, no children in residence.\n\nAs the Department are aware, the building was only completed a short time ago, and is therefore in a first class state of repair. I wish to point out, however, simply for the information of the Department, that I would hate to live in the building on account of the cement floors on the main floor. In all the other schools we have battleship linoleum in the halls, kitchen, &c., and some rugs in the different rooms. In this school the floors are bare in the halls, nor are there any rugs on any of the rooms,\u2014and the appearance of the cold, rough cement floor is certainly not inviting. A certain amount of dust always rises from the cement, which naturally collects on the furniture. The sisters and the Principal brought to my attention that they found walking around on this cement floor continually to be very hard on the feet; I can quite believe this.\n\nThe only out-building at the school is the barn, which is a very fine structure, except that there is no drain provided for from the gutters. To provide this would require a trench about 7 feet deep for a distance of about 150 feet.\n\nA. S. Williams, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThere is also a question of wiring the hay loft for electric light, providing for about four drops.\n\nThe Principal also brought to my attention the following requirements of the school:\n\n1 - Seed Drill, 20/ single disk - Not required until Spring.\n1 - Disk Harrow, 16 X 16 - \" \" \" \"\n1 - Brush Breaker - 16\" - \" \" \" \"\n1 - Spring-toothed harrow - 3 sec. - \" \" \" \"\n1 - Bob-sleigh, 2\u00bd\" steel shoe with box - Required this fall.\n6 - Horses - Not required until Spring.\n3 - Sets harness, not required until horses are furnished.\n\nA hog pen and hog pasture are also required. At the present time the school is raising 43 pigs which are housed in little shacks. No chickens are raised at the school as they have no chicken coop. A chicken house is required. At the present time they have seven cows of shorthorn breed. The Principal is asking for 10 more. He also asked for one bull. This is not required until Spring, and could be purchased at the same time as the bulls for the different agencies. An implement shed is also required. A granary should be built this fall, if possible, to provide storage space for the crop. One about 20 X 40 with 9-foot studs would be most suitable.\n\nThe pump and rods should be taken out of the well as they are having difficulty with their water supply, and as the man who drilled the well is living in the vicinity, it would be necessary for him to set his machine over the well to clean it out. This is absolutely necessary.\n\nThe Principal is also asking for an expenditure of about $250.00 to fix up the playgrounds and fence them, &c. The sewer and septic tank need some attention. It would, however, be necessary to get someone who is experienced in that line to check this matter over. I do not think there is anyone in that vicinity who could do this.\n\nThis year the school has in crop 20 acres of wheat.\n40 of oats and 30 of green feed; 90 acres in all. Six acres of potatoes and a splendid garden have been raised. The crop looked exceptionally good.\n\nThe staff consists of the Rev. Fr. J. Ansin, as Principal; Rev. Fr. A. Wattelle, Assistant Principal; H. Lord Engineer; Alphonse Lord, Farmer; T. H. M. Tuck, Disciplinarian; J. L. Henry, Labourer, and ten Sisters of Charity.\n\nThere were 81 children on the register, and three were discharged, leaving 78. The Principal will have to do considerable recruiting.\n\nConsiderable work has been done by the Principal and Staff in fixing up the grounds, but there is a great deal more to be done here. The grounds behind the school are not level, and it will certainly require a lot of work to put them in shape, and, as the Principal stated, it will be two or three years before a real showing can be made there. One thing I did not like about the location of the school is that it is hidden from the view of the main road by the brush, and anyone driving past would not know there were any buildings there. I think that in approaching from the west there is only one place on the road where you can see a corner of the school. Of course, this is of little importance.\n\nAs far as I could determine during my stay at that school, the management of the institution seems to be good. However, when the children are all there next winter and the school is in operation I shall make a further visit and inspect the class-rooms, &c.\n\nI am aware that the Department have not the funds at the present time to meet all the requirements of this institution, in the way of equipment and buildings, but I thought it well to bring them to the attention of the Department in this report as no doubt, sooner or later, these things will have to be supplied, as no institution can be successfully run unless it is properly equipped.\nWhile I am on the subject of schools: In my rounds of the reserves and at meetings held with each band, the matter of day schools was brought to my attention, and all bands seemed to be very anxious to have day school established on the reserve, and evidently there has been considerable outside influence in the matter, advising the Indians that they could demand day schools on reserves where there is no school. I advised every band that the matter of a day school was absolutely a dead issue as far as my recommendation went, as the Department had built the Blue Quills School for the purpose of taking care of all Catholic children in the Saddle Lake Agency and the Edmonton School had been built for taking care of all Protestant children in those agencies.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

After enquiry, this last firm has not been reached, neither in Ottawa nor in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Vancouver. So, I have asked the Dustbane Co to see if they could find oil for these cement floors and they have highly recommended their D.B.Lacol, which they say to have been used in many Indian schools, and I bought sufficient oil to cover the floors one coat.\n\nInstead of sprayer which is not in use with this oil, I have ordered two brushes.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev.

Mr. Frederickson has apparently had some trouble with the rig and this has been the cause of the delay. The work at the school shall, however, be attended to at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.E.

This is able to astonish you, but you have the plan, it is easy to you to reckon the square area to be oiled.\n\nTruly yours,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal\nDr. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nO T T A W A.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nRe Barn at Blue Quills Indian School - St. Paul de Metis.\n\nThis is the matter which I mentioned to you at lunch yesterday.\n\nThe contractors complain about the deduction of the sum of $300.00 from their contract price.\n\nThe facts appear to be:\n\n1. Their tender was $1500.00 lower than the next.\n\n2. The work and material they put into the barn was, they claim, particularly good. You will find a letter from them to the Department under date October 20th.\n\n3. The delay in finally giving the tender and allowing the work to be started was so great that they were on the edge of winter before they could commence and lost four weeks of good weather, having to do the bulk of the work in hard winter weather, which required the installation of heating equipment and the cost of fuel supplies for heating for the inside cement work.\n\n4. After the work was all done and approved and\nDr. McGill,\n\naccepted they were kept out of their money, even out of their deposit, for months and I had to write from Edmonton on their behalf, urging expedition in the payment.\n\n5. The inspector appointed to represent the Government was himself a man who had tendered on the job and been disappointed. The wisdom and fairness of this is, to my mind, questionable. To put a defeated rival to pass and report on the work of his successful rival.\n\nWould you look into the matter at your convenience, and in doing so it might clarify matters if we had the following details:\n\n1. Date of calling for tenders.\n2. Date of reception of tenders.\n3. Date of the acceptance of the successful tender.\n4. Date of the authorization by the Government of the commencement of work.\n5. Date of the completion of the work other than the painting, which was left till the spring.\n6. Date of completion of the painting and final completion of the work.\n7. Date of the payment of balance due.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. U. G. Bury, M.P.\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\nNov. 5, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Bury,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the contract for the building of a barn at the Blue Mills Indian Residential School, and have pleasure in giving you the following information.\n\nWith reference to the contractors' complaint about the deduction of $500.00 from their contract price, I beg to say that the Inspector of Construction reported to the Department that the foundation of the barn was not built according to the specifications, it being 6\" narrower and 4\" lower than shown on the plans, which made a difference in his estimate of $500.00 in the cost of the work. Before, however, the final certificate could be paid it was necessary to correspond with the Inspector, and when issuing the final certificate he recommended a deduction of $500.00 in view of the fact that the contract had been taken at a low figure, and that the balance of the work had been satisfactorily performed. This is the amount that was deducted from their contract price.\n\nYou state that their tender was $1,500.00 lower than the next tender. This is not correct, as there was a difference of $12.65 between their tender and the next lowest.\n\nThe tenders for this barn were invited on August 26th, receivable by the Department on September 14th. A Memorandum was forwarded to Council on September 21st, which was passed awarding the contract on October 15th, and the contractors were advised that their tender was accepted on October 16th.\n\nOn March 7th the Inspector advised the Department that from all information obtainable the contractors had paid their accounts, and recommended payment of the balance of their contract, holding back $500.00 for the painting which would have to be left until the spring. This was paid.\n\nA letter dated May 31st from the contractors advised the Department that they had completed the painting of the barn and\nthe Inspector was written to and instructed to issue a certificate for the final payment on their contract, and also to advise whether the contract had been satisfactorily completed.\n\nA letter dated June 6th from the Inspector advised that the contract was completed, but the certificate was not properly made out and it was necessary to have same returned and adjustments made before final payment could be made. This final payment, amounting to $445.00 was made to the contractors on September 30th.\n\nI trust that this will give you the information required.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. U. G.

INDIAN SCHOOL,\nSt.Paul de Metis, Alberta,\nby\nP.A.Fetterly,\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nCalgary, Alta., Nov.8,1932.\nFile 4811.\n\nREPORT\n\non\n\nSEPTIC TANK AND BARN DRAINAGE SYSTEM\n\nat\n\nBlue Quills (R.C.) Indian School,\n\nSt. Paul de Metis, Alberta,\n\nby P.A. Petterly, B.Sc.A.M.E.I.C.\n\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nI. Purpose of Report.\n\nA letter dated September 21, 1932, was received from the Director instructing an officer of this Branch to investigate complaints received by the Indian Department from the Principal on two matters, viz:\n\n(1) Septic tank for disposal of the sewage from the school was not working properly.\n\n(2) Proper drainage facilities should be supplied in connection with the barn.\n\nThis inspection was made by the writer on October 31 and November 1.\n\nII. Results of Inspection of Septic Tank.\n\nThe tank is situated about 30 feet west of the girl's entrance, which is on the west side of the school. The details of construction are shown on the accompanying blue prints.\n\nIt was found that the tank is not operating as a septic tank but merely as storage for raw sewage from the school. An accumulation of most of the summer sewage must be present. The lumber door in the floor of the motor\nchamber was opened for an instant and it was found that the whole chamber is filled with raw sewage to within a few inches of the floor. This means that the whole bottom of the septic tank, including the baffle chamber is filled with sewage to a point an inch or more above the notch between the tanks.\n\nThe lumber trap door, about 6' x 3\u00bd', is waterlogged, offensively damp, and does not now fit tightly because of its damp condition.\n\nThe chamber containing the motor and switch mechanisms is damp, including the walls. The switches are short-circuited and rusted through dampness. Many \"false currents\" occur all over the machinery.\n\nThe motor itself has partially rotted because of the damp atmosphere which of course is saturated with hydrogen sulphide and other gasses. The motor had been removed from the chamber for a considerable time as it was found to be useless, at least temporarily. It has not been in use since April. Everything in the motor chamber is wet and rusted. The wires are rotten and \"false currents\" are caused by the damp air and by disappearance of insulation. The school engineer thinks that the float for activating the switch is too small. The writer did not see the float as it is buried in sewage.\n\nIt is to be noted that the motor chamber is half-planked instead of being made of concrete. This is evidently for the purpose of providing ingress to the\nmoving parts in the pump chamber.\n\nThere is apparently very little bacterial action in the tank.\n\nThe overflow sewage - of course untreated, and apparently consisting only of the flushing water - flows from the end of the sewer 820 feet to the southwest. This escapes from the tank by means of the overflow opening in the upper side of the sewer pipe which extends into the pump chamber. The flow into the sewer pipe was designed to be intermittent.\n\nThe end of the sewer line consists of about 55 feet of lumber conduit 10\" square. The end is two feet off the ground and is not protected from frost. However, the flow has not yet been interrupted by formation of ice and functions well during the winter.\n\nThe odour in the general vicinity of the tank is very strong and is a constant source of danger even in the present cold weather. In warm weather it must have been very bad and dangerous.\n\nIII. Necessary Improvements to Septic Tank.\n\nThe trouble is evidently caused by an excess of moisture in the motor chamber, which tends to rot all susceptible material therein. All of this moisture apparently comes from the trap door. Several remedies may be considered, as follows:\n\n(1) Make a hermetically sealed entrance to the lower chamber instead of the trap door. This would need to contain a manhole for ingress.\n\n(2) Cause a circulation of air in the motor\nchamber by making a hole in the concrete wall near the bottom of the motor chamber and connecting this with a pipe and grating on the surface of the ground immediately to the west of the tank. Then make a hole in the opposite side near the surface of the ground and connect this with a pipe running eastward to the wall of the building and up to the roof. This would cause a circulation of air and a draft to draw off the moist air in the chamber.\n\n(3) Build a lumber house say 9' by 9' by 7' high over the chamber. Install the motor switches and float mechanism in this house by lengthening the rods. The motor and switch should be repaired before installation.\n\nThis latter proposal is favoured by the writer as it makes a permanent and a sure repair, as in his opinion the mechanism should be removed from the dampness.\n\nA visit was made to the Hospital in the town of St. Paul three miles away where a similar septic tank has been in use for a considerable time. The mechanism is similar but the motor is installed in a small house over the tank. They never have any trouble except that the hospital engineer has to mechanically trip the switch as the float is apparently too small. This tank never gives them any trouble. It was noted that the discharge pipe at the Hospital which is at least 3\" in diameter comes up into the surface house. The pipe at the School is about 1/2\" in diameter and extends about one foot above the floor of the motor chamber. No way could be found for ingress into the hospital tank. It appears to be entirely closed. How\nrepairs are made to the under part is not known. The cost of the house, repair of motor, extension of the rods and installation of the motor and switches should not exceed $300 and may amount to a less sum. A small chimney should be constructed for installation of a stove if found necessary.\n\nIV. Barn Drainage System\n\nThe sewage from the barn, that is from the troughs behind the horses and cattle, is collected by means of conduits into a sump just outside the small door at the east side of the barn.\n\nThis sump is about 5 feet deep by 2 feet square. This hole becomes full of both solids and liquids and has to be dipped out as it will not seep very readily through the surrounding soil, as was originally intended. The soil consists of clay, which explains the difficulty. Here again, two methods may be used.\n\n(1) Lay tile from the sump north-eastward to the water course 3 or 4 feet below.\n\n(2) Deepen the sump to say, eight feet, and at about the frost line - 6 feet - lay 3 or 4 lines of porous tile in several directions for a distance of fifteen feet. The lower portion would collect solids. The latter would appear to be the better method as a larger seepage area would be created. The fact that the sub-soil consists of clay cannot be ignored. This\nmethod would only increase the seepage area,\nbut the construction of a drain over 100 feet\nlong to the north-east would be difficult because\nof the paucity of disposal grade and changes of\nwater elevation in the water course.\n\nV. Heating System.\n\nThis matter was not mentioned in the letter\nfrom the Indian Department but the Principal, Father Angin,\nbrought it to the writer's notice requesting that it might\nbe mentioned in this report.\n\nIn short, the extreme ends of the building -\neast and west - in which are situated the class rooms and\ndormitories - do not heat properly although the centre of\nthe building is too hot. The Sisters and pupils complain\nof the cold even at this early date.\n\nAlthough cold weather is not yet in evidence\nboth boilers are now (November 1) being used. During very\ncold weather two carloads of coal, or two tons per day,\nare burned. Even the extremities of the building are too\ncold for comfort.\n\nIn the first place, Father Angin considers\nthe firebox too small. He also thinks that the pipes are\nimproperly connected. As an instance of this he states that\nthe Kelvinator was joined to the hot water pipes instead\nof the cold water pipes. This was corrected by the Kelvinator\nman after investigation. He thinks that they (presumably\nthe contractor) may have made other mistakes. He states that\nthe \"blow-off\" of the boilers had also to be corrected.\n\nHe states that the heating system has not given satisfaction on the whole. It has been badly connected, according to him.\n\nThe writer, not being an expert in heating systems, did not inspect this trouble but merely states what was told him by the Principal.\n\nVI. Conclusions.\n\nThis report is prepared immediately in order that early consideration may be given to the condition of the septic tank as repairs are urgently needed.\n\nThe writer will find it necessary within two or three weeks to visit Onion Lake Anglican School where a water-supply installation is being made. If authority be given by the Indian Department to build the house and repair the motors at an early date the two activities could be carried on at the same time, thus saving expense. The improvements to the septic tank should be made immediately as they are a constant source of danger due to the large accumulation of raw sewage in all of the chambers. It is useless to simply repair the motor and replace it in the chamber as it would again deteriorate within 8 days - a space of time mentioned by the school engineer.\n\nThe request was made in the letter from the Indian Department that, if possible, the question of barn drainage be postponed until Spring. The matter can be postponed as it is not so urgent as the improvement of the septic tank.\nI have received your letter of the 14th instant with reference to drainage at the Blue Quills Indian Reserve School and enclose herewith a report on the same, which has just been received from our Engineer at Calgary. The last page of this report as received, was not quite correct and it has been sent back to be corrected, but the report as now submitted will give the information desired, and the missing page will be supplied when it is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 17, 1923\n\nMemoirs\n\nMr. Bushard,\n\nReferring to memorandum of the 1st of September requesting the drainage work at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I beg to say that a report has been received from the Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Calgary, and the following is the information submitted in their report.\n\nPlans and specifications for the sewage disposal system for the Blue Quills School were prepared in 1920 by the Calgary Office of the Dominion Water Power Branch and the work was carried out under their supervision. The Engineer reports that he found the septic tank was not operating as a septic tank but merely as a storage of raw sewage caused by an excessive amount of ammonia in the chamber containing the motor and switches which are required to operate the pump which discharges the sewage from the tank.\n\nIn order to remedy this condition it will be necessary to provide additional ventilation inside the tank and to construct a small building 8 x 8 x 7 over the top of the tank in which to install the motor and switches. These, of course, will have to be repaired before installation. The estimated cost of these alterations and repairs will be approximately $500.00, and I would recommend that the Water Power Branch be instructed to proceed at once with this work, as at the present time the sewage disposal system is a constant source of danger to the health of the occupants of the school.\n\nWith reference to the drainage for the barn, at the present time this is taken care of by a sump 6 feet deep by 8 feet square. This was installed at the time the barn was erected as a temporary arrangement. In order to make a permanent job it will be necessary to either install a drain to the water course or provide a larger sump. The Engineer who investigated states that the barn drainage can be postponed until next year as the work is not as urgent as the improvements to the septic tank.\n\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nNovember 17, 1932.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nReferring to memorandum of the 21st of September regarding the drainage work at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I beg to say that a report has been received from the Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Calgary, and the following is the information submitted in their report.\n\nPlans and specifications for the sewage disposal system for the Blue Quills School were prepared in 1920 by the Calgary Office of the Dominion Water Power Branch and the work was carried out under their supervision.

Gurney Orr,\nArchitect,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Orr:\n\nI checked over the heating plant at the Blue Quills school at St. Paul while Mr. Gardner-Smith was on the job and the changes to be made were listed and he saw that they were carried out. Our main trouble on the job was the priming in the boilers caused by the alkali water. We had to haul water from a small lake to overcome this difficulty.\n\nThis heating system, using a return trap, will require a little pressure to heat the ends of the mains but now that you have electrical power at this school it might pay you to install a vacuum pump, trap the ends of the mains through float traps and change the existing wet return into a dry return. This would give better circulation and cut down the fuel bills.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC.A.DUNHAM COMPANY, Limited,\nCalgary Branch Sales Office.\n\nA.Walker, Mgr.\nOttawa,\nDec. 9, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Walker,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo and note that you checked over the heating plant at the Blue Quills School. I also note your remarks with reference to the installation of a vacuum pump. I quite understand that the installing of a vacuum pump would give better circulation but I do not see why the system as now installed should not give better results than they are obtaining. We have the identical system in other schools of the same size as the Blue Quills and they are having no trouble in heating the building to a uniform temperature.\n\nI will be glad if you will, at the first opportunity, take a look over this plant, as I am sure there must be some other cause for the poor circulation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith, a letter from Rev'd J. Angin, Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school, in which he asks for the sum of $25.00 to cover damage caused by a fire started in the school by one of the pupils.\n\nI might state that on being advised that one of the pupils, Mary Castor, had endeavored to start a fire in the building, I called at the school and was informed by the Reverend Principal that some twenty garments, mostly dresses, had been destroyed. Mary Castor who is 12 years of age, had evidently started the fire in the cloak room. The dresses which I was advised were mostly new ones, caught fire and most of them were damaged beyond repair before the fire was extinguished. The wall on the east side of the room was somewhat discolored and the moulding was slightly burned. Fortunately, no further damage was done. The girl had been questioned and admitted her guilt before the Principal and staff.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H. Bullion\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 14, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a communication from the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. It is noted that he requests to be reimbursed to the extent of $25, to cover damage to clothing, caused by a fire started by one of the girl pupils.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department cannot consider making reimbursement. You have not stated what action was taken in the case of Mary Caster, the pupil who set the fire. The Principal and staff should make every effort to see that she does not incur further damage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. E.

E. Gullion, Indian Agent, I proceeded with my well drilling outfit to the Blue Quills Indian School for the purpose of investigating the accumulation of sand in the water well at the School. I took the pump out and removed the sand from inside the casing and then reset the pump. I found 41 feet of sand in the casing which I removed. The well is now to its original footage, namely, 327 feet. It is possible that this well will now overcome the difficulty with the sand, but I cannot guarantee this.\n\nI would recommend that your Department place another set of casing in the well with a sand screen attached. This would, I believe, permanently overcome the difficulty, and as my complete outfit is now at the well, the casing could be installed far more cheaply now than in the future. Moreover I believe that all future trouble with sand would be eliminated. I can supply 5\" casing F. O. B. St. Paul at 85\u00a2 per ft.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nf. E.

As the school well was giving some trouble, I again went to see Mr. Frederickson on the 26th September and as he had not completed the job on which he was then working, I arranged for him to come to the school on the 3rd October in order that the well at the school could be checked up and the pump placed in a condition that it could be used temporarily. Temporary repairs were accordingly made at that time. Mr. Frederickson moved his well drilling outfit to the school on the 2nd November and proceeded with work on the well. He reported finding 41 feet of sand in the well. After giving the well a thorough cleaning out, the pump was replaced and the well was tested. The test being found unsatisfactory, he was instructed to again take out the pump. It was then found that the wall of the cylinder was very badly worn, no doubt owing to friction caused by sand. I therefore arranged for a new cylinder and two pipe rods as it was considered advisable to put in another length of pipe. Mr. Frederickson then put some gravel in the well, considering that it might to a certain extent, prevent the sand from coming up. I asked Mr. Frederickson to again test the well and to make careful observations in order that he could furnish a report on his findings. I am submitting his report herewith. You will note that he recommends another casing with sand screen attached. I understand that a sand screen would cost about $120.00 and the cost of casing and screen would therefore be approximately $396.00. The well has been giving considerable trouble and it is not considered that the gravel put in will overcome the difficulty permanently. A limited quantity only can be used as it is feared that the flow of water may be interfered with.\n\nMr. Frederickson still has the well under observation and it is hoped that no further trouble will be experienced for a time, at least.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nSECRETARY DEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA ONT\n\nREFERENCE MY LETTER NINTH INST REGARDING WELL AT BLUEQUILL SCHOOL\n\nAM ADVISED THAT THIS WELL NOW GIVING INSUFFICIENT WATER SUPPLY STOP\n\nUNABLE TO STATE CAUSE BUT FLOW APPARENTLY IRREGULAR STOP HARD WATER BEING USED AT PRESENT NOT SUITABLE FOR CONTINUOUS USE IN BOILERS STOP\n\nSHOULD DEPTH BE FURTHER EXTENDED OR NEW WELL DRILLED\n\nW E GULLION.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThis is a Collect message, and will be charged to your account.

McGill.\n\nChg. - Dept. I. A.\nSir:-\n\nI beg to confirm my telegram of today's date as follows:\n\n\"Referring to my letter ninth instant regarding well at Blue Quill's School advised that this well now giving insufficient water supply. Unable to state cause but flow apparently irregular. Hard water being used at present not suitable for continuous use in boilers. Should depth be extended or new well drilled?\"\n\nIn connection with this, I might state that on being advised on the 17th instant that the well was again giving unsatisfactory service, I called at the school in the evening of the same date. The Reverend Principal advised me that the supply of water from the well was insufficient to meet their requirements. Water from the shallow well is being used occasionally but this is hard water and not suitable for use in the boilers and pipes for any length of time. Everything possible has been done to remedy the trouble at the school well and although it was considered that it was in good order when Mr. Frederickson completed and tested the well, there has been a recurrence of the same trouble as was previously experienced. The Principal suggested that the depth might be extended to the 460 ft. level where another vein might be tapped but there is considerable uncertainty as to whether this would prove satisfactory as sand and mud was found at this level in the first well drilled at the school. It is also possible that the lower part of the casing in the well was considerably damaged by the drill during the drilling and cleaning out which was done. Should the depth be extended, it would be necessary to put in a five inch casing and if the six inch casing in the well is damaged to any extent near the bottom, it is doubtful if the space would permit the use of five inch casing. The driller is still of the opinion that the 327 ft. level would prove the most satisfactory if a sand screen were used, but he is somewhat doubtful as to whether this could be done in the well now being used.\n\nI should be glad to have your advice and instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Report later.\"\n\nThis is in answer to your wire of the 21st inst. I requested Rev. Jos. Anglin, the Principal to send samples of the two wells to the University of Alberta, Edmonton, for analysis, as a preliminary action to assist in providing full information.\n\nI also sent a letter to W.E. Gullion, Indian Agent of Saddle Lake Agency, for information. I am aware of the fact that he had a driller at the well two weeks ago studying the matter.\n\nMr. E. Gardner-Smith, the Building Inspector, who had charge of construction, has certain information regarding the well. He is, however, out of town, and will be home on Friday. I wish to obtain from him the address of J.E. Fredrickson, the driller of the well. Mr. Fredrickson has an excellent reputation.\n\nI also wish to ascertain the character of the casing, point and strainer; also the log of the well. This information is not on our file.\n\nI believe that it would be useless to send Mr. Fetterly to simply view the surface conditions until the above information is obtained.\n\nMy present opinion is that a portion at least of the trouble is caused by very fine sand clogging the casing but Mr. Fetterly will proceed to the well as soon as he has obtained all the information possible. I will write you as soon as the information is in hand, and before proceeding to the well.\n\nMeanwhile Mr. Fetterly must visit the School very shortly to inspect the house over the Septic tank which should be completed within a few days.\n\nThe water supply system at St. Barnabas Indian School, Onion Lake (File 4617) should also be completed shortly. Mr. Fetterly hopes to inspect the well and Septic tank at Blue Quills and the Onion Lake School on the same trip.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H.

Both men were in St. Paul and had just come from the School.\n\nI ascertained that they succeeded in obtaining a good flow of clear water yesterday. The flow may only be temporary but they think that nothing more need be done in the immediate present.\n\nI had already requested Father Angin by wire to send samples of water from the two wells to the University of Alberta at Edmonton for analysis in order to ascertain the nature of the salts and whether the water needs softening. This is a preliminary and necessary step. Mr. Gullion stated that this was being done.\n\nMr. Fredrickson said that he would not recommend deepening the present well.\n\nHowever it will apparently be quite safe to allow the matter to remain in abeyance until Mr. Fetterly proceeds to St. Paul for inspection of the Septic tank house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Hoover, the Engineer in Charge of our Calgary office, from which it will be noted that Mr. Gullion, the Indian Agent, and Mr. Fredrickson, who drilled the deep well, have been at the school and have succeeded in obtaining a good flow of clear water and that they think nothing more needs to be done at the present moment.

I must state that I received your telegram and immediately, I sent to the University of Alberta for containers, thinking that the samples required for analysis should be examined for bacterial germs. As you want only to know about the hardness of water, I will try to send today 2 samples in glass containers.\n\nHowever, Mr. Gardner-Smith who was present at school when the 2 wells were built, can tell you about this information you require.\n\nMr. Fredrickson has built the deep well, this one we used till now, 327 feet deep, supplying soft water, but not giving sufficient quantity for the need of the school. However, I may state that we were satisfied with this well because we shared the water in the different departments of the house by special days.\n\nWhen Mr. Fredrickson has drilled this well, he has put in the bottom 3 feet of gravel to hinder sand and mud to rush up. Lately, 7 weeks ago he was required to clean the well but he drilled these 3 feet of gravel so that the water was filled with sand and mud, being nearly black. After 2 other days, he was obliged to put back gravel and stone about 10 feet deep, but he stopped the vein of the water in doing so. Finally he removed the gravel and stones and now we have water again, but black as at the first time, full of sand and mud. Mr. Fredrickson has worked here since 7 weeks and his outfit is yet on the spot. He suggests that a new well be built, 10 or 20 feet from the deep well, but before imposing upon the Department of Indian Affairs such expense, I think there is something to be done to save this well we have.\n\nI will suggest myself that a new casing 20 ft. long at the bottom, be put, as it is possible that the drill has broken this casing at the bottom. After this, a very fine screen should be placed, to stop the mud and sand. With these, I guess the well should be in good condition.\n\nI think that Mr. Fredrickson is not expert enough in this job, and an experienced driller should be required to examine the conditions of the deep well.\n\nAs to the shallow well, 90 feet deep, I must say that the water is very hard and even prejudicial to the health of the pupils. We have used this well when the deep well did not give sufficient quantity of water, and since 7 weeks we were obliged to take water from it.\n\nThe casings of the 2 wells have 6 inches in diameter.\n\nThe house over the septic tank is finished and the motor\nOffice of Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alberta.\nDecember 23rd, 1932.\n\nAttention Mr. Fetterley\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation of yesterday's date in connection with the water supply at the Blue Quills Indian School, I beg to enclose herewith copies of reports on tests made in the Provincial Laboratory, University of Alberta. One of the reports covers the deep well (461 ft. level) and the shallow well. Of these two, water from the shallow well only has been used.\n\nThe second report dated April 16th, 1931, covers the well (327 ft. level) being used at present. The water in this well appears to be good but sand has been giving considerable trouble. The driller, Mr. Frederickson, has spent considerable time on this and at present, it is giving fairly satisfactory service but it is difficult to say how long this will continue. The Principal informs me that there has not been sufficient water to permit of using it for flushing purposes throughout the school. The water from the shallow well which has been used from time to time, is very hard and it is feared that the plumbing and flues in the boilers will become damaged eventually from continued use of this. The Reverend Principal is to submit further samples of water for testing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(SD) W.E.Gullion.\nIndian Agent.\n\nO.H.Hoover, Esq.,\nEngineer in Charge,\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service,\nCalgary, Alta.\nCOPY\n\nProvincial Laboratory\nUniversity of Alberta\n\nEdmonton, April 16, 1931.\n\nJ.E.

The flow appeared to be irregular at times and Mr Fredericksen the driller, spent a good deal of extra time trying to correct this. Immediately after advising the Department I was in touch with Mr. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power and Reclamation service, Calgary and I submitted copies of reports covering results of bacteriological and chemical analyses of samples of water from the three wells at the school. The reports covering these tests were dated October 1st 1930, and April 16th 1931. The Principal was however, forwarding samples of the water for a further test.\n\nW. E.

Indian School - St. Paul, Alberta\n\nby\n\nP.A. Fetterly, B.Sc., A.M.E., I.C.\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nI. Purpose of Report.\n\nThis report is prepared with further reference to a report dated Nov. 8, 1932, regarding the condition of the Septic Tank and also to a telegram received from Ottawa on Dec. 21, 1932, regarding the condition of the wells. The writer visited the location on January 13 and 14.\n\nII. Septic Tank.\n\nA cheque for $300 was received from the Indian Department on 9th ultimo for the purpose of erecting a building 9' x 9' x 7' over the tank and for repairing and changing the location of the motor from the underground concrete chamber to the house provided for it.\n\nH.S. Fraser, of St. Paul, Alta., was entrusted with the construction of the house and I.H. Galloway with the installation of the motor and other electrical work. Estimates were previously obtained and were subsequently closely followed. This portion of the work is now satisfactorily completed.\n\nThe septic tank being filled to a depth of 7 feet with unwatered raw sewage which also clogged the outlet pipes, Mr. Fetterly found it necessary, during his visit of January 13, to engage J. Pigeon of St. Paul, to\nremove it, as Father Angin would not undertake the work with his small staff and no facilities.\n\nMr. Pigeon promised definitely to finish the work but a letter was received from the Principal on January 25th, by which time this office had expected the work was completed, to the effect that he only worked one day and then abandoned it. The Principal was instructed to hire another man whom he mentioned. It is too much to expect Father Angin's staff to do this portion of the work.\n\nThe cost to date was as follows:\n\nH.S. Fraser, St. Paul, Carpenter $226.62\nThis was an extremely reasonable cost.\n\nI.H. Galloway, St. Paul, Electrician. 45.32\nThis was also very reasonable.\n\nStandard Iron Works, Edmonton - 66.40\nRepair of motor and fabrication of extensions, etc.\n\nThe motor was found when unwound to be in poorer condition than first thought.\n\nTotal. $338.34\n\nThe first two bills were paid from the $300 advance. The last invoice is in hand but is being held until the bill for removal of sewage is received, which should be within a few days. The total required extra amount will then be requested from Ottawa.\n\nIt is suggested that the Department of Indian Affairs send the circular which has been seen at other schools containing instructions that the septic tank be cleaned out every six months. Father Angin states that he\nhas never received a copy.\n\nIII. Wells.\n\nImmediately on receipt of the wire dated December 21st, W.E.Gullion, the Indian Agent at Saddle Lake Agency, in whose district the school is situated, was communicated with. He stated that the driller had again brought in water, at least temporarily and that a visit by the writer was not immediately necessary. A visit was made on January 13 and 14.\n\nA resume of the writer's findings are as follows:\n\n(a) Three wells have been drilled.\n\nWell No.1.\n\nDrilled 300 feet west of the school in 1930 on the slope of a hill about 20 feet high. This well is 470 feet deep. Four veins of water were found 96', 205', 327', 460'. The first vein contained hard water and the last two fairly soft water. There were 350 feet of water in the well producing 2500 gallons per hour. It is said that the hole became clogged in the last few feet. Casing was lowered to the bottom. Some of this casing was afterwards removed. It was 6\", 5\" and 4\u00bd\" in diameter. This well afterwards partially filled with sand and was definitely abandoned.\n\nWell No.2.\n\nDrilled within five feet of No.1 in 1930 by the Contractors who built the school, for construction purposes, to the 96 foot vein. This produced very hard water and was not intended for permanent use by the\nSchool. It is at present used continuously when no water is available from No.3, which is now nearly all of the time. It produced 2000 gallons per day. The school requires about 4000 gallons, and consequently must ration the water. They melt snow for soft water. The casing in this well is 6\" diameter throughout.\n\nAn analysis made January 3, 1933, by the Alberta Provincial Analyst indicated a hardness of 85.68 grains per gallon (St. Barnabas School Onion Lake, Sask., water contains 38 grains).\n\nWell No.3.\n\nThis well was drilled to the 327 foot vein within 30 feet of the School, in August, 1931. The hole is 8 inches diameter with a 6\" casing throughout. The hole is straight. Water came up to within 92 feet of the surface, i.e. 235 feet of fairly soft water. All veins of No.1 were struck at similar depths.\n\nThe water pipe is 3\" diameter. The Department had to go to the 327 foot vein to get sufficiently soft water. The analyst on January 3, 1933, found it to contain 14 grains per gallon.\n\n(b) Later Activities with Well No.3.\n\nThe driller of Well No.3, Mr. Fredrickson, of St. Paul, Alta., was called in by W.E. Gullion, Indian Agent, to ascertain the reason for cessation of flow, on Nov. 3. He worked at various times until Christmas.\n\nWhen the well was finished, August 1931, he put 3 feet of average gravel in the casing. During the 14 succeeding months 40 feet of sand, similar to the sample\nwhich is being sent under separate cover, apparently came through the gravel into the casing. The sample being sent was gathered in the water and dried for transportation. It must have some silt as 2 hours are required for settling. It is not sand rock. This sand, as will be noticed, is very fine and would go through a 100 mesh screen or even finer. A sand point would not stop it. Any screen which would stop it would probably clog altogether. This sand is being pumped whenever the well is used.\n\nThe cylinder is 87 feet from the bottom of the well. The driller removed this sand at the beginning, November 3, by agitation with a baler. He then drilled through the 3 feet of gravel with an 1800 lb. bit. He then placed 10 feet of average gravel and stone into the casing. Apparently he stopped the water nearly altogether. However, after an interval he again drilled through the 10 feet of gravel, his drill becoming stuck twice in the last two feet. He finished by dumping in one pail of gravel. The water was evidently coming intermittently during these times, but the sand was always present in the pumped water, in suspension. In manipulating the pump rods and cylinder the rods broke. This is the condition of the well at the present time.\n\nOne of three things must have happened when drilling. Either the gravel was pulverized, driven below the end of the casing, or the lower ten feet or so of the casing is broken (6\" casing in an 8\" hole). However, the\nwriter is assured that the last alternative is not probable.\n\nMr. Fredrickson, the driller, informed Father Angin that he had sent a report to this office containing a log of the well and an account of his activities but this report has not yet been received.\n\n(b) Solutions of the Problem.\n\nSeveral solutions were offered, as enumerated below.\n\nThe writer returned to Calgary on January 15. He has found since that it is exceedingly difficult to find anybody that has had experience in this sort of well trouble and who has a remedy. After several interviews with engineers, wholesale firms and well drillers, he found that Mr. Nelson, Instructor at the Technical Institute, had drilled many wells of this nature, in Northern Alberta. Pending receipt of Mr. Fredrickson's report, he offered a logical solution. This was afterwards corroborated by a former South Dakota driller who lives in Calgary and who has invented a pump for this kind of water trouble in which the leather cup washers are inverted and the water forced through a hollow pump rod.\n\nThe various solutions are as follows:\n\nFather Angin's Solution\n\nPurchase a 4 ton block and 40 feet of chain to lift out the rods if they break because of sand and to pull the cylinder. The accumulated sand could then be\ntaken out by a baler, hand-operated. This could be done every 10 or 12 months and would occupy 5 or 6 days. He states that his own staff could do this work. However, it would constitute a permanent operation. It would cost about $200 for hand-operation, plus the cost of an engine which undoubtedly would have to be purchased for permanent operation, a total of $600.\n\nMr. Fredrickson's Solution.\n\nHe would sink another well in the immediate vicinity of No.3, to the same depth (327 feet) at a cost of about $900. This is also favoured to some extent by Mr. Gullion. Mr. Fredrickson does not want to touch the old well at all.\n\nA new well may develop the same trouble as before.\n\nA solution considered by Mr. Gullion and the Writer.\n\nUse No.2 (96' deep) with possibly another of the same depth near it and use a Zeolitic Water Softener, to soften the water. This water is very hard (86 grains per gallon) and a water softener would cost from $1200 to $1500 for 4000 gallons per day. It would be a sure solution of the difficulty. It is to be noted that the capacity of No.2 is 2000 gallons per day as far as proved.\n\nMr. Nelson's Solution\n\nRepair No.3 in the following manner:\n\nRemove the Cylinder and pipe. Clean out the sand and gravel to the bottom of the casing - 327 feet.\nAttach sufficient pipe to lower the cylinder to the bottom of the well. Pump slowly steadily and incessantly for two or three days or more, night and day. The thickness of the water vein at 327', possibly consisting of the fine sand, is not known. It may be 6\" or one foot. The pump should never stop. The cylinder should be at the bottom to catch all sand as possibly only the finer sand is carried up at present by the cylinder 87 feet above the bottom. However, this incessant pumping should clear a space beneath and around the bottom of the casing and also for a distance vein itself. This would then act as a reservoir. If enough sand were pumped out it might never trouble the well again.\n\nIV. Conclusion\n\nThis report is prepared pending receipt of Mr. Fredrickson's log and report and possible subsequent consultation with Mr. Nelson.\n\nIt is evident from the divergence of opinion and from the various interviews that the solution of the problem is difficult. The only feasible source of water for the school consists of one of the exposed veins and one of these must be developed.\n\nConsiderable consideration of the problem before taking action is warranted because of the cost of experimenting.\n\nA sample of the sand which comes from the well with the water is being sent under separate cover.\nThis sand may or may not consist of the entire content of the vein or the coarser sand may be at the bottom.\n\nP.A. Fetterly\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nO.H. Hoover\nEngineer in Charge.\n\nCalgary, Alta., January 30, 1933.\n\nP.S. One would expect that, considering the number of deep wells which have been drilled in the west, some authoritative method would by this time be found, but two more expert opinions have been given, since the above was written. Mr. MacDonald, Toronto Engineer in charge of Construction of the Glenmore Dam, Calgary, considered that a form of \"air lift\" and settling tank could possibly be used.\n\nL. Michael, of Gleichen, when being consulted regarding the Old Sun School well on January 30, and who has had considerable experience, stated that he would use the baler, instead of lowering the cylinder and damaging it, to take out the water and sand. He prefers a short stroke for deep wells, and at any rate, a slower speed than is usual.\n\nQuick action is necessary as a letter has been received from Father Angin stating that \"the well is not fixed up and we have not sufficient water with the shallow well. I would be satisfied if you could give orders that the well be fixed up the soonest possible.\"\n\nA copy of this report is being sent to W.E. Gullion, the Indian Agent, through Inspector Christensen, who is proceeding to St. Paul on January 31.\nFebruary 6, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nRe Blue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nWith reference to the repairs to the septic tank recently carried out at the Blue Quills Indian School and the condition of the wells there I enclose a report by Mr. Fetterly dated January 30th. From this it appears that the septic tank has been satisfactorily completed at a cost slightly in excess of the estimate - the final bills for which have not yet been received.\n\nRegarding the wells - the situation is not very good and it seems to be difficult to find out what is the best plan to try and remedy the existing situation. I have asked Mr. Hoover to obtain further advice if possible and have sent a copy of the report hereto, to Mr. W.A. Johnston of the Geological Survey of Canada, for his suggestions. A sample of the sand, which has caused so much trouble, is also being sent to Mr. Johnston. I will advise you on receipt of his reply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul, Alta.\n\nFeb. 3rd 1933\n\nTo the Honourable Harold Mac Gill,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\n\nHonourable Sir,\n\nYou have received very lately a report from Mr. Fetterly, hydraulic engineer at Calgary, concerning the well at Blue Quills School. In reading myself this report that I have received also, I have seen that Mr. Fetterly writes about my opinion as to give the solution of the trouble with water at school. But it appears that Mr. Fetterly has not understood my solution of the problem. My solution is very simple and I have asked him for fixing up the deep well No. 2 as it was before the driller spoiled it lately.\n\nWhen Mr. Frederickson has drilled this well in 1931, he has put at the bottom of the well 3 feet of gravel to prevent the sand to come up and with this stopper, we had a good service from the well during 8 months. Lately, on last November, he came to clean the well, and he drilled these 3 feet of gravel; it was a mistake, and I do not know if Mr. Frederickson did it purposely to drill another well because he had no work elsewhere. Then, my solution is to put again at the bottom of the well 3 or 4 feet of gravel, to be used as a stopper for sand. If this is done, I guess we can have a good service from the well as before.\n\nI talked to Mr. Fetterly of a block chain of 4 tons, but it is not to clean the well by ourselves, it is to repair the pump when the rod is broken; this rod is a wooden one, and has been broken 4 times since Mr. Frederickson has worked at the well since last November. The rod can break again and if we are obliged at every time to ask for Mr. Frederickson, this will be expensive and will take long, as sometimes the tiller is far away. Then, I ask to the Department to equip the school with this block chain and 40 feet of chain, that we may repair the pump by ourselves.\n\nI am very much opposed to the solution of Mr. Fetterly, viz., to buy a water softener for the well No. 2. This water softener, without regard to the high cost of $1200 or $1500, is a dirty thing, expensive in brine, and that does not give satisfaction. More of that, you have remarked that Mr. Fetterly states that the well No. 2 gives not sufficient water for the school why then install a water softener?\n\nI think that the matter about this well has not been placed in the right way. When Mr. Indian Agent Cullion has sent a telegram to the Department one month ago, he has stated that the water formed the boilers. This is false as the water from the well No. 2, which is exceptionally hard, has never been used for the boilers. We have used till now the water from the cistern which is soft water. I must say that now this cistern is empty, and a prompt action of the Department is wanted, because in the next future, we shall be obliged to use this hard water for the boilers.\n\nThe Department will do as they wish, but for me, I consider that the matter is very simple. It is easy however to try my solution, this will not be very expensive; I try to save the deep well we have used till now, the water is soft and good, and this well gives water nearly sufficient to the school. I consider as a shame to impose upon the Department such big expenses as to drill a new well or to place a water softener, which are not necessary at all.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. J. Q. Anglin,\nPrincipal.\nDepartment of Mines\n\nCanada\nGEOLOGICAL SURVEY\n\nOttawa, February 7, 1933.\n\nMr. J.T. Johnston,\nThe Director,\nDominion Water Power Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,- Re: File 41167-W\n\nI have your letter of February 6th in reference to difficulties encountered in drilling for water at the Blue Quills Indian School near St. Paul, Alberta, and sample of sand from No. 3 well.\n\nThe difficulty of fine sand and silt coming with the water and plugging the well has been met with at many places in the prairie Provinces, and in other regions. H.E. Simpson, State water geologist of North Dakota states in a recent report that \"it is not an exaggeration to say that thousands of holes (in North Dakota) have been abandoned and hundreds of thousands of dollars lost through the inability of the drillers to secure water in ample amounts from fine sand deposits in which the water occurred in abundance. Even after wells have been finished and enough water apparently secured, the life of other thousands of these wells has been brief due to the infiltration of the fine sand, the clogging of the screens, the filling of the pipes, and the cutting out of the valves in the pumps. If the problem of securing this water through the proper drilling and finishing of these wells can be solved, it will be not only a great financial saving, but also a great material benefit to the people of the state by reason of better water supplies.\n\nThe method proposed by Mr. Nelson, namely cleaning out of the well and pumping sand and water sufficiently long to clear a space around the bottom of the casing, is the one commonly adopted. As much of the material is fine enough to be carried in suspension in the water I doubt whether the method would be successful except temporarily. A method used by the Kelly Well Company, the Layne Canadian and other large well drilling concerns might be successful, but would be very expensive. A large outside casing is put down to the water sand and fine gravel placed between it and the screen at the lower part of the inside smaller casing. The outer casing is then withdrawn and a filling placed around the inner casing. A modification of this scheme by using two small casings with a screen on the inner one and gravel between the two at the water sand might be tried. A very fine screen would be required and it is doubtful whether it would not become plugged.\n\nA sieve analysis of the sand is as follows: probably the sand in place is somewhat coarser:\n\n| Plus 0.1 mm | 36 |\n|-------------|----|\n| 0.1/0.05 mm | 14 |\n| Minus 0.05 mm | 50 per cent. |\nThe sample is, therefore, fine grained. A little of the plus 0.1 mm. portion is retained on a 0.2 mm. sieve. The grains are subangular.\n\nIn connection with the plan favoured by Mr. Fetterly, namely using No. 2 well, which seems to be the most feasible scheme, it may be advisable to find out whether there is a screen in the well and if not whether a screen would increase the water supply. This would depend upon the thickness and character of the water sand. If it is proposed to soften the water a fairly complete analysis of the water should be made; some hard waters can be softened by the Zeolite exchange silicate process whereas others cannot. Analyses are made by some of the firms handling water softeners.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n'SGD' W.A. Johnston.\nSir,- Re Blue Quills Indian Residential School, St. Paul\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 6th instant regarding the condition of the well at the Blue Quills Indian School, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter received from Mr. W.A. Johnston of the Geological Survey of Canada, which contains some additional suggestions as to how this well may be treated. Copy is being sent to Mr. Hoover and I am asking him to consider it along with the other suggestions which have been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F.

Fetterly, an engineer of the Calgary office of this Bureau, amounting to $29.30, covering expenditures for the month of January, in connection with work for your department at the above school.\n\nProvided the account meets with your approval, will you kindly have a cheque issued in favour of Mr. O.H. Hoover for $29.30, the engineer in charge of our Calgary district, and forward it to the undersigned for delivery.\n\nThis is a general surveys account item, and the issue of the above mentioned cheque will maintain Mr. Hoover's advance at $50.00, the amount agreed upon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Hoover, Esq.,\nEngineer in Charge,\nCalgary.\n\nSir,-\n\nI have received the report of Mr. Fetterly,\nconcerning the work done at Blue Quills School, and I thank\nyou for it.\n\nAs to the cleaning of the septic tank, I may say\nthat I did not hire at once Mr. Joe Hamlin, as stated per\nyour telegram. I heard that Mr. Pigeon, who had the job,\nhad bought a special hose to connect to a pump in order\nto clean by himself this septic tank. So, I waited some\ndays, asking Mr. Pigeon to come at once, and I stated him\na day, viz: Monday, Jan. 30th, as the last concession I\ncould give him. But Mr. Pigeon did not come, so I hired Mr.\nHamlin.\n\nTill now, the smaller tank, where the pump is,\nis cleaned and the pump has been cleaned also. Next Monday\nMr. Hamlin will start work again to clean the bigger tank,\nand I suppose about next Wednesday that the work will be\ncompleted.\n\nMr. Joe Hamlin has charged $125.00 for cleaning\nthe tanks. At first view, this seems to be a high price,\nbut, after reflection, this is a moderated price, as the\njob is not very good smelling and palatable.\n\nAs soon as the work is completed and proves\nsatisfactory, I will send you in quadruplicate, the bill\nof Mr. Hamlin.\n\nI have read the report also as to the wells, and\nI was surprised to see what is my opinion concerning the\nsolution of this problem. I have talked to Mr. Fetterly\nabout a block chain, but not to clean the well; this was\nintended to repair the pump when the rod is broken. My\nopinion is that the well be fixed up as it was before\nMr. Fredrickson spoiled it. This last driller has removed\nthe 3 feet of gravel that he dumped when drilling the\nwell, and this was a mistake. Now he has only to dump\nagain 3 feet of gravel to be used as a stopper for sand;\nthis is my opinion, and I have written to Ottawa about\nthis. For me, I consider that this deep well No.3 can\nbe saved very easily, instead of abandoning it. We had\na good service from this well during 8 months, the water is\nsoft, good, and I do not see why this well would be\nabandoned. I am sorry to see that I did not talk clearly\nenough to be understood.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n(signed) Jos. Angin.\nPrincipal\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nDominion Water Power and Reclamation Service\n\nCalgary, Alta. February 11, 1933\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 31st ultimo and the accompanying report, dated January 30th, page 2, paragraph (2), I have now received a letter from Father Anglin stating that he has obtained a man to clean the septic tank at a cost of $125. I am sending a copy of his letter.\n\nThe cost to date is therefore as follows:\n\nH.S. Fraser, Carpenter (paid) $226.62\nI.H. Galloway, Electrician (paid) 45.32\nStandard Iron Works, Edmonton (not paid) 66.40\nJoe Hamlin, Scavenger (not paid) 125.00\n\nReceived from Director on Dec. 9, 1932 300.00\n\nBalance still due $163.34\n\nThe total cost of repairing the tank is larger than was anticipated but it was expected that the pump, when repaired, would empty the tank with little trouble. Nine months' accumulation of raw sewage, however, was more than it could handle.

If it develops that the barn drainage is absolutely necessary, cost of the work will have to be charged to the above mentioned appropriation.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nFile 4811.\n\nCalgary, Alta., Feb. 23, 1933.\n\nMemorandum to Mr. Hoover.\n\nIt was suggested to the writer verbally, by Mr. Christianson, Inspector of Indian Agencies, at a chance meeting in Edmonton, on Feb. 17th, that a definite recommendation regarding the well situation at Blue Quills Indian School, St. Paul, Alberta, should be made quickly. Mr. Christianson had just returned on that day from St. Paul and stated that immediate action was necessary as laundry work and ablutions were unduly limited.\n\nBecause of this necessity the writer recommends that Mr. Nelson's plan as indicated in the Report dated January 30, page 7, be followed.\n\nThe cylinder should be placed at the bottom of the well No. 3 (327 feet) with rods of equivalent length. The apparatus should be sufficiently strong to withstand weight of water column, back pressure from the pressure tanks, friction losses, sediment, etc. The other details are contained in the report. This may be or only temporary relief, say 8 or 10 months, but something has to be done quickly. The expense would not be great.\n\nThe writer hesitates to definitely recommend a water softener as yet for Well No. 2 because of the extra hardness of the water, until he has been able to obtain more information. He had an interview with the Provincial Analyst at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, on Jan. 18, regarding the matter. This official had analysed all of the water samples from the well. This well produces 2500 gallons per day, while the school needs up to 5000 gallons.\n\nMr. Christianson suggested that a copy of this recommendation be placed with him to gain time.\n\nP. A. Fetterly\n\n......P.A.Fetterly.....\nSir,\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School,\nWell No. 3.\n\nIn further reference to the deep well at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School as described in my letters of the 6th and 10th instant, I enclose herewith a memorandum from Mr. Fetterly to Mr. Hoover dated the 23rd instant in which, owing to the urgent necessities of the school, it is recommended that Mr. Nelson's plan, as indicated in his report dated January 30th which accompanied my letter of the 6th instant, be followed.\n\nMr. W. A. Johnston of the Geological Survey, in his letter of the 7th instant, states that the method proposed by Mr. Nelson is the one commonly adopted, although he doubts whether it would be successful except temporarily.\n\nIn view of conditions at the school, however, it seems desirable that this method should be tried, more especially as it is likely to give at least temporary relief and will enable the condition of the well to be better understood; also the cost would not be great.\n\nI beg to recommend that the method of continuous pumping be tried, and will be glad to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nCALGARY, ALTA., February 24th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to your attention that I have just returned from an inspection of the Saddle Lake Agency and while there inspected the Blue Quills School. The Principal naturally brought to my attention the difficulty they have been having with the water supply and sewerage: The deep well has gone out of commission altogether, and even the pump rods are broken. Therefore the well has had to be abandoned.\n\nFor the present the school are getting their water from the shallow well which only produces about 2000 gallons per day, whereas 4500 or 5000 gallons are actually required. The water from the shallow well is very hard and unfit for laundry use, and the Sisters have been melting snow to use for washing. The Department will realize how unsatisfactory this is.\n\nOn my way back to Calgary, I met Mr. Fetterly, (who has the situation in hand,) by chance in Edmonton, and asked him to make a definite recommendation as to what should be done about it. A letter has been forwarded by him to his Department at Ottawa this morning, and the suggestion is that the deep well be cleaned out and the quicksand pumped out, to make a basin in the bottom of the well, have the cylinder lowered, &c. At the present time, in my opinion, this is the only solution, and I would ask that I be authorized by wire on receipt of this letter, to have it done ahead with. Then, as Mr. Fetterly's office is only a few doors from my own office in this building, I shall place the matter in his hands, and direct instructions can be given to Mr. Gullion, who can in turn instruct the well driller as to what to do. It may also be necessary for Mr. Fetterly to make a trip to Saddle Lake.\n\nThis is going to cost a great deal less money than if another well were drilled. I realize that Mr. Fetterly has gone to a great deal of trouble in trying to find ways and means of dealing with this situation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nINSPECTOR'S OFFICE.\n\nCALGARY, ALTA... February 24th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nIn connection with the trouble they are having with the well and with the sewerage at Blue Quills School in the Saddie Lake Agency, I beg to bring to your attention that I reported on this on August 24th, last. To this day I have not heard officially what the Department were doing in the matter, as all dealings were with the Water Power Branch, and I was not advised of what was taking place. However, Mr. Fetterly was good enough to come into my office to get whatever information I had, and he kept me posted. He did not have to do this, but being in the same building he often came to my office and discussed this matter with me.\n\nI am well aware that the Department took the best means of handling the situation, as Mr. Fetterly has had a great deal of experience in matters of this kind and is always most willing to give me advice when we have difficulties of a similar nature at other institutions; What I object to is not being notified as to what was taking place, as in my opinion, I am entitled to being kept informed on matters of this kind, and I am quite sure that if that had been done, there would not have been such a delay in having the water supply looked after. Being the representative of the Department for the Province of Alberta, I think it only reasonable that I should be in touch with what is going on in the Agencies in my jurisdiction without having to get information from someone else.\n\nI hope the Department will admit that my stand in the matter is only reasonable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The policy of the Department has always been, in matters of this kind, to deal direct with the Director of the Dominion Water Power Branch in Ottawa, and any instructions issued for work such as at the Blue Quills School are sent out by him to his officers in the field.\n\nI have today advised the Director of the Water Power Branch to instruct his Calgary office to proceed with the cleaning of well No 5, as recommended by Mr. Rutterly and he will no doubt receive his instructions in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

H. Hoover, of Calgary, I enclose herewith cheque No. 3815, to the amount of $163.34, to pay the balance of the cost of the work. It is noted, from the communication which you forwarded from Mr. Hoover, under cover of your letter of the 14th ultimo, that the total cost amounted to $463.34 - a cheque for $300.00 having been previously sent by this Department.\n\nI would request that you instruct your Engineer to forward itemized accounts, in triplicate, properly receipted by the various parties or firms, in accounting for the expenditure of the advances which have been sent. These receipted accounts should reach the Department at the earliest possible date, and I shall be pleased if this matter is given your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

This School is equipped with two steel return tubular boilers, each having a capacity of 5000 square feet of radiation, making a total capacity of 10,000 square feet. The School is supplied for heating purposes with 6,138 square feet of cast iron radiation. It will be noted, therefore, that the boilers have a capacity of nearly twice the amount of radiation installed.\n\nIt appears, however, that they have had difficulty in heating this building, but this is not due to either lack of boilers or radiation, but to the fact that the system appears to be sluggish. When this School was erected electric power was not available, and the system was designed with wet returns in the basement. In order to increase the circulation it will be necessary to install a vacuum pump to trap the ends of the mains through float traps, and change the existing wet returns into dry returns. This would increase the circulation and cut down the fuel bills. This arrangement is possible now as electric power is delivered to the School. There has also been some trouble with the boilers due to alkali water.\n\nArchitect.\nMarch 27, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the report of the Auditor hereunder, dated March 4th regarding the heating system for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the statement that the boilers have not the necessary capacity for heating the school is incorrect.

Some machineries have been sold, but the heating system, sold $250.00 to Mr Thibodeau of St Paul, has not been paid and will not be paid; this last man being bankrupt.\n\nIn fact I have received nothing till now, and I ask that the Department furnish the material for fencing the playgrounds; we cannot wait that the creditors pay.\n\nLast year, I have submitted to the Department an estimate of $250.00 to buy the material, the freight being not included.\n\nI hope that the Department will allow the money wanted for these fences, so that the work be done the soonest possible, in May.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev.

I have said in my last letter that the proceeds of the old school would have been used for this fencing. It is strange that the $250.00 of the heating system cannot be collected. Will the Department make no effort to have this money? If so, the Department causes a damage to the school. This heating system has been sold through Mr. Indian Agent Gullion with the order from the Department to sell it strictly cash. Of course, Mr. Gullion has followed the instructions of the Department, but Mr. Morrison, Inspector of Reserves, has sold it, giving 3 months for payment, and from this comes the trouble\u2014everybody here in St. Paul knew well that this heating system would never be paid, as Mr. Thibodeau, the buyer, was at this time nearly bankrupt; he could not have even a cent in loan from the banks. This sale is not serious, and for me, Mr. Morrison should be forced to pay the $250.00, and arrange to have his money refunded by Mr. Thibodeau.\n\nI have seen yesterday Mr. Indian Agent Gullion, and he told me that he has $165.00 coming from the sale of old other machinery from the old school. I ask that this money be given to me to fence at least the playgrounds of the boys.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, April 27, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have been directed to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, regarding the fencing of the playground at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School and with reference to the sale of the equipment, machinery, etc., at the old school. The Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Gullion, requesting him to put forth every effort to collect the amount due for the sale of this old equipment.\n\nUnder the requirements of the Auditor General, it will be necessary for the Agent to forward any proceeds he may obtain to the Department, instead of handing same over to you, to be used towards the expenses of fencing. When we have a report from Mr. Gullion, together with the receipt of any funds that he may have collected from the sale of the old equipment, further consideration will be given as to whether same can be applied towards the cost of fencing the playgrounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Jos. Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSaint Paul, Alberta.\nOttawa, April 27, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer you to previous correspondence regarding the sale of material from the old Blue Quills Indian Residential School and request that you will state what action you have taken to collect from Mr. Thibodeau the amount owing by him for the heating system. The Department understands that he agreed to pay the sum of $250 for this equipment. Is there any chance of obtaining payment of the full amount or a part of same?\n\nThe Department understands, further, that there are certain moneys due for the sale of other old machinery which was on hand. I would request that you take early steps to collect, as far as possible, the amount due for the sale of equipment at the old school and forward same to the Department for credit to the Receiver General. The Principal of the new school has requested that these funds be handed to him, to be applied to cover the cost of fencing the playgrounds; but, owing to the requirements of the Auditor General, it is necessary that any moneys obtained for the sale of old equipment be forwarded to the Department.\n\nI have to request that you will report, at the earliest possible date, what prospect there is of obtaining payment for the old equipment. If you have any funds on hand from the sale of same, you should immediately forward them to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake,\nAlta.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir,-\n\nReferring to your letter No.4811 of the 11th inst. regarding the equipment for the well at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I beg to advise you that I was in St. Paul on the 12th and 13th in connection with the well and the material. Anticipating that the material would be on hand, I had started Mr. Fredrickson on the well and he had just completed the cleaning out process. The material arrived on Wednesday's train and I had this released on Thursday and it was delivered at the school on the same date. I gave Mr. Fredrickson instructions as contained in your letter and asked him to give me a report as soon as possible as to how the test was going. About nine o'clock Saturday night, he reported by phone that he had put in the pump and that he had kept the pump going from 9 p.m. to 3 o'clock the following morning, when the pump stopped. He stated that he had considerable trouble getting the pump out as approximately 24 feet of sand with some mud had come up and the pump rods were stuck. In order to give Mr. Nelson's plan a fair trial, I advised the driller to again clean the well thoroughly and to put in the pump for another pumping test. He was to start on the second test this morning. Personally, I am somewhat doubtful as to this plan being successful. The quantity of fine sand already taken out would indicate a vein of considerable extent and in view of this, the probability of creating a reservoir by pumping appears to be slight.\n\nShould Mr. Nelson's plan prove unsatisfactory, Mr. Fredrickson has made the following suggestion:- that a number of small holes be drilled in a short length of 5-5/8\" casing and that this be lowered to the bottom of the well. He claims that this is sometimes done in drilling oil wells. The objectionable feature in this case would be the possibility that should the short casing fail to remedy the trouble, and should it be found impossible to take it up, it would probably leave the well in such a condition that no further work could be done on it. Rev. Father Angin suggests that gravel might again be given a trial and that small holes be drilled in the pipe below the pump cylinder. His idea is that by having the holes, the suction would be from the sides instead of from the bottom of the pipe. Gravel has, however, already been tried out and the suction in any case would be from the bottom of the pipe.\n\nAs already states, Mr. Nelson's plan will be given a fair trial but should this fail, what plan would you suggest as an alternative?\n\nIn regard to the equipment received, I note that there are no extra rods for the pump. In the event of breaking one of the rods, there will be considerable delay in getting a replacement and in view of this, I am of the opinion that there should\n\nO.H. Hoover, Esq.,\nEngineer in Charge,\nDominion Water Power Bureau,\nCalgary, Alta.\nbe at least two spare rods on hand and also one dozen washers for the cylinder. The sand cuts the latter very quickly.\n\nI shall again advise you as to progress being made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) W.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\ntogether with the invoices, in quadruplicate, to be receipted and returned. The vouchers from the Standard Iron Works have been returned, but none have been received from Mr. Hamlin. Would Father Angin be kind enough to remind him that I need these receipts immediately for return to Ottawa.\n\nMeanwhile we will anxiously await any further communication either by phone, wire, or letter regarding progress at the well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(signed) O.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to our telephone conversation on the afternoon of the 18th instant regarding the well at Blue Quills Indian School, Mr. Fetterly states that he waited at his phone (M7346) from 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. on the 19th instant for a call from you in accordance with our mutual plan in the original conversation. This call, however, did not come through. We will be very pleased if this is due to the fact that no difficulties had been encountered up to last night.\n\nAs a preparation for last night's possible phone conversation Mr. Fetterly again consulted Mr. Nelson, Instructor at the Provincial Technical School, on the 19th. This gentleman was quoted in the former report as a well driller who had had a great deal of experience in the drilling of wells around Camrose and Provost, under similar conditions.\n\nHe was informed of the facts you communicated over the phone to Mr. Fetterly. His comments were as follows:\n\nHe stated that in the case of one well at Camrose he pumped for a day and the water then came clear of mud. He concluded that it was all right and left it as finished. After another day had elapsed the water became muddy again (evidently a cave-in of sand). He again started to pump the water and sand and continued for a full week, stopping only from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m., and not even then, at times. When he stopped the pump he was careful to see that the stroke was at the top of the cylinder so that if it stuck on him he could gently pound it downward to loosen it. At one such stoppage it happened that he only had one-half inch to spare as the plunger was near the bottom. However, even in these circumstances he was able to loosen it.\n\nMr. Fetterly asked him if it would be a good plan to raise the cylinder 5 ft. or 10 ft. or 20 ft. He did not think this a good plan as this might raise the cylinder above the heavier sand.\n\nHis main advice was \"pump incessantly\" and don't leave the well until you are sure it is clean. He stated that in one well he pumped over two wagon-loads of sand with the water before clearing. It would not do to clear the water and then leave it immediately as a cave-in might occur for a short time. This advice appears to be reasonable.\n\nW.E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent, Saddle Lake Agency,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to the re-habilitation of the well at Blue Quills Indian School, I am enclosing correspondence relative to our activities regarding this very vexing problem, for your perusal and action.\n\nFirstly, we have no means of finding a better driller than Fredrickson. He is the only driller we know about in the north country. The only method known to this office is to attempt to obtain advice from other drillers. Mr. Nelson, Instructor at the Calgary Technical School, and who has been quoted before, has given advice during the last few days but he can only describe what he might do under certain circumstances. If he were on the spot he might not be able to fully overcome the difficulties we have encountered at this site. It is to be remembered that this office has been attempting to direct operations between Calgary and an isolated spot 350 miles away. Difficulties arise which the operator cannot overcome and he then communicates with us for advice.\n\nI will now enumerate recent events and mention suggestions for the future.\n\nWe ordered the material as instructed in your letter of March 6. On March 14 we instructed Mr. Gullion, Indian Agent, on the method of procedure giving full instructions as far as could be anticipated. The material arrived in St. Paul on April 13 and was immediately installed in the well. On April 20 we received the following telegram from Mr. Gullion from St. Paul:\n\n\"Nelson plan proving unsatisfactory stop\n\"Consider advisable Mr. Wetterly come.\"\n\nAs the trip is expensive I wired a night letter as follows:\n\n\"Why cannot Fredrickson keep pumping so as\n\"to extract water and sand continually\n\"stop expert advice indicates that this\n\"operation is only way to bring back well\n\"stop before visiting I must learn cause\n\"of failure by driller to keep going stop\n\"reply night letter Friday.\"\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nImmediately after this had been sent I received a letter from Mr. Gullion, a copy of which is enclosed, dated April 17. Instead of a night letter I received a phone message from Mr. Gullion at St. Paul, Mr. Fredrickson being also present in St. Paul, in which they stated that they could not carry on. Meanwhile Mr. Fetterly again consulted Mr. Nelson personally on Friday. Mr. Nelson suggested boring 40 feet further below the present casing (which is now 327 feet down) and exploding four sticks of dynamite 15 feet below the end of the casing to form a cavity, giving detailed instructions in handling this operation.\n\nDuring the last phone conversation this plan was mentioned, but owing to expense, it was not fully discussed. They, however, had other plans which they wished to discuss so I decided to advance Mr. Fetterly's departure on his regular hydrometric trip. He is consequently proceeding to St. Paul on Monday morning. He will interview Messrs. Gullion and Fredrickson and will immediately send a report to me at Calgary which I will forward to you.\n\nI have caused the letters to be typed in duplicate for your information and that of the Indian Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th ultimo regarding well No. 3 at the Blue Quills Indian school, I enclose herewith copy of a letter dated the 22nd instant from Mr. Hoover with attachments referred to therein describing the attempts which have been made to clean out this well.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Fetterly is to inspect the work during the present week and should be in a position to supply more definite information on his return.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

I took him with me to St. Paul where the offer with conditions was prepared by Mr. W.G. Fuller, solicitor, by whom it was witnessed. I am enclosing herewith, in duplicate, Mr. Fredrickson's offer, etc. You will note that the offer is not quite the same as that made when Mr. Fetterly was at the school on the 26th April. The change made in the offer is in connection with the casing. Mr. Fredrickson, in his original offer, stated that he would supply the casing at 95 cents per foot. On going into this question with him, I came to the conclusion that should he be called upon to pay cash on delivery of the casing, he would not be financially able to handle it and that if such were the case it would necessarily mean correspondence and delay in obtaining release of the material. He eventually decided that he would make the offer on the drilling and drive shoe only.\n\nI might mention that when I called at the school on the 3rd instant, I was informed that the well was not giving any more water. It was apparently plugged with sand and mud to such an extent that the vein had stopped. In an endeavour to obtain at least a temporary supply of water for the school, I advised Mr. Fredrickson to try a shot of dynamite. This he did\non Saturday. On Wednesday when I called at the school, the flow had started and the pump had been going continuously for forty-eight hours. The water was very muddy and did not show any sign of clearing after the forty-eight hours pumping. I was advised later in the evening that the pump had stopped around 3 p.m. but as this information was obtained from the power house at St. Paul by phone, I am unable to state the cause of stoppage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) W.E.

In the event of this failing also, it is desired to secure authority to drill a new well with such precautions as experience has shown to be necessary.\n\nA new well is estimated to cost $1500 or $1400 and as the matter is urgent it is desired to receive instructions regarding this as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nREPORT\non\nThe Well Situation\nat\nBlue Quills Indian School\nby\nP.A. Fetterly\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nI. Introduction.\n\nA letter was sent to the Director, dated April 22nd 1933, stating that the writer was proceeding to St. Paul immediately to make an inspection of difficulties which had been mentioned in the wire and telephone conversation with Mr. W.E. Gullion, Indian Agent, and Mr. J.E. Fredrickson, driller. These men were interviewed on April 26 and 26.\n\nII. Mr. Fredrickson's Activities.\n\nIt was ascertained that the new 3\" piping, rods and cylinder had been placed in the well, the bottom of the 6\" casing being at the 326 foot level. The water vein being utilized runs from 323 feet to 327 feet, i.e., 4' thick, with the casing one foot from the bottom of the sand vein. A stratum of clay lies under this vein.\n\nMr. Fredrickson stated that when he started to work the first time, i.e., about November 1, 1932, the accumulation of sand in the 6\" casing was 40 feet thick. He, of course, stopped working about December 25. When he began again about April 15, 1933, he found 24 feet of sand, the accumulation of 3\u00bd months. This sand was so dense that\nhe had to drill through it instead of simply baling it out. This, of course, all took place in the lower 24 feet of the 6\" casing, and occupied about half a day. He then lowered the cylinder and pumped water and mud (please note that it seemed to be mud rather than sand, but was similar to the samples which were obtained by the writer on January 10 and sent to Ottawa), for 2\u00bd hours. It then stuck solid and the pump stopped because of the resistance at the end of that time. He then removed the 3\" piping and cylinder, about 3 hours' work. He then had to drill the sand out again and bail out until the water became fairly clear but not as clear as it was 2 years ago when he first drilled it. Three days were occupied in this one operation. The sand appears to almost actually shoot up to a depth of several feet within a few minutes.\n\nThis operation was repeated three times, each time there being 10' or 12' of sand in the casing accumulated within a few hours or less. The last two times he could only pump 15 or 20 minutes, before the cylinder froze. He had to extract pipe, rods and cylinder every time he cleaned it. When he had tried this for three times he decided that it was wasted effort and advised Mr. Gullion, on April 22, to communicate with Calgary office, stating that the \"Nelson plan\" had proved unsatisfactory.\n\nIII. Cause of Troubles\n\nMr. Fredrickson believes that the trouble is caused by the fact that the lower 20 feet of casing, or a certain length of it has been ruptured by the continuous\ndrilling and pounding and that the \"mud\" in the water comes from the clay stratum immediately above the water sand vein as it is much finer than the original water vein sand. This is problematical. He claims that when he finished the well two years ago, he advised that the pump be started immediately and pumping continued until all sand has disappeared from the water. He believes that this was not done and was the cause of the present trouble. He also states that a well should always be pumped immediately after it is finished to clear it and that if this is not done trouble is liable to ensue.\n\nMr. Nelson agrees with this fact.\n\nIV Fredrickson's Cure\n\nMr. Fredrickson is of the opinion that a new well should be driven about 30 or 40 feet away from the present well. He claims that under certain conditions he will guarantee a free flowing well, if he be allowed to plan it and to pump until clearing as soon as finished. He states that a well cannot be allowed to stand as it will deteriorate.\n\nHe would not place the cylinder at the bottom of the well as in the present experiment. He drilled a well for the St. Paul Flour Mill, two miles to the east, 360 feet deep, and kept it going for a month. This water is rather harder than that of the School well.\n\nHe thought of inserting a 5\" casing inside the 6\" casing, for the full distance with a screen on the bottom but if the 6\" casing were ruptured mud would still\nenter to the cylinder.\n\nHe claims that he cannot clean the well with the baler as the water stays muddy continuously. Mr. Nelson and Mr. Fredrickson agree on the system of continuous pumping and the latter states that this should have been done at the beginning as it cannot be done now because of the nature of the sediment, as explained above, they only being able to pump for a few minutes at each operation before cleaning the cylinder and pipe.\n\nV. Log of Well\n\nThe log of the present well, No.3, is not now available, but the log of Well No.1, drilled by J.G. Douglas, 11706-87th St., Edmonton, in 1929, has been given as follows (this well is 300 ft. west of No.1 and of the School):\n\n- Yellow Clay 0'-30'\n- Blue Clay 30'-100', Very Hard water vein at 98'.\n- Hard blue clay 100'-120'\n- Blue Clay and Many Boulders 120'-198'\n- Clay & Gravel 198'-228' Hard water at 207'\n- Sand 228'-298'\n- \"Soft water\" sand 298'-330' Softer water at 324' (Clay 2')\n- Fine Sand 330'-360'\n- Coarse \" 360'-370'\n- Fine Sand 370'-390'\nRiver Sand 390' - 410'\nSand mud\nQuicksand, gravel\nand Clay 420' - 461' bottom of well, soft water.\n\nVI. Notes.\n\nA considerable amount of gravel has been placed at different times in the well for straining purposes. This gravel and the sand have been drilled through or pushed down or outwards at various times. It is difficult to estimate the exact or approximate condition of the bottom of the well and 6\" casing.\n\nThe present pump should deliver 350 to 500 gallons per hour and the present well should produce this amount if in good order. This amount would be sufficient for all school purposes.\n\nVII. Observations.\n\nFor the first time the writer has had an opportunity of observing Mr. Fredrickson. He has been drilling wells for 14 years and consequently has a considerable amount of experience in this work. He appears to be quite anxious to obtain water and, in the writer's opinion has done what he could. Mr. Gardner-Smith recommended him in the beginning with apparently good reason after making enquiries.\n\nThe writer, together with Mr. Gullion and Father Angin, and afterwards, with Mr. Fredrickson consulted today regarding the matter, and, allowing for limited\nknowledge on the part of all but the latter, came to\nthe conclusion that the only solution they could see\nwas to drill another well 20' or 30' to the west, with\nall of the precautions gained in the experience of\ndrilling No.3.\n\nWhile awaiting definite instructions from\nOttawa on the matter, Mr. Fredrickson has been instructed\nto make one more attempt. This consists in beginning\nwith a clear casing as far as may be known, then pour\nin a few feet of gravel, say 3 or 4 feet, then insert\nthe pump and test the efficiency of the screening. If\nsand is still found to come through, place one or more\nfeet of gravel and try again. In this way an exact amount\nof gravel to stop the sand but not too much to stop the\nwater may be found. If this fails then no other method\nis known to the writer. One considers that the limit for\nexperimentation has been nearly reached in the present\nwell. The cost will soon approximate that for a new\nwell if not stopped. Mr. Fredrickson guarantees a new\nwell under certain conditions which are not difficult,\nand are principally concerned with the cost.\n\nThe water question is more serious to the\nSchool than ever because the snow - which has been their\nprincipal source of soft water - has disappeared.\nLaundry conditions are deplorable and the hard water is\naffecting the water pipes. Father Angin is exceedingly\nanxious and urged the writer to wire to Ottawa for an\nimmediate answer and authority to proceed.\n\nMr. Fredrickson's presence on the work increases the cost every day he is there, consequently early instructions are imperative. It is obviously impossible for the writer to be in constant attendance at the School to check up the activities.\n\nMr. Nelson, on April 22, proposed one last attempt to save the well. This plan was to drill a further 40 feet below the casing, then lower a charge of 4 sticks of dynamite 15 feet below the casing to produce a cavity into which the sand surrounding the bottom could run, if it will not come up by pumping. This was found to be impossible because the sand runs into the drilled hole as fast as drilled and packs there. To hold it, the casing would have to be driven through the water vein and thus cut off the supply.\n\nVIII. Cost Estimate.\n\nIt is estimated that a new well, together with an underground gallery 20 feet long, extending the present one would cost about $1300 or $1400. This would include casing, drilling and extension of the basement. The recently purchased material would be utilized.\n\nIX. Addendum.\n\nThe writer has just witnessed the baling of the well. The water obtained in the bailer contains at a rough estimate about 5% of fine sand and mud. This settles in 10 minutes to a muddy appearing opaque water with much sediment on the bottom of the can. The remainder clears fairly well in about 2 or 3 hours indicating that clay is present. A sample of the sediment was obtained and dried. It is similar to that obtained in January.\nX. Conclusion.\n\nA perusal of this report, prepared at the School, will convey to the reader all that is known by the writer regarding the well situation. Suggestions have been made as to possible procedure. It is with a great deal of hesitation that one recommends another well as the expense of obtaining water has already been great, but it is the only solution to the writer's knowledge.\n\nP.A.

Hoover,\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to my letter of the 2nd instant regarding well No. 3 at Blue Quills Indian school, I enclose copy of a guarantee submitted by the driller Fredrickson for the drilling of a new well adjacent to No. 3 together with copy of an explanatory letter from Mr. Gullion the Indian Agent, dated the 11th instant.\n\nThe guarantee and the general situation with respect to the wells were placed before Mr. W.A. Johnston of the Geological Survey today. He considers the guarantee to be not quite satisfactory, the drilling price being high for a five inch well and some of the other conditions not being exactly worded.\n\nMr. Johnston is also of the opinion that the chances of successfully drilling a new well are not much greater than those of cleaning out and reclaiming the existing well and considers that the efforts now being made for the latter purpose should be continued at least for a short time longer.\n\nActing on these suggestions, I have today sent the following night letter to Mr. Hoover:\n\n\"Re Blue Quills school Fredrickson's guarantee considered by Geological Survey unsatisfactory and that his chance of securing a new flowing well is not greater than that of clearing existing well. Stop. Efforts to clear existing well should be continued and possibility of now using screen considered.\n\nI trust that this action meets with your approval.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Chemically it is high in saline content - containing sulphate of soda in such quantity as to have a laxative effect, particularly to those unaccustomed to its use. There is a considerable sediment of iron, and contains some carbonate of lime and magnesia. This is an extremely hard water; the hardness being equivalent to 49 degrees hardness - Clarke's scale.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(signed) Allan C.

E. Gullion, Indian Agent, regarding activities at the well (No. 3) at the above mentioned school. Two copies of this letter, which is self-explanatory, are enclosed.\n\nThe water from the 200 ft. vein is understood to possess a hardness of 50 grains per gallon (Mr. Gullion erroneously calls it 50%). This is somewhat harder than the water at St. Barnabas school, which was 38 grains. It is much harder than should be used in plumbing without softening. It is only half as hard as the 92 ft. vein now.\n\nMr. Fredrickson's account of $406.20 for activities in connection with the well has been received on even date.\n\nIt is as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Amount |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Gas and oil           | $68.70 |\n| Board and lodging     | 93.00  |\n| Electric power        | 19.50  |\n| Wages for hired man   | 50.00  |\n| For my own services   | 175.00 |\n\n$406.20\n\nThis account, although certified by Mr. Gullion, is not accompanied by any vouchers or detailed accounts and is therefore not sufficient for presentation to the Indian Department. Mr. Fetterly is proceeding northward on May 31 on regular hydrometric work and will call at the school towards the end of his trip, say June 10, or thereabouts. It is almost impossible to have these people prepare accounts correctly by correspondence.\n\nBy that time the water, now supposedly coming\n\nThe Director  \nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau  \nDepartment of the Interior  \nOttawa\nfrom the 200 ft. vein will have become homogeneous, and a sample can be obtained for chemical analysis for hardness. One cannot depend on an old analysis such as Mr. Fredrickson obtained on Mar.30,1931, a copy of which is enclosed. There is a strong probability that a water softener will have to be installed. However, if the present flow continues, and a softener is installed, the school will have a sure supply similar to St. Barnabas school at Onion Lake and Sacred Heart school at Peigan Reserve.\n\nIt appears to be inevitable that the 327ft. vein will have to be abandoned, as, underpresent conditions, results appear to be nil.\n\nEnclosed are two copies of Mr. Gullion's letter and two copies of the old analysis.\n\nThe possibility of a water softener had occurred often to me, but if water could have been obtained from the 324 ft. vein, this would not have been necessary. The softener should pass about 15 gallons per hour for 5 hours as the school needs about 4000 gallons per day.\n\nInquiries have been made from agents for the Duro softener, viz:- Bell and Morris of Calgary, and they have promised to obtain the information. The cost should be well within the $1300 allowed in your telegram of 8th instant for a possible new well.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"O. H. Hoover\"\n\nEngineer in Charge.\nSir,\n\nI am forwarding to you herewith, Mr. Frederickson's account, Voucher No. 3681, amounting to $406.20 in connection with work performed, etc., repairing well at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn regard to the water situation at this school I beg to submit the following report: The question of obtaining a water supply was becoming somewhat serious and on calling at the school on the 3rd instant, I was informed that the vein at the 327 ft. level had stopped and that it was impossible to bring up any more water by pumping, I discussed the question of using dynamite with the driller and before leaving, advised him to endeavour to drill at least a few feet below the bottom of the casing and to try a shot of dynamite. This he did and having opened up the vein, the pump was kept going continuously for approximately twelve days. I called occasionally and found that the water showed no signs of clearing. There was sufficient mud and sand being brought up to make the water appear thick. I called again on the 18th and as there was no improvement, I again discussed the water situation with the driller and the Principal. The driller suggested that although it would probably be found hard, sufficient water might be obtained from the 200 ft. vein. As the water supply at the school was then exhausted and the situation serious, I advised the driller to try a shot of dynamite at the 200 ft. level. He accordingly plugged the well at the bottom and shot the well on the following day. Water was brought in and after bailing, the pump was installed and started. The water came to within 43 ft. of the surface. One hundred feet of pipe was used on the pump. The water cleared about 3 a.m. Sunday, the 21st Inst. and the pump has been going continuously since. I am informed that full pressure is maintained in the pressure tank. Mr. Frederickson advised me that when he first turned the water into the pressure tank, he pumped at the rate of 650 gallons per hour. This did not lower the water and he states that the well will supply 1000 gallons per hour without any difficulty. I believe that the water from this vein was tested at the time of drilling but I have not seen a report of the analyses. I understand however, that the hardness was reported as being about 50 per cent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO.H. Hoover, Esq.,\nEngineer in Charge,\nDom. Water Power Branch,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\n(signed) W.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\nOffice of Indian Agent\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nJune 2nd 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of the 27th ultimo advising that Fredrickson's guarantee considered unsatisfactory and that efforts to clean existing well should be continued and possibility of now using screen considered.\n\nIn this connection, I might refer to my letter of May 25th. I might add further that the prospect of obtaining an adequate supply of suitable water from the existing well at the 327 ft. level was generally considered hopeless. A great deal of work was done on this well and a considerable sum of money expended with practically no results. The question of installing a sand screen was discussed some time ago but at that time I believe it was considered that in order to stop the flow of sand encountered the screen would necessarily have to be so fine that in all probability, the flow of water would be interfered with. The Principal has previously stated that before the well commenced causing trouble, he had to more or less \"ration the water\" in order to conserve the supply. At that time there were about 87 pupils in the school. There are now 117 pupils and including the staff, the number in the school is 133. It is doubtful therefore if this well could furnish an adequate supply of water from the 327 foot vein even if brought back to its former condition. The driller of course maintains that this condition was brought about by the fact that the pump was not kept going continuously immediately after the well was completed. Taking all this into consideration and as water situation at the school was as stated, serious, the 200 ft. vein was brought in. The well could still be cleaned if it is desired that this should be done but it is doubtful as to the probable result warranting the expenditure that would be entailed. I visited the school yesterday and so far, the supply of water from the 200 ft. level is sufficient to meet all requirements in the school. The Rev. Principal informed me that full pressure is maintained in the pressure tanks at all times and the water is clear. In view of this, I shall await your further advice before going any further in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) W.E. Gullion,\nIndian Agent.\n\nO.H.

This, of course, is hard water and could not be used indefinitely without injuring the plumbing.\n\nMr. Hoover states that Mr. Fetterly will visit the school during the present week and will furnish a complete report on his return to Calgary.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T.

Gitterly\n\nIndian Affairs - School Files\n(RG 10, Volume 6346, File 731-5, part 4)\nSir,\n\nBlue Quills Indian School\nCleaning Well No. 3.\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 30th ultimo please find enclosed the accounts of Rev. Father Angin and J.E. Fredrickson.\n\nAs intimated in my former letter, an account for $406.20 was sent to this office by Mr. Fredrickson through W.E. Gullion, Indian Agent, and certified by him. The form in which this account was prepared was considered unsatisfactory. Consequently Mr. Fetterly visited St. Paul on his last trip northwards last week and interviewed Rev. Father Angin, Mr. Gullion and Mr. Fredrickson.\n\nAn explanation regarding the accounts is necessary.\n\nMr. Fredrickson was engaged by Mr. Gullion in November and December, 1932, to attempt re-habilitating Well No. 3. This occurred before this office was called in consultation on the matter. Mr. Fredrickson was paid $250 for the work. He was expected to pay Father Angin $39.80 as per enclosed account. He postponed doing this until he had received payment for the present work. Officially, therefore, this office has no interest in the account for $39.80.\n\nEnc.\n\nAt the conclusion of the present work he presented a bill for payment. A copy of this is enclosed.\n\nMr. Fetterly suggested to Mr. Fredrickson that the account be altered so that payment for board and lodging, gas and power, should be made to Father Angin direct especially as he had agreed to provide these items only on the responsibility of this Department. This proviso was met at the time as the work had to be carried on forthwith and Mr. Fredrickson could not meet the expenses.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, Mr. Fredrickson wished to receive the cheque for $406.20 and disburse it himself. He was persuaded to allow the old bill for $39.80 and the new bill for $112.50, a total of $152.50, to be paid to Father Angin.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nThe items in the bill of Father Angin are self-explanatory. It might be mentioned that in November and December, Mr. Fredrickson was paid a stated amount and was expected to pay the expenses himself under agreement with Mr. Gullion.\n\nMr. Fredrickson's account needs some explanation. According to agreement, this Department was to pay all expenses. The gas and oil were used for running the drilling rig. The hired man was paid direct by Mr. Fredrickson as the work was carried on, and was to be reimbursed by this Department.\n\nMr. Fredrickson's own services were rated by himself at $175.00. He stated this price when he expected to drill another well, and said on June 9th that if he had known this would not be done he would not have given such a low price.\n\nIn the considered opinion of both Mr. Gullion and Mr. Fetterly the price is extremely low. Both officials expected that the total for Fredrickson's services would amount to $250 or $300, as the usual price for a rig is $25 per day.\n\nI am enclosing copies of the following documents.\n\n1. Account of J.E. Fredrickson, in triplicate.\n2. Account of Rev. Father Angin, in triplicate.\n3. Copies of Father Angin's two accounts, as given to Mr. Fetterly.\n4. Copies of temporary pay sheets for Fredrickson and his hired man, in triplicate.\n5. Copies of the original account of Mr. Fredrickson, in duplicate.\n\nI would recommend that cheques be sent as follows:\n\nRev. Father Jos. Angin, St. Paul, Alta. $152.30\nJ.E. Fredrickson, St. Paul, Alta. $253.90\n\n$406.20\n\nI might mention that the Indian Department may decide to send the full amount of $293.70 to Mr. Fredrickson and allow him to pay Father Angin although the former agrees to direct payment. I believe that direct payment to Father Angin of the $39.80 together with the $112.50 is best for all concerned.\n\nI might add that Mr. Fredrickson stated on June 9th that he expected the cheque from Ottawa on that day and was very disappointed that it did not come. Mr. Fetterly explained matters to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) O. H.

MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDepartment of the Interior\nCanada\n\nFile No. 4811.\n\nDominion Water Power and Hydrometric Bureau\n\nCalgary, Alta.,\nJune 14, 1933.\n\nSir,-\n\nRe: Blue Quills Indian School\nWell Situation\n\nI beg to advise you that Mr. Fetterly of this staff visited the above named School on June 9, to examine Well No. 3 and to prepare the accounts of J.E. Fredrickson and Father Angin for payment. These are attached to another letter of even date.\n\nHe found that Well No. 3 is working satisfactorily. Father Angin is satisfied, providing the water is not too hard. The present capacity is limited by the capacity of the pump. This pump is rated at 650 gallons per hour but on test produced about 500 gallons. The well as at present conditioned would probably produce upwards of 1000 gallons per hour if the pump could handle it. Plenty of water is now available for the School.\n\nMr. Fredrickson, as a last resort, on the advice of Mr. Gullion and on previous suggestion by Mr. Fetterly, exploded two charges of dynamite of three sticks each, at different times; one at 205 feet and the other at 200 feet. The water, presumably from the \"200 ft. seam\" arose to within 43 feet from the surface of the ground at the time. It was still at that point on June 9. The cylinder is 100 feet from the surface. The water has been coming since May 20 with no apparent diminution. The School needs 4000 to 5000 gallons per day. There are at present 130 people. If the school filled the number would be 155.\n\nThere is no means of knowing whether the well will be a permanent producer. Only time will answer this. At any rate, three quart jars of water were obtained by Mr. Fetterly. He allowed the pump to activate for some time before collecting the water directly from the well. The original sample from this vein indicated 50 grains per gallon of hardness. There is a strong possibility that the present water is too hard for plumbing and boilers. This can only be found on analysis.\n\nI am therefore sending you a sample of the water collected on June 9. I will send another sample to the University of Alberta for analysis. The third sample will be\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nretained for possible future use of a manufacturer of Water Softeners.\n\nYou will note that a sand sediment is present. This was not noted at the time of collection, although the water was very slightly discoloured.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the last instant, paragraph 3, I might state that we were very anxious regarding the expense which was being incurred in attempting to clean out the well but could see no other solution except to attempt rehabilitating Well No. 3 as authorized by you and while awaiting authority to begin another well if efforts were useless. Mr. Fredrickson was on the ground with his outfit and continued his attempts. As a result he has now obtained water, although of unknown hardness. The cost has been much less than was anticipated by this office.\n\nAs will be noted, no expense has been incurred since May 10 due to Mr. Fredrickson's expressed unwillingness to add to the already high cost of obtaining water. Mr. Fredrickson has been very reasonable throughout.\n\nWith regard to the 4th paragraph of the same letter I might explain that the present well is situated in a 6' x 6' concrete \"tunnel\" extending at right angles for about 30 feet from the boiler room. The top of the tunnel, consisting of concrete is at the surface of the ground. The greater portion of this tunnel is occupied by the pressure tank. The end of the tunnel farthest from the building contains the pump and well No. 3 in a space 4' x 6' x 6'.\n\nIt was proposed to extend this space for 60 feet further for the proposed new well in order to get away from the influence of \"Well No. 3.\n\nIn order to save expense it was proposed that the chamber for the new well at the end of the new tunnel 60' from the building would have been 6' x 6' x 6' with a narrow gallery for pipes connecting with the old one to minimize excavation and concrete. The alternative method would be to construct a house above the new well. This was considered to be more expensive than an extended tunnel. This new gallery and tunnel would have been at the same elevation as the original, the top being at the surface of the ground.\n\nMr. Fetterly is of the opinion that the matter can be left in status quo at present until the well has proved itself or until the necessity for a water softener is evident from analysis of the samples which have been secured.\n\nIt is to be acknowledged that the very small\nquantity of fine sand in the sample submitted is rather disturbing but this may disappear on continued use of the well, although it may also gradually fill up the pipes below the cylinder or collect in the pressure tanks on settling. The results of this particular difficulty will be found later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n'SGD' O.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to well No.3 at Blue Quills Indian school, I enclose copy of a letter dated the 14th instant received from Mr. Hoover, which describes the present situation.\n\nIt may be said in brief that water is now being obtained, sufficient in quantity but of unknown hardness. The latter will be determined by an analysis to be made by the University of Alberta.\n\nThe sample of water referred to by Mr. Hoover as having been sent to this office has been received and will be handed to Mr. Chene; as received it contained a considerable amount of silt, but this settled in about two days, leaving the water quite clear.\n\nNo further action seems necessary until the well has proved itself by continued use and the results of the analysis are received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nPer\n\nA. F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1933.\n\nRe:- File No. 41167-W.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant, with further reference to cleaning well No. 3 at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the accounts submitted in favour of Mr. Fredrickson and Reverend Father Angin. You will note that the account in favour of the former includes a charge for 190 gallons of gas, while the account in favour of Father Angin includes a charge for 12 gallons of gas and 385 k. w. h. of electric power. Before these accounts are passed for payment, it will be necessary for this Department to receive receipts for these expenditures.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $150, in part payment of Mr. Fredrickson's account, will be forwarded to your office under separate cover.

What he is asking for is a building 40 X 24 with 8-foot walls.\n\nThere is no doubt but that the granary is required as the school have no outbuildings except the barn, and I would ask the Department to advise me whether any funds are available for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

The Department has been requested to consider a further reduction of 10% in the Appropriation for Indian Education for the balance of the present fiscal year. Therefore, I regret there will be no funds this year to provide the cost of erecting a granary.\n\nI may add that it may be necessary to incur further expense in connection with the water supply - in providing a water softening plant - which would entirely use up any funds that might be available for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Fredrickson's account for 180 gallons of gas and 10 gallons of oil (owing to an error the oil was given as gas.)\n\nMr. Fetterly obtained vouchers in triplicate from the North Star Oil Limited of St. Paul for this item, to the amount of $68.70.\n\nFather Angin's account.\n\nThe items for which vouchers are required are as follows:\n\n| Item       | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| 12 gal. gas @ 32\u00bd\u00a2 |          |            | $3.85   |\n| 60 K.W.H. @ 12\u00a2    |          |            | 7.20    |\n| 325 \" @ 5\u00a2         |          |            | 19.50   |\n\nGasolene.\n\nFather Angin as purchasing agent for the Roman Catholic Church (not the Dept. of Indian Affairs) purchases his gasolene from the Imperial Oil Co. of St. Paul, by the barrel. He sold 12 gallons to us through Mr. Fredrickson for use in drilling at a critical time. According to agreement we paid for all materials used. Mr. Fetterly visited the Imperial Oil Office and requested vouchers which were refused as they sold the gas to Father Angin who sold to us. I cannot understand how we can go further back than Father Angin for the account. He has already furnished this, and we cannot obtain receipted vouchers until he has received payment.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nOTTAWA.\nPower\n\nMr. Fetterly requested vouchers from the Calgary Power Co. of St. Paul for the power used. Their argument was similar to that of the Oil Company. They sold power to Father Angin who sold a portion to us. The vouchers should therefore be obtained from Father Angin in the form of receipts after he is paid by the Indian Department.\n\nThe above explanation indicates my views of the matter. As no money has been paid to the Creditors no receipt can as yet be obtained. Father Angin sold the gas and power to us through Mr. Fredrickson and should provide the vouchers after he has been paid.\n\nI would therefore recommend that cheques be sent for disbursement as follows:\n\nJ.E. Fredrickson\n\n$253.90 less $150.00 (your letter 7th ult.) $103.90\n\nFather Angin\n\n$152.30 total amount.\n\nVouchers will then be obtained from these parties and forwarded to Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nO. H. Hoover.\n\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nAugust 8th, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nThis will acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June 26th returning, for revision, accounts submitted by Mr. Fredrickson and Reverend Father Angin, in connection with cleaning of well No.3 at the Blue Quills Residential School.\n\nA copy of your letter, together with the accounts in question, was forwarded to our engineer at Calgary and I now enclose copy of a letter received in reply.\n\nI trust the explanations given in Mr. Hoover's letter will enable you to pass the accounts for payment.\n\nThe accounts in question are returned herewith.\n\nENCL.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The manager of this branch advised me that he would look into the matter and would write me in regard to this item but I have not, to date, received the information asked for.

I have not heard from you since that time, and as I am badly in need of money at the present time, anything you can do to expedite the payment of my account will be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanking you in advance for your early attention to this matter, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. E. Frederickson\n\nJ. E. Frederickson\nOttawa, August 26th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 18th instant regarding the amount due you for work done at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, I beg to say that the Dominion Water Power Branch has forwarded to the Department an account showing $253.90 due you. A cheque for $150.00, in part payment of your account, was forwarded through the office of Mr. O. H. Hoover and a cheque for $103.90 will go forward to you in a few days.\n\nThe reason for the delay in this matter is due to the fact that we had to return the account in order to obtain further information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Netterly,\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nPURPOSE OF REPORT\n\nThis report deals finally with the Water Supply at Blue Quills Indian School, St. Paul, Alberta. Letters from this office dated May 30, June 5, 14 and 15, and July 4, the latter containing copies of the chemical analysis, were sent the Director fully covering the well situation.\n\nA final visit was made on July 20 in connection with vouchers.\n\nCONDITION OF WATER SUPPLY\n\nThe well was found to be working properly and is producing sufficient water for all purposes. This water is rather hard, as shown by the analysis, but the School Engineer, in the absence of Father Angin, stated that it was \"pretty good, although a little hard\". A letter from the Director, dated July 17, stated that \"no funds were available at the present time for the installation of a water softener and that so long as the water supply remains\nadequate as to quantity, no further action will be taken at this time\".\n\nThe matter of a softener will thus remain in abeyance as long as conditions are as at present.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nReferring to Mr. Mackenzie's letter of 11th ultimo, File 115-1-5, Ref. 128247 W, last paragraph, there should be no further expenditure at this school for Water Supply.\n\nAssistant Hydraulic Engineer.\n\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nAugust 23rd, 1933.\n\nSir:-\n\nEnclosed herewith you will find copy of a Final Report, dated August 17th, by Mr. P.

BUSKARD.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 22nd instant, concerning the enclosed letter from Mr. C. H. Gauvreau, of St. Paul, Alberta, I have now to state that arrangements might be made for the clearing of the farm at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School, provided the Minister's correspondent can finance the work until the spring. That portion of the farm to be cleared would have to be indicated by the Reverend Principal, and I believe the contract should be at a certain rate per acre and should be for clearing, stumping and breaking, complete. Of course, the stumping and breaking would likely have to wait until the early summer, but I believe it advisable to have the job completed by those to whom it is entrusted.\n\nI may say that Mr. F. O. Maurice, the Secretary Treasurer of the Village of St. Paul, has urged the Department to do the clearing this winter, and, in December, Mr. Hector Plante wrote, wanting to quote on the brushing and breaking of 100 acres. He stated he had been doing custom work of this kind for farmers during the past few seasons. Perhaps Mr. Gauvreau would like to have this information if the Minister decides to proceed with the work.\n\nIt would be necessary for Mr. Gauvreau to see those who are competent to do this work and who need employment and to make an offer to clear, stump and break a certain specified quarter section, as indicated by the Reverend Principal, at so much per acre. This offer should go to the Reverend Principal himself, who could forward it to the Department with his comment concerning the quotation, etc. If this suggestion is made to Mr. Gauvreau, please let me know, so that we can instruct the Reverend Principal.\n\nDuncan C.

The school authorities cannot undertake to do this because the new school is located approximately fifteen miles from the old building. We would pay the man appointed at the rate of $3.00 or $3.50 a day. St. Paul is in the electoral district of Athabaska. A very reliable man should, of course, be selected.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nApril 10, 1931\n\nDR.

The clearing was given to Mr. Hector Therrien, of St. Paul, after communication with Mr. G. H. Gouveneau. Please see my memorandum of January 27th in this connection.\n\nMr. Therrien has made a satisfactory offer to do the breaking and discing for a total of $8 per acre. Should the work be given to him?

BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 11th instant, with the enclosed telegram, with reference to breaking and discing 100 acres at the new Blue Quills Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alta. Mr. Faucher's price is about the same as that of Mr. Therrien. Mr. Therrien's quotation in detail was as follows:\n\n- Breaking - $6.00\n- Discing 4 times - $2.00\n- Dragging with heavy harrows - $.50\n- Picking roots - $.25\n- Picking stones - $.50\n- Floating - $.50\n- Light harrowing - $.25\n\nTotal - $10.00\n\nIt is not the intention to do more than break and disc the land at this time. The school management should be responsible for the lighter work on the land, without cost to the Department. Mr. Therrien's quotation for breaking and four discings was $8.00 and I believe that Mr. Faucher, also, would be quite willing to do the work at this price.\n\nMy suggestion is that I telegraph Mr. Agent Gullion to interview both Mr. Faucher and Mr. Therrien of St. Paul and to have them divide the work. There is not much time remaining before harvest and it is necessary to take early action. Please let me know if this meets your views.\n\nA. S.

BUSKARD,\n\nPursuant to telephone conversation this afternoon, I have to inform you that horses, cattle and agricultural machinery will be purchased for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, in the electoral district of Athabasca, from time to time, during the next few months, as required. The original requisition from the Reverend Principal indicated that six horses, ten cows and the following agricultural machinery would be required:\n\n- Breaking plough,\n- Mower,\n- Gang plough,\n- Rake,\n- Disc,\n- Wagon,\n- Harrow,\n- Bob sleigh.\n- Drill.\n\nI may say it is not the intention to purchase any of this equipment until the Reverend Principal writes that particular stock or machinery is then required. The current prices for the locality of St. Paul, Alberta, will be paid when purchase is made. It is possible that a team or two of horses, the ten cows, a harrow, wagon and bob sleigh will be required during the next few months and that the rest of the equipment and stock will be needed in the spring.\n\nA.

It is proposed to fence the whole section and to erect a cross fence to protect the 100 acres that are being prepared for crop next year. The local management has secured a price of $264 from Marshall-Wells Alberta Company, of Edmonton, for wire, staples and gates, and a price of $350 for the posts from the Hayward Lumber Company, of St. Paul. As these firms are on the list and their prices are satisfactory, I wish to recommend that the business be awarded to them.

Alexander, of St. Paul. Do you consider this likely? Reply please.\n\nfor Private Secretary.\nOctober 20, 1931.\n\nMR. FERRIER:\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of October 14th regarding trucking and setting up furniture at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, as this particular job is about completed Mr. Telesphore Lord may be allowed to finish the work. If however, any additional work of this kind is required in the future it is to be given to Mr. Joseph H. Alexander, of St. Paul.\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nOctober 20, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nWith reference to the inquiry in the second paragraph of your memorandum of October 19th, I have to advise you that the Superintendent of Indian Education states that it is unlikely that there will be any work in the future such as is now being done by Mr. Telephore Lord, namely, trucking and setting up of the furniture at the new Blue Quills School. We have, however, made a note of the name of Mr. Joseph H. Alexander, of St. Paul.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nOctober 7th, 1931.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Buskard -\n\nAs the contract for the new barn at Blue Quills School will be awarded shortly, I would ask you to kindly give me the name of a competent inspector who may be employed to supervise the construction. It is thought that two inspections a week would be sufficient, and he will be paid at the rate of $6.00 per day for two days a week.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMinister's Office\n\nOctober 19, 1931.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nMr. H. S. Fraser, of St. Paul, may be engaged as Inspector to supervise construction of the new Blue Quills barn.\n\nIn your memorandum of October 7 you mention that it is thought two inspections a week will be sufficient, at the rate of $6.00 per day.\n\nfor Private Secretary.\nOctober 20, 1931.\n\nMR. ORR:\n\nWith reference to the construction of the new barn for the Blue Quills Residential School, Mr. H. S. Fraser, of St. Paul, is to be engaged as Inspector to supervise the construction. I think it was considered that two inspections a week would be sufficient, and remuneration was to be at the rate of $6.00 per day for two days a week.\n\nActing D. S. G. I. A.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nNovember 11, 1931.\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nWill you please let me have a memorandum stating what action was taken on the memo sent you on the 4th instant concerning the construction of the barn at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nI understand that you discussed this matter with the Minister but I would like the memorandum to complete my files and enable me to draft a reply to the wire received from Mr. H. S. Fraser.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nNovember 16, 1931.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard\n\nRe Inspector of Construction,\nBlue Quills Residential School Barn.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 11th instant, I have to advise you that I explained to the Minister that there was regrettable delay in informing Mr. H. S. Fraser that he had been appointed Inspector of this work. When this fact came to my notice owing to your memorandum of the 4th instant, I immediately wired both to the Agent and Mr. Fraser. Copies of these wires are attached hereto. I thought in the circumstances it was best for me to telegraph immediately.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nMinister's Office\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMarch 14, 1933.\n\nDR. MCGILL:\n\nMr. WALTER ALLEN, of ST.

I have sent already to the Department a copy of this requisition through Mr Inspector Christianson for his approval; but as I heard lately that Mr Christianson was sick, I doubt if it has reached you.

Also, I have received the 2 bats and the playground balls, for which I thank you very heartily. This last equipment will accommodate the small boys and the girls, the big boys playing baseball under the direction of Mr S. Fitre, teacher.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.W. Jos.

It is not necessary that this material, if supplied, be the full width of the corridors. You might also give the size of the Principal's room and office and that of the Sister Superior and two or three of the staff rooms. This information is required as soon as possible, in order that, if funds can be found in the Appropriation for the present fiscal year, full particulars will be on hand for the supplying of Battleship linoleum for the corridors and congoeum for the Principal's and staff rooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There are two partitions and the linoleum for this would have to be cut to fit. The Sister Superior's room and three of the staff rooms are all of the same size, being 14 feet by 10 feet.\n\nI might mention that six feet is the full width of the corridors.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.B.

This will provide sufficient for the corridors on the main and first floors of the building and for the corridors leading to the chapel.

It is hoped that this shipment will be satisfactory and that it will greatly improve the condition of the floors in the corridors of the school. The account, in triplicate, covering the cost, will be sent you, and, when the material arrives, you should certify and forward the account to the Department for payment.\n\nRegarding the rugs required for the Principal's room and office and for the staff rooms, it is considered that congoelum rugs would be both serviceable and satisfactory. You may arrange for the purchase of six congoelum rugs, size 9 x 12 ft. You should obtain prices for the supplying of these, f.o.b.

Ltd., and the company has inadvertently shipped to you 150 lineal yards of the linoleum (6' wide) instead of 75 lineal yards, in effect double the quantity that was required. You will please therefore hold the extra quantity that has been shipped you until you receive further directions, as the company will take back what was inadvertently over-shipped.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.C.

Cookson, of the Purchasing Branch, with reference to the shipment of battleship linoleum to the Indian Residential School at St. Paul, Alberta. It was pointed out that while the order for this linoleum actually read 150 yards, if the order had been compared with the quotation request which asked for only 150 sq. yds., the error in shipment might have been avoided, if confirmation of the order had been asked for before the shipment went forward.\n\nA letter has been written to the consignee drawing attention to the error in the quantity shipped, and he has been directed to hold the extra quantity until word has been received from you as to what disposition you desire to be made of it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C.

We, of course, presumed that the letter would be delivered to you the following morning.\n\nWe regret very much this mistake and from the above we feel sure you can quite understand just how it occurred, but we are writing to one of our customers who handle this line right along, asking them if they will kindly take delivery of the quantity left over, so that we would suggest that you instruct the Principal of the Indian Residential School in St. Paul to use only the 150 square yards wanted and return the other 150 square yards by freight, carefully packed, to Messrs. Gaults Alberta Limited, EDMONTON, Alta., and as soon as this is effected we will arrange to pass a Credit Note for the quantity which is returned.\n\nWe feel quite sure this will be satisfactory to you, and regretting very much any trouble caused you in connection with this transaction, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDOMINION OILCLOTH & LINOLEUM CO.

This makes a big difference already in the rooms.\n\nAs to the surplus quantity of Battleship Linoleum shipped by the Dominion Millcloth and Linoleum Co of Montreal,I hope you received long ago my letter,stating that I shipped to Gaulta Alberta Ltd, Edmonton,this surplus quantity,vid.75 lineal yards or 150 square yards.\n\nHoping you enjoy a good health,I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.Jos.Angin,\nPrincipal\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI know just today from Gaults Alberta Ltd., Edmonton, that you have received a note of credit from the Dominion Oilcloth and Linoleum Co., of Montreal, for 2 only rolls of Battleship Linoleum, vid. for 60 lineal yards, instead of 75 lineal yards, surplus quantity that was shipped by error to Blue Quills School.\n\nI must say that I mistook in the measurement of the 2nd floor corridor that I figured off the same length as the 1st one, and then, before shipping to Gaulta the 75 lineal yards of surplus, I asked them to buy by myself the 15 lineal yards that I missed to cover entirely the 2 corridors, if I agree with their price.\n\nThe Gaults firm have written to Montreal, but I see they have transferred the matter to the Department.\n\nPlease, tell me how much you will charge me for these 15 lineal yards, and I will pay you at once, if however the price is moderate. Otherwise, I told the Gaults firm I would ship back to them these 15 lineal yards.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, March 6, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo, with reference to the linoleum supplied for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThrough error, there was supplied to your school 301-1/6 sq. yards of linoleum. We received a credit note for 121 sq. yards that had been returned. The Department therefore paid for 180-1/6 sq. yards of linoleum, at $1.53 a square yard.\n\nI trust that the above is the information you require.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Joe Angin, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSaint Paul, Alberta.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDR. MCGILL\n\nThe following is taken from a letter received by the Minister:\n\n\"You will no doubt recall that in November last I discussed with you the water supply problem at the Blue Quills Indian School. Originally the well used at the school was 327 feet, but due to the fact that the well was not used for a considerable period after it was drilled, the sand seeped in and the bottom of the well became plugged. The water found at the depth of 327 feet was soft and suitable in every way for the purposes of the school. When the well plugged with sand, the casing was opened at a vein of water at 200 feet. This water was hard, and is not altogether suitable. The Indian Agent informs me that the Department now proposes to put in a Water Softener, in order to overcome this difficulty.\n\n\"I have no doubt that I could drill a well to the depth of 327 feet and find an abundant supply of good soft water, and as the water from this new well would be used continuously, it would not plug with sand. This would be much cheaper and far more satisfactory than installing a Water Softener.\n\n\"The cost of a Water Softener of the type required at the School would be about $1500.00. To drill a well 327 feet, provide casing therefor, and install a pump would cost about $700.00. This figure is of course based on the assumption that the pump now in use at the School will be installed in the proposed well.\"\n\nThe Minister would like a report on this matter.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nMarch 16th, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Buckard,\n\nSince the erection of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, the Department has had considerable difficulty with the water supply. This is due to two reasons: (1) the hardness of the water, and (2) the clogging of the pipes owing to very fine sand filtering into them. The situation became rather acute in December, 1932, and we secured the services of the engineers of the Dominion Water Power Bureau. Under their supervision, considerable work was done during the spring and summer of 1933 and, in a report dated August 17th, 1933, Mr. P. A. Petterly, Assistant Hydraulic Engineer, Calgary, wrote as follows:\n\n\"A final visit was made on July 20th to the Blue Quills Residential School. The well was found to be working properly and is producing sufficient water for all purposes. This water is rather hard, as shown by the analysis, but the school engineer, in the absence of Father Amos, stated that it was 'pretty good although a little hard'. A letter from the Director, dated June 17th, stated that no funds were available at the present time for the installation of a water softener and that, so long as the water supply remains adequate as to quantity, no further action will be taken at this time. The matter of a softener will thus remain in abeyance as long as conditions are as at present.\"\n\nThis Department has, therefore, not considered installing a water softener at the Blue Quills School nor have any complaints regarding the water supply been received from either the Indian Agent or the Principal since the date of the report quoted above.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDUPLICATE, FOR DEPARTMENT.\n\nBank of Montreal,\n\n$80.00\n\nOttawa, Apr. 5th/34.\n\nRECEIVED from W.E.

Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, June 20th, 1934.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to your 407-11A of the 16th instant, I regret that no provision was made in our current year's appropriation for the erection of a granary at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nI have the honour to report on an inspection of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School in the Saddle Lake Agency, which I visited on my recent trip to that Agency. I might say that I spent the greater part of a day making this inspection. I found there were 125 children in residence at that time.\n\nI am pleased to report that conditions at this institution are very favourable. The children all looked exceptionally well and were enjoying the best of health. I made a thorough inspection of everything in connection with the work at the school with the exception of the Class-room work, on which the Department receive a report from the Provincial School Inspector. The girls do a great deal of sewing, fancywork, &c., and the handicraft work done by them is splendid. They make their own dresses, boys' suits, &c. and are given all the usual training received in residential schools.\n\nDoctor Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nThe girls also do some outside work in the way of planting and looking after gardens, etc. The boys look after the stable, cattle, etc., and do a certain amount of farm work \u2014 about the same as at the average Indian residential school on the prairie. The Principal brought to my attention that with the staff he has there he could also arrange to give the boys some instruction in blacksmithing and carpenter work. They have the shop, but not sufficient tools to bring this training into force. The Indian fathers expressed the desire that the Department make arrangements to have their sons get some training in blacksmithing and carpenter work as it would be so useful to them when they came back to the reserve. I realize the Department have no funds for this purpose at the present time, but this is something that should be brought into force at every residential school. As soon as I have time, I shall write to the Department on this matter in connection with all our schools.\n\nI checked over the children's clothing supply and found they were well provided for: The girls have five changes of dresses; the boys three changes; and all have the necessary underwear, socks, etc.\n\nIt is not necessary for me to go into detail regarding the work at this institution, as I consider everything is going along satisfactorily. I heard no\ncomplaints whatever regarding this school and I think it is being well managed. The children are well fed and clothed which is quite evident from their appearance. Mr. Sutherland, our Acting Superintendent of Education visited this institution last fall. The enrolment is also very fair now: There are very few children of school age available and every endeavour will be made to recruit them after the holidays.\n\nThe building, of course, is in a first class state of repair, although the cement floors are not improving any. Some congooleum rugs were purchased last winter and some battleship linoleum for the halls. I recommended this a year ago last winter when it was not authorized, and did not know it had been furnished until I visited the school this time. The furnishings are all in good shape: This is one thing we can say for the Sisters of Charity, they certainly look after their end of the work and the furnishings are all as good as new. As we have not a lighting plant at this institution, the electricity being supplied from the Town of St. Paul, there is not very much machinery in the school, with the exception of the boilers and laundry machinery. The Principal and the Engineer informed me that this machinery is in a good state of repair, and as far as I could see the engineer seemed to be quite competent.\nThe pump is in good condition and the school has an ample supply of water, although it is very hard. I shall leave this matter to Mr. Fetterly to deal with.\n\nThe school raised an excellent garden last fall and 1000 bushels of potatoes, turnips 150 bushels, peas 25 bushels, beans 30, carrots 14, beets 12, salsifiss 6, parsnips 6, onions 6, sweet corn 2, tomatoes 2, cucumbers 1, table turnips 1, cauliflower 300 heads and cabbages 500 heads, as well as some celery, cress, radishes, &c. They have 12 horses, 1 bul 1, 19 cows, 10 steers 24 yearlings and 10 calves, or 64 head of cattle in all, 70 pigs but no chickens. They have 30 acres in wheat, 50 in oats, 50 in green feed and expect to break 30 acres. This year they are having 1\u00bd acres of garden and 4 acres of potatoes. The Principal expects in a few years to have about 200 acres of land under cultivation. This is about all that can be cultivated without a lot of breaking.\n\nThe staff consists of the Principal, Rev. Father Jos. Angin, an Assistant Principal, 11 Sisters of Charity belonging to the Grey Nuns Order, 1 male teacher, 1 engineer, 1 baker and shoe-maker, 1 disciplinarian, 1 farmer, 1 gardener and two labourers.\n\nThe children of the school had just recently taken part in a Musical Festival at St. Paul, competing against some 40 or 50 outside schools. There were\nthree prizes and although they did not participate in any of these, they received favourable mention by the Adjudicators and those who heard them said they had done very well. They sang their songs for me while I was at the school and I thought it was splendid.\n\nThe school is very well managed generally, and they have a very efficient staff of Sisters. The finances of the institution are better now as they are raising some crop each year and will soon have sufficient to supply all their own meat.\n\nIf the Department have any funds available to buy some paint for interior work in the school, this could be made good use of as some of the walls on the boys' side of the building are beginning to require some decorating. As I have often said, if a little paint is supplied each year the work could be performed by the boys and in this way the walls can always be kept in good condition.\n\nTrusting this report will be of interest to you,\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

I bought a new fusible plug that was replaced at once by the engineer.\n\nHoping this information will give satisfaction, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, July 19, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your account for $25.00 for inspecting the boilers at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. Payment of this account is being made, but I would point out that neither the Department nor the Principal of the School has yet received a copy of your report regarding the condition of these boilers.\n\nPlease let me know if you issue reports following your visits, and, if so, to whom they are sent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am enclosing the boiler inspection certificates issued for these inspections, Nos. 5470, 11, 14. I would ask you to please forward these certificates to the Principal of the School, when you have noted the reports, this is to comply with the Provincial \"Boiler's Act\", which requires that these certificates be posted up in the engine or boiler room of the plant.\n\nHoping this is the information you require, and thanking you for your attention to this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nH.G. Alexander,\nBoiler Inspector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 23, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received the reports of the Provincial Boiler Inspector on his inspection on June 15, last, of the three boilers at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note that the Inspector recommends, in connection with boilers Nos. 9556 and 9557, that a stop valve be installed in feed line between check valve and boiler. In connection with the inspection of boiler No. 9558, he recommends that fusible plug be renewed; also that condensate from drier be returned direct from trap to boiler, as this will save fuel, water, etc.\n\nI would request that you instruct the Principal to see that the Inspector's recommendations are carried out. No doubt, the engineer at the school can do this work and it should be carried out without cost to the Department.\n\nThe Inspection Certificates are enclosed herewith, and I would request that you hand them to the Principal to be posted up in the boiler room of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I regret that acknowledgment of the report was not made at that time.\n\nIt is noted that conditions, generally, at the school were satisfactory at the time of your visit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSaddle Lake, Alberta,\nJanuary 31st, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nAlso cheque No. 57225 for $10.00 for amount received from sale of one old bath tub, part of the old Blue Quill's school equipment which was left for disposal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E. Gullion.\nIndian Agent\nThe Principal brought to my attention that the water that was used in the institution is very hard and corrodes the water pipes. I checked this matter over and found that this was correct and if this is allowed to continue, we no doubt will have considerable trouble with the water system in a very short time. A water softener was mentioned, but I might say that I have had very little experience with this, but I believe that there are several makes of water softeners that are giving good satisfaction and in my opinion this matter should be looked into by the Department. It would be easy to get a test of the water and ascertain what makes of water softener will give the best satisfaction.\n\nThe machinery, boilers, etc., in the school appear to all be in good order and the Engineer that looks after the machinery, boilers, etc., apparently has the necessary qualifications, as I could find no fault with the condition the machinery and boilers were in.\n\nThe Department is aware that the only out-buildings with the exception of make-shift buildings, is the barn. This, I also found to be in good order and well kept. The floors are still in A. I. shape, stanchions, etc. Last fall, the Principal had a log stable built for the cattle, as there is not sufficient stable room in the barn to house the number of cattle they now have at the school. I wish to again bring to the attention of the Department that the school requires a chicken-coop, implement shed and granary.\nOttawa, August 12, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 407-11 of the 2nd instant, reporting on your inspection, at the end of June, last, of the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department is pleased to note that you found the buildings in a good state of repair and well taken care of, and also that the friction that had taken place between the Indians and the school has died down. It is noted, further, that there is an efficient staff and that conditions, generally, were satisfactory.\n\nRegarding the installation of a water softener and the erection of certain outbuildings, I have to say that our Estimates for the current fiscal year provide the following items:\n\nWater softener - $2,000.\nErection of a granary and hen-house - $1,400.\n\nThe Department will make enquiry here with reference to the supplying of a water softener.\n\nRegarding the amount provided for the erection of the granary and hen-house, I would request that you take up this matter with the school authorities, informing them of the funds available for material and labour. You should ascertain the size and type of buildings and also how you would recommend the work be carried out. Could the local Agent or yourself arrange for the purchase of building material, etc., from firms on the approved list and have the work carried out under the supervision of the Agent or the Principal of the School? I should like to have your report, also, concerning the labour that would be necessary, other than that which could be performed by the staff of the school. As full particulars as possible regarding this matter would be appreciated.\n\nWhen your report is received, the necessary authority will be given to proceed with the work, in so far as the funds mentioned above permit.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

I have written to the Principal of the School to ascertain what type of buildings they require, and our Agent can look after the purchase of material, etc. There is just one lumber yard at St. Paul, three miles from the school, and they are on the approved list. We get all material from there at a very fair rate. I would suggest that the school be asked to haul material, and I have made reference to this in my letter to Father Angin today. The only carpenter on the list in St. Paul is Mr. Fraser, and instead of hiring him and his men by the day I would suggest that this work be done on a tender, all material to be supplied by us and the labour to be done for a certain sum. I am sure the Department are aware that where we have no foreman of our own on a job, it is liable to be costly if labour is paid by the day, whereas when it is under tender, it does not matter very much how long it takes. As soon as I hear from Father Angin in this connection, I shall again get in touch with the Department.\n\nRegarding the water softener, I might say that the Manager of Webb Water Softener Company here has called on me several times. I know very little about the quality of their equipment as I have had no experience whatever in water softeners, but I am advising this firm to get in touch with the Department, so you will no doubt be hearing from them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMr. Christianson,\nInspectorate.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nAugust 14, 1935.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR.

The Hayward Lumber Company at St. Paul have given us a 15% discount on their regular price on the lumber, and a 10% discount on the hardware.\n\nThe size of the granary required is 24' x 50' with 8' studs. This building will be on a surface cement foundation, well built in every way, the walls to be of common sheeting and siding, and the necessary bins to be provided. It is large enough to take care of the grain raised by the school, and to provide adequate space to keep chop and do the cleaning of the grain, &c. The price of material for the building is quoted at $710.94, and the labour was estimated at $225.00 by Mr. H. S. Fraser of St. Paul. The chicken-house would be 15' x 40' with 7' studs in the back and 9' studs in front. The cost of material for this is quoted at $487.75 and the labour at $190.00. This chicken-house is to accommodate about 200 chickens, which is just about what the school requires. In all, these two buildings would cost $1613.69, or about $200.00 more than the allowance made by the Department, but I note you have allowed $2000.00 for the water softener and I am sure you will be able to effect some saving there.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nAs I mentioned in my previous letter, I would advise going on with this work immediately, and that we be authorized to purchase the material from the Hayward Lumber Company, and that Mr. Fraher be given the work of erecting both buildings on tender. The material will be hauled out by the school teams, and the Principal can look after the erection of the buildings, and our agent can visit the school occasionally to see how things are progressing, and can look after the accounts, &c. I expect to be up at Saddle Lake within the next three weeks or so myself.\n\nI trust this will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Christianson, Inspector of Indian Affairs, Alberta Inspectorate, we are quoting you herewith prices on a Webb Water Softener for the Blue Quills School, at St. Paul, Alberta.\n\nThe Softener which we propose to supply for this school is designed by the Webb Manufacturing Company of Kansas City, Mo. and manufactured by us in Calgary, according to their specifications. Owing to the extreme hardness of the water, we have selected their Down-flow Model. This type of Softener is an excellent filter as well as a Softener.\n\nThe Softener Equipment is composed of a Softener Tank and a Brine Tank with connections.\n\nThe Softener Tank would be 27\" in diameter by 72\" high, made of 10 gauge plate, hot galvanized, inside and out after welding.\n\nThe Brine Tank would be 27\" in diameter, by 48\" high, hot galvanized and of 14 gauge, with cover.\n\nThe Pipes, Fittings and Valves as shown on the enclosed sketch will be one inch.\n\nA Four Way Control Valve, is on the water supply line to the Softener. With this the water flow can be reversed, for back-washing, thus throwing out all sediment which may have accumulated during the period of operation.\n\nThe Salt necessary for regeneration would be 96 pounds.\n\nWe understand that the water at the Blue Quills School has 42 grains of hardness per gallon, and that approximately 4000 gallons of water might be used each day; therefore we propose to furnish a Softener with a capacity to meet this requirement and we guarantee this Softener to do this.\n\nThe Zeolite (trade name \"Webbolite\") which we use in this Softener is\nSt. Paul Alberta,\nSept 3rd, 1925\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nHon.

Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nCALGARY, Alberta.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn your request I visited the Blue Quill Indian School at St. Paul with a view to seeing what could be done in connection with sewage odors, which were proving offensive to the inmates of the School. The Principal, Father Angin, informed me that the odor emanated from the septic tank itself, and that no objectionable odors resulted from the method used in finally disposing of the tank effluent in the nearby slough.\n\nUpon examining the tank I found that screens had been placed over the openings above the weirs, to prevent the scum blanket, which forms in the tank proper, from entering the pumping chamber. The scum blanket in the tank had risen to a height at least a foot above the weir and the effluent from the septic tank found its way with difficulty into the pumping chamber. If the septic tank system was laid in accordance with the plan given me by Father Angin, dated August 19th, 1930, this rising of the scum blanket would naturally block up the incoming sewer to such an extent that the soil pipes of the building would not perform their ventilating function. The plan indicates that the invert elevation of the sewer from the building is 86.4, as is the weir elevation. Consequently a rise of one foot in the scum\nblanket above weir level would cut off ventilation through the soil pipes as previously mentioned. Since the gases found in the tank have no means of escape, other than into the pumping chamber, the latter result takes place. From the pumping chamber the gas rises to the building above the pumping chamber and thence reaches the outside air through the door of the aforementioned building.\n\nAs a corrective to the nuisance, I would propose three schemes.\n\n1. The construction of a vent stack leading from the pump chamber out through the roof of the building. This would be the cheapest solution but probably the least efficient, as it would not be very easy to raise the stack very high above the roof of the building.\n\n2. The construction of a vent stack leading from the pump chamber underground to the side of the School and thence up the wall. In this manner the gases might be raised to a greater height and would be less likely to create a nuisance and then only under ideal barometric and wind conditions.\n\n3. The blocking up of the weirs, doing away with the screens and substituting two or three elbows so constructed that their long arms would be submerged in the liquid below the scum blanket of the septic tank. By so doing the gases formed in the septic tank would have greater difficulty getting into the pumping chamber, and better air conditions could be maintained in the latter place. Moreover, I think that the invert elevation of that part of the elbow leading to the pumping chamber should be at least six inches lower than that of the present weir. By so doing the scum blanket would not build up so easily and thereby block up the ventilation of the tank proper through the soil pipes of the building. I am, of course, assuming that there are no traps on the line leading from the soil pipe to the septic tank. Father Anglin had no plans available from which I could ascertain this fact.\n\nI think the carrying out of Scheme 3 should be carried out whatever else is done, and that in the event of there still being trouble, Scheme 2 should be carried out. It is my opinion, however, that if Scheme 3 were carried out, no further difficulties would be encountered providing the scum blanket in the septic tank were not allowed to rise to such an extent as to block off the ventilation to the roof. This could only be carried out by periodically\npumping out the septic tank proper.\n\nShould you require further assistance I should be glad to help you and trust that the report thus submitted is what you require.\n\nI am also enclosing the travelling expenses incurred in quintuplicate. No charge is being made for my time. I regret that I cannot furnish receipts as my method of travelling under the Provincial Government does not require the same in connection with the use of my own car.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDUDLEY B. MENZIES,\nProvincial Sanitary Engineer.\nSir:\n\nI beg to bring to the attention of the Department that on several different occasions I have reported that there was a very bad odour from the sewer at Blue Quills School. On days when the wind blows in a direction from the sewer to the School the odour in and around the building is most unpleasant, and both the Sisters and the Principal have complained of this to me every time I was there. Sometime ago I got in touch with the Provincial Government Health Department and they advised me that they would send one of their Sanitary Engineers to the School whenever he was up in that part of the country, and I am now in receipt of a report from Mr. Dudley B. Menzies, Provincial Sanitary Engineer of the Department of Public Health, in which he makes three suggestions, and I am enclosing this report herewith. I trust this matter will receive the consideration of the Department, and you will note that Mr. Menzies states that should we require further assistance he would be glad to be of service to us.\n\nI am also attaching hereto the voucher for his travelling expenses in the amount of $21.30, which I trust will be passed by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nOttawa, Sept. 21, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 407-11A of the 13th instant, regarding the condition of the sewage disposal system at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School and enclosing a communication which you received from the Provincial Sanitary Engineer, who examined this service and who gives three suggestions to remedy present conditions.\n\nThe Department will approve of you arranging for the carrying out of Scheme No. 3, as outlined by the Sanitary Engineer, as follows:\n\nThe blocking up of the weirs, doing away with the screens and substituting two or three elbows so constructed that their long arms would be submerged in the liquid below the scum blanket of the septic tank. By so doing, the gases formed in the septic tank would have greater difficulty getting into the pumping chamber, and better air conditions could be maintained in the latter place. Moreover, I think that the invert elevation of that part of the elbow leading to the pumping chamber should be at least six inches lower than that of the present weir. By so doing, the scum blanket would not build up so easily and thereby block up the ventilation of the tank proper through the soil pipes of the building. I am, of course, assuming that there are no traps on the line leading from the soil pipe to the septic tank.\n\nThe Engineer has not given an estimate of the cost of carrying out this scheme, but, if it should not exceed\n\nM.

A ...\n\nCatalogue of Water Pumping Systems\nand\nWater Purification Equipment\n\nGUARANTEED\nDURO\nMADE BY\nPUMPS & SOFTENERS\nLIMITED\nLONDON, CANADA\n\nManufactured in Canada\nBy\nPUMPS AND SOFTENERS, LIMITED\nLONDON, ONTARIO\nThey all can't be wrong\n\nThe original letters from which the reproductions shown below have been taken are all on file at our offices, and their names and addresses, together with countless others, will be supplied on request.\n\n\"A Duro Pump on a Power Line will give you water at anytime\"\n\nThe Theory of Pumping\n\nThe one natural law which makes possible the operation of pumping equipment is the fact that atmospheric pressure is constant. A blanket of air extends around the earth and has been proved that at sea level this blanket or weight exerts a pressure of 14.7 lbs. per square inch. As we ascend higher into the atmosphere, of course this blanket gets not so thick and consequently the pressure decreases. For example, on a mountain top 50 feet above sea level the atmosphere only weighs 12.1 lbs. per square inch.\n\nA cubic inch of water weighs .039 of a pound, so we find that it takes a column of atmospheric pressure in area of 3306 ft. sq. to weigh 14.7 lbs., or as much as a column of atmospheric pressure in area of 25 ft. sq. at sea level.\n\nNow take the case of the drilled well as in fig. 1. If we now provide some mechanical means for raising all of our pressure to a height sufficient to climb up the tube \"A,\" then the air pressure outside the tube will permeate the soil and force the water to rise in the tube as shown to a height equal to the air pressure outside, i.e., 14.7 lbs. per square inch, which is equivalent to a height of 25 ft. At 1000 ft. above sea level, owing to the air pressure only being 12.1 lbs. per square inch, the water would only rise 27.7 ft. In other words, the water would rise 2.6 ft. for every 100 ft. of elevation. In other words, and at sea level the safe limit the water would rise is 25 ft. with a drop of 2 ft. for every point less in air pressure than 14.7 or 1/4 ft. drop in suction lift for every 1000 ft. elevations above sea level.\n\nIn what we call a Shallow Well Pump, the pump cylinder acts in exactly the same way, too, as described in fig. 2, located anywhere within 25 ft. of the surface. The piston is connected to the power mechanism which operates the plunger so that this type of pump can only pump water to a vertical depth at a level of not more than 25 ft. above the surface of the water and the suction cylinder \"H\" must be kept below (for every 100 ft. of horizontal run in the suction pipe).\n\nIn the sectional cut Fig. 2, of a double acting Shallow Well water box, we have demonstrated how the course taken by the water. On the plunger stroke to the left, it comes up the suction pipe \"B\" and enters the lower seat valve \"E.\" On the plunger stroke to the right, the valve \"D\" will close and the water trapped in chamber \"E\" will be forced by the plunger up through the discharge valve \"C\" and into the delivery pipe. Of course, the reverse action takes place on the stroke of the plunger.\n\nIn a Deep Well of anything over 25 ft. from surface of water to water level, if there is no water, it is necessary to connect the pump cylinder to the water at a distance of 25 ft. from the well surface and connect it to the power head by means of a rod commonly known as a sucker rod. This necessitates the power head being placed at least 25 ft. above the well at all times. To prevent the possibility of the sucker rod coming it is advisable to use the proper length of connecting or drop pipe and sucker rod so that the pump cylinder is immediately off the deck.\n\nIn Fig. 3 we show a sectional view of an open type single acting Deep Well Pump cylinder, the type most commonly used. These are also close type cylinders and act in exactly the same manner as the double acting plunger, allowing the lower seat valve to be removed by simply drawing the sucker rod without the necessity of raising the entire drop pipe and cylinder. On the stroke of the plunger the water is drawn down through the Valve \"K\" remains closed and the water in the Chamber \"I\" is forced up through the Valve \"C\" and into the delivery pipe. On the stroke of the plunger, the valve \"C\" closes and the valve \"K\" opens allowing the water in Chamber \"I\" to pass up through the Valve \"K\" in the plunger into Chamber \"I\".\nDURO PUMPS and WATER SYSTEMS\n\nDURO PUMPS are self-contained machines. They provide a dependable supply of fresh running water under a strong pressure for suburban and farm homes, country estates, schools, institutions, and wherever water under pressure is required beyond the city water mains. They are divided into two classes:\n\nSHALLOW WELL PUMPS: Will draw water at sea level and will lift water to a maximum vertical lift of 25 feet from the well to the suction intake of the pump. The shallow well pump need not be located directly over the source of water supply.\n\nDEEP WELL PUMPS: Should be used when the water level is beyond the reach of a shallow well pump. They may be located from depths down to 500 feet. The deep well pump must be located directly over the well.\n\nSELECTION OF PUMP TYPE. It is very necessary when selecting the type of pump that the fall of the water level in the well or cistern be taken into consideration.\n\nA great many factors enter into the question of whether to maintain their original water level when water is being pumped from them, and therefore, before the water system is chosen the shallow well pump should know the exact fall in the water level. Then base the type system on the fall of the water from the low water level to the point where the pump is installed. If the fall distance is 25 feet or less, use a shallow well pump\u2014and if more than 25 feet, use a deep well pump.\n\nOnce the type of pump has been selected, it is necessary to determine the requirements for water. The table below should be used as a basis for such determination.\n\nTHE WATER SYSTEM: A water system consists of a pump, and also a pressure or storage tank and fittings. During normal operation it is assumed that 25% of the entire tank capacity may be withdrawn between standard 25-45 lb. operating pressures.\n\nMany pump manufacturers base Pump Capacity ratings are based upon normal discharge pressures at normal suction lifts. Many pump manufacturers base their capacities against \"no pressure.\" Were we to do this Duro pump capacities could be drastically lowered. Capacities based upon normal pressures are more realistic in actual applications.\n\nPUMP CAPACITIES: To be used as hot water circulating pumps, or for hot water uses, or for pumping fuel oil, can be furnished at the nominal additional charge of $100.00 list. Such requirements should be especially factored into the selection.\n\nSHALLOW WELL\u2014The size pump and storage tank will depend upon the average daily requirements, the maximum amount of water required during heavy demands, and the storage desired. It is safer to specify a larger capacity than a smaller capacity tank rather than to take into consideration the peak load required.\n\nFor example, a family of five 300 gallons of water per day would be filled quickly? If the peak load does not exceed 50 gallons per hour, then a 100 gallon tank is sufficient. However, if the peak load is expected to be greater for speckling and other requirements, then it is safer to specify a larger size pump and storage tank.\n\nDEEP WELL PUMP sizes depend upon the well characteristics and usually require larger tank sizes than shallow well installations. See page 18, on Deep Well Installations.\n\nHow to Compute Water Requirements\n\nThe following figures are given as a guide in computing the amount of water that might be required for a given condition, and in selecting the proper Duro pump system to fill the requirements. It is first necessary to determine the amount of water that will be required per day. From the following table of average consumption per day can be figured:\n\n- For drinking and cooking: 5 gal. per person per day.\n- To fill average bathtub: 30 gal.\n- To flush water closet: 30 gal.\n- For bath and shower bath: 30 gal. per hour.\n- Continuous flowing drinking fountain: 225 gal. per hour.\n- For sprinkling (3/4\" nozzle) 300 gal. per hour. (10 gal. will sprinkle 100 square feet; 20 gal. will soak 100 square feet.)\n\nHorses: 10 gal. per head per day.\nSheep: 21 gal. per head per day.\nHogs: 17 gal. per head per day.\n\nBy dividing pump capacity per hour into average daily usage, average daily pumping hours can be determined. Pump capacity should be sufficient for maximum usage during any one hour.\n\nThe water requirements usually increase with time, and therefore the pump specified should be sufficiently large to handle such additional requirements.\n\nDirections for Installing\n\nDURO PUMPS are all self-contained and are not dependent upon foundations to maintain alignment of the working parts, but a good foundation is essential to preserve correct position of the pump in relation to the driving mechanism and to avoid undue strain in the pipe connections. The pump should be placed on a secure, solid foundation (a good plank floor is sufficient), and the tank should be mounted so that they can readily be reached from all sides.\n\nSHALLOW WELL PUMPS should be placed near the pipe source of supply if possible. The vertical distance from source of supply to the pump must not exceed 25 feet at sea level. Hot and thick liquids must flow to pump. If the source of supply is at a point where foreign matter may be drawn into the pump, with consequent clogging of valves, a strainer should be installed.\n\nTHE FRICTION PIPE should never be smaller than the suction opening on the pump. In laying the suction line, a uniform grade must be maintained throughout to avoid air pockets which would prevent the water from entering the pump. The friction pipe should be as short as possible and made up of as few bends and turns as possible. Use 45 degree elbows in preference to 90 degree elbows. One gal. of water will pass through a 45 degree elbow with less loss than through a 90 degree elbow. Keep the pump as badly or always, as close to the tank as possible. This will prevent the pump from running badly or periodically prevent its operation. Use a good pipe cement on all joints and pull tight.\n\nTHE CONNECTING PIPE from pump to tank should be as short as possible and as few bends as possible as numerous bends will create an instantaneous back pressure which will act on the pressure switch and cause it to cut in and out before the ultimate tank pressure is built up.\n\nOPERATING\n\nPRIMING: If the Shallow Well Pump takes its suction under difficulties on a new installation, prime by removing the plug in the suction chamber and filling with water. Do not allow the pipe to get too tight or too much air to be drawn into the pump by leaving the pipe too tight or too tight. Tighten enough to prevent leaking.\n\nTHE VALVE and pipe seats should be examined occasionally to see that dirt or pipe cuttings have not become wedged there. If valve seats are roughened, clean with 60 sand paper.\n\nFROST: If pump is located where there is danger of freezing, be sure it is thoroughly drained.\n\nRead Instructions packed with all Duro Pumps.\n\nHOW AND WHEN to Use SHALLOW WELLS\n\nUse DEEP WELLS with Vertical Suction Lifts of 25 feet or more.\n\nDEPT.

This construction also conserves space and makes a compact, totally enclosed efficient job. The motor is up high away from all possible dampness. By installing this pump directly above the well there is a saving of over 20 per cent in horse power over the type of power loads where the relative power is other.\n\nSpecifying Deep Well Pumping Systems\n\nIn the specification of Deep Well Pumps and Systems, the Plumbing Contractor must take into consideration various items in making up his estimate. Many times contractors forget these items or forget them. Many times the plumbing contractor is told that in common practice all items are furnished by the Manufacturer of Deep Well Pumps and Systems that many necessary items are included in the price of the pump head, and consequently he is called upon to make expenditures for these items which reduce, and which sometimes take away all of his anticipated profit on the job.\n\nThe following items must be included in any estimate for Deep Well Pumps and Systems:\n\n1. Power Head\n2. Electric Motor\n3. Wiring for Motor and Switch\n4. Electric Automatic Switch or Controller\n5. Well Cylinder\n6. Brass Relief Valve\n7. Vacuum Chamber\n8.

Set wall forms 2 feet wider and longer than outside dimensions of pit.\n2. Pour walls 3' deep concrete on complete bottom.\n3. Coat top of bottom with tar thoroughly.\n4. Set wall forms.\n\n5. Pour Walls, setting in any pipe first.\n6. Coat inside of walls with tar thoroughly.\n7. Fill in 3\" of concrete around tar on inside for floor.\n8. Fill in dirt around walls.\n9. Set drop pipe down. Tar makes a joint at bottom of pipe and around well casing, or any other pipe that goes through the walls.\n\nS. R. 900 Frost-proof Set Length\n\nDuro Set Lengths are so constructed that the pump head cannot freeze solidly to the pipe box located several inches below the frost line. The discharge line is then taken off from the water box and the danger of freezing is eliminated. The automatic pump is forced with the water box, giving the new absolute protection against freezing.\n\nSupplied for 900, 3000 and 3200 series pumps, regular size feet.\n\nFig. 900 - Duro Guide Couplings\u2014Made from machined cast iron.

The water as rain can be considered as pure water free from any dissolved minerals or gases that may have been present in the clouds. However, pure water is nature's solvent and may be considered an eager to dissolve anything and everything with which it comes in contact. The rain, in its travels through the atmosphere, absorbs carbon dioxide gas, CO\u2082, and also some oxygen, O\u2082. This carbon dioxide is absorbed by the water from decaying vegetation, etc., and it goes down into the upper surface of the earth.\n\nSurface supplies from rivers, lakes, and the like, unless they are fed by subterranean springs, are not as highly dissolved mineral matter than deep well waters because there has been less opportunity for the water to come in contact with the earth. In other words, the well water has had a chance to come in contact with the earth through various layers of the earth's crust and be exposed to various mineral formations and thus dissolve more minerals. It must be remembered, however, that there are rivers in certain localities carrying the drainage from industrial chemicals, plants, etc., which will make the water very hard. If a river can be loaded with dissolved mineral matter whereas at its source in the mountain it may be pure and free from dissolved mineral matter.\n\nWith supplies of water from deep wells and subterranean springs, the story is entirely different. Although pure water will dissolve but very little calcium carbonate (limestone) rain with dissolved carbon dioxide gas dissolves it readily, and as it trickles down through different layers of the earth it dissolves more and more minerals, the soluble bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium, as shown in the following chemical equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{CaCO}_3 + \\text{MgCO}_3 + 2\\text{CO}_2 + \\text{CaCO}_3 + \\text{MgCO}_3 + \\text{CaCO}_3 + \\text{MgCO}_3 \\]\n\nThese bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium are called \"temporary hardness\" of water as distinguished from \"permanent hardness,\" the basis of which are other salts of calcium and magnesium such as sulphate and chloride. These temporary hardnesses are removed by boiling the water. When heated the carbon dioxide is held in solution by the carbon dioxide gas and if the water is boiled the carbon dioxide is driven off to the air and we have removed the insoluble calcium and magnesium bicarbonates from the tea kettle and the scale deposits of a water heater. This is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Soluble CaCO}_3 + \\text{MgCO}_3 + \\text{lime CaO} + \\text{magnesium CaCO}_3 \\]\n\nThis method of removing temporary hardness by boiling water is, of course, too expensive for ordinary use and in practical practice there are two different methods used for softening water in homes. First, the first method devised was the addition of lime CaO to the water containing the soluble calcium bicarbonate and insoluble calcium carbonate is formed which deposits out and is removed by settling. This is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Soluble CaCO}_3 + \\text{lime CaO} + \\text{magnesium CaCO}_3 \\]\n\nA somewhat similar but more complicated method involves the addition of sodium bicarbonate NaHCO\u2083 and the formation of the permanent hardnesses or the sulphate and chloride compounds, soda ash Na\u2082SO\u2084 or sodium carbonate is added.\n\nThe action of the soda ash to change the calcium sulphates and chlorides into sodium sulphates and chlorides which are soluble in water. The non-soluble calcium and further calcium carbonate is deposited and drawn off as sludge. This process is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{Calcium Sulphate CaSO}_4 + \\text{soda ash Na}_2\\text{CO}_3 = \\text{soluble Na}_2\\text{SO}_4 + \\text{insoluble CaCO}_3 \\]\n\nThe time saved in the process of softening, which will be used for some purposes probably preferable but its success depends on the proper feeding of the proper amount of lime and soda to the water as over feeding or under feeding will still leave the water hard.\n\nPUMPS and SOFTENERS LIMITED\n\nLondon, Canada\n\n[22]\n\nHow Duro Water Softeners Perform\n\nChemicals are not used in the actual softening of water by Duro Softeners, as they are all of the zeolite or base exchange type. The term zeolite is applied by chemists to certain classes of mineral which possess a remarkable property of base exchange. It has sodium as a base and is chemically formulated as follows: Na\u2082O\u00b7Al\u2082O\u2083\u00b7SiO\u2082\u00b7yH\u2082O for the purpose of simplification we will refer to Na\u2082Z or Sodium Zeolite.\n\nIn Duro Water Softeners water containing the \"hardness\" salts of calcium and magnesium is passed through a bed of this sodium zeolite and during its passage the sodium of the zeolite exchanges place with the calcium and magnesium in the hard water, resulting in water which is soft as rain water.\n\nThe action is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{CaCO}_3 + \\text{Na}_2\\text{Z} = \\text{CaZ} + \\text{Na}_2\\text{CO}_3 \\]\n\nCalcium bicarbonate-sodium zeolite = sodium bicarbonate + calcium Zeolite.\n\nA similar action takes place with all the other salts of calcium and magnesium present in hard water.\n\nOf course, when a certain amount of hard water has been passed through the sodium zeolite all its available sodium will have been exchanged for calcium and magnesium and it becomes necessary to replace the sodium. This is done by what we call the regenerating process and simply consists of passing a solution of ordinary salt (NaCl) through the zeolite which is now a calcium and magnesium zeolite and the calcium and magnesium will be exchanged for the sodium in the salt. The action is represented by the following chemical equation:\n\n\\[ \\text{CaZ} + \\text{NaCl} = \\text{CaCl} + \\text{NaZ} \\]\n\nexhausted calcium zeolite + salt = regenerated sodium zeolite + calcium chloride.\n\nA sufficient amount of salt or brine solution is used at each regeneration to completely reform the sodium zeolite.\n\nAs will be seen from the above reactions, hard water after zeolite softening will be completely softened to zero hardness. It will be non-scale forming and will neither instantly nor will it contain less dissolved mineral salts. In every case the calcium and magnesium salts in hard water have been changed to corresponding sodium salts which have no hardening effect and are not objectionable.\n\nThere are two general types of zeolites, natural minerals, processed to a certain extent, and manufactured minerals. The absorptive capacity of a mineral and its length of life is, of course, the most important part of any zeolite softener. The quality of processed natural zeolites, which are generally dark green in color, will depend largely on the uniformity of the deposit from which they have been mined and they do not have as great an absorptive capacity per cubic foot as the various manufactured zeolites.\n\nIn Duro Softeners we use a manufactured zeolite of the highest quality\u2014it is a pure white, colorless, 100 per cent active material\u2014high in capacity, super rapid working and extremely efficient. Our zeolite is large and the size, large grains or small, is not so important to the type of floater required. Each grain is rugged and homogeneous and they are angular in shape and will not pack to restrict the flow of water or cause channelling.\n\nThey are hard\u2014so hard they will scratch glass and resistant to erosion or abrasion.\n\nIt has 3 to 4 times the capacity per cubic foot of the average natural zeolite and its superiority is largely due to the fact that its capacity is not lost and the regeneration of the granules are what they are made to be, it is said to be as soft as milk or rapid acting. The regeneration with salt or brine is accomplished as fast as it is possible to pass the solution through the softener. The entire regeneration process, including delivery of the water to the tank, is completed in about 6 minutes. By using our large zeolite, the number of granules required for washing the zeolite bed free from brine is quite a factor. With Duro synthetic zeolite of high capacity a tank of smaller area can be used, greatly reducing the total water required for regeneration.\n\nIn many cases, where a Zeolite Softener using natural or green sand mineral has been outgrown (either as to capacity or rate) it has proven more economical to change the old equipment to operate with our high capacity zeolite. We have competent engineers on our staff and if you have present softening apparatus not functioning properly, consult us and we will gladly make suggestions.\nDURO\n\nWhy a Duro Water Softener is a Necessity in the Home\n\nIt is quite possible that through the water from your faucets may be clear and sparkling; it may contain mineral compounds injurious to skin, hair, food and clothing and cause clogging of pipes.\n\nIn the past the use of cistern or collected rain water has been advocated for household purposes. However, its use in association with decayed vegetable matter and possible animal matter makes it positively dangerous.\n\nWhen soap is used with so-called hard water microscopic gummy particles are formed which stick to the water and coat the particles, dog parsley, stick to your hair; coat the fibers of fine fabrics and form that hard scale in your boiler.\n\nThis hardness in water is one of the greatest known causes of skin irritations, chapped hands, dryness and scaling and many prominent physicians have testified to the adverse effects of hard water on stones, gutters, constipation, kidney complaints and other diseases of the digestive organs and general health.\n\nMany a housewife has wondered why her linens, cottons and silks wear out so fast. She does not know that the continual irritation by hard water causes them to break down faster than they would otherwise. Launderers learned this lesson a long time ago and today every modern laundry uses soft water. You too can learn what thousands have shown\u2014return your washing beautifully soft and white.\n\nHard Water is also a poor cook\u2014an enemy of our kitchen. It toughens bread, cakes, muffins, biscuits, pancakes, corn and makes poor pastry. Many times you no doubt have wondered at the freshness, natural color and flavor of the food cooked by your neighbor while yours is on the table cold and tasteless. Hard water causes loss of flavor in coffee and tea and many of the large ranges of restaurant type boilers which you see in the best hotels and restaurants use only tea and coffee when using softened water.\n\nNot only does lime deposit in your kettle. The same deposits, only bigger and stronger, line your furnace coils and hot water pipes wherever hard water is used. Lime deposits in the pipe will prevent the heat from getting through, accumulating cement-like deposits until some day the flow will be entirely stopped and pounding occurs with a possible explosion. This can happen in any size pipe. If only the first few feet of your water heating plant\u2014it has been proven that a coating of 1/10\" thick causes a fuel loss of approximately 10%.\n\nThe degree of hardness varies with different water supplies, but in waters with hardness as low as 6 grains per gallon you get all of the above troubles. Considerable research has been carried out and the results of these tests recorded and tabulated and the saving given below is a conservative estimate for a family of five using softened water as against hard water.\n\n| Annual Expense | Saving |\n|----------------|--------|\n| Saving of half annual soup bill\u2014soup consumed based on 13\u00bd lbs. per person per week for all | $40.00 | $20.00 |\n| Saving of 10% of annual expenditure for washable clothes, sheets, towels, etc., due to much longer wearing | 250.00 | 25.00 |\n| Saving of 75% of annual maintenance cost of repairs to heating plant, water heater, etc. | 30.00 | 22.50 |\n| Saving in tea, coffee, sugar and many other foods | 25.00 | |\n\nTOTAL ANNUAL SAVINGS: $92.50\n\nThe saving in fuel for heating domestic hot water has not been included, but a conservative estimate places this at $10.00 annually.\n\nFor confirmation of above figures, see booklet compiled and presented by R.

A softener selected on this basis should be regenerated once each week in order to keep the mineral in the best condition at all times. This prevents the mineral from becoming exhausted at any time and insures maximum capacities and efficiency.\n\nPUMPS and SOFTENERS LIMITED\n\nDuro Mon-O-Matic Water Softener\n\nAutomatic regeneration is accomplished by simply pushing lever into starting position. A simple float control then takes care of three cycles of regeneration before washing of minerals, rinsing with fresh water and refilling the brine tank. The complete cycle then automatically returns to starting position and recovers soft water supply.\n\nThe complete valve and float control unit is protected under the removable dome on top of the brine tank, thus making possible for the first time a fully enclosed unit, without any pipes or tubes exposed.\n\nThe complete regenerating cycle takes only a few minutes once each week, according to the size softener selected. There is no interruption to soft water supply, because starting lever can be pushed into regenerating position at night or during any half hour period when soft water is not being used.\n\nThe only attention needed, simply push the starting lever, the Mon-O-Matic does the rest.\n\n| Size | Grain Gal. | Flow Rate | Overall Dimensions | Salt Storage | Shipping Weight |\n|------|------------|-----------|--------------------|--------------|----------------|\n| No.  | Capacity   | G.P.M.    | Fittings | Depth | Width | Height |          |\n| M-70 | 10,000     | 12        | \u00bc       | 20    | 28    | 58     | 200 lbs. |\n| M-71 | 20,000     | 16        | \u00bc       | 20    | 30    | 58     | 200 lbs. |\n| M-72 | 30,000     | 10        | \u00bc       | 20    | 30    | 60     | 200 lbs. |\n\nDivide grain gallons by hardness of water to determine gallons of soft water.\n\nPUMPS and SOFTENERS LIMITED\nDuro Single Control Valve Water Softener\n\nS.

Their use for boiler feed waters and laundry purposes is, of course, pre-eminent, but considerable savings have been effected in other industries, such as sugar making, canning especially peas and beans, preparation of certain extracts, tanning, especially leather tanning, dyeing, printing, paper making, textile finishing, bleaching and dyeing, textile fabrics, cooling of condensers and internal combustion engines, washing automobile bodies, and in fact, wherever hard water is detrimental.\n\nIn laundering using water of 14 to 20 grain hardness a saving of as much as two-thirds of the soap bill has been effected where softeners were installed and considerable saving also made in fuel bills because of scale-free boilers. With commercial laundries of today, it has been found economical to use softeners even though the water has but 5 or 6 grains per gallon hardness.\n\nEven since the steam boiler was invented boiler scale and sludge has been one of the major problems of steam boiler operation. The advent of the modern high pressure boiler with its greater rate of heat transfer, difficulties caused by boiler deposits have been greatly intensified. Today the correct treatment of boiler feed water has become not only a money and labor saving convenience, but an absolute necessity.\n\nEven with waters as low as 2 or 3 grain hardness, when used in boilers where the percentage of make up water is large, concentration by evaporation is always taking place and it is evident that as concentration proceeds, precipitation will occur sufficient to cause corrosion by concentration of the water within the boiler.\n\nThe scale deposit is the result of heat insulating the boiler tubes and reducing their efficiency. In low pressure steam boilers and ordinary water heating apparatus it is roughly figured that a scale deposit of 1/16 inch over the boiler tube will cause a loss of 10%. In high pressure boilers, even a thin egg shell deposit is costly and dangerous. This is due to the fact that the rate of heat transfer in a high pressure boiler is much greater and the rise in the temperature of the boiler metal due to scale is directly proportional to the rate of heat transfer. Axial scale forms at a rate directly proportional to the heat transfer which in turn varies directly as to the heat transfer. Thus that in a high pressure boiler a scale deposit will form more rapidly and be many times more dangerous to over heating of boiler metal than in low pressure boilers. This accounts for the so-called \"bagging\" or failure of boiler tubes.\n\nWhen Duro treated water is used in a steam boiler no scale or sludge will form. The tubes and boiler metal will always remain clean and the unit will be guaranteed trouble free for years at a minimum rate of resistance. Therefore, operating costs are kept at a minimum and repairs and replacements become only a small percentage of what they were formerly.\n\nIt is sometimes stated that zero soft water causes boiler corrosion. This statement is entirely erroneous, as boiler corrosion is caused either by dissolved oxygen or acids in the water. The most frequent cause is the presence of dissolved oxygen or air. Dry air, of course, will not attack steel but the combination of oxygen and water will soon rust or corrode, and therefore boiler feed water which contains these elements should be removed. This can usually be accomplished by the use of a deaerator or various types of boilers especially boiling points. However, high pressure boilers, rather than go to this expense, it is recommended to use a boiler feed water of 1 or 2 grain hardness, allowing a slight protective scale to form as a coating against corrosion.\n\nAs the water in a steam boiler is evaporated into steam, the dissolved salts present are left as a concentrate known as boiler blowdown. There is a limit beyond which it is not safe to continue these salts because of the attendant foaming or priming. These concentrations can be removed by periodic blowing off or installation of a continuous blowdown system.\n\nWe have competent engineers on our staff and will gladly survey your water problems.

There is protection to women's clothing and it is a fact that the presence of linen has been ruined when washed in water containing iron. Many times a water softener has been installed only to find that the capacity would be kept, but due to the amount of iron in the water, the capacity is greatly reduced and this of course is overcome by the installation of an Iron Removal Filter.\n\nDirection of Water Flow through Filter\n\n1. In Filtering Position:\n   The water enters the top of the tank and flows downward through the mineral bed, removing the sediment and iron held in solution.\n\n2. In Backwash Position:\n   The water enters the bottom of the tank and flows upward through the mineral bed, removing the sediment collected throughout and on top of the mineral bed.\n\n3. In Reconditioning Position:\n   The water enters the top of the tank, dissolves the restoring salts and flows downward through the mineral tank, regenerating and sterilizing the mineral bed.\n\nOne of the most important places for pure water is hospitals and clinics. An Iron Removal Filter will often save such institutions hundreds of dollars in producing pure, healthful and clean water. Sometimes pure drinking water must be purchased (filled water) this condition can be eliminated by the use of an Iron Removal Filter.\n\nIn schools, the prospects are good for the sale of an Iron Removal Filter and Purifier. In greenhouses, where water is so essential to the growth of plants, it is necessary to have pure water because a film is often deposited on the glass, holding back the sun's rays, which is so important to valuable hot house plants. The effect of pure water on the growth of plants is very marked.\n\nHotels and other public places depending on favorable public opinion naturally must keep their water supply pure. They purchase as a standard An Iron Removal Filter will oftentimes overcome an objectionable water problem in such institutions.\n\nPUMPS and SOFTENERS LIMITED\n\nDuro Style \"B\" Pressure Filters\n\nDuro Pressure Filters are providing clean, clear water wherever water is being used. The style \"B\" Pressure Filter is recommended where only a moderate volume of water is needed. A single filter or a battery of two or more units can be used to secure the desired capacity. The style \"B\" Pressure Filter is built of steel, welded into one piece and suitable for working pressures up to 100 lbs. A deep bed of special wash sand, supported by fine grade of screen and filter gravel acts as the filtering medium which removes the suspended impurities from the water. Beneath the gravel is the underdrain system which collects the filtered water and also distributes the water during backwashing.\n\nThe Single Control Valve with its lettered dial assures proper operation by even an inexperienced attendant. Movement of the lever to the proper dial indication gives the desired operation. A sight glass, duplex pressure gauge, air relief and sampling cocks are provided as standard equipment.\n\nTo make the filter more than a strainer, it is necessary to use a coagulant to provide an efficient mat on the surface of the filter bed. As water passes to the filter a very small amount of alum solution is added to it by the automatic coagulant feeder. The alum forms an insoluble floe or precipitate which gathers together the fine particles of suspended matter and assists in removing impurities held by the filter. Its action can be compared to that of the white of egg in clearing coffee. The alum floe stays in the filter until removed during the backwashing.\n\nSpecifications\n\n| Size | Area | Capacity | Approx. Wt., Lbs.

A single filter or a battery of two or more filters may be used to secure the desired capacity.\n\nThe Style \"E\" Filter is built of steel welded inside and outside, insulated to a pressure of 100 pounds per square inch and suitable for any working pressure up to 67 pounds. Style \"E\" Filters for higher working pressures can be furnished at a slight additional cost. All immersed pipes, valves and fittings necessary for the operation are furnished.\n\nA Coagulant Feeder is furnished with each filter or battery of filters. It is sight glass mounted on the wash water outlet to show the condition of the wash water and re-wash water, so that the operator can see when the filter is clean.\n\nThe Style \"E\" Filter in three or more units is recommended where it is desired to wash the filters with filtered water, or where sufficient wash water cannot be available to wash a single filter of the required capacity.\n\nCoagulant and Artificial Alkalinity Feeder\n\nWhen the filter is to be used in connection with circulation and clarification of water for swimming pools, an alum feeder should be used. Neutralization of the water finally exhausts the alkalinity of the water and unless artificial alkalinity, such as soda, is supplied, the coagulant floc is not formed and free alum will pass through the filter. For such work and for waters low in natural alkalinity, the use of two feeders, one for alum and one for soda, is to be recommended.\n\n| Size | Area | Capacity | Shell Filter Bed | Dimensions |\n|------|------|----------|------------------|------------|\n|      |      |          |                  | Width Depth Height |\n| 30\"  | 491  | 600      | 500              | 1655 25\" 37\" 8\" |\n| 36\"  | 7.02 | 846      | 1200             | 2308 25\" 41\" 8\" |\n| 42\"  | 11.05| 1200     | 1600             | 3062 32\" 49\" 9\" |\n| 48\"  | 12.57| 1510     | 2000             | 3816 39\" 57\" 9\" |\n| 54\"  | 14.09| 1800     | 2500             | 4570 46\" 65\" 9\" |\n| 60\"  | 16.63| 2500     | 3000             | 5324 53\" 73\" 9\" |\n\n*Capacity figured at rate of 2 gallons per minute per sq. ft. of filter area.\n\n**Capacity figured at rate of 3 gallons per minute per sq. ft. of filter area.\n\n***Underdrain with umbrella nozzles.\n\n****Operation with Perforated Laterals.\n\nActual weights using 97 lb. working pressure shell and net including concrete grouting furnished by purchaser.\n\nPumps and Softeners Limited\n\nLondon, Canada\n\nHydrodarco Purifiers\n\nHYDRODARCO purifiers will accomplish what was thought to be almost the impossible\u2014water purification without removing impurities, organic taste and odor, the elimination of free chlorine, and the removal of organic color\u2014without chemical treatment, electricity, steam, expensive replacement parts, or any mechanism to get out of order.\n\nHydrodarco is an activated carbon manufactured to meet the particular requirements of water purification. Its high mechanical strength, its effective weight in water permits proper backwash rates; its carbon content is 99% pure activated carbon, and its porous structure permits rapid clarification desired. Hydrodarco is not boneblack or charcoal\u2014and should not be confused with either.\n\nThe uniliterary and complete success of many installations, under many operating conditions, is convincing proof that the Hydrodarco Purifier is the automatic, simplest and fastest method of removing practically all tastes, odors, colors and other impurities from water.\n\nThe Style BHD Hydrodarco Purifier is used where only relatively small volumes of water are required. It is especially built to handle the small volumes of water required in small residences, cottages, camps, lodges, drinking or bottled water supplies and for special process water in industrial plants. A single purifier or a battery of two or more units can be used to secure desired capacity.\n\nThe Hydrodarco Purifier is completely automatic. It is not a filter or a water softener, nor does it have a backwashing system. It has no appearance, but with the installation properly engineered to meet the individual conditions and requirements, it will fulfill more than merely purify water\u2014it will also remove the highly adsorptive activated carbon and allow its full efficiency to be utilized. Dirty or turbid waters should first be filtered\u2014and the companion Style BHD Pressure Filter is recommended.\n\nThe Style BHD shell is built of steel welded into one piece, suitable for working pressures up to 100 pounds, and provided with removable head to simplify inspection and inspection. The inside of the shell is smooth to prevent turbulence. The Hydrodarco Purifier is given a strong bed of special sand and four graded sizes of silica gravel, underneath which is the underdrain system which collects the purified water and also distributes the water during backwashing.\n\nWater enters the purifier from the top, passes down through the Hydrodarco and through the underdrain to the outlet. Operation continues until the gauge shows a difference in pressure of 3 or 4 pounds. This indicates that the Hydrodarco bed is packed and that it must be cleaned by the simple operation of raising the water level above the Hydrodarco bed and allowing it to drain off the bottom, and it loosens the Hydrodarco as it passes upward and out the top to the wash water outlet. After a few minutes backwashing the purifier is again put into regular service.\n\nSpecifications\n\n| Size | Area | Capacity | Shell Filter Bed | Dimensions |\n|------|------|----------|------------------|------------|\n|      |      |          |                  | Width Depth Height |\n| 8\"   | 35   | 42       | 100              | 60 11\" 20\" 32\" |\n| 12\"  | 70   | 85       | 160              | 130 15\" 21\" 32\" |\n| 16\"  | 140  | 167      | 260              | 230 21\" 30\" 50\" |\n| 20\"  | 215  | 250      | 410              | 330 21\" 30\" 50\" |\n| 24\"  | 214  | 400      | 630              | 520 20\" 34\" 56\" |\n\n*Capacity figured at rate of 2 gallons per minute per sq. ft. of purifier area.\nFriction Head or Loss and Comparative Discharging Power of Pipes\n\nHead depends not only upon size of pipe but upon velocity of flow, a factor that changes with the relations of head to water and length of pipe. Inspection shows that doubling the diameter of a pipe increases the discharging power or capacity about 3\u00bd times.\n\nA column of water 1 foot high having a base equal in area to 1 square inch weighs about 7 16 of a pound, and of course the weight of any number of such columns will be proportional to their height and obviously both the weight and the pressure are doubled. Hence it may be taken for granted that the pressure of columns of water (static pressure or head) is in direct proportion to the height or depth of the water.\n\nFriction loss should not be greater than given in the following table:\n\n2 lbs. per 100 feet for 200 feet or less of pipe.\nPer 100 feet for 200 feet to 500 feet of pipe.\n1\u00bd lbs. per 100 feet from 500 feet to 1000 feet of pipe.\n1\u00bd lbs. per 100 feet from 1000 feet to 2000 feet of pipe.\n\n| Diameter of Pipe in Inches | Friction Loss in Feet for Each 100 Feet Length of Pipe |\n|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1/4                      | 7 1/2                                                |\n| 1/2                      | 1 1/4                                               |\n| 1                        | 2 1/4                                               |\n| 1 1/4                    | 3 1/2                                               |\n| 1 1/2                    | 4 1/2                                               |\n| 1 3/4                    | 5 1/2                                               |\n| 2                        | 6 3/4                                               |\n| 2 1/2                    | 8 1/2                                               |\n| 2 3/4                    | 9 1/2                                               |\n| 3                        | 11 1/4                                              |\n| 3 1/2                    | 13 1/2                                              |\n| 3 3/4                    | 15 1/2                                              |\n| 4                        | 17 1/4                                              |\n\nExample\n\nEight gallons per minute (600 gallons per hour) through 30 ft. of 1\" pipe with a total of 8 elbows (see Table of Friction Loss in 90\u00b0 Elbows) and 1\" pipe shown a 7 1/2 feet of friction.

What is the speed of the latter?\n\n180 x 30 = 5400 revolutions per minute, driven by a 30-inch pulley making 180 revolutions per minute. What will be the diameter of countershaft pulley?\n\nWhat will be the diameter of a pulley making 180 revolutions per minute, to drive a 12-inch pulley 450 revolutions per minute?\n\n5400 \u00f7 12 = 450 x 30 = 1350-inch pulley.\n\nTo determine the Horse Power of Pulleys\n\nMultiply the circumference of the pulley in feet by the number of revolutions it makes per minute, and this product by the width of the belt in inches. Divide this result by 600, which will give the horse power the pulley will develop.\n\nHOW TO USE A VACUUM GAUGE\n\nIf scale is in inches of mercury multiply by 1.03 to reduce to feet; if pounds multiply by 2.3 to reduce to feet.\n\nPUMP VACUUM\n\nTo determine whether the Pump is developing a vacuum or suction, disconnect suction line and plug opening in vacuum chamber or tank. Run pump until water stops rising in tank. If water stops rising, pump is running under vacuum. If water continues to rise, increase vacuum, then stop pump. (A perfect pump will register 25 to 30 feet.)\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SUCCTION LIFT\n\nThe suction lift is generally far back after pump stops, so air leak is indicated in vacuum chamber, around valve plate, cylinder plug, or suction pipe.\n\nSUCTION LEAKS\n\nTo test suction line for air leaks, press snug while water is running until water is discharged, then stop pump.\n\nPUMP VACUUM\n\nTo determine whether the Pump is developing a vacuum or suction, disconnect suction line and plug opening in vacuum chamber or tank. Run pump until water stops rising in tank. If water stops rising, pump is running under vacuum. If water continues to rise, increase vacuum, then stop pump. (A perfect pump will register 25 to 30 feet.)\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SUCCTION LIFT\n\nThe suction lift is generally far back after pump stops, so air leak is indicated in vacuum chamber, around valve plate, cylinder plug, or suction pipe.\n\nSUCTION LEAKS\n\nTo test suction line for air leaks, press snug while water is running until water is discharged, then stop pump.\n\nFRICTION LOSS\n\nTo determine the amount of friction in the suction line, run the pump if necessary and insert vacuum gauge in top of vacuum chamber. Turn on water and allow water to run until gauge reads zero. Turn off water and allow water to run until gauge reads zero. The difference between the two readings is the friction loss in the suction line. (If the difference between the gauge readings is 5 inches, the friction loss is 5 feet.) This reading indicates the actual suction lift of 5 feet, and that the effective vertical suction lift of the pump will be reduced 5 feet.\n\nDEPTH OF WATER\n\nTo find depth to water, with pump running, insert vacuum gauge and run pump until water is being discharged.\n\nTo find depth to water, with pump running, insert vacuum gauge and run pump until water is being discharged.\n\nThis reading will indicate the exact vertical distance to surface of water in well.\nUseful Rules and Information\n\nTo convert inches vacuum into feet, multiply by 1.43.\n\nTo reduce head in feet to pounds per square inch, multiply by 2.4.\n\nDoubling diameter of pipe increases its capacity four times.\n\nA cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds and contains 7.48 cubic inches, or 0.13 gallons, or 0.11 Imperial gallons.\n\nAn Imperial gallon of water weighs 10 pounds, and contains 277 cubic inches.\n\nAn Imperial gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds, and contains 231 cubic inches.\n\nHorizontal suction lines on length is practical up to 10 feet, providing you have a gradual slope from the pump to the suction line (not more than 1/100th). This prevents air pockets forming and is absolutely necessary in a suction line.\n\nSuction lift means the vertical distance from the level of the water supply to the centre of the pump.\n\nDischarge head means the vertical distance from the centre of the pump to the centre of discharge out let when the pump is running.\n\nTotal head means the sum of the suction lift, discharge head, and all friction loss in both suction and discharge pipes.\n\nAtmospheric Pressures, Equivalent Heads and Suction Lift\n\n| Atmospheric Pressure | Vacuum Gauge Reading | Head in Feet | Maximum Practical Head in Feet |\n|----------------------|----------------------|-------------|-------------------------------|\n| 14.7 psig            | 0                    | 0           | 0                             |\n| 15.0 psig            | 3                    | 3           | 3                             |\n| 15.3 psig            | 6                    | 6           | 6                             |\n| 15.6 psig            | 9                    | 9           | 9                             |\n| 15.9 psig            | 12                   | 12          | 12                            |\n| 16.2 psig            | 15                   | 15          | 15                            |\n| 16.5 psig            | 18                   | 18          | 18                            |\n| 16.8 psig            | 21                   | 21          | 21                            |\n| 17.1 psig            | 24                   | 24          | 24                            |\n| 17.4 psig            | 27                   | 27          | 27                            |\n| 17.7 psig            | 30                   | 30          | 30                            |\n| 18.0 psig            | 33                   | 33          | 33                            |\n| 18.3 psig            | 36                   | 36          | 36                            |\n| 18.6 psig            | 39                   | 39          | 39                            |\n| 18.9 psig            | 42                   | 42          | 42                            |\n| 19.2 psig            | 45                   | 45          | 45                            |\n| 19.5 psig            | 48                   | 48          | 48                            |\n| 19.8 psig            | 51                   | 51          | 51                            |\n| 20.1 psig            | 54                   | 54          | 54                            |\n\nNote: Vacuum gauge reading in inches vacuum multiplied by 1.43 equals atmospheric pressure per square inch. Vacuum inches carrying into feet suction multiplied by 1.43.\n\nSuction lift is vertical distance from pump inlet to water level plus pipe friction and other losses, if any.\n\nFrom the above data it is obvious that Nares has established a limit upon the height that water may be lifted by a suction lift. The maximum practical suction lift stated above may mean that no suction pump will lift water more than 34 feet, even under ideal atmospheric conditions at sea-level. Variations in altitude above sea-level decrease the suction-lift ability of all pumps in proportion to the difference in feet.\n\nWine Gallons Discharged per hour through Various Sized Orifices under Stated Pressures.\n\n| Head | Dia.

Duro Softener\nWebb Water Softener Co., Calgary, Alta. Webb Softener.\n\nThese men required some notice in obtaining prices as their principals need an analysis of the water to be treated before submitting prices.\n\nThe Duro Softener is manufactured by Pumps and Softeners Limited of London, Ontario. The Webb softener is manufactured in Calgary from an American patent of the Webb Mfg. Co. of Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nMr. Fetterly could not find any representatives of Westaway Co. of Hamilton who made the softener for Union Lake School in Saskatchewan. This last was supplied by Bowers Hardware Co. of Battleford and has given good satisfaction.\n\nThe chemical analysis as supplied to the first two firms mentioned is that sent to you under date July 4, 1933, as follows:\n\n| Component       | Value          |\n|-----------------|----------------|\n| Total solids    | 1322 parts per million |\n| Ignition Loss   | 308            |\n| Hardness        | 600 (x .07 = 42 grains per gallon.

Bell & Morris Co., Ltd.,\nCalgary, Alta.\n\nAttention Mr. S.D. Jenkins.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 23rd for softeners for the Department of Indian Affairs, we would recommend from the information with which you have supplied us, two of our No. S.F. 5 Duro single control Softeners which are described on page 28 of our Pumps and Softeners catalogue. Two of these units hooked up together would make an ideal installation in that during the course of regenerating one of the units, the other unit would supply the soft water.\n\nThe S.F. 5 Softener, on 36 grain water to the wine gallon, would have a capacity of 2480 gallons each, and a flow rate of 20 wine gallons per minute each, or combined capacity would be in excess of 4900 wine gallons, or 40 gallons per minute flow rate. The selling price of these units are $340.00 each, or $680.00 for the two units, F.O.B. Calgary.\n\nIn the event that this type of equipment does not suit your customer, we are pleased to offer as an alternative our 30\" diameter industrial type Softener having a capacity of 5200 wine gallons between regenerations, on water of 36 grains hardness to the wine gallons, with a maximum flow rate of 39.2 wine gallons per minute, complete with 30 x 48 Brine tank, holding 700 pounds of salt. The salt consumption in this unit would run approximately 100 pounds per regeneration, and the selling price on same would be $525.00, Net, F.O.B. London. Shipping weights are as follows:\n\n| Item     | Weight   |\n|----------|----------|\n| Tanks    | 1215 lbs |\n| Gravel   | 795 lbs  |\n| Fittings | 295 lbs  |\n| Minerals | 875 lbs  |\n\nIn regard to the S.F. 5 softeners, these would be equipped with one Brine tank, having approximately 800 pounds capacity and the salt consumption would run in the neighbourhood of 70 pounds per regeneration.\n\nShipping weights of the combined units would be 2600 pounds.\n\nThe S.F. 5 Softener would be shipped filled with the necessary gravel and mineral, and the installation charges\non this job would be negligible, while on the 30\" diameter the interior and exterior piping, as well as the filling, would have to be done on the job.\n\nIf there are any further questions in regard to these two assemblies, please feel at liberty to consult us at any time, without obligation to yourself. Our branch at 74 Princess Street, in Winnipeg, has several of these dual S.F. No.5 units installed in some of the Indian Schools in Manitoba, and they have worked to the entire satisfaction of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPumps & Softeners Ltd.\n\nNote: Freight on 3180 lbs. from London, Ont. to St. Paul de Metis amounts to $125.29 at 3.94 per 100 lbs. This amount is additional to the above.\n\nP.A.F.\nThe Secretary,\nDept.of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nAt the request of Mr.M.Christiansen, Inspector of Indian Affairs, Alberta Inspectorate, we are quoting herewith prices on a Webb water Softener for the Blue Quills School at St.Paul.\n\nThe Softener which we propose to supply for this school is designed by the Webb Manufacturing Company of Kansas City, Mo. and manufactured by us in Calgary, according to their specifications. Owing to the extreme hardness of the water, we have selected their Down-flow Model. This type of Softener is an excellent filter as well as a Softener.\n\nThe Softener Equipment is composed of a Softener tank and a Brine Tank with connections.\n\nThe Softener Tank would be 27\" in diameter by 72\" high made of 10 gauge plate, hot galvanized, inside and out after welding.\n\nThe Brine Tank would be 27\" in diameter by 48\" high, hot galvanized and of 14 gauge with cover.\n\nThe Pipes, Fittings and Valves as shown on the enclosed sketch will be one inch (should read 1/4\")\n\nA Four Way Control Valve is on the water supply line to the softener. With this the water flow can be reversed, for back-washing, thus throwing out all sediment which may have accumulated during the period of operation.\n\nThe Salt necessary for regenerating would be 96 pounds, for 4000 gal.water.\n\nWe understand that the water at the Blue Quills School has 42 grains of hardness per gallon, and that approximately 4000 gallons of water might be used each day; therefore we propose to furnish a Softener with a capacity to meet this requirement and we guarantee this Softener to do this.\n\nThe Zeolite (trade name, Webbolite) which we use in this Softener is the world's greatest absorbing mineral, having a guaranteed capacity of 15,000 grains of hardness per cu.ft.\nOur Price for the above equipment is $650.00 f.o.b. Calgary.\n\nThe approximate Weight of this Softener is 1100 pounds.\n\nWe will pay the freight, cartage and other shipment charges, furnish pipes, fittings, valves and all labour necessary for complete installation of the Softener for the additional sum of $130.00.\n\nWe shall be glad to furnish any additional information which you may require.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nWEBB WATER SOFTENER COMPANY.\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of September 3rd regarding the installation of a water softener at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, St. Paul, Alberta, I enclose herewith a copy of a letter from Mr. Hoover, our Engineer-in-Charge, at Calgary, which gives prices of two makes of water softener; one manufactured by Pumps and Softeners Limited of London, Ontario, and the other made by the Webb Water Softener Co. of Calgary.\n\nThere are also enclosed copies of letters from representatives of these two concerns describing their water softeners and catalogues giving an illustration of each.\n\nFrom the information supplied it appears that there is very little difference in the price quoted for each of these water softeners. The amount of salt required with each regeneration also is approximately the same and the general method of operation is very similar in both cases. The main difference appears to be that with the Duro Softener two units would be necessary, whereas the Webb Softener can be supplied of the same capacity in the single unit at a price about $30.00 less than the other.\n\nI shall be glad to receive your further instructions in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOctober 15, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th instant, you may give instructions to your district engineer at Calgary to purchase and have installed a water softener at the Blue Quills School, the purchase to be made from the firm quoting the lowest price providing the Engineer is satisfied that the equipment will do the work in a proper manner.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nActing Secretary.\n\nDominion Water Power Branch,\nOttawa.\nOctober 11th, 1925.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to our letter of September 3rd giving you quotation on Water Softener, we notice that in giving you the dimension of the pipe size that it was mentioned as one inch connection. This was an error and should read one and a quarter inch. The one inch pipe would not carry the number of gallons mentioned. Should we be favored with your order we can make delivery in three weeks time.\n\nHoping that we may be favored with your order, we are\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWEBB WATER SOFTENER COMPANY\n\nBy [Signature]\nMARSHALL-WELLS LIMITED\nWHOLESALE\nHARDWARE, MILL and MINING SUPPLIES\n\nCALGARY, Canada Oct. 4th, 1935.\n\nSold to Dom.

Bell and Morris of Calgary, at the price of $680.00 complete F.O.B. St. Paul de Metis.\n\nIn my letter to you of October 9th, I stated that the Webb water softener can be supplied at the price of about $20.00 less than the Duro softener, but it appears that the price quoted for Webb softener would not include transportation charges, new fittings and installation. Adding these charges would bring the total cost of the Webb softener to $780.00. The Duro softener is also considerably more economical in salt consumption, and it is, therefore, recommended that the Duro S.F. 5 two-unit installation be purchased for the Blue Quills School. I shall be glad to have your approval of this recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA. F.

H.S. Fraser.\nEDMONTON, ALBERTA\n\nDecember 9, 1935.\n\nRev. Father J. Angin,\nBlue Quills Indian Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\n\nRev. Father:\n\nAs you are aware, our present contract with the Department of Indian Affairs covering service from our Company to the Indian School expires on December 31st of this year. We presume that you wish to continue this service and we would of course be very pleased to continue it on the terms contained in the present contract.\n\nWe do not know if it will be necessary for you to secure authority from the Department, or not. If the matter rests with you, a letter from you, signifying your intention to continue the service for a further period of five years, will be quite sufficient, and, in that case, it would not be necessary to draw up another contract.\n\nIf, however, you feel that you are unable to bind yourself to continue this service for a further period, we would suggest that you take the matter up with the Department and obtain their wishes in the matter, and would be obliged if you would advise us accordingly.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCALGARY POWER CO. LTD.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager, Northern Division.\n\nJHM/C.\nBlue Quills Ind.Res.School,\nSaint-Paul, Alta.\n\nDec.13th 1935\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received from the Calgary Power Co a letter that I enclose for your information, stating that the contract between this firm and the Blue Quills School for furnishing the electric light and power is ending on Dec.31st of this year. They ask, of course, to renew the contract.\n\nI must say that we had a very good service from the Calgary Power Co for the last 5 years, but the rate per kilowatt-hour is very high for the light.\n\nI would suggest that you ask to the Calgary Power Co to lower the rate for the light and to reduce it to 0.09 cts per kilowatt-hour, instead of 0.12 cts we pay for just now; we pay 0.06 cts per kilowatt-hour for the power, and this is quite right.\n\nIn the village of St Paul, the private customers of the Calgary Power Co pay 0.12 cts per kilowatt-hour for light and 0.06 cts for the power; but the elevators pay only 0.06 cts per kilowatt-hour for light and power; and I suppose the Calgary Power Co could easily reduce the price rate of the light in favor of Blue Quills School.\n\nDuring these last 2 years, I have paid to the Calgary Power Co $100.00 per month in average, and as you see, it is much. I would be satisfied if you could obtain from this firm a reduction in the rate of the light.\n\nIt would be probably more advisable to discuss the matter directly with the head-office of the Calgary Power Co, at Longtrel, 244, at James Street.\n\nHoping you will succeed in this business, I remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. Jos. Angin,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, December 20, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Blue Quills Indian Residential School, near St. Paul, Alta., receives electric service from your Company. The Principal advises us that his contract expires on the 31st instant, and your Edmonton Branch has requested him to renew the contract for another five years.\n\nThe Principal is quite prepared to do so, but he states that he is charged .12 cents per kilowatt-hour for light, which is the same amount as charged to private consumers in the Village of St. Paul. The Principal further states that the elevator companies pay only .06 cents for light.\n\nIn view of the fact that this school consumes a large amount of light and power, and also in consideration of the rate allowed the elevator companies, the Principal considers that the Calgary Power Company might allow him the rate of .06 cents per kilowatt-hour.\n\nThis Department does not pay directly for the electricity used at this school, but we provide a per capita allowance for each Indian child in attendance, and from the funds thus obtained the Principal pays the current expenses of the school. If it is at all possible to meet the Principal's wishes to reduce the rate for light service, the Department would appreciate such action.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nThe Calgary Power Co. Ltd.,\n244 St. James St.,\nMontreal, P.Q.\nDecember 26th, 1935.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq., Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nYour Ref. No. 118-1-5\n\nThe Blue Quill Indian Residential School is not supplied from our main system, but from a small Diesel engine plant in the Town of St. Paul. On account of the costly source of power supply our St. Paul system operates at a loss. This condition we hope to correct eventually by extending our transmission system to supply St. Paul. Any reduction in rates in the meantime is apt to increase our losses and may force us into an extension of our St. Paul plant, which would be money thrown away when our main transmission system is extended.\n\nWhile we have not the full details in this office regarding the St. Paul rates, it would surprise us if any of the elevator companies are being supplied with light at a lower rate than the Indian School, all things considered.\n\nWe are referring your letter to our Calgary Office who will go into the matter further.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.P.\nGAG-DC\nPresident\nOttawa, December 30, 1935.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 13th instant, regarding your contract with the Calgary Power Company, the Department communicated with the head office in Montreal, and, for your information, I enclose a copy of their reply.\n\nYou will note that the matter is being referred to their Calgary office, and Mr. Christianson is being instructed to visit this office and discuss the matter with the manager.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Prices subject to change with or without notice.\nBlue Quills Indian School.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of 6th instant regarding the Duro Water Softeners which have been installed in the above-named school.\n\nI might state that Mr. Fetterly and I spent a considerable amount of time deciding upon the type of softener to install. Information of the right sort and also of a competitive nature is very difficult to obtain. However we at last decided to recommend a Duro Softener.\n\nBy the price, $650 complete, as mentioned in page '2', centre of page, of my letter of October 29, it was intended to convey the information that the unit was self-containing as a softener including zeolite, etc., with no extra parts to purchase to make it a going concern. It was not intended to include piping, valves, etc. or other connections with the present water system. When tenders were offered neither Bell & Morris nor ourselves intended to convey this idea. The pipe, valves, etc. should be considered as extras as they have nothing to do with the softener itself.\n\nThe softener ordinarily would be located actually between the well and the pressure tanks, but in this case this procedure was impossible unless a concrete pit were constructed contiguous to the tank room and outside of the building. It was therefore decided to locate the softeners behind the rear end of the tanks and behind a concrete wall enclosing the tanks.\n\nIf Bell & Morris had tendered on fittings and installation their price would have still been lower than the Webb tender.\n\nThe tenders were requested without a visit to the School by Mr. Fetterly, as that would cost upwards of $50 or more. Mr. Gullion, the Indian Agent at Saddle Lake, was kind enough to attend to that part.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\nConsequently Bell & Morris were requested to tender for the water softener, \"complete\" but not extras nor installation.\n\nThe installation was superintended by Mr. Gullion, the work, according to him, being done by Mr. Desmarais, a tinsmith of St. Paul, who is to receive $22 for his work as arranged by Mr. Gullion.\n\nI requested that Father Angin and Mr. Gullion inform me of the arrival of extras and the completion of the installation. I have not heard from them, as yet.\n\nMr. Gullion stated that Mr. Desmarais' charges for the installation would be $22 as he had to cut through a 10\" concrete wall to allow ingress and exit for the pipes.\n\nThe total cost will therefore be\n\n$680.00 for the softeners, $55.15 for the connections (wholesale price f.o.b. St. Paul,) and $22 for installation, a total of $757.15.\n\nIt is evident that the word \"complete\" conveyed an erroneous impression to you which was not intended, as Bell & Morris could not tender on the whole installation without visiting the School, 330 miles from Calgary. This would have raised their tender, making the total cost much more than it will now aggregate.\n\nI might add that while negotiations were pending, we viewed a \"complete\" water softener but unconnected with any water system. This may have been the reason for the use of that word.\n\nI trust that this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nJanuary 3, 1936.\n\nBlue Quills Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nPursuant to your instructions dated November 13, 1935, I purchased two Duro water softeners from Bell & Morris of Calgary for use in the above named school.\n\nThe softeners arrived in St. Paul de Metis, Alberta, three miles from the school, about December 14. I received a letter from Mr. W.E. Gullion, Saddle Lake Indian Agency, Saddle Lake, Alta., stating this fact.\n\nI have been waiting for advice from Father Angin, the Principal, or from Mr. Gullion advising me of the arrival of certain other material including valves, tees, gates, etc., which was subsequently ordered for use as connections with the main pipe. I am quite sure that this material arrived some time ago but the Principal has not as yet advised me of its arrival.\n\nEnc.\n\nI do not wish to delay any longer and am consequently sending the invoice of the softener in quadruplicate.\n\nMr. Gullion has stated that the softener has arrived. Consequently I will not need to make a special trip to certify its arrival.\n\nMeanwhile, I will repeat my request of Dec. 18 to the two officials concerned by today's mail to certify the arrival of the remainder of the material.\n\nI would therefore recommend that a cheque for $680 be sent to Bell & Morris, Calgary, Alta., in payment of the softeners.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\nJanuary 13th, 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the installation of a water softener at Blue Quills Indian Residential School authorized by your letter of September 3rd last, I enclose herewith, in quadruplicate, the account of Bell and Morris, for the duplicate water softener, amounting to $680.00, together with Mr. Hoover's accompanying letter of the 3rd instant.\n\nIt was not quite clear from Mr. Hoover's letter what was covered by the account herewith and he was accordingly asked to state what other expenditures were required and what arrangement had been made for connecting the softener and placing it in service. Mr. Hoover's reply of the 9th instant is attached, which gives full information on this point. I beg to recommend, therefore, that the enclosed account for $680.00 be paid forthwith.\n\nEnds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nDirector.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nCOPY.\n\nSaddle Lake, Alta.,\nJan.7,1936.\n\nSir,- Re Blue Quills Indian School.\n\nReferring to your letter No.4811 of the 3rd inst. addressed to Rev.Father Angin, copy of which was sent to me, I beg to advise you that all of the materials shipped by Bell & Morris, Calgary, were received and I arranged to have Mr.Desmarais commence the installation of the water softeners on the 2nd instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd) W.E.GULLION.\nIndian Agent.\n\nO.H.Hoover,Esq.,\nEngineer-In-Charge,\nDom.Water Power Bureau,\nCalgary,Alta.\n\nSt.Paul, Jan.8th 36.\n\nDear Mr.Hoover,-\n\nAll the material shipped by Bell and Morris from Calgary and such as stated in your previous letter No.4811, has been received in good condition. I advised Mr.Gullion of this last December 31st and I supposed you were informed already. If however Mr.Gullion has not informed you about this, I state you can pay at once Bell and Morris, as all this material has been received.\n\nI must say also that Mr.Desmarais of St.Paul is fixing up just now the water-softeners, and expects to complete the work to-day or tomorrow.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(sgd) H.Angin.\nBlue Quills Indian School\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to my letter of 9th instant I am enclosing an invoice in triplicate of the extra materials such as piping, valves, etc.\n\nReceipt of the materials at the School has now been vouched for by Mr. Gullion and Father Angin as per the enclosed copies of letters received from them at this office today.\n\nFull explanation has been given in my letter of the 9th instant.\n\nThis bill of $55.15 is subject to a discount of 2% if paid for within 30 days after shipment (Dec. 19) according to the quotation received from Bell & Morris and on file in this office. The discount therefore amounts to $1.10.\n\nI would recommend, therefore, that a cheque be sent to Bell & Morris, Calgary, for $55.15 less $1.10 or $54.05, if paid before Jan. 18.\n\nMr. Demarais, as you will note from Father Angin's letter, is now finished, and I should receive his account of $22.00 within a few days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEngineer-In-Charge.\n\nThe Director,\nWater Power & Hydrometric Bureau,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa.\n### Bell & Morris\n\n**Manufacturers and Wholesale Merchants**\n\n**Ironfounders and Engineers**\n\n---\n\n**SOLD TO**: Department of the Interior, Water Power & Hydrometric Bureau, Calgary.\n\n**ADDRESS**: Blue Quill Indian School, St. Paul de Metis\n\n**SHIPPED TO**: Calgary.\n\n---\n\n| OUR NO. | CUSTOMER'S NO. | ORDERED BY |\n|---------|---------------|------------|\n| 27839   |               |            |\n\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|-------|\n| ft. 1/2\" Galv.

This will be on the basis of $1.00 per K.V.A. of demand per month and so far your demand has not exceeded 10 K.V.A. This will automatically reduce the number of kilowatt hours for which you pay at the higher rate, which is 12\u00a2 per kilowatt hour for Commercial usage and 6\u00a2 per kilowatt hour for Power purposes. This will effect a saving of something over 10% on the basis of your 1935 accounts.\n\nWe should be glad to have you advise us in this matter after you have had an opportunity to consider it.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCALGARY POWER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\nH.B.

I had two or three meetings with Mr. Sherman, the Operating Superintendent of the Company, with the result that they have made a reduction of 10%, which will mean a saving of approximately $100.00 - $120.00 per year, figuring on the amount of energy used there last year. This is the very best rate I could obtain, and I trust it will be satisfactory. For your information I am attaching a letter which I have received from Mr. Sherman.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

Ltd., under the terms of which Calgary Power Co. Ltd., in consideration of payment of the sum of $4,997.00, constructed a line from the Town limits at St. Paul to your Blue Quills Indian School, together with a substation at the School. Under the terms of this agreement, the ownership of this line and substation was retained by the Department of Indian Affairs, which involves replacement of the line, substation, etc. at the end of its useful life. We wish also to point out, that under the terms of the agreement, the Department of Indian Affairs was responsible for the maintenance of this line, etc., although Calgary Power Co. Ltd. has not made any charge to the Department for such maintenance.\n\nWe feel that ownership of the line is not of advantage to the Department owing to the annual depreciation and maintenance costs in connection therewith and with this in mind interviewed Mr. Christianson, Inspector of the Department of Indian Affairs at Calgary, and suggested to him that, in consideration of one dollar, you might deem it desirable to transfer ownership of the line etc., to Canadian Utilities Ltd., who we believe would be willing to accept all responsibility for the necessary\nannual charges on such a basis.\n\nMr. Christianson requested us to write you in this connection, setting out briefly our suggestion. Would you, therefore, be good enough to let us have a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCALGARY POWER COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nHBS/WF\n\n[Signature]\n\nOperating Superintendent.\nOttawa, September 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nEnclosed is copy of a letter that has been received from the Calgary Power Company Limited with reference to the power line from the Town limits of St. Paul to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department has carefully considered the offer made by the Power Company but we cannot see any real reason why their proposal should be accepted. However, before giving a definite decision in this regard, we would appreciate having your views.\n\nYou will note from their letter that the Company claims to have maintained the line since 1930, although, under the terms of the agreement, the Department was responsible for this expenditure. Have you any idea of the approximate amount the Company spent in this regard?\n\nOne of the clauses in the original agreement read as follows:\n\n\"14. The Customer further agrees that the Company shall be at liberty during the term of this agreement to use said Tap for the purpose of transmitting electrical energy and power to such consumers as the Power Company shall desire to serve thereby or therefrom, and the Power Company shall pay to the Customer for such use of said Tap such sums as may be agreed upon between the parties hereto and in the event of disagreement the amount so to be paid by the Power Company shall be referred to an Arbitrator to be agreed upon by the parties hereto and in case of disagreement to an Arbitrator to be appointed by a Judge of the Supreme Court of Alberta, and in either case in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Arbitration Act.\"\n\nWe have no record of any correspondence with the Company since 1930 regarding other consumers using the line for which we paid. Please let me know if the Blue Quills School is the only consumer of power from this line.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie.\nSecretary.\n\nEnc. 1.\n\nM. Christianson, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, September 17, 1936.\n\nATTENTION:- Mr. H. B. Sherman.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 9th instant, with reference to the agreement entered into on December 15th, 1930, between the Department of Indian Affairs and the Calgary Power Company, Limited, in connection with the line from the Town limits of St. Paul to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nInspector Christianson is being written for a report and, on receipt of his reply, the proposal contained in your letter of the 9th instant will be further considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nCalgary Power Company, Limited,\nCalgary, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the Department's letter 118-1-5 of the 11th instant in connection with the tubes for the boiler at Blue Quill School, and that I am to buy this out of the amount that was authorized by the Department sometime ago. In reply I wish to state that this has been spent and I am afraid that the amount expended will come to about $20.00 more than what was authorized.\n\nIt would not be necessary to have many tubes on hand for flues at one time. I would think that if there were approximately a half-dozen on hand that this would meet with any emergency of a flue breaking, and of course, it would not take very long to get them from Edmonton to St. Paul. Therefore if the Department will authorize it, I can arrange the purchase of these.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, September 22, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your 407-11A of the 18th instant, regarding the supplying of extra tubes for the boiler at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery at the school of one-half dozen tubes, of the dimensions required for the boiler. It is noted that the cost will be in excess of the amount appropriated for this school. It is considered, however, that it would be advisable to have the extra tubes on hand. An account, in triplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded, covering the cost of the extra tubes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nM.

In this connection I wish to give the Department the following explanation.\n\nWe are the only ones that are supplied with above mentioned line from the town limits of Saint Paul to the school. Under the agreement of erecting the line, I am informed, that we were supposed to keep it in repair and pay for any replacements of poles, etc., and of course, during the past four or five years since it was erected, there have been no replacements, and very few repairs and any work on it in the nature of upkeep has been borne by the Calgary Power Co.\n\nI am however informed that the expense of replacements and repairs only commences after approximately 12 years. The Calgary Power Co. have made some dicker with the Canadian Utilities to take over the lines around St. Paul, which are in the Canadian Utilities' territory, and the Calgary Power Co. is taking over some lines from the Canadian Utilities in some other territory that really belongs to the Calgary Power Co. In other words the Calgary Power Co. have sold their interest in the lines around St. Paul to the Canadian Utilities Ltd.\nI am now coming to the real point of issue, which is that if we still retain ownership of this line with the new company, they will probably charge us for all repairs made to this line, and when it comes to replacements we will also be charged for all replacements, also material and labor in connection therewith.\n\nIf however, we sell or deed the line over to the Canadian Utilities Ltd., they will have to stand the expense of all replacements and repairs on this line.\n\nTherefore, in the opinion of the Calgary Power Co., we would be well advised to turn the line over to the mentioned Co., and save all expense of repairs and replacements in connection with the line.\n\nI hope I have made myself clear, but if there is any further information that is required, I shall be glad to furnish it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM.

JAMES ST.\nMONTREAL\n\nCALGARY OFFICE\nINSURANCE EXCHANGE BUILDING\n\nCALGARY, ALBERTA\n\nJanuary 7th, 1937.\n\nYour 118-1-5\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our letter to you of September 9th last and your reply of October 13th, we are now enclosing a sketch showing the transmission line running west from the St. Paul town limits to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. As already advised you we disposed of our distribution system in St. Paul to the Canadian Utilities Limited. This sketch also shows a short section of the transmission line which the Canadian Utilities has built to connect St. Paul with its transmission system at Willingdon, the oil engine plant in St. Paul no longer being used. You will note that as part of this transmission line the Canadian Utilities has incorporated the 2-mile stretch of your line immediately west of the St. Paul town limits, i.e. the section A-B. This we feel you should have no objection to since under our contract with you dated December 15th, 1920, and which expired on December 15th, 1935, you gave us the right by arrangement with you to use this line for other purposes in addition to serving the School. It does, however, become necessary to reach some arrangement with you in this regard.\n\nWhen we arranged to transfer our St. Paul distribution system to the Canadian Utilities the question of the Canadian Utilities using a section of your line as part of their transmission from Willingdon to St. Paul was not considered but later in determining the route of this line it was found by them that 2 miles of your line (section A-B) could be used to advantage. Were we still operating St. Paul and had we built such a transmission line to serve it we would have wished to have used this 2-mile section of your line under some mutually satisfactory arrangement with you while you still retained ownership. The Canadian Utilities, however, follow\na different policy and they wish to obtain title to this 2-mile section A-B. They further advise us that unless title can be obtained on some reasonable basis they will build a parallel line into St. Paul thus leaving your line entirely for your own service as formerly and to be maintained at your expense. Such a duplication is unnecessary and in our estimation is inadvisable since it would necessitate the maintenance of 2 additional miles of line and serve no useful purpose. It should prove a saving to both you and the Canadian Utilities if some mutually satisfactory arrangement can be reached.\n\nUnder our expired contract with you above referred to electric energy was metered to you at the town limits, that is you paid the transmission line losses from the town limits to the School and the transformer losses at the School. In using the section of your line A-B as part of their transmission line to St. Paul the Canadian Utilities raised the voltage to 13,200 volts making it necessary to replace the 2200-volt transformers previously installed at the School with 13,200-volt transformers. They then installed metering equipment on the secondary side of the new transformers at the School, that is on the 220/110 volt circuits so that as now metered you no longer pay for line and transformer losses as formerly which should mean an appreciable saving to you.\n\nIn 1930 you paid us $4997.00 to construct the line from the town limits to the School together with the sub-station structure, transformers and additional distribution at the School. Of this total the 2-mile section A-B accounted for approximately $2500.00. In our opinion if the Canadian Utilities would agree to maintain the line to the School including the necessary transformers and give you the present rate or any revised rate which they may later apply in St. Paul for similar service, we believe you will be well advised to transfer ownership of the whole line to the Canadian Utilities at a nominal price as suggested in our letter of September 9th. On the other hand if you do not wish so to transfer the line, substation, transformers, etc., to the Canadian Utilities, then will you please advise us as to the basis on which you would consider transferring the 2-mile section A-B to the Canadian Utilities.\n\nOur Company now has no property in St. Paul or vicinity and our interest in this matter arises through the fact that the Canadian Utilities through a misunderstanding\nand without consulting us assumed that this line from the St. Paul town limits to the Blue Quills Indian School was the property of this Company and therefore assumed that it was being transferred to them. This explains why the section A-B of your line was incorporated in their transmission line from Willingdon to St. Paul without arranging with you. We are most anxious to get the matter straightened out and would appreciate an early reply from you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nManager\n\nGHT: o\nMr. Orr,\n\nPlease see letter from Calgary Prov Co.\n\nWhat action do you advise - your previous memo is turned off.\n\nP.P.\nJanuary 29, 1937.\n\nAttention of Mr. Cochrane.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSome years ago the department arranged with the Calgary Power Co. for the construction of a power line to the Blue Quills School to supply electric power to this Institution. The department paid for the cost of this line.\n\nA letter has been received from the Calgary Power Co. advising that they have sold their interests to the Canadian Utilities Ltd., and asking that the line be transferred to this company. I am enclosing herewith a copy of their letter, also a copy of their letter of September 9th.\n\nI would ask you to kindly obtain a report from your district engineers in Calgary as to what they would recommend regarding this power line from St. Paul to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\n\nThe Water and Power Bureau,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter of January 28th with enclosures regarding the power line supplying the Blue Quills School with electric power and the situation which has arisen due to the sale by the Calgary Power Company of its interests in and around St. Paul to Canadian Utilities Limited.\n\nIn accordance with your request I have asked Mr. Hoover, our Engineer in Charge at Calgary, to submit a report and to make recommendations as to what he considers would be the best solution of the difficulty from the point of view of the Blue Quills School and the protection of the Indian Affairs interest.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nController\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nThe latest development in this situation is as follows:\n\nOn February 27th Mr. D. A. Fetterly of the Water Power Branch of the Department of the Interior was apparently requested from Ottawa to make a report on the situation. He called on both the Calgary Power officials and ourselves, got all the information as to when the line was built, the cost of same, the rates which the Calgary Power and ourselves charged the school and discussed the question of Depreciation and Maintenance. He went away quite satisfied and expressed himself as being in favor of the line being transferred to this Company on the understanding that we would be responsible for all future maintenance on the line direct to the school, that our meter would be installed at the school, thereby not registering the line losses as was the case with the Calgary Power installation, and as our rates showed a further saving for electric service to the school.\n\nTo date we have heard nothing further but in speaking to Mr. Hoover, the chief of the Department, this afternoon, he stated the report had been submitted but they had had no further word.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nS. M. Hill,\nManager\n\nPlease quote our file number.\nOttawa, April 17, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nI desire to refer you to my letter of January 29th, last, and your reply of February 2nd, with reference to the power line owned by this Department and which extends from St. Paul to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nI would appreciate receiving, at the earliest possible date, Mr. Hoover's report in connection with the above matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nController,\nDominion Water & Power Bureau,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 21, 1927.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nI have to refer to your visit to my office of the 15th April when we discussed the subject of the transmission line of the St. Paul Indian School.\n\nWe have received a letter from Mr. J. T. Johnson in which he forwards a copy of report from Mr. P. A. Fetterly, a member of his staff in Calgary.\n\nMr. Fetterly's recommendation is that the power line be transferred to the Canadian Utilities Company for the nominal sum of One Dollar provided the company will agree to supply the necessary electrical energy to the school subject to certain conditions and reservations stated in the report.\n\nSteps will now be taken to make the necessary submission to Council.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nH.

History of Transfer.\n\nThe copies of letters from the Calgary Power Company to the Indian Department, in possession of the Controller, contain the essential facts of the transfer. Apparently, nothing was said during the negotiations between the Companies regarding this 2\u00bd miles of line and accessories. Consequently, the Canadian Utilities used it as a part of their line from Vegreville and Willingdon to St. Paul. The portion from St. Paul, straight west two miles to a point half a mile south of the School, was used as a part of the main line. The part north to the school was used as a branch feeder to the school. The whole line was overhauled as mentioned hereinafter. Vegreville is seventy miles southwest of St. Paul.\n\n3. STUDY OF THE PROBLEM.\n\nThe Manager of the Canadian Utilities considers that it is a matter solely between the Calgary Power Company and the Indian Department as regards settlement of the problem, as they purchased the plant from the Power Company, believing that this line to the school was a portion of the plant.\n\nData was obtained of costs of electrical energy from the Calgary Power Company and from the Canadian Utilities, respectively.\n\nEight exhibits were obtained from the two Companies to illustrate the points enumerated in this report. The real purpose of the report is to enable the officials of the Indian Department to decide upon the method of settling the matter. In pursuance of this object, the data will be presented in connection with eight exhibits arranged in logical order.\n\n(a) Sketch map of the area concerned. (Exhibit 1)\n\nThis map shows the location of the transmission line from St. Paul to the School. The original meter was located near the west side of the town. The school thus paid for\nall transformer and transmission losses on nearly three miles of line. The Calgary Power Company apparently maintained the line without charge to the school, as a gift.\n\n(b) Original Contract with Calgary Power Co. (Exhibit 2)\n\nThe original contract stated the terms under which the Calgary Power Company provided Electrical Energy to the school, delivering it from their line at the west side of the town to the line owned by the Department of Indian Affairs. The Company was allowed to supply energy to private users on this portion. One private service was provided.\n\n(c) Data regarding Construction and Maintenance. (Exhibit 3)\n\nThis data was provided by the Calgary Power Company. They state that the annual cost of maintenance averages $20.00 per mile per year. Depreciation is 4% per year. The probable life of the poles is 17 years and of the rest, 25 years. Annual replacement expense is $50.00 per mile per year.\n\nThe right of way purchased is in the name of the Calgary Power Company. The revenue in 1934 was $1,026.28; in 1935 it was $1,079.44.\n\n(d) Electrical Account for June, 1936. (Exhibit 4)\n\nThis exhibit contains the account rendered for June, 1936, by Calgary Power Company as a comparison with the amount if under Canadian Utilities Company. The writer has examined this exhibit in detail and it is unnecessary to comment. The saving under Canadian Utilities Company contract would be $2.63 for the month, a saving of nearly 32% on a light month.\n\n(e) General Data on Comparative Costs. (Exhibit 5)\n\nThis exhibit contains detailed data on the comparative costs, as between the rates of the Calgary Power Company and those of the Canadian Utilities Company for the months August, 1936, to January, 1937. It is to be noted that due to the method of metering used by the Calgary Power Company, all line and transformer losses were charged to the school. Under the Canadian Utilities, power is delivered at the school without charge.\n\nAlthough a study has been made of this data, it is unnecessary to detail it here. It will, however, be noted that the estimated reduction for the eight months is $111.60 or 19% of the whole. This would mean a total saving of about $160 for the year.\n\n(f) Rendered Bill of Calgary Power Co. for 1935. (Exhibit 6)\n\nThis consists of the itemized bill rendered by the Calgary Power Company for 1935. The total amount is $1074.44.\nAccording to data supplied by the Canadian Utilities Company, this would have amounted to slightly over $500, because of difference in rates and cessation of transmission line and transformer losses.\n\n(g) Maintenance costs of the Canadian Utilities Company. (Exhibit 7)\n\nOn the transfer of the property, the Canadian Utilities Company immediately rehabilitated portions of the line at a total cost of $280, as shown by Exhibit 7. Ordinarily, the Company should be reimbursed for this expense. Some of the costs of replacement are also shown in this exhibit. Note the nature and cost of replacements already necessary, viz., stubs, lightning arresters, etc.\n\n(h) Proposed New Contract with Canadian Utilities Company. (Exhibit 8.)\n\nUnder the new management, the contract is the simple one of a private service user as shown by Exhibit 8.\n\n4. DISCUSSION.\n\nThe line was constructed in 1930 at a total cost of $4,997, of which the portion A-B cost $2,523.28. The line has been built for seven years. In another eight years, replacements or stubbing of poles will have to be undertaken and in a few more years, similar action must be taken with the remainder of the equipment. One bolt of lightning may require replacement of one or more transformers at a cost of $380. Insulators are broken; or the line may be partially destroyed by storms or prairie fires, as has happened elsewhere to Calgary Power lines. Meanwhile, if the Dominion Government retain ownership of the line, it will be compelled to maintain it at a considerable cost. It is understood that the Calgary Power Company did not tender any bid for maintenance up to the present, but the Canadian Utilities Company certainly would do so. In addition, if the Canadian Utilities Company do not obtain possession, they will build a parallel line on the south side of the road and the school or Government would pay dearly for maintenance of their line.\n\nThe financial considerations are as follows:\n\n| Cost of maintenance per year | $50 |\n|-----------------------------|-----|\n| Depreciation per year 4% on $4997.200 | $250 |\n| Total cost per year | $250 |\n| Total Cost | $4997.00 |\n| Depreciation to date 7 years @4% of $4997 | $1399.00 |\n| Present net value | $3598.00 |\n\nConsidering a maintenance and depreciation cost of $250 per year, the net value would be exhausted in thirteen years.\n\nIt is further noted that the saving in rates to the school under the new management may possibly reach $160 per annum, or a total yearly saving of $410.\nIf the Indian Department retain ownership of the line, there is no possibility of having the Company assume the cost of transmission charges on the 2\u00bd miles of line. Also, other causes, such as lightning, etc., may cause trouble, delay and expense. It might even be necessary to hire a St. Paul Electrician to assume maintenance if the Company declined to do so.\n\nAll of these troubles would be eliminated if the Company own the line. If and when the line needs complete rehabilitation or renewal, the whole question would have to be re-opened. At this future time, the line would have little or no salvage value. One cannot formulate any practical reason for retention of ownership by the Government, except the doubtful one of actual ownership. If it is relinquished, the Government and School officials will have no worry and will lose no time in supervision, as the power will be delivered to the switchboard in the school without extra cost and the whole line to the last pole outside of the school, will be the responsibility of the Company.\n\nIn consideration of the above reasoning, it would appear that the Indian Department would really be in a better position permanently if the whole line were owned by the Canadian Utilities Company.\n\n5. RECOMMENDATION.\n\nAfter consideration of the above data and discussion, I would recommend that the power line under consideration be transferred to the Canadian Utilities Company for the nominal sum of One Dollar, with the understanding that the Company will supply the necessary electrical energy to the school for lighting and power at the school switchboard after passing the transformers at the rates stipulated in their service permanently.\n\nPrecaution or reservation should be taken or made that there would be no cessation of supply at any time in the future. It is suggested that a stipulation might be made that if at any time in the future there should be a permanent cessation of supply by the Canadian Utilities Company, or if the Canadian Utilities Company relinquish ownership of the system, that ownership of this portion of the line should return to the Government, provided that the Company agrees to this reservation. This stipulation would protect the school under all conditions.\n\nCalgary, Alberta,\nApril 9, 1937.\n\nO.H. HOOVER\nEngineer-In-Charge\n\nP.A. FETTERLY\nAsst. Hydraulic Engineer.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of January 28th last regarding the power line supplying electric energy to the Blue Quills Indian School in regard to which you ask for a report, I now enclose a report dated the 9th instant, by Mr. P.A. Fetterly of our Calgary staff, together with the exhibits referred to therein.\n\nMr. Fetterly's recommendation is that the power line be transferred to the Canadian Utilities Company for the nominal sum of One Dollar provided the company will agree to supply the necessary electrical energy to the school subject to certain conditions and reservations stated in the report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.T. Johnston,\nController.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n(c) If, at any time in the future, there should be a permanent cessation of supply by the Canadian Utilities Company or if the Canadian Utilities Company relinquish ownership of the system, that ownership of this portion of the line should revert to the Government.\n\nI would appreciate your taking up the matter with the Canadian Utilities Company and advising me, as soon as possible, if they are prepared to accept the stipulations mentioned above or if they object to any of the above conditions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nCalgary Power Company, Limited,\nInsurance Exchange Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\nOttawa, April 27th, 1937.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nOn receipt of your letter of January 7th, last, regarding the transmission line running west from the town of Saint Paul to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, arrangements were made to have the Dominion Water & Power Bureau engineers investigate the matter.\n\nTheir report has just been received and I am prepared to recommend the passage of an Order-in-Council providing for the transfer of the power line to the Canadian Utilities Company for the nominal sum of $1.00 on the following conditions:\n\n(a) That the Canadian Utilities Company will permanently supply the necessary electrical energy to the school for lighting and power at the school switchboard after passing the transformers at the rates stipulated in their service.\n\n(b) That there would be no cessation of supply at any time in the future.\n\nCalgary Power Company, Limited,\nInsurance Exchange Building,\nCalgary, Alta.\nMr. W. E. Gullion, Indian Agent,\nSaddle Lake Agency,\nAlberta.\n\nDear Mr. Gullion;\n\nPlease allow me to solicit your kind assistance to obtain from the Department of Indian Affairs, the following items:\n\n3 Sewing Machines No. 1588 with:\nOnly one attachment for button-holes.\nThese machines are greatly needed not only to fabricate the clothing for our numerous children, but at the same time, to teach our big girls the use of them.\n\n24 \"Institution\" Beds complete,\n(Bed, Mattress, Pillows,) (5' x 2\u00bd')\nYou are aware, dear Mr. Gullion, that there are many children of 8, 9, 10 and even 12 years of age, especially from the Saddle Lake, Good Fish, and Beaver Lake Reserves, who do not attend School. The parents of these children request their admission, but, as our approved attendance roll is more than full, (147 children are now registered, and not one more bed to spare) we are forced to refuse them.\n\nWe therefore, renew the demand recently made in regard to increasing the attendance roll of \"Blue Quill School\" from 140 to 160 or even to 165; and, at the same time, we send in this requisition for the necessary beds to accommodate them.\n2 Gallons Satin Gle Varnish (120 - clear) to be used for the kitchen and refectory in order to protect the linoleum so graciously furnished by the Department.\n\n1 Single Row Potato Planter.\nTo get the amount of potatoes required for the School we have to plant yearly six acres of potatoes. It is very long and tedious to do it by hand.\n\nLast year the Department approved the demand made by this School for the construction of a piggery estimated at a cost of $1200.00. Owing to the shortage of funds, the Department was unable to carry on the approved plan.\n\nHowever as the above mentioned items of this requisition are more urgent at the present time, we would prefer to postpone again this construction and have our present needs attended to.\n\nWe feel confident, Mr. The Agent, that you will do your utmost to influence the Department in our favor and to cooperate with us for the general welfare and progress of our School.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n\nSaint Paul, Alberta.\nMarch 5, 1937.\nSIR:\n\nI beg to transmit herewith, a letter received from the Reverend Principal of the Blue Quill's Indian Residential school in regard to certain requirements for that institution.\n\nYou will note that he asks for three sewing machines. The matter of the machines was discussed when I was at the school recently and the Rev., Principal informed me that the machines on hand were not sufficient to meet their present requirements. Four No.127-3-2 G.O. sewing machines and one 31K-15 machine were supplied in 1931 but the three machines No.1586 are evidently required to take care of the sewing now being done.\n\nIn regard to the request for increased pupilage; I might state that there are at present, 147 pupils on the roll. In order to accommodate the additional pupils now in school, it was found necessary to use the beds from the sick wards and there are now no extra beds available. There are two or three children on the waiting list and if these could be accommodated, the registration would be about 150. It would appear therefore that arrangements for an increased pupilage would be necessary. The Rev., Principal asks that this be raised from 140 to 160 or 165. Taking the prospective recruits here who will be coming of age, discharge of pupils, etc., into consideration, the pupilage could probably be kept at 150. If there are any more eligible recruits available on the Cold Lake, Keeheewin and Frog Lake reserves in Onion Lake Agency, no doubt in time, an allowance for an increased pupilage would be necessary.\n\nAbout two gallons of varnish would be required to varnish the linoleum in the kitchen and refectory.\n\nA single row potato planter is also asked for. Discussing this with the Rev., Principal, he stated that owing to the necessity of seeding such a large area to potatoes,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\na planter was badly needed in order to speed up the work.\n\nIt is considered that if these items were authorized, the matter of the piggery could be held in abeyance as there is no pressing need for one this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. F. Gullion\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, April 29, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 2nd instant, the Department will arrange for the purchase of three new sewing machines for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nRegarding the Principal's request for an increased pupilage at this school, I may say that when preparing our appropriation for the current fiscal year, definite instructions were received not to increase pupilage at any residential school. Under these circumstances, no funds were provided for increased pupilage at the Blue Quill Residential School, and, as the funds at our disposal are limited, it will not be possible to favourably consider the Principal's request this year. As the pupilage will not be increased, it will not be necessary to consider the purchase of the new beds, mattresses and pillows.\n\nIf you consider a single new potato planter is necessary, you may arrange for the purchase of same, from a firm on the approved list. You may also purchase two gallons of varnish for varnishing the linoleum in the kitchen and refectory.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Heey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E.

Except for a slight change in the wording they are in agreement with Clause (a) of your letter and have no objection to Clause (b). Clause (c) however in its present form would conflict with their Trust Deed but we believe that practically the same result and an equally satisfactory guarantee to you can be accomplished as set out below. The following clauses have been drafted by us in collaboration with the Canadian Utilities:\n\n(a) That the Canadian Utilities Limited, its successors and assigns, will permanently supply the necessary electric energy to the School for light and power, metering the same as at present on the secondary side of the supply transformers.\n\n(b) That the rates charged for such service shall not be greater than those prevailing for similar service from time to time in the Town of Ste. Paul de Metis.\n\nWe believe the addition of the words \"its successors and assigns\" to Clause (a) eliminates any necessity of Clause (b) of your letter and we suggest that it also eliminates the necessity of the guarantee you are seeking under Clause (c) of your letter since it insures that should the Canadian Utilities relinquish ownership of the system, then its successor automatically undertakes the same guarantee to supply service to you.\nClause (b) we believe is a better guarantee to you in respect to rates than you had in your Clause (a) since it means that any reduction in the rates in St. Paul will automatically benefit you and any increase in the rates is most unlikely.\n\nAt your convenience will you kindly advise us whether an arrangement along the lines of Clauses (a) and (b) above will be satisfactory to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nManager.\n\nGHT:e\nOttawa, June 25th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of April 17th (File 41167-W) regarding the power line supplying electrical energy to the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, the Department wrote the Calgary Power Company Limited and, for your information, I enclose a copy of our letter to them.

Father Allard of Blue Quills Indian Residential School, enquiring what is being done regarding the root-house they intend building, a plan of which he states he handed to you. I presume this is the plan you sent me, together with yours.\n\nFrom Father Allard's letter mentioned above, I understand that application was to be made to the Department for funds to build this root-house. This is the first I hear of this: Your letter of July 18th, in reply to my No. 400-SC. of June 26th asking you to submit the plan of the root-house you intend building at the Agency, does not say so. While you state you enclose a plan of the root-house Father Allard wishes to build, and that the cost will be about $600.00, including labour, no request is made for assistance. My interpretation of your letter was that you were enclosing his root-house plan for comparative purposes.\n\nI am returning herewith the plans prepared for Father Allard, and would ask you to call on him at once, and while with him immediately prepare a letter to the Department, giving full particulars and details, and asking for an early reply.\n\nPlease let me have a copy for my file. I am forwarding a copy of this letter to the Rev. Father Allard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSADDLE LAKE, Alta.\n\nC. Pant.

Allard, O.M.I., St. Paul, Alta.\nFor your information.\n\nCOPY:\nSir:\n\nI beg to enclose herewith copy of a letter I have today addressed to Mr. W. E. Gullion, Indian Agent, Saddle Lake.\n\nWhen at Blue Quills School on May 28th, last, I saw the old side bank root house, which was showing signs of caving in, and in my opinion was not worth repairing. Rev. Father Allard, the Manager (Bursar) at the School, informed me he intended building a new one, the plans of which he had not yet prepared. We discussed the matter at length, as I was deeply interested, having several root houses to build under Special Welfare. During the summer I have received from the different Agents plans of root-houses I had asked them to prepare: On July 19th I received Mr. Gullion's, enclosed with which was a plan of the new root house to be built at Blue Quills School, which, as stated in my letter attached hereto, I thought he had sent for comparative purposes.\n\nAs it is, Blue Quills School have no root house, and I am very much disappointed about it, as the season is rapidly advancing. In another six weeks we will be having cold nights and frosts, and taking up of garden stuff will begin. The old root house is not worth repairing, and a new one will have to be built.\n\nRev. Father Allard, I understand, made application to Agent Gullion for assistance to build this root house, and through my mis-interpreting the Agent's letter, the matter has not been placed before the Department.\n\nI strongly recommend that when the application is received from Mr. Gullion, that authority be given to erect the root house.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Res.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nC.

The old root cellar, which was found very unsatisfactory, recently caved in and is now useless.\n\nI have discussed this matter with the Reverend Principal and I am enclosing herewith plan of root cellar submitted by him. The plan of root cellar submitted would no doubt prove satisfactory and the approximate cost of $600.00 for material and labor would appear to be reasonable. The list of materials, etc., required is given on the back of the sheet showing plan.\n\nThere will be a considerable crop of potatoes and vegetables to harvest this year and as there are no storage facilities at the school, I should be glad to have the building of a suitable root cellar authorized. As the season is advanced, the Reverend Principal would appreciate approval of his request by wire.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

I am, therefore, enclosing the two vouchers required which you should sign. The account of W. Dubois amounts to $28.40 of which amount $24.40 is material and the balance labour.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nW. E. Gullion, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaddle Lake, Alta.\nSir:\n\nThe water from this drilled, 6\u00bd-inch casing well, which was sunk when the school was built, is very hard, and coloured with rust, and is not used for drinking or cooking. Water for this purpose is hauled in a thresherman's tank from a neighbour's well. There is quite a history in connection with this well, of which the Department no doubt have full particulars.\n\nWhen at St. Paul, I interviewed Mr. J. E. Frederickson of that town, who says that when he sunk the well, he found a small supply of hard water at 97 feet; at 207 feet he found more water and this was very, very hard; at 327 feet he found water in sand. This was clear, fairly soft and apparently plentiful. A pump was installed, and the caretaker instructed to pump continuously for a certain period of time, in order to clean out the bottom of the sand and make a reservoir or basin. It appears these instructions were not carried out properly, i.e., the pumping was not continuous. It was some considerable time after the well had been sunk before the school was occupied by the staff and pupils, and therefore very little, if any pumping was done before they moved in. Later, after the school was occupied, the water supply became inadequate.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made to clean the well by pumping; The pump cylinder would pack with fine sand or silt, which packed so hard that the pump rods broke. These were replaced with heavier ones, but the pump cylinder continued to pack with silt and would not work at all. The casing was then blown (broken) at the 207 foot level. This gave a large supply of water, but as stated above, it is hard and full of rust. A Duro water softener was then installed; I am told this did not prove satisfactory, as it did not remove the rust, which caused the screens or discs in the water softener to crack. These were changed on several occasions, but did not last any length of time. As it is, the softener is not being used, and the hard, rusty water goes directly into the pressure tank and is used in the heating boilers and through the pipes throughout the whole building.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\nWhen a tap is opened after being closed for a number of hours, the water comes out quite reddish at first, then clears somewhat, but always has some colour of rust.\n\nI am afraid this water will damage (corrode) the piping in the building; also, it may ruin our heating boilers and system. (Ref. Dept. letter No. 118-1-5 under date of September 11th, 1936.)\n\nI am not in a position to recommend what should be done: When at St. Paul I mentioned the matter to Mr. Frederickson (mentioned above) who suggests a new 327-foot well, and says he believes a good supply of clear, fairly soft water can again be obtained at that depth if the well is given the proper attention (continual pumping) as soon as completed, in order to make a reservoir or basin at the bottom.\n\nI have been waiting for the return of Mr. P. A. Fetterly of the Dominion Water Power Branch, who has been absent for some time, before writing; I saw him this A. M. when he stated he would read his files and report to their Director at Ottawa.\n\nAs stated above, I fear serious damage may be caused to our heating system and water piping generally.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nC. Fant. Schmidt,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nAlberta Inspectorate.\nCopy sent to Mr. Schmidt\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a report from Inspector Schmidt with reference to the water supply at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. As you are aware a water softener was installed in the fall of 1935 but Mr. Schmidt advises that this is not being used at the present time. The softener was rather expensive equipment, as it cost an amount of $650.00, and the Department cannot understand why its use was discontinued without first receiving official approval. Please let me have a full report stating why such action was taken in view of the fact that the water is so hard that without the use of a softener considerable damage is being done to the pipes.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. L. Balter, O.M.I.,\nPrincipal,\nBlue Quills Residential School,\nSt. Paul, Alta.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the water supply at the Blue Quills Indian Residential School. A copy of your letter is being sent to the Director of the Surveys and Engineering Branch and he is being requested to forward us a copy of Mr. Fetterly's report as soon as the latter is received. At that time the matter will be further considered and a decision made regarding what action should be taken.\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of a letter that is being sent to the Principal of the Blue Quills School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nC. H. Schmidt, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nCalgary, Alta.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. WARDLE\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mr. C. P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Alberta, in which he reports on the water supply at the Blue Quills Residential School, Saddle Lake Indian Agency.\n\nFor your information I enclose a copy of Mr. Schmidt's report. You will note that he has discussed the matter with Mr. P. A. Fetterly who promised to report to you. When Mr. Fetterly's report is received I would appreciate your sending me a copy of it.\n\nI am writing to the Principal of the Blue Quills School in order to ascertain why the use of the water softener was discontinued without receiving official approval. I may say that the water softener was purchased in November, 1935 at a cost of $650.00. It was selected and installed under the direction of Mr. Hoover and Mr. Fetterly.\n\nDirector.\nBlue Quills Res. School\nSt. Paul, Alberta.\nFeb. 25th, 1938.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn complying with your wish of having a full report regarding the use of the water-softener installed in the fall of 1935, I wish to state the following:\n\n1st - The pressure of the pump being too strong pushed the gravel and rust through the screen of the softener and blocked it to the point of bursting. In fact, one of the tanks of the softener became worn out by the force of the gravel and had to be replaced by a new one. For this reason, the position of the softener was changed and was placed between the water-tank and the system-pipes (which go through the building). This was done in the fall of 1936, Father Angin being principal.\n\n2nd - However the trouble continued. The amount of rust accumulating in the softener-tanks necessitated the cleaning of the softener almost every day so as to have the water fairly clear to pass through the system-pipes. Furthermore, when there was a lot of water used e.g. as on washing and bathing days, the rust even passed from the softener-tanks\nTo the system-pipes and it took a half-day then to clean the softener. Thus, there being always some rust going into the pipes even with the use of the softener, we decided in June 1937, to discontinue its use.\n\nThe remedy offered for your consideration by our engineer, is to have the water coming from the Pump pass through a filter before passing through the softener.\n\nOn receipt of your letter I gave orders to put the softener into use again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

Consequently it will not be possible to favourably consider doing all the painting requested by the Principal. I would also point out that if the total amount available is expended for painting it will not be possible to do any other repair work at the school. Our funds next year will be quite limited and the amount specifically appropriated for this school cannot be exceeded.\n\nI would, therefore, appreciate if you would discuss with the Principal the question of repairs and improvements at the Blue Quills School during the fiscal year 1938-39 with a view to definitely deciding if there are other expenditures that will be necessary or if the total amount available can be expended in painting. In connection with the proposed painting I might say that the cost could be considerably reduced if the school staff were prepared to do the work and only request the Department to supply the material.\n\nYours truly,\n\nW.

I found that owing to corrosion, some of the three inch pipes forming part of the heating system in the boiler room had started leaking badly and it was necessary to have the damage repaired at the earliest possible moment in order to supply heat to the building. Mr. J. Dubois, of St. Paul, steam engineer and fitter, had been called and repair work was started immediately. The approximate cost of replacements and labour is estimated at $125.00.\n\nConsiderable rust had accumulated in the pipes, particularly around the elbows and unions and the metal had been eaten through. Some new pipes were necessary.\n\nThis condition is no doubt caused by the water which is hard and it is probable that there will be sufficient corrosion in other parts of the system to cause further trouble later.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E. Julien\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n15th March, 1938.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water supply, Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to the above matter and in reply to your memorandum of the 4th instant, I am forwarding herewith a copy of a memorandum received from our Chief Engineer together with a copy of a report from Mr. Hoover. It will be noted that the main difficulties with this water supply are the general hardness of the water and a rust content which is a major objection for domestic purposes. It will also be noted that Mr. Hoover is in communication with a firm for obtaining an analysis of the water which will be forwarded to you when received.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle\n\nRe: Water Supply, Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 8th instant in connection with the above, I may say that a report has now been received from Mr. Hoover, copy of which is attached for your reference.\n\nFrom the information now available, it would seem that this well has been the victim of rather unfortunate circumstances. First when the drilling of the well was completed it would appear that such necessary action as carrying on continuous pumping until the bottom of the well was cleaned of sand and a reservoir or basin formed was not carried out. This condition was also probably aggravated by the fact that as the school was not occupied for some time after completion of the building no use was made of the well for some period of time. When the well was put into use it appears that the water supply became inadequate but the general evidence seems to indicate that there is really a sufficient supply of water in this well and therefore the lessening of the supply would appear to have been due to filling up of the pipe with sand and silt.\n\nInstead of properly cleaning out this sand and silt it appears the casing was blown at the 207 foot elevation where according to the log very hard water was found when drilling. The blowing of the casing at this elevation, however, would appear to seriously complicate any action towards cleaning out and reusing the well to its original depth of 327 feet where better water was found when the well was first drilled.\n\nThe difficulties now encountered at this well appear to be, first,- the general hardness of the water, and second,- a rust content in the water which, of course, is a major objection for domestic purposes.\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector, Surveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nIt will be noted in the last paragraph of Mr. Hoover's report that he is in communication with a firm with the purpose of obtaining an analysis of the water and when same is received it will be forwarded on to you.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(sgd.) T.S. Mills.\nSir:-\n\nWater Supply at Blue Quills Indian School.\n\nMr. C.P. Schmidt, Inspector of Indian Agencies, for Alberta, brought the condition of the above-named well to the attention of Mr. Fetterly and myself.\n\nAs a consequence I have been examining the file. I would like to refer you to my several reports on the matter. These begin April 26, 1933, and are at present in the office of the Controller of the Water and Power Bureau.\n\nBriefly this office was instructed in a telegram May 8, 1933, to consider a new well at a cost of $1300. However, before abandoning the old well it was considered advisable to blow the old well with dynamite at the 200 feet level. This was done early in June 1933 and a sufficient supply of water obtained. This water was hard but not too much so for a water softener. It had no colouring matter except a small amount of fine sand.\n\nLater, in November, 1935, a water softener was purchased and installed.\n\nStill later, in June, 1937, a water softener was disconnected as \"rust\" had made its appearance in the water. That is the condition at present.\n\nMr. Fetterly of this staff secured a gallon of the water as at present existing and gave it to Bell and Morris, of Calgary, from whom the water softener was obtained, to send to the manufacturers of Duro Softener at London, Ontario, to be analysed.\n\nThe result of this analysis is expected daily. Mr. Frederickson of St. Paul who drilled the well and performed the repairs in a recent interview with Mr. Schmidt stated that when he sunk the well he found a small supply of hard water at 97 feet; at 207 feet he found more water and this was very, very hard; at 327 feet he found water in sand. This was clear, fairly soft and\n\nT.S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\napparently plentiful. A pump was installed and the caretaker instructed to pump continuously for a certain period of time in order to clean out the bottom of the sand and make a reservoir or basin. It appears these instructions were not carried out properly, i.e., the pumping was not continuous. It was some considerable time after the well had been sunk before the school was occupied by the staff and pupils, and therefore very little, if any pumping was done before they moved in. Later, after the school was occupied, the water supply became inadequate.\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt was made to clean the well by pumping. The pump cylinder would pack with fine sand or silt, which packed so hard that the pump rods broke. These were replaced with heavier ones, but the pump cylinder continued to pack with silt and would not work at all. The casing was then blown (broken) at the 207 foot level. This gave a large supply of water, but as stated above it is hard and full of rust. A Duro water softener was then installed. I am told this did not prove satisfactory as it did not remove the rust, which caused the screens or discs in the water softener to crack. These were changed on several occasions but did not last any length of time. As it is the softener is not being used and the hard rusty water goes directly into the pressure tank and is used in the heating boilers and through the pipes throughout the whole building.\n\nIt is evident that the \"rust\" appeared a couple of years after the well was \"blown.\" At that time it was doing well.\n\nAt present the school is using the untreated water.\n\nBell and Morris state that they have a machine which removes rust but we have not yet examined it. On receipt of the report on analysis I will communicate with you further.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(sgd.) O.H. Hoover,\nEngineer-in-Charge.\nEND OF REEL", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
