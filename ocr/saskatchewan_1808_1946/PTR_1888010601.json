A copy of the proceedings was printed in the election papers handed to all voters at the polls.\n\nDr. Bain, nominated by T. N. Campbell and seconded by J. F. Betts.\nMr. Thos. Knowles, by J. O. Davis and A. L. Sifton.\n\nELECTION RESULTS.\n\nWard No. I.\u2014L. J. McPhail, nominated by E. Dooner and seconded by H. B. Macdonald.\nJoseph Courtney, by T. O. Davis and R. C. Wigmore.\nWard No. II.\u2014J. L. Johnson, nominated by W. J. Macdonald and seconded by W. J. Carter.\nT. E. Baker, by J. D. Maveety and W. Drain.\nJim Knowles, by J. F. Betts and Jas.

Murray.\nT. J. Agnew, by John McTaggart and James Macarthur.\nR. C. Wigmore, by Wm. J. Carter and J. D. Haasdonk.\n\nMr. Gwynne withdrew after the nominations closed, and Mr. Mair has since filled his place as Returning Officer, but he has not been signed according to the Ordinance his name should have been signed. We think it is a great mistake for electors to nominate candidates for civic honours without having given notice in part of the person's willingness to stand. If a man wishes to be a candidate let him stand himself and if not let him bring someone else forward; and if not let each ward nominate their own candidates.\n\nTHE ELECTION.\n\nThe election for mayor and councillors took place on Monday last and passed off very quietly. The contest for mayor was between Mr. McPhail, who was nominated in opposition to Dr. Bain, withdrew before the election began.\n\nIn Ward No. I, although Mr. Courtney was nominated he virtually was not in the field. The race was in that ward was over for Mr. McPhail.\n\nWard No. II was only contested. Sam. McLeod withdrew at the commencement, thus leaving the field to Mr. Joseph Courtney and David Macdonald.\n\nIn Ward No. IV Mr. Chas. Mair, with draw leaving the field to Messrs. Agnew and W. R. Gwynne and resulted in the return of Mr. Agnew by a majority of one.\n\nThe following is the result of the poll:\n\nWARD NO. I.\n\nMcPhail...16\nCourtney...10\n\nWARD NO. II.\n\nKnowles...41\nJohnson...33\nBaker...32\n\nWARD NO. III.\n\nStewart...36\nMaclean...28\nWigmore...26\n\nWARD NO.
