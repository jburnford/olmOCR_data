Smithfield\nActing Indian Agent\nOttawa, November 29, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant, relative to the request of the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School for a grant to purchase prizes, toys and other gifts for the pupils at Christmas.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding $25.00 in the purchase of suitable gifts. This is the full amount that can be allowed at this school. There are many demands at this season of the year and our funds are limited. You should consult the teacher concerning what supplies she requires and arrange for the purchase of same. Itemized accounts, in duplicate, should be obtained, and these you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment. The above authorized amount should not be exceeded.\n\nRelative to a grant for prizes, etc., for the No. 2 School, I beg to say that you were informed in official letter of the 14th instant of the amount that was provided for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPort Lambton, Ont.\nLet the children in the picture be the little Indians. The picture when completed should be worth $350. We could get it sent to a missionary school, the cost of an additional copy of Shaws case to write, will send it to me, postage prepaid. I should like to be satisfied with $250. We have already sent him $27 raised from school concerts and approximately $30 owing. Would it be possible to ask the Dept. to send $25 as a grant for the purchase - we have never had such a grant - this could be sent direct to the artist, and we would need the funds for the concert at the end of the year. Kindly advise what you feel to do in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHarriette Macpherson\nM.O. Indian Day School\nKwakwaka'wakw Reserve\nPort McNeill, B.C.\n8th, 1928\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Trustees of the Kwakwaka'wakw Reserve\n\nWe have recently learned that\none of our students died while attending school.\n\nWe have decided to erect a memorial\nin the form of a bronze plaque in\nmemory of each Indian pupil who died while\nattending school.\n\nThe school principal, Mr. Smith, principal\nof the reserve school, has agreed to\nhave the plaque made for us. It is an\nact of kindness that he has offered,\nreporting \"I will be glad to assist in\nthis matter\" (enclosed is a copy).\nAll the children in the picture are to be little Indians. The picture was completed about six months ago. Because of the trip to a missionary school, the artist, Mr. Goldhammer of 5 Stars Ave Toronto, will send it to us along with a framed etching for slightly less than we have already paid him. We need four solid weeks for a concert. I am going to write to ask the West to send $25 as a grant for school pictures\u2014we have never had such a grant\u2014this could be sent direct to the artist, and we could send the other $5 by a concert at Christmas to raise money for school. We have often over our own heads, but what else can we do in this matter? Remain, very truly yours,\n\nHarriette Macpherson\nOttawa, December 10, 1928.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th instant, I beg to inform you that the salary cheques for the current quarter for yourself and Mrs. McDougall as teachers of the Walpole Island No. 1 Day School will be mailed from here on the 15th instant. It is noted that you will have the usual quarterly reports forwarded through your loc. 1 Indian Agent.\n\nRelative to your request for a grant to assist towards the payment of the cost of a memorial picture which you have ordered and which is to be placed in the school, I have to say that the Department has never provided grants for purposes of this kind. We have no funds available for this purpose, and it is, therefore, regretted that the sum asked for cannot be provided. The copy shot of the picture which you enclosed was received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. E. Macpherson,\nR. R. #3, Wallaceburg,\nOnt.\nNo. 1 Indian Bay School,\nWalpole Island Reserve,\nP.O. no. 3, Wallaceburg, Ontario\nJan. 3rd, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Macdonald,\n\nI am writing to inform you that Mr. Riggsfield expects to take up his residence on Walpole Island and thus be available whenever we need to consult him in matters relative to the school work. The present arrangement is most unsatisfactory. According to the fiscal year report, the agent was the school. The former agent always called regularly to see that all was going smoothly. Now there is a great deal of work necessary in connection with a day school of 75 pupils. Mr. Riggsfield never calls; it is most difficult to locate, as he seldom visits his office here and never comes when we telephone. Furthermore, we do not feel any sense of being handled. We go to Fort Edward to see him, although we have had to do so already.\n\nMight I draw your attention to the following requests which have been made to Mr. Riggsfield but to date have brought no results:\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nHandwritten note: \"Handwritten note: Handwritten note:\"\n(2) In October the request was made for a separate outdoor toilet for the Teachers' residence. The present arrangement whereby the ladies, who children all are the same toilet, partitioned partly by but with one pit was found unsatisfactory, not only from a hygienic but moral viewpoint.\n\n(3) The wood for the school stove, one stick of which alone, is too much for a woman to be expected to lift, must at present be carried in on our owns the school wheel barrow, you will understand and upon the teachers request for a new one to which wood with your help authorized the purchase of a new wheel barrow. In the past it was customary to order from Mr. J. Smith's Sons, hardware merchants, Wallacree, as always, to find the school most satisfactory, delivering their goods, the day after it is ordered. Mr. Smithfield in trying to order last fall Hamilton orders from the General store here, which we turn orders from the factory and although the purchase of the wheel barrow was authorized... we have a month ago, to July 1st, not arrived.\nThere is the greatest need of a sink in the residence, where slop water may be emptied. With the present arrangement all slop water must be carried outside, a distance of feet. This is not very satisfactory especially in cold weather. A good sink could be installed in the which would add much to the comfort of the residence and the appearance of the school grounds.\n\n(4) The pump needs a metal guard around the base, so all refuse water, drips down into the well. This is especially bad when the Indian children's noses are bleeding, they stand around the pump, unwittingly allowing the bloody water to run down into the well, which might be the cause of an outbreak of typhoid fever.\n\nI trust these matters will receive your kind attention, and wishing you all happiness for this New Year.\n\nVery Sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Farrell & H. Macpherson\nOttawa, January 7, 1929.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, with reference to improvements at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School and to the visits of Mr. Indian Agent Highfield.

R. #3,\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nOttawa, January 7, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe senior teacher of the Halpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School reports that you are not visiting the school sufficiently often to transact the necessary business. The Department expects you to give whatever attention is required to this important part of your work.\n\nI should be glad to have a reply to my letter of November 26th, last, in which you were asked to estimate the cost of an outdoor toilet for the teachers' residence. Mrs. Macpherson states that she has asked you for a wheelbarrow, for a kitchen sink in the residence and for a metal jacket around the base of the school pump. Please let me have your recommendation without delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA.

I wish to say that I gave an estimate on foot of letter to the Dept. on or about Dec 7th 1928, which also contained request for porch and toilet for No 2 School, as the estimate for each toilet was $60.00 the Dept did not approve of toilet at No 2 School I considered the same would apply to No 1 School's request, the teachers on No 1 have again requested that I take the matter up with the Dept., as $60 estimate seems rather high. I have asked another contractor to submit an estimate, 5' by 6' with 6' ceiling, a box below 15\" by 24\" with trap at rear for cleaning purposes.\n\nAs soon as these tenders are submitted I shall immediately notify the Dept.\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nWalpole Reserve.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nSir;-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 7 inst., No 40-1-5 Re teachers report.\n\nI might say that up till Dec. 21st I firmly believe that I averaged two calls a week to No 1 School, the two weeks following I was confined to my house with an attack of the \"Flu\", from Jan 3rd to the present date I have been in the office every day except Sundays, not over a half a mile from the School, have talked to the Senior teacher at intervals during this period, also I have a phone in my residence so what had they needed me on any pressing emergency I was available.\n\nIn a letter under date of Jan 11th I have dealt with the question of toilets for teachers personal use.\n\nRegards to the wheel barrow when I placed the order there was none in stock, after ordering from wholesale it seemed much longer than usual for delivery, it came during the time I was confined with the \"Flu\" and the dealer forwarded it to Walpole Island where it remained at the Public dock for some time where they must surely have seen it, needing to pass it while going to and coming from the Algoma Ferry, as soon as I arrived at the office I had it delivered to the School house.\n\nAs for the kitchen sink and metal jacket for pump I have no recollection of them requesting me for such.\n\nI was at the School again yesterday and they brought up the toilet question again, but did not ask for kitchen sink or metal jacket for pump, if they request from me a sink and metal jacket for pump I shall honor the dept with my report, they have mentioned the fact to me that they need no recommendation from me to see what they want, it has been brought to my attention in the past month or six weeks that they keep very irregular School hours they appear to have no set time for calling school in the morning recess or at noon hour, always take at least one hour and a half for noon when the school regulations specify only one hour, recently it has been brought to my attention that there are children living within one half mile of school who have not attended school during this term nor have not been reported as absentee's on monthly report, and when I spoke to the teachers about these children they were aware of the fact that they were not attending school, it has been reported to me that\nthere are other children not being reported for which I am as yet unable to confirm.\n\nI am trying to get a check on conditions at this school also a list of children who should be attending. I am sorry to say that the teachers do not seem so inclined to co-operate.\n\nIf you will please refer to a former letter of mine covering the last School report you will see that I did not feel like recommending the adoption of the report as submitted as I wanted to get a further report of school hours as held daily at No. 1 School, also the non-attendance of pupils of school age which are not being reported on the monthly report to the Truant Officer.\n\nI am Sir of the opinion that for harmony to prevail there should be complete co-operation between Agent and Teachers.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nAgent Walpole Reserve.\n\nJ.

Conlon Contractor of Port Lambton has offered to\nbuild the two toilets for $39.00 each.\nThese toilets are to be 4' by 5', 6' high Shingle roof\nsheeted and sided with paper between, the cleanout box\nis to be 18\" by 24\" by 5' long, with rear trap for cleaning\npurposes.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nAgent Walpole Reserve.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAss't Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 21st, 1929.\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of erecting a toilet for the teachers' use at each of the Nos. 1 and 2 schools on the Walpole Island Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with Mr. M. Conlon, contractor of Port Lambton, to build a toilet at each of these schools of the dimensions as mentioned in your letter. These toilets should have shingled roofs, sheeted and sided with paper between. It is noted that the price quoted for doing this work is $50 for each toilet. I shall be pleased if you will arrange to have this work carried out at the earliest possible date that weather conditions will permit.\n\nWhen these toilets have been completed, please forward a separate account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the work for each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Two brothers are at Brandon - \"... her name is Barnes\"\n\nII. Sisters - mother has no means of support\n\nIII. Lives with various Indians, too far from school for children to attend\n\nIV. Father a white man - \"... he is now resident in another village. Indians are living at agency. Child lives with his own grandfather who cannot clothe him.\n\nV. One family - father and mother not married - mother's wife living. These children live too far from school.\n\nVI. Father a returned soldier, dead. Children in receipt of pension. Still father always in jail for wife beating. Children are not properly cared for.\n\nVII. Son of a returned soldier, dead. Father had trouble with his creditors.\n\nVIII. Father lives with his mother's father. Never properly fed or clothed. Also, most unhealthy.\n\nIX. Names of these children not known. They live too far away to attend school.\n\nX. Lives with his grandparents who want to send him away.\n\nThe other children are from No. 1 School.\nNo 1 Indian Bay School,\nWalpole Island Reserve,\nP.O. Box 3, Wallaceburg, Ont.\nMarch 16th 1921\n\nMr. Russell Perrin,\nIndian Education Office,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Mr. Perrin,\n\nAs another school year draws to a close, there are certain things which we who are so vitally interested in the school and the Indians of Walpole Island wish to draw to your attention. Reports on trivial matters in connection with the school, e.g., the great good to your health while the more worthwhile matters are overlooked. Please treat this letter as official or unofficial when convenient.\n\nThe wood for the school stove or indoor furnaces. The wood supplied is 3' long. This year, more than ever before, those having the contract to supply this wood have brought huge sticks, some just the trunks of trees, some trunks or hearts of the trunk with wood chopped off. The sticks weigh on an average 5 lbs each. It is almost physically impossible for any woman to keep the fires fed. We have to lift these sticks and throw...\nthem into the stove approximately 12 to 15 sticks a day at the fires used in building at both morning and afternoon recesses and at noon hour. During very cold weather we fill up the stoves at 4 o'clock. We drew the agent's attention to this want and asked him to see to it. It was split before being delivered also asked the man who supplied it if they were smaller wood, explaining how hard it was to lift. But no attention was paid to our request. There are about 40 cords of this wood piled in the yard too heavy to lift, while we keep burning the lumber wood scattered throughout the yard. This is not smaller wood be delivered to the school.\n\nEarly last fall we requested and the Dept. granted new toilets for the teacher's residence. To date these toilets have never been supplied. Meanwhile the two teachers and 16 pupils, both white and Indians have one toilet divided into 3 compartments but with the same pit underneath. The excuse for non-delivery was that the ground was frozen too hard to dig a pit although gravel was being dug in the cemetery next the school. Now there is no frost left in the ground.\n\nA year or two ago the farmer's salary was increased to $100 a year on condition that he scrub once a month and clean the windows. The\nSchool has not been scrubbed since Christmas and then only with a broom and cold water. It was filthy condition last week. One room was practically scrubbed for parasitic to being nourished. But the whole building should be thoroughly cleaned at Hampton where duty is to be done. That is done - the agent's teacher.\n\nThere has been an epidemic of sickness - severe coughing and vomiting among the school children at this school. They report only children attending (one day only). While here we only average 2-3 between the two teachers. Wed March 6 the Agent and Teacher decided to close the school, as the doctor says this \"virus\" is infecting through the plants to keep it from spreading. Should the school population be exposed to this disease, i.e., send home all pupils suspected of having it, be infected?\n\nIn the past the Dept. has hardly granted permission to buy each year, new swing rope for the school swings which are wooden ones erected over to repair a good and becoming quite unsafe would it be possible to have a steel frame and chain swings erected - regular playground equipment. It would be less expensive in the end.\nas it would eliminate the practice of buying new sewing rope each year. There are 70 children attending here in the summer and the smaller ones do love to sewing. There are about 25 children, more or less, who for various reasons cannot attend school on the Reserve. We gave the list to the Agent and Truant Officer, who visited all the homes and found that in the majority of cases it would be advisable and the parents were willing that the children be sent to a residential school. Mr. Elgin is full but Shingwauk would accept some. No doubt you will have received the Agent's report on this but I again forward the list of children from this section of the Island. If you contemplate sending them away, please they go immediately before spring weather makes living conditions most disagreeable and they love the idea of education. Would like if anyone from here is sent with them to put in an application for the position of delivering them to a given destination.\n\nOtherwise all is well. There is an Entrance Class of 3 pupils. Six of the children are taking violin or piano.\nlessons and are making good progress with their school work.\n\nWould it be possible to have our quarterly cheque forwarded in order to reach here before the end of the month. We have been requested to attend the Ontario Education Association meeting in Toronto, Easter week\u2014April 1st-6th\u2014and would like to have our cheque before we go.\n\nThanking you, I remain,\n\nVery truly Yours,\nHarriette Macpherson.\n\nP.S.\nRe the report or complaint about \"Billie\"\u2014the goat. He is a small black and white goat given to the school children as a mascot. The school children raised him on a little land are most attached to him. He is kept tethered in a field beside the school yard, upon permission from the Indian owner. This is no bother absolutely. The complaint received was from the owner of a police dog which killed several pet rabbits here at the school. When he knew we were annoyed by retaliation by having a complaint put up against the goat, he didn't at all trouble if we ever did or not, saying anonymously that a complaint could be entered.\nOttawa, March 21st, 1929.\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, referring to various matters in connection with the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nRelative to the size of the wood supplied for the use of the school, the Department is taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Highfield. A cheque was sent yesterday to Walter Ross for supplying, piling and sawing wood. On his account you have certified that the work was satisfactorily done, and it is, therefore, presumed you refer to the wood that was purchased from Allan Isaac in December last, for the furnace. We have requested the Agent to see that the wood is split into sizes easy to handle.\n\nWe are also requesting the Agent to have a toilet for the teachers' residence erected as soon as possible, to engage into the janitor's services and to have the schoolroom thoroughly scrubbed and the windows washed during the coming Easter holidays. We are also requesting him to report regarding the cost of erecting swings of the type mentioned by you.\n\nIt is noted that the school was closed by order of the doctor on account of an epidemic of whooping cough, but that it has been reopened. No child having a contagious disease should be permitted to attend. If in any case you are aware that a child has, or you have strong reasons to suspect a child of having a contagious disease, you should not permit him or her to attend during the period of illness.\n\nCheques in payment of the salary of yourself and Mrs. MacDougall for the current quarter will be sent early next week.\n\nRelative to the list of children which you enclosed as not attending school and whom you recommend be placed in residential schools, I have to say that all of these cases have already been drawn to the attention of the Department by Mr. Agent Highfield. The Department regrets that there are no vacancies for these children at either Mount Elgin or Shingwauk Home, Sault Ste. Marie, until after the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. J. MacKenzie\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. H. H. Macpherson,\nR. R. #3,\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nOttawa, March 21st, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School has requested that swings be provided as playground equipment. She requests that a steel frame supporting 6 chair swings be installed. I have to request that you will enquire into this matter and inform the department as to the cost of erecting swings of the type desired by the teacher. If any new rope is required for the present school swings, you may purchase and have installed the quantity required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

You have already received the necessary instructions to proceed with this work, and in this connection I would refer you to your letter of January 25th, last, in which you stated that Mr. Conlon had agreed to build the toilet at this school and also at the No. 2 school at a very early date. It is considered that weather conditions would permit having this work carried out, and you should see that the toilets are completed at the earliest possible date.

It appears there were a few sticks larger than they should have been. We are requesting Mr. Agent Highfield to arrange to have any wood remaining on hand, which is too large, split into smaller sizes. When this has been done, it is hoped that the wood will be satisfactory.\n\n(2) We are informed that the toilet for the teachers' use has been erected.\n\n(3) The Agent is enquiring as to the cost of installing steel swings on the playgrounds. When we have full information as to the cost, consideration will then be given to authorising the supplying of same.\n\n(4) Relative to janitor services, we understand that Mr. Day has handed his resignation to the Agent to take effect the 31st ultimo, and we are taking up the matter of obtaining a successor with him.\n\n(5) Cleaning schoolroom and washing windows: The Agent states that he has arranged to have the school thoroughly cleaned and the windows washed during the present Easter holidays. He has also been instructed during the summer holidays, next, to have the oil which was used on the floors removed, the floors thoroughly cleaned and varnished. He is also taking up with the builder the question of the smoking of the stove and chimney and it is hoped that a definite solution of this difficulty will be arrived at.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The daughters of the Empire at Wallaceburg installed swings for the Grade 1-3 but at the following prices: 6 steel swings $150 each called the Senior Outfit; 3 steel swings called the Junior Outfit $100. In each case it would cost $150 for delivery and installation. The Senior Outfit would give the best satisfaction in the difference in price.\nBetter quotations might be obtained from a wholesale firm direct.\n\nRe the wood for the school furnace. Really believe that the prices the wood delivered this year was because the man who had the contract is the father of the janitor at No. II School. He is a very old man - his name is Mr. Miller. I said to No. II School that it would be easier lifting. He knew and the pieces that could not be split were left in, and gravel could find quite tough. Mr. Helpfield, the agent, says he told them to bring smaller wood but they paid no attention. However, as you have given instructions to have it split feel certain that there will be no further difficulty. Remembering you put your kindness and interest. I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nHarriette H. Macpherson\nOttawa, April 23, 1929.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nI have to request that you will ship, addressed to Mrs. H.

The top of the well is quite tight it has a cement top except a small opening where the pump goes in that is covered with two inch plank and the pump bolted to them these plank could be covered with galvanized iron and possibly make it a little tighter. I have always understood that a surface well has to have some opening for air or the water will get stale and have a very bad odor.\n\nThe first complaint I received of the well being bad was early one morning Mrs. Macpherson called up and said the pump wouldn't work. I immediately secured the services of the Truant officer and we found the top off the well and the pump on the ground as we could see nothing wrong with it we put it back in again and worked as good as any pump and the water seemed to be all right to both myself and Mr. Wright (the Truant Officer) as there seemed to be some dirt floating on top. I ask the medical health officer to make an analysis.\n\nJ.D. Mclean\nAsst. Deputy uni Secretary\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nArchibald\n\nIndian agent\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo: Cousine A.

A drip from the eves causes them to get wet going in and out. \"No trespassing\" signs placed around the school yard. Also signs at each side of the school on the road, for auto traffic. The signs to read, \"School, drive slowly.\" I think these signs are quite necessary, and recommend they be placed at about one hundred feet both east and west from the school yard, before school opens in September. Mrs. MacPherson also says several of the doors have sagged so that they do not open properly. I should think that a carpenter for a day or a day and a half could complete the very small jobs. It would require about 14 feet of eve-troughing a small amount of lumber and paint to make signs and letters on them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, July 16th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the request made by the teacher of the No. 1 School on the Halpole Island Reserve for repairs to the eaves-trough, the providing of signs and repairs to the doors.\n\nIn reply I have to say that you may arrange to have eaves-troughing placed along the west side of the porch at the entrance to the teachers' residence. You may also arrange to have the doors which have escaped repair and placed in good condition. The Department would also approve of your arranging to have the \"No Trespassing\" signs placed around the school yard, also a sign \"School - Drive Slowly\" placed on the road, for auto traffic. You may engage the services of a carpenter and supply him with the amount of lumber, paint, etc., required in carrying out the above work.\n\nAfter this work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material and labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It is customary for the Indians to save up money to be used to purchase suitable books, gifts, toys, etc., for the school children. Usually we have been helped through the year to spend a certain amount on the first store at Hanna, Saskatchewan. We are allowed a certain amount each year to purchase supplies for the school. However, this year, due to the present economic situation, it may not be possible for us to purchase the usual amount of supplies before the end of the year.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nI do not care to authorize this expenditure without the approval of the Department.\n\nMrs Ethel George teacher at No 2 school has not asked for grant for above purpose yet quite probably she will and it can probably be covered in one letter.\n\nThere is approximately 35 pupils at No 2 school and 40 pupils at No 1 school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 25th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School for a grant to purchase small gifts for the pupils for Christmas.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $25 in the purchase of suitable toys or other gifts. The teachers may arrange for the purchase of the articles they consider suitable to a total cost not exceeding the above authorized amount. They should obtain itemized accounts, in duplicate, which they should hand to you. You should attach the accounts to proper voucher forms, which you should certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment.\n\nRelative to a grant for the same purpose for the pupils of the No. 2 School, I have to say that the Department will approve of the teacher incurring an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $15. Itemized accounts should be obtained and certified by you in the same manner as in the case of the account for prizes for the No. 1 School mentioned above.\n\nPlease inform the teachers of both these schools of the amounts granted for the purpose of purchasing gifts for the pupils at their schools for the coming Christmas.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I imagine there is a surface seepage which has contaminated the water. I believe if the well were deepened and a cement top put on, good water might be obtained.\n\nMr. McPherson requests that the following may, in a war case for the well, be provided: North America, Ontario, Canada and the world. She also requests that one kettle, forty-five cups and forty-five spoons be supplied for hot lunch purposes to pupils who cannot go home at noon. If this request is considered, it will be necessary to furnish similar equipment for the No. 2 school.\n\nThe boys' closet at No. 1 school requires a new lid on the outside of box, also the closet door rehung and window fitted reed. Both No. 1 and 2 schools should have two coats of paint next summer.\n\nThos. McCockin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, January 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McCookin, in a report on his recent inspection of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School, states that the well has been condemned. This well is only 8 feet deep, and, no doubt, surface seepage has contaminated the water. The Inspector suggests that if the well were deepened and a cement top put on good water might be obtained. Please report regarding this well, stating the cost of having it deepened and a cement top put on, and whether you would recommend that the work be carried out.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the boys' closet requires a new lid on the outside of box and the closet door rehung and window light replaced. You should arrange to have this closet put in good condition and the repairs as suggested by the Inspector carried out.\n\nThe Inspector further states that the teacher requested that one kettle, 45 cups and 45 spoons be supplied for the purpose of preparing and serving hot lunches to the pupils. If you consider this equipment necessary, you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of same. The cups and spoons while serviceable should be as inexpensive as possible.\n\nThe Inspector states that both the No. 1 and No. 2 Schools should have two coats of paint next summer. I have to request that you will draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving full particulars regarding the painting required at each of these schools, the approximate cost of the paints, etc., and the labour, and how you would recommend that the work be carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\n\nA. W. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, January 14, 1930.\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to Mr. Inspector McGookin's report on the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. Regarding the well, it is noted that this well was thoroughly cleaned a short time ago and that you believe it is satisfactory at the present time. It is also noted that you will have another analysis made of the water if it is found to be unsatisfactory. You should make a report at a later date regarding the condition of the water obtained from this well.\n\nWith reference to the cups and spoons for the serving of the midday lunch, if you consider this equipment is necessary and will be properly used, you may supply the number of cups, spoons, pots, pans, etc., which you consider necessary. You may also purchase the utensils necessary for the serving of the lunch at the No. 2 School. It is not considered necessary to supply cloths to cover the desks when serving the lunch. You should forward separate vouchers, in duplicate, for the expenditure incurred in the purchase of any utensils for the serving of the lunch at the No. 1 and No. 2 Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst.

Mr. Highfield was told that if possible this voucher should be amended so as to show the quantity and price of material supplied.

MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nMrs. Harriette Macpherson,\nBox 56,\nPort Lamiton, Ont.\nThe agent came to me about the painting of the two schools and we measured them and after doing the worst jobs so that he could only give us from thirty to forty cents for painting these schools, we offered to do it for sixty cents an hour. For the forty cents he asked us to supply brushes and paint so I pointed out in view of the school district was for seventy-five cents an hour and his work cheaper than the other two main lines. The agent is figuring on getting some white friends to do the work, but I am not willing to allow any more of our work to be done by Indians. We have been treated very badly and I am sure they will be treated worse if they are employed out of work for several months.\nOttawa, October 4, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter relative to the painting of the two schools on the Walpole Island Reserve. In this connection I have to say that the carrying out of this painting was placed in the hands of Mr. A.

You should take up with Mr. Highfield the matter referred to in your letter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.Y. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Frank Day,\nR.R.

In reply I have to say the Department agrees with you that, in view of the present circumstances as regards unemployment on the reserve, 60\u00a2 per hour would be ample remuneration. You should use your best endeavours to obtain Indian labour, paying not in excess of 60\u00a2 per hour. However, if the Indians refuse to work for this rate, you may arrange with white men who would be competent to do the painting. The Department hopes that you will be able to satisfactorily arrange for the labour required and have the painting completed at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nMr. A. F.

Said garage was being used by the present teachers to house approximately 100 hens and chickens.\n\nShould this not be the information required, kindly forward explicit instructions to your Agent, Mr. Highfield, as to what is required. At his request we went down and measured the garage but it is rather a problem for women, at least not experienced in the lumber business. It must be rather unpleasant for the teachers to have to measure around their memories aside from the number of unnecessary trips to the Reserve, the nice sisters.\n\nThe Indians saw mill owner, Mr. James Knowles, from whom the lumber was purchased, does not keep books and cannot be expected to remember what he sold 4 years ago. There is a garage of the size stated containing the lumber listed left at the school.\n\nI trust this is all that is necessary and that you will receive the invoice at an early date.\n\nSincerely,\n\nHarriette MacKenzie\nAmount of material in garage at No. 1 Indian Day School, Walpole Island, erected by Mrs. H.

However, we measured the exact amount of lumber left in the garage, at least as well as women with no experience in the lumber business could measure it.\n\nKindly forward this to Ottawa with receipt etc., at your earliest convenience as this small matter has already been a much too long drawn out affair.\n\nYours truly,\nHarriette Macpherson\nOttawa, 13th October, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 9th instant, and previous correspondence regarding material used in building a garage at the Walpole Island No. 1 School, where Mrs. H. MacPherson is employed as a teacher, and who desires payment for lumber used in the construction of the garage, I beg to say that the regulations prohibit payment being made direct to a Departmental employee in the nature of purchase money. If Mrs. MacPherson procured the lumber in question from a lumber dealer and paid for the same she should be able to produce receipted accounts, which should be forwarded to the Department. This will admit of payment being made to her.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

It is noted that the pump at present in use is beyond repair and that a new pump is necessary. You may arrange for the purchase and installation of a new pump of a type considered by you to be satisfactory. You should have this new pump installed at an early date, and you should see that it is properly installed. Please keep all expense as low as possible. An account, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the cost of the pump, as well as any expense in having same installed.\n\nRelative to a grant to purchase supplies for a treat to the pupils of both the Nos. 1 and 2 Walpole Island Indian Day Schools, I have to say that our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and it has been found necessary to reduce the amounts formerly allowed for this purpose. The Department will approve of an expenditure being incurred not exceeding the sum of $20 in the purchase of supplies for a treat to the pupils at the No. 1 School and $10 for the pupils of the No. 2 School. An itemized account, in duplicate, should be obtained covering the cost of the supplies for each school separately. These you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and send to the Department for payment. It might be advisable for you to consult the teacher as to the supplies required before making the purchase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

I have asked Mr. Highfield's agent over a week ago to get us some more but it seems as if he does not want to do it so we too have to attend to this. There are five of us in his family and we are in need.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYours Truly,\n\nFrank Day\nOttawa, 9th December, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant, I may say that the Department is writing to Mr Indian Agent Highfield in your case. He has been told that if he finds that there is money due you for work done in connection with Indian School buildings on the Walpole Island Reserve, to forward a voucher in your favour with a view to payment. It is anticipated that the matter will receive prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F.

It would be quite in order to charge this to the Chippewa and Pottawattamie Band Fund as the tree was ordered cut by the Band and the amounts passed by a joint Council.

I would agree to put the shingles on over a naval reserve that could be done in a fairly short order.\n\nI am requested for writing this letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJames W. Gilbert\nWalpole Island Ont. Sept. 21 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose requisition from James W. Daley Senior teacher at No. 1 school. With attached letter.\n\nWith further reference to the garage I might say that this garage was built out of rough lumber by the former teacher Mrs. McPherson and is attached to the north end of a small building used for wood shed and store room. In 1929 there was two swing doors put on the east end and paid for by the Department.\n\nAt the present time the garage is no protection against storms. Mr. Daley offered to put the shingles on free of cost to the department and I ask him to put in writing.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, September 27, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, enclosing a communication from the senior teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School regarding the repairs required to the garage which was erected for the use of the former teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you incurring an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $11.00 in the purchase of shingles, this being the full amount we can authorize in having the garage repaired. The teacher should be responsible for the labour in putting on the shingles, and in making any other repairs required.\n\nPlease forward an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the shingles.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

You may, however, incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $15 in the purchase of supplies for the No. 1 School and $4 for the No. 2 School.

The two steps with platforms would probably cost $15.00.\n\nThe east step in its present condition is not very safe for the children, they get their feet or legs hurt.

But when Dr. McGill the Deputy Superintendent was on the Reserve, Mr. Daley senior teacher at No.1 school, drew Dr. McGill attention to the conditions of the interior of the class-rooms, and Mr. Daley states that Dr. McGill agreed that they needed re-decorating. Mr. Daley asked that I bring this to the attention of the Department. While the class rooms do need re-decorating I did mention in the former letter, realizing that funds were not plentiful at the present time. If Dr. McGill is in Ottawa he may remember the condition of the wall and ceiling in the class-rooms.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo File No.40-1-5 in reference to repairs at No.1 school. I would beg to say that I have went over these repairs again very carefully, and would say that everything that I ask for in my letter of May 18th is absolutely necessary, with the possible exception of repairs to swings, this is a minor item and should be done before some of the children are hurt.\n\nI might say that the bridge was in such a bad condition that Mr. Alley did think it safe for a car any longer and tore it out and filled the ditch with wood from the school yard. If there should be a heavy rain now there would be no outlet for the water. One of the outside doors is nailed up, as it is too badly damaged to swing, some of the cupboard doors in the school room are off the hinges and apart at the joints. Quite a number of the fence posts are rotted off and before another year the fence will be partly down. I ask for seven new post in the first letter. On going over the fence more carefully find there are 16 new posts needed. In my letter of May the 18th I estimated the cost from $60.00 to $75.00 It is rather doubtful if the needed work can be done for that amount. I estimated the cost of bridge material and labor at $33.25. I have since ask the Wallaceburg lumber company to figure on the cost of bridge. I am enclose there statement for material and labor which is $40.54. A galvanized steel pipe could be used here. A 15 inch pipe 16 ft long would cost for the cheaper grade, 16 gauge steel, at $1.42 a foot, $22.72, and better grade 14 gauge, at $1.62, $25.88. Then there would be the cartage from the Depot and labor putting in. There would not be much difference in the total cost, the steel pipe might be installed at little less cost.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in further reference to certain repairs required at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nThe Department feels that it is hardly necessary to incur the rather heavy expenditure mentioned in your letter for a bridge across the ditch. I would appreciate your again discussing this matter with Mr. Daley with a view to ascertaining if some plan could be evolved requiring a very much smaller expenditure.\n\nYou may purchase 16 new posts to repair the fence and have the wire re-stretched. The cost of this should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYou may, also, have the cupboard doors repaired.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it is not possible to authorize the painting and decorating of the interior of the classrooms.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\nWalpole Island Ont., August 16th 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of July 4th file NO.40-1-5 \"A bridge over ditch in front of NO.1 school.\", There are several ways that a bridge could be built for less cost than mentioned, but not a bridge the size that was there formerly. A plank bridge could be narrowed up to probably a width of 4 feet and the sides filled in with dirt. The old bridge was about 8 feet wide, a 4 ft bridge would probably answer the purpose or it could be entirely filled in with dirt at a low cost, but in that case there would be no outlet for the water from the east. There is not such a lot of water here, but in the spring or very wet time the water might flood the school grounds or adjoining lands if there is not some outlet.\n\nGalvanized steel pipes can be purchased from 10 inches up, or 10 in, 12in, 15in, and 18in sizes. I also have here in the yard a 6 in iron pipe that was bought several years ago with road money for use where a small culvert was needed. That might be used at the school. It makes a small outlet for the water and the rest could be filled in with dirt, and the cost would be low if at a later date it was found that it didn't work satisfactory it could be removed and a proper bridge installed. I have not a price list of galvanized steel culvert before me, but 15 in steel culvert cost $1.42 per foot a 12 in. Would probably cost about $1.20 or about $19.20 for a 16 ft culvert, plus labor of installing, cartage from R.R. and possible freight.\n\nThere should be something done to replace this bridge before school opens. I can put in this 6 in. iron pipe that is here and fill for probably $10.00 or less. When I estimate $33.00 it was for a finished job.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs School Files (R.G. 10), Volume 6176, File 442-5, part 4]\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, I beg to say that you may use at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School the 6 inch iron pipe which you have at present on hand and you may arrange for filling in the earth over the pipe. It is noted that the approximate cost of this work will be $10.00. If it is found later that this is not satisfactory, you can advise the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

You may also secure 15 storm windows at as reasonable a cost as possible.\n\nMinor repairs may be made to the fence around the school property.\n\nIt is noted that the cost of the culvert will possibly amount to $35.\n\nYou may also have the four swing-seats repaired.\n\nWith regard to the teacher's request to move the building he wishes for an ice house from the property on which it is located to the school lot, I beg to say that you may grant him permission to do so, on the understanding that no expense is caused the Department and that the building is placed at the lower end of the school property. It should also be understood that, if at any time the Department desires this building removed from the school property, Mr. Daley will do so at his own expense.\n\nIn connection with painting the interior of the school, the Department will advise you later regarding who is to be employed. I presume that the best time to do this painting would be during the Christmas holidays, as, otherwise, it would necessitate closing the school for some days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

All the wall and ceiling need painting very badly.\n\nMr. Phelan was here discussing the interior work that needed done. At one time he mentioned painting just the plaster part of the walls. (I am not certain either from Mr. Phelan remarks or the Department letter what is intended.)\n\nIf part of the walls are and some left that are left will show up in a worse condition than ever. The ceiling are metal but in terrible condition from smoke, as four or five years the stoves smoked very bad. The ceilings might have to be washed before they could be painted. And if they washed after the walls were painted it might splash up the walls somewhat. However even if the walls are painted it will brighten up the class room considerable.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, November 14, 1934.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, with reference to painting the interior of the two classrooms at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.

To replace this fence it would take 21 rod of fence, 20 post, staples and brace wire at an estimated cost of about $30.00 as follows:\n\n- Fence 10 wires 4 feet high ........................................... $13.86\n- 20 posts at 40\u00a2 .......................................................... 8.00\n- Staples and brace wire .................................................. 1.50\n- Labour ............................................................................. 6.00\n\nTotal .................................................................................. $29.46\n\nThe flag pole at the school is rotted beyond use. This present pole is a wooden one. I have secured prices on iron pipe for a flag pole which would probably cost a little more than wooden one but would be more durable. I secured prices from for pipe from both Port Lambton and Wallaceburg. I will list below the Wallaceburg prices for both black and galvanized pipe.

If possible, Indian labour should be utilized. It is noted that you estimate the cost of both material and labour to be approximately, $30.00.\n\nWith reference to the flag pole, the Department will approve of you arranging for the purchase and installation of a 25 foot galvanized iron pole. This should be installed in a cement base with necessary pulley and flag rope, the work, if possible, to be carried out by Indian labour.\n\nAfter the above authorized work in connection with the fence and flag pole has been completed, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the material.

The well is a dug well, perhaps nine feet deep with bricked sides. The top is cement except for the hole where the pump enters. This is big enough for a man to enter when the pump is out.\n\nNearly every year we have to pump the well dry as the water becomes so strong - cannot use the water, we find dead frogs and turtles pumped out at such times. I believe that if a point was driven down from time to time just below the lower line of the water in the well the water passing through the gravel would be raised. There may however be a better method but I do not know anything should be done as soon as possible.\n\nSincerely yours,\nJames H. Bailey\nPrin. No. 1 School\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th ultimo, file No. 40-1-5 in reference to the well at No. 1 School, I would like to deal with the wells at both No. 1 & No. 2 schools, as the well at No. 1 school is in better condition than the well at No. 2 school.\n\nI hardly know myself what to report on these wells. If I can secure proper containers I am going to have samples of the water from both the wells at No. 1 and No. 2 School sent to the Provincial Health Department for analysis. I am inclined to think that Mr. Deley's suggestion re-driving a steel point is a good one, but at the present time his well as a whole is in fair condition. I have had new leathers put on the pump this week, and the well pumped dry and cleaned out. With these surfaces weals it seems necessary to clean them once or twice a year to keep the water in good condition, and then it is not number one.\n\nIn reference to the well at No. 2 school it is a dug well brick lined, with a concrete top, with a manhole just big enough for a man to get in. When I had a look at it last fall, I found the bricks loose, and every indication of falling in, and it would appear that there is likelyhood of the well caving in. No one cares to go down to the bottom of the well to clean it for fear of a cave in. I have asked a mason to look at the well and give me an estimate cost of the job, but he has not done so at the present time. Some are of the opinion that it would be cheaper to dig a new well than to repair the present well, for to help the repair it would be necessary to break up the concrete top and take the bricks out and replace them, and to make this sort of work it might be necessary to remove a couple of feet of dirt from around the top of the well. This well is approximately 10 ft deep, and of course if this repair was made it would be necessary to build a new concrete top. One would naturally think that both these wells would prevent flies, snakes, and other insects from getting into them, as the manhole is covered with a wooden cover, and the wooden cover has a sheet iron cover sitting over it tight around the pump, despite this flies, snakes, mice, and other insects and animals seem to get into them.\nIn further reference to driving steel points I might say that many of the summer residents and some of the permanent residents just fasten a steel point, screened, on the end of a pipe and drive them into the ground about 12 to 15 ft until they reach the gravel or quicksand and in this way seem to get all the water required for a house; these wells are considered very sanitary, as no vermin can get into them and there is no body of water to become stagnant. Personally I have had no experience with these wells myself but this morning I was talking to Mr. Bachus, Custom Officer, who drove one at the old custom property 14 years ago and it has never needed any repairs, and is working satisfactory yet. I was also talking to a lady who has had one in her kitchen through the floor 9 years ago, and one outside about 16 years ago and both are working satisfactory, and have never needed any repair. The Anglican rectory has had two drove under the house one five years ago, and one nine, and both still work satisfactory. There is also one under the Parish Hall that is only 4 ft in the ground, and supplied a camp of thirty girls for two months this summer. These points I mentioned are all within 600 feet of the river, and I could not guarantee that they would work at the school, but there seems to be an unlimited supply of water in the dig wells at both schools and I am quite firmly of the opinion that if one struck gravel or quicksand that a point would supply all the water needed for school and residence.\n\nHaving no experience I would not care to estimate the cost of these wells with the driven points, but I understand that they cost less than a dug well. I believe that the steel point cost $3.50, and probably 10-15 ft of pipe, depending on the depth necessary to strike gravel, and quite probable the pipe in the present well would do for a driven well. I have been informed that there is an Indian on the reserve here who would drive these wells for $5.00 each, as he had done at the cottages, but as the school is further from the water edge, it may be necessary to drive them a little deeper.\n\nI might say that they are not using water from the well at No. 2 school, but are carrying it from a farm house near by. This well should be attended to at once, but I do not care to authorize the necessary expense until such time as I hear from the Department, and so an early reply would be appreciated. We might be able to drive a point a few feet from the bottom of the present well and fill in with sand or gravel from the river.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nEXD.\n\nOttawa, October 15, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, regarding the wells at the No. 1 and No. 2 Day Schools on Walpole Island.\n\nIf you consider that an ample supply of water could be obtained by driving steel points, installing the necessary pipe, pump, etc., the Department will approve of having the work carried out. It is noted that this arrangement for obtaining water has been satisfactory in other cases in the vicinity; but, as the schools are farther from the river than in the cases mentioned by you, it may be necessary to drive the points to a considerably greater depth. You should be in a better position to judge whether this arrangement would be more satisfactory than digging wells, and the Department will have to leave the matter in your hands but will expect you to see that all costs are kept to the lowest possible point. You might advise what action you are taking, and, if possible, give an estimate of the cost involved for each well.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA.

Nov. 19th 1937.\n\nSir,\n\nFor your information I might say that the roof at the residence at No. 1 School is leaking in places to quite an extent. After it was found to be leaking tar was put on the ground floor, Mr. Bulley and myself went up into the attic and found it leaking many places but not all of them were fixed. There was through to the living quarters, but were running down the walls etc., being absorbed by the plaster in some cases on the ceiling.\n\nThis part of the roof is very flat and the shingles have been laid too close to the weather and in general very poorly built; there are many leaky places where the building joins that you can see out any place where you can run your finger out the cracks. On both class rooms the roof has much more pitch and appears to be all right. In the flat part of the residence there are rafters 20 and 22 ft long with out any supports, the center of the roof has lower leaving flats places when a person walks on this it springs so much one would think they were going through. In any case repair I would suggest that there should be some support to put on this long span in the center. The entrance is flat and cover with galvanized material, this year entrance is flat and a heavy coating of roofing tar would stop this.\n\nThis roof might be patched, but it would be only a temporary job and not likely to prove satisfactory for any length of time. I had a carpenter look at this roof and submit the following estimate for a new shingle roof, repair to entrance and support to center span:\n\n| Item                          | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------|--------|\n| 13 square No. 1 shingle       | $70.20 |\n| 50 lb galvanized nails        | 7.00   |\n| 2 gal tar                     | 3.00   |\n| 8 pieces 2x6-20 supports for roof | 7.20   |\n| labour                        | 50.00  |\n\nTotal: $137.40\nOttawa, November 23, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of November 19, you may incur an expenditure not exceeding $137.40 in placing a new roof on the teacher's residence at the Walpole Island No. 1 school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

It seems that we have been busy since, that we got nothing done about it. So after talking it over with Mr. Higfield we decided to tell you our difficulties etc. and get your advice.\n\nThere is an enrolment of 75 pupils with an average attendance of 65. This average will probably be lower during the present winter months. So we would need 7 quarts of milk at 10\u00a2 to allow a half cup of milk per pupil. Our plan was to alternate cocoa and creamed vegetable soup. In that case besides the milk we would need sugar, cocoa, vegetables soup bones, barley, etc. I think 20 cents a day for these articles would be sufficient. This would make a total of $1.30 per day.\n\nIn regard to equipment we would need a large kettle about $2.50, 2 serving bowls worth 2 large dish pans 4\u00a2 each, 6 dark towels 2 cents each, 6 dog teaspoons and a ring mixing pan and 2 dozen cups. For cooking, we can use our old stove which we use only in summer. We also have an unused cupboard for equipment and a table. The children already own 6 dozen cups.\nWhat would be the system of buying these things, the foodstuffs in particular? Would each person from whom we bought make his own bill or would we use the voucher system?\n\nIf we had only cows such days it would consume a lot of time. So let us know what you think of these plans. I would be glad to try it for the next 2 months. I am sure it would be a great help to the children in many ways. It would be good training too, in preparing, serving and cleaning up afterwards.\n\nTrusting that we not, too neat a house for you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJames H. Daley\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, January 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sirs-\n\nWith reference to the recent letter received from the Principal of the Walpole Island No. 1 School, in connection with serving a mid-day meal, you may purchase:\n\n1 large kettle\n2 pair knives\n2 large dishpans\n6 dish towels\n72 teaspoons\n?4 cups\n1 mixing spoon.\n\nYou may authorize the teachers to spend an amount not exceeding $25.00 a month from the date of receipt of this letter to the end of March, in the purchase of the supplies that they consider would give the most nourishing mid-day meal.\n\nYours, truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.A.

Mines & Resources\nOTTAWA, Canada\nOttawa,\nNovember 5, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the serving of a midday lunch at the two schools on the Walpole Island Reserve.\n\nWhile the food served at noon at these schools should be nutritious it is not the Department's intention that a full meal should be supplied as the latter not only means increased expenditure but also extra work and would possibly interfere with the regular school activities.\n\nIt has, therefore, been decided to allow $15.00 a month for 4 months at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School and $3.00 a month for 4 months at the Walpole Island No. 2 school. Accounts should be forwarded at the end of each month and a separate account sent for each school.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo.

Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen Mr. Phelan and Mr. Mo Gookin were here on an official visit in company with former Agent Down, Mr. Phelan told Mr. Down to repair the well at No 1 school. This has not been done and I would like permission to do this now.\n\nI would also like permission to have the well at No 2 school repaired at the same time, but would suggest that a white man be given the contract.\n\nBoth these schools are in much need of paint, and some repair work. No 1 school needs entry room steps as the present ones have rotted away. Again I would suggest white labour.\n\nI understand the attitude of the Dept. in giving work wherever possible to Indians but there are many things that they are not capable of doing, and I believe these two jobs require ability.\n\nYo' r obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJames W. Daley\nActing Indian Agent\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nDEPT. MINES & RESOURCES\nOTTAWA\nOttawa, June 29, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, you may purchase, for use at the schools on the Walpole Island reserve, three brooms.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the toilets at both schools cleaned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPHILIP Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJames W. Daley, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nR. #3, Wallaceburg,\nOntario.\nOttawa, June 29, 1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, an amount of $250.00 was provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the two schools on the Walpole Island reserve. Please let me know what repairs you consider are required and give an estimate of the cost\u2014it being understood that the total expenditure will not exceed the amount stated above.\n\nDetailed information should be given regarding any material, in order that purchase may be made by our Purchasing Branch, and in the event of Indian labour not being available, you should state the tradesmen required, in order that you may be advised as to who should be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nJames W. Daley, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nR. #3, Wallaceburg,\nOntario.\nAttention Mr. Phelan\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of June 29 No 40-1-15 re repairs & improvements of Walpole schools, I beg to state that the following estimates for painting by the job for both schools are as follows. No 1 school Labour $120.00 No 2 school $95.00 Total $215.00 Material and labour $310.00 Besides this an entrance on the east side of No 1 school and needed repair to the wall would cost $25.00 to $30.00.\n\nThe walls of both schools should be washed. There are several small items need attention at No 2 school. Listed as follows:\nDoor locks (worn out) Window sash ropes replaced. Small gate n needed. Kitchen stove relined (approved in Mr. Down's time) Valve needed in pump. Blackboards painted. Bridge repaired. Window sash replaced (in residence).\n\nWhat I would recommend subject of course to the approval of the Dept. is the painting of No 1 school this year as I believe it to be in the worst condition and certainly is in the public eye more than No 2 school. Also that the minor repairs as listed and possibly others that may be found at the time be done as soon as possible. This might take from $200.00 to $225.00. Then if the other school could be painted the next year they should be in good condition.\n\nMaterials needed paint, lumber and other builders supplies. Tradesmen needed, painters and carpenters. Some of the work could be done by Indians.\n\nIn view of the present world conditions prices may have to be estimated higher.\n\nHoping to be of further service in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJames W. Daley\n\nTHE SECRETARY\nDEPT. MINE & RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\nOTTAWA\nOttawa,\nSeptember 13, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant you may arrange for the immediate painting of the Walpole Island No. 1 school provided Indian labour only is employed. If it is necessary to employ a white painter you will have to communicate with me again before doing any work. In the event of your proceeding with the painting the material should be purchased from a firm on the approved list.\n\nYou may also arrange for the minor repairs required at the No. 2 school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

McGill,\n\nI beg to submit the following report covering my visit of inspection to the Walpole Island Agency on May 7th and 8th:\n\nSchool:\n\nNo. 1 was visited and Miss Field and Miss Isaac interviewed. School was clean. Out-houses should be supplied with lime. Agent's attention was drawn to the matter. A new door should be built to replace present front door and about one hundred square feet plaster renewed as well as some minor repairs made to outhouses. Estimated cost \u00a335.00. Miss Field the senior teacher is highly regarded throughout the Reserve and appears most satisfactory. Miss Isaac, an Indian girl is also highly regarded and is doing wood work. Attendance has been fairly good.\n\nThe school residence a 1\u00bd storey building is in a good state of repair with a single exception. An upstairs bedroom leaks rather badly. The leak said to have existed for twelve years, comes from the flashing at chimney or the chimney itself. Mr. Daly states he has tried to fix the leak and cannot and that the chimney will have to be rebuilt. The chimney is on a bracket. I would recommend that this repair be given attention during the summer and that an expert be asked to quote. After repair has been effected the bedroom should be redecorated.\n\nN.S. Arneil,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nOttawa,\nMay 21, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his recent inspection of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School Inspector Arnell states that a new front door is required, also that about 100 square feet of plaster should be renewed as well as minor repairs made to the out houses. The Inspector estimates the total expenditure at $35.00 and you may arrange for these improvements.\n\nMr. Arnell also refers to a leak in the roof of the teachers' residence. You should arrange to have someone investigate this thoroughly and you should then report what is required to fix it and at the same time submit an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Jas. W. Daley,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSept. 4, 1941\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. Ross, the new Principal of No. 1 Indian Day School, was here and has asked for the following repairs to be made at No. 1 School and in the residence at No. 1 School.\n\nShe has asked that the residence be papered throughout and the floor painted in the middle bedroom, a small change made in the kitchen sink, chimneys cleaned, the school rooms entirely cleaned and the walls and woodwork painted, the store rooms and the attics entirely cleaned and the rubbish burned. She would like to purchase for the use in the residence two Aladdin lamps, two new stoves, one for the school and living room, one charcoal iron, china cabinet with drawers for silver. She has particularly asked that the cleaning be done immediately and the papering and painting in the living quarters also be done before school starts. She has also asked that a cement cistern be built in the north east corner of the building outside for soft water. She is also asking that a children's sink be installed in the entry room to the school rooms.\n\nIn order to avoid any misunderstanding between her and Miss Faireervice, the other teacher, she would like to have charge of the living quarters and have Miss Faireervice be a boarder. I should recommend this latter request as Mrs. Ross has many friends in the district who will in all probability be visiting her and it would hardly be fair to Miss Faireervice to ask her to pay half of the expenses when the probabilities are that she will have very few friends in this district as she comes from. In regard to the other requests I certainly would like to see her get these things but would draw your attention to the fact that it would cost at least $350 to $400 and frankly this has not been put into the estimate. There is no question about necessity of most of the articles asked for. Some of the things must be done but I am leaving this entirely in your own hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames W. Daley\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nSeptember 9, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 4th instant I regret that all the repairs and improvements requested by Mrs. Ross, the new teacher at the Walpole Island Indian Day School, cannot be done this year.\n\nAn amount of $100.00 may be expended for repairs and improvements but this is the total amount that can be allowed at the present time.\n\nIn addition to the above amount for repairs and improvements you may purchase two Aladdin lamps.\n\nIn connection with the last paragraph of your letter I may say that Miss Fairservice has decided not to accept the position at Walpole Island and the Department is now endeavouring to secure another teacher. I think it would be preferable to await the arrival of the new teacher at the school before making the arrangements suggested in the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Jas. W.

The Council agreed that the benefit to the children would far exceed the amount of money expended and quite willingly granted the request.\n\nI would recommend approval of this and would also respectfully suggest that a grant of $15 should be given No. 2 School for a like purpose. If this could be arranged immediately I am positive that the Council would be only too pleased to pass this resolution at the December Council.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames W. Daley\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nNovember 15, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with reference to the serving of a midday lunch at the Walpole Island No. 1 and Walpole Island No. 2 Schools.\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph of your letter, I would point out that you have not yet received any authority for expenditure for midday lunch purposes. It is true that you were given authority in the year 1939 but that only covered the academic year 1939-40. Instructions have repeatedly been issued to all Indian Agents that new authority must be obtained in every fiscal year.\n\nIf you consider the serving of a midday lunch necessary at these two schools, the Department has no objection to allowing the same monthly amount as previously; namely, $15.00 a month for a period of four months at the No. 1 School and $8.00 a month for a period of four months at the No. 2 School.\n\nWe are not prepared to approve the resolution of the Council with reference to expending an additional $10.00 a month from band funds. The Department does not see any necessity for this extra expenditure.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Jas. W. Daley,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\n\nR.A.

Daley\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, it is difficult for the Department to understand how you consider official letter of September 9, 1941, gave you authority to purchase a $45.00 breakfast set.\n\nMy letter of September 9, 1941, was in reply to yours of September 4 in which you specifically mentioned papering and painting and the necessity for some equipment, which did not include a set of dishes.\n\nWith reference to the second paragraph of your letter, recording your interview with Mr. Phelan, it is evident that he only told you what you already knew from official letter of September 9. I have consulted Mr. Phelan and he has no recollection whatever of having authorized a set of dishes at the price you paid for them. We try to supply a reasonable amount of dishes for a teacher's residence but certainly the purchase you have made cannot be justified, especially in view of conditions at the present time. Under these circumstances I believe that the set of dishes should be returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Jno. W. Daley,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nWalpole Island, April 29, 1942\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere seems to be a mistake regarding the Voucher that I forwarded to you regarding a breakfast set. This breakfast set is not dishes but consisted of a kitchen cabinet, a table and several chairs. I cannot accept the blame for the way that this was entered by the furniture store. Possibly, however, I should have mentioned just what it consisted of.\n\nThere was no table in the teacher's residence either in the living room or the kitchen. During the time we taught there we had our own tables and chairs. When Miss Field came as teacher she was granted a certain amount of money to purchase certain needed articles for the residence. She purchased articles for the living room with the money granted. We had a table in the Council Hall here which she made do for the time that she was here. This table did not suit Mrs. Ross who preferred to buy the set as sent in. Again may I express my regrets regarding this misinterpretation.\n\nI would appreciate a further letter from your Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJames W. Daley\nIndian Agent\nOttawa,\nMay 2, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo, with further reference to the account which you forwarded for a breakfast set for the Walpole Island No. 1 School. I note from your letter that this set does not consist of dishes, but a kitchen cabinet, table and several chairs.\n\nUnder these circumstances you should obtain a new account from J.T. Saint & Son and this should show exactly what was supplied. I am returning your voucher No. 11 for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. Jas. W.

I then had Chris. Whale make a bid on the work and the best he would do it for was the sum of $515.00.

Mr. Chesney did the work while the paint was\npurchased from Newkirk's in Wallaceburg. We had a great\ndeal of trouble in getting plaster repairs done. And as\na result, part of the painting could only be done, as only\npart of the plastering had been done. It would appear\nthat Chesney is operating on very little capital, and he\nasked if I would send in the first part of his account in\norder to pay his hired help. I felt that this would be in\norder as the cost was being held down to the estimate\nforwarded you in my telegram. I am further enclosing\nvoucher #83 to the amount of $47.50, covering labor\nin full for the painting of #1 and 2 schools. I am also en-\nclosing voucher #84, to the amount of $97.45 covering\npaint and paint materials for these two schools.\n\nYou will note that the total of these three vouchers\namounts to $257.45. After the painting was done, there was\na great deal of cleaning up to do, due to paint being\nsplashed and the plaster repairs.

About the attendance; I have talked to several of the parents trying to point out the necessity of the children getting an education in order to get along better in life. I have chased after truants trying to bring them to school and the answer usually got from the parents is that they do not like Mrs. Ross. I have had two fathers tell me that I could put them in jail if I wanted too but they would not send their children to school so that the teacher could hit them over the head. I don't for one minute believe that Mrs. Ross has struck them hard at all the probabilities are that the blows were pats but try to convince the parents.\n\nJames W.

Mrs. Daley informs me that the room is never without this smoke as the stove smokes whenever there is a fire in it. Mrs. Daley, the former teacher also complained of this smoke, and thinking back to the time when I taught there the smoke nuisance was considerable then also. For some reason the chimneys built in the centre of both No. 1 & No. 2 schools were never successful. You will recall that a new chimney was built at No. 2 school last year and the smoke nuisance ended. About 13 or 19 years ago a new chimney was built for the junior room at No. 1 and this was successful. I am now asking that we be permitted to have a new chimney built at the north end of the senior room at an estimated cost of $150.00.\n\nWe would also like to purchase liquid soap and paper towels for both schools.\n\nIndian labour I believe is available for the stove work.\n\nJames W.

Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: Pumping School Well\n\nOn Sept. 22nd we received a bacteriological report from the Department of Health of Ontario on water samples from our school wells.\n\nNo. 1 School - classification of water B\nNo. 2 School - \" \" \" B\n\nThe well at No. 1 School is a dug well, brick lined about 12 feet deep, the cover is quite tight fitting. It would appear that the pollution is from seepage. The toilets are about 125 feet away from the well.\n\nSince the well is full of water I arranged with the chief, fire dept. Wallaceburg to bring a small pump belonging to the Water Works Dept. to the island to pump the well dry.\n\nThis was done on Sept. 29th. This pump could not keep up with the rate of seepage long enough to be able to clean the well. To-day the Chief returned with a fire department truck and pumped the well out thoroughly. This pump removed what little extraneous material there was in the well, and we placed in it some water purifier supplied by the water dept. Within half an hour the well was full of water again.\n\nThe cost of this operation is high due to the two trips that were made. However it appeared to be the only immediate solution to the problem. I do not know what the source of pollution is unless it is caused from the high water table this year. The well has not been cleaned for several years.\n\nEnclosed please find Mr. Hearn's bill for your consideration.\n\nAlbert J.

The repairs to the toilets and steps were made before school opened in September. The fence, however, was delayed unduly for reason of the fact that estimates of materials by the carpenter were incomplete and several trips had to be made for additional materials. Delivery of materials was slow and also obtaining the bill from the Lumber Company was protracted.\n\nAt the time this work was commenced I was not well acquainted on the Island and since the repair work was urgently needed before school started, I obtained the labour that was most readily available. Sampson Sands, who is caretaker of the school, offered to do the work at 50 cents an hour and to obtain his own help. The whole work was done more or less in spare time. Consequently he has fewer hours on his account than his helper. Although the work was not completed at the time of Col. Neary's visit to the Agency, the extent of the work and the difficulties involved were explained to him.\n\nThe work has been completed for some time now and the Indian workmen are anxious for their payment.\n\nTrusting this meets with your approval.\n\nRobert J.

Items for the school are paid from one appropriation and items for the agency residence from a separate appropriation. From the information given on the account it is impossible for us to decide what articles were used in each place. In any case, expenditures should not be grouped in one voucher.\n\nAccounts covering the cost of supplies and materials provided for schools should be forwarded under cover of one voucher so that it can be charged to the appropriation for Indian education.\n\nOther expenditures should be covered by a separate voucher, depending on the appropriation to which it should be charged.\n\nWe are, therefore, returning your voucher so that you can have two vouchers issued covering the proper charges to each appropriation.

Attendance has been quite good. Due to the fact that some Indian children who wished to commence school after Easter were turned away, there has been some talk of requesting white children in attendance to leave. However, I have learned that the only children refused admission are those below six years of age. If the over-crowded condition continues in September, I shall set the example by having my child attend a Wallaceburg Public School.\n\nDuring the past winter the heating arrangement for the classrooms and the teacher's residence have not been too satisfactory. The classrooms have very old box stoves. It may be necessary to replace these before too long. Perhaps the most satisfactory arrangement would be a central heating system to cover the classrooms and the residence, and a coal oil range for cooking. It is quite a task for the teacher to operate coal and wood range and heater.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to Lavitz Hardware Co., M.\n\nAddress Wulloso A.R.E., Ont.\n\nDATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT\n---|---|---\nTo supplies for No. 1 School per enclosed statement. | | 640\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The Bishop has been very ill and much of the business of the diocese has been held in abeyance.\n\nMr. Bradbury, the local rector, is prepared to have us go ahead on that basis, however, there are some minor repairs to the hall - 1) replacing some glass in the windows, 2) purchasing tacks, 3) stove legs which I estimate will cost about $50.00 (labour and materials). The estimated cost of a coal bin is approximately $40.00 (labour & materials). The church board is looking to the Department to make the above repairs.\n\nThe caretakers of No. 1 School, Mr. & Mrs. Sam Sands are willing to take the position of looking after the parish hall. One of their sons would probably do it. They live very close to the school and hall. May authority be given to hire a caretaker on the same basis as for the other classrooms.\n\n[Signature]\nRobert J. Stallwood\nIndian Agent\n\n[Stamp]\nSeptember 1, 1948.\n\nMr. R.J. Stallwood, Supt.

On the advice of the Rev. Mr. Bradbury, I have proceeded to install the newly arrived stove and to repair the glass in the windows etc. The Masonite blackboard has been painted and is in readiness.\n\nIf no word is received regarding a third teacher for this school, I shall have to apply once more after September 7. I have forwarded a second application from him, since the one he sent you has apparently gone astray. Mr. Bradbury is willing to teach this year if a more qualified teacher cannot be obtained.\n\nMiss McKean, the principal, has arrived back on the Island and is prepared to supervise the three rooms.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.J.

Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nToday we had a visit from Miss J. G. Adair,\nformerly teacher at the Kama Indian Day School. Miss Adair was\nforced to resign in April, 1946, due to the illness and subsequent\ndeath of her mother.\n\nShe is now prepared to accept another school\noperated by the Department.\n\nI immediately thought of the vacancy at Walpole\nIsland and gave her details concerning this school. If Miss\nAdair accepts the position as offered to her, we could use\nMiss Adair in the third room to replace the Reverend Mr.\nBradbury. These moves, of course, are contingent upon the\ntwo points I raised in my letter of yesterday,\n\n(1) that there is sufficient accommodation in the\nteacher's residence for three female teachers,\n\n(2) that the Reverend Mr. Bradbury is prepared to resign,\neffective September 30, 1948.\n\nMiss Adair is prepared to accept the position\nat Walpole Island on October 1, 1948, in either the primary\nor the intermediate rooms. She has an elementary degree.\nCertificate and 15 years of experience in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nWould you please advise me as soon as possible concerning the two problems raised above and also let me know what additional furniture will be required at the teacherage. For your guidance I attach our standard list of furnishings for a one-room school.

L), Volume 6176, File 442-5, part 61\nNovember 17, 1948.\n\nDear Mr. Barrett:\n\nI was sorry that I could not get to our Teachers' Convention in Southern Ontario this year but I was in Western Canada inspecting schools at that time.\n\nAs you are probably aware, we intend to build an additional classroom or classrooms at Balpole Island next year. Mr. Stallwood has sent me the sketch of the one-room classroom which the Ernest Lumber Company, of Dresden, Ontario, has built in two school sections of Chatham Township in 1938. It would seem that this would be a fairly satisfactory rural school if two windows were placed above the blackboard (to avoid cross light) on the side of the room opposite that with the windows in it.\n\nI note that you have apparently discussed this matter with Mr. Stallwood and are in agreement with this change.\n\nAs we are very interested in the construction of one-room schools, I would appreciate any other comments which you would wish to make upon this plan.\n\nWith kindest personal regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard V.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Neary:\n\nI am very happy to learn from yours of November 17th, that an extra classroom is to be provided on Walpole Island.\n\nI believe that the room which was designed and built for us by the Bresett Lumber Company of Dresden is as effective and economical as one can get at the present time.\n\nI have not noticed any evidence of cross light in this school but it might be well, if the cost is not too great, to have two Clear-storey windows above the boards on the dark side.\n\nThe thing most noticeably wrong with our Chatham Township Schools is the artificial lighting. We have only 4 drops and the last 2 are too close to the back of the room. There should be 6 drops properly spaced over the seating area with 50 watt bulbs along the inside of the room and 300 watt bulbs next to the windows.\n\nYou may be certain that I shall be very pleased to do anything which will help your Department in this endeavour.\n\nWith very best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nF.

The possibility of acquiring this land will be explored.\n\nIt will be noted in Inspector Barrett's report that considerable repair work is required on the two existing schools. It is suggested that the contractor for the above school take over some of the repair work as well, to be done at the same time that a similar type of work is being done on the new school.\n\nI believe there are contractors in both Wallaceburg and Dresden who will be interested in the above work, so that these two local newspapers have been quoted for tenders. The firms whom I know are interested are the Bresette Lumber Co., Dresden, and the Lac Construction Co., Wallaceburg, possibly also the Thompson Supply Co., Wallaceburg.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRobert J. Stillwood,\nSuperintendent of Indian agency.\nMay 9, 1949.\n\nMr. P. J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nWalpole Island Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 11-40 of May 2\n\nWe are quite prepared to erect the new school as outlined in your letter of May 2.\n\nConcerning the extra land required at the site, I would suggest that you write to Mr. L. Brown, Resources and Trustee Division, describing to him the additional land which you feel is required.\n\nIn discussing this school with Mr. Doucet, he has suggested that we build, not plan 638, but plan 657, which provides for a full basement. I am therefore sending to you, under separate cover, a set of the drawings for plan 657. The specifications are the same as for 638. You will note that it provides a full basement, which could be used as a lunch-room for the children of all three classrooms at Walpole Island No. 1. The only change necessary would be the installation of a door leading down into the basement so that the children would not have to go through the stair-rooms to reach this basement.\n\nI would like to have, by return mail, your comments as to the advisability of building plan 657 instead of 638. While the former is a more expensive type of building, it might suit your needs better at Walpole Island. The basement, of course, is also available as a second classroom, if and when it is needed. The only concern which I have is whether the land will permit the building of a basement which will be dry at all times of the year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBernard F.

MURCHIS\nHalpole Island, Ont.\nMay 13, 1949.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\n\nRe: Halpole Island Indian Day School.\n\nReference your letter received May 12, 1949.\n\nI certainly agree with the suggestion of Mr. Boucet that an additional room be provided that could be used as a lunchroom for the children of all three classrooms at Halpole Island No. 1. In addition, a room would be available as an additional class when necessary.\n\nIn most localities this could be ideally located in the basement but I do not wish to recommend this on Halpole Island. The Rectory, parsonage, and its residence each have basements as furnaces, but they are subject to flooding; in the last year, the United Church Board put in a basement to their church but found it too unsatisfactory and have filled it in. The basements mentioned are only approximately four feet below ground level.\n\nIt would appear, therefore, that any addition as an education planned would have to be in the form of another room attached to this building.\n\nRobert J.

An investigation had revealed that several children from this reserve were attending this residential school in Sault Ste. Marie and thus preventing other children from Northern Ontario reserves where no day schools were available, from attending this boarding school.\n\nUnfortunately, we were not able to include an amount for the construction of this school in our 1947-50 estimates, but it is our intention to request a transfer of the amount required from the Lake Melan School in the Port Arthur Agency. It does not now seem likely that we will be able to build this latter school as the land on which it will be located is still provincial property and an Indian school can not be located on it. When field officials have settled the matter of this land ownership, we may be able to build the Lake Melan School at a later date.\n\nTherefore, we would request your approval of the attached requisition to the Departmental Purchasing Agent for advertising for tenders for the construction of the standard one-room school at Malpole Island. This building will be directly adjacent to the old building which is a two-room structure.\n\nOur Engineers have advised against adding to\nthese old schools and recommend that we should erect instead separate buildings in the same playground. It would be appreciated if this requisition could be passed to the Departmental Purchasing Agent when it has received your necessary approval.\n\nDirector,\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.M./M.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPay to: Day's Trading Post - Joe Day\nAddress: Malpole Island, Ont.\n\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n|      | 1 Bchou | 4.00   |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

We understand from the specifications that we are to tender on a form provided for that purpose. We did not receive this form and our efforts to obtain one from the Superintendent's office at Walpole Island have not been successful.\n\nWe believe we have not been placed in a very favourable position in regard to our tender for this work. We do not know what security deposit you require etc. Should it be possible that the contract for this work was arranged previous to us receiving plans, we hope this might receive your attention.\n\nOur estimated cost of this building according to plans and specifications would be seventeen thousand two hundred and twenty three dollars ($17,223). This being a public job, we believe we do have the right to tender as we are well qualified to undertake this class of work.\nWe are at present constructing three schools in the vicinity of Sarnia, have just completed one a short time ago for the city of Chatham and have on hand at the present time several large commercial projects, one being the Memorial Arena for the city of Chatham, also a building for the Royal Bank of Canada in Sarnia and while we know our tender is possibly irregular, that is through no fault of ours.\n\nHoping our application for work may be favourably received, we are,\n\nYours truly,\n\nCURRAN & HERRIDGE CONSTRUCTION CO.

There should be a small gate installed in front of the new building.\n\nIt is suggested that the fence along the road be kept uniform and perhaps be of a lawn type. However a 42\" fence may not be satisfactory from the standpoint of the horses running loose on the Island. If a gate is installed in front of the new school, a foot bridge over the road ditch will be necessary.\n\nPlease advise regarding the purchase of the above fencing and gate.\n\n[Signature]\nRobert J.

Indian Affairs Branch,\nEducation Division,\nFile 442-5 (E)\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Dr. O. Leroux, Assistant Director, Indian Health Services which refers to a requisition from Nurse Powell, Sarnia, for 200 tooth brushes, 150 white enamel cups and 10 lbs. of soda bicarbonate. It is stated that the Education Branch of Indian Affairs would supply tooth brushes and cups.\n\nIn connection with the cups, I may say that there is a supply of enamel cups in our schools, although they are quite old. The teachers here have asked me to try to obtain paper cups and containers. The price locally as was quoted in my letter of September 14th, 1949 is:\n\nContainer - each $2.25\nPaper cups (cone) - 1000 @ $5.15\n5000 @ 4.75 per M.\n\nIf it is decided to purchase these, it would be advisable to obtain a container for each classroom (including No. 2 School) which would make 4.\n\nI have also been asked by the teachers to obtain mattress covers for the two beds in the old residence. May authority be given please to purchase this locally.\n\nRobert J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Walpole Agency.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nRe: No. 1 Indian Day School,\n\nIn connection with the new teacher's quarters, no provision has been made as yet for a heater for the living-dining room. It has been suggested by the teacher that an oil burning space heater be obtained (Watson's page 580). However if that is too expensive I consider the large size Quebec Heater (Watson's - $956-6446 and $956-8551 - $21.00) to be quite satisfactory.\n\nRegarding blinds for the new school and residence the requirements are:\n\nResidence - 5 windows\nClassroom - 11 windows.\n\nThe Junior Room teacher has requested paste brushes and kindergarten scissors (metal). These are not in stock yet locally but have been ordered. Our new teachers have stated that it has been their practice to purchase and pay for some of their minor classroom requirements locally and submit their account to the Department for personal reimbursement. However during the past month they have made purchases at Zovitz Hardware and Colwell's Book Store and the supplier's accounts will be submitted at the end of the month. Is there a limit set as to the amount that may be expended in more or less emergency supplies, at one time or by the month?\n\nMay authority be given please to have the pianos in No. 1 and No. 2 Schools tuned please.\n\nPlease advise what grants are available to each classroom this year for manual training and household science.\n\nFinally, the Indian locates, Mrs. Martha Sands, from whom the additional land was purchased to enlarge the school grounds has been pressing this office for payment. May this matter be reviewed please.\n\nR.J. Stallwood\n\n[Signature]\nOctober 1st, 1949.\n\nMr. R.J. Stallwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nWalpole Island, Ontario.\n\nDr. Leroux telephoned me about a week or ten days ago about the matter mentioned in your letter of September 26th. He was promised that we would send the tooth brushes to Superintendent McCracken, who would hand them over to Nurse Powell. We only had 180 tooth brushes left in stock and these have gone forward to Mr. McCracken.\n\nWe did not promise to supply 150 white enamel cups and do not intend to supply them. It is presumed that the soda bicarbonate has been supplied by the Indian Health Services.\n\nIt has been decided not to supply paper cups and towels in future.\n\nYou may obtain the mattress covers for the two beds in the teacher's residence.\n\nBernard F.

Insofar as the residence is concerned the contractor is finished, with the exception of sanding and varnishing the floors. The hardwood flooring is good material but it was not well enough finished at the mill to be able to sand by hand. Consequently they require sanding with electrical equipment. Since it is not possible to obtain electrical power for that purpose on the Island, the contractor is willing to shellac the floors now and to do the sanding and finishing next year if and when the hydro service is extended to the Island. An amount to cover this work will be deducted from the contract price and the final payment requested when the work is completed.\n\nRegarding the classroom, the contractor has been notified that the blackboards will be shipped to arrive November 7th. With the exception of the floors as mentioned above all the work will be completed by that time and the classroom will be ready for use.\n\nMay authority be given please to purchase locally 8 standard size blinds and 3 small blinds for classrooms and 5 standard blinds for residence @ $1.50 per blind. Total cost $24.00.\n\nReference our letter of September 28, 1949. May we be advised please regarding the type of heater that will be purchased for the teachers residence.\n\nFinally, Miss McKenna wishes a kitchen table. A quotation by Douglas-Haycock for a table, 28\" x 42\" top, is $9.50. May authority be given please to purchase this locally.\n\nR.J.

Thomas, of Valpole Island, has written the Department on behalf of Miss Cameron, lately appointed teacher of No. 1 school, asking that she be allowed to use the Parsonage, which Rev. Mr. Brigham vacated about a year ago, as a dwelling. It would appear that Isaac Sampson and David Johnson are at present living in this building.\n\nThe Department would be glad to have a full report from you on this application at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. MOLL\nDeputy\n\nJ. B. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nValpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of Aug 26th 1908\n\nNo. 15274/1\n\nI am reply to your letter of above date the parsonage on the reserve was vacated about a year ago by the Rev. S.A. Brigham he is living with his father in the town of the place when Mr. Brigham vacated the house he let his cousin Isaac Sampson use the house the late teacher of the school used one of the rooms part of the time the building is not in fit repair for anyone to live in at present but if it was repaired it could be rented to renter at $30 per month.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary Department\nIndian Affairs\nOttawa\nTHE WALLACEBURG SUGAR COMPANY, LIMITED\n\nWALLACEBURG, ON Sept. 14, 09\n\nHonorable Frank Pedley,\nDeputy Minister of Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nMr. A. Cameron has arranged for a piece of land from P. W. Thomas, on which to build a home for his sister who is to teach school on Walpole Island. It appears the consent of the department is necessary before Mr. Cameron can enter on the land and utilise it for the purpose mentioned. Will your department consent to his doing so? If so, I would thank you to advise by first mail. I need only add that I think it in the interest of the Indians generally to have this arrangement made, as it is difficult to get a teacher of any standing to live on the Island without comfortable quarters being provided.\n\nAwaiting your early reply, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nDiet. D. A. G.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, September 16, 1908.\n\nThe Deputy Supt. General,\n\nMr. D. A. Gordon, M.P., of Wallaceburg, asks the Department's consent to the erection of a house on Walpole Island for Miss Cameron, who has been appointed teacher of No. 1 school. You will see that Miss Cameron's brother would bear the expense and an Indian locatee is willing to give the site.\n\nThis would appear to be a very satisfactory arrangement and, if it were not for information on file regarding Miss Cameron, I would recommend its being carried out.\n\nMiss Cameron was appointed through the good offices of Mr. Gordon and it was only after her appointment that the Department became aware of the fact that it was placing the school in charge of an old and infirm woman. Mr. Agent McDougall says that her health and age are against her. She is fully sixty years old, if not older, and, although, as far as her education is concerned she is capable of teaching, she is not a qualified teacher, and former teachers were dissatisfied for this cause. I have reasons to know that the Indians are dissatisfied with the appointment and as her retaining the position as dependent upon her giving satisfaction, I think it would be unwise to give her any hold on the\nschool such as the proposed arrangement would confer.\n\nIf you agree with me, Mr. Gordon could be told that a surrender would have to be obtained from the band before a lease could issue.

You should now have a constable investigate this matter, and, if possible, have the person who committed the theft prosecuted.\n\nWe regret the loss sustained by Mrs. Macpherson, and you should do everything in your power to have her personal articles returned, besides the articles stolen. In the teacher's case, it is noted that a laundry stove, the property of the teacher of the No. 2 school, and a wheelbarrow belonging to the No. 1 school, were also stolen. It should not be difficult to ascertain where these are now, and if they are traced, it would then be possible to find the party who took the personal effects of the teacher.\n\nI would be pleased to hear at an early date the result of any action taken by you in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I also told the Provincial Police immediately after Mrs. MacPherson's return, that she could give them a list of the articles stolen, and a possible clue where they might be found.\n\nI did not write Mrs. MacPherson telling her that her house had been broken into, thinking that it would spoil her summer holidays. The wheelbarrow has been returned and we believe we know where the stove is.

In this connection, the teacher is very anxious to have these articles returned, as they are essential property and the loss to her is considerable.\n\nIt is noted that the wheelbarrow has been returned; but that it is very probable that the stove will be located.\n\nThe teacher requests that curtains for 5 windows be supplied, also a small rug for the bathroom and linoleum for the kitchen.

The Department regrets the loss sustained by you, but cannot recoup you. We cannot see that the Department is in any way responsible for your loss, which, as stated, is regretted.

In this letter you were asked to draw the matter to the attention of the provincial police and have them make an investigation with a view to recovering the articles and punishing the culprit.\n\nA communication has been received from Mr. Macpherson, the teacher, in which he states that the detectives report that the articles belonging to Mrs. Moore were taken by the janitor's son-in-law who used the janitor's keys, and that they recovered some of the articles in connection with another robbery, but, as they were not claimed, they were returned to the home of the Indian from whom they were taken, and, on hearing the description of the articles taken from the teacher's residence, they recognized them as belonging to her, but when they tried to locate them again they had evidently been sold or given away.\n\nIt appears strange that stolen articles should be returned because, at the time they were found, no one claimed them, and you will be good enough to report at once as to whether any arrests were made by the detectives, and, if so, the result of the action taken in the matter. The Department will expect an early reply from you giving us full particulars as possible regarding this matter.\n\nI might add that Mrs. Macpherson has asked the Department to compensate her for her loss, but we cannot undertake any responsibility in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The Department considers that you have been remiss in your duties in that a reply has not been directed. Mrs. H. Macpherson, formerly Senior Teacher at the Halpola Island No. 1 Indian Bay School, has called at the department, and she reports it is common knowledge that an Indian, named Samson Sands, not only broke in and stole certain articles, but lived in the teachers' residence for some days. Our informant states that this man was arrested by you, in June, last, and charged with stealing a stove, only. It is claimed that restitution of this article had been made, and no further charge preferred.\n\nI should be pleased if you would make a full report in this connection and state whether Samson Sands acknowledges his guilt. If he does, it might be advisable to get a signed order, permitting you to retain his interest money from year to year, until such time as $50.00 may be withheld. This is the value of the articles, stolen from Mrs. Macpherson. If the interest money of Samson Sands and his family is inconsiderable, you should state whether it is possible to have him make restitution in some other manner.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\n[Signature]\n\nThomas Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSarnia, Ont.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nLater wrote Mrs. Macpherson\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter, of the 11th inst., and previous correspondence, concerning the case of Sampson Sands, of Walpole Island, and with reference to him breaking into the Teacher's Residence, No. 1 School, Walpole Island, from which he stole certain articles. Beg to advise, that shortly after Sampson Sands stole those articles, he left Walpole Island, living in different parts of Michigan, for a considerable time. Late last winter, he began to visit the Island on week ends. I made the Provincial Police acquainted with this fact, and late in May, Provincial Police Atkins and Scott, went down to Walpole Island, and brought him to Sarnia, for trial. There was a warrant issued, at the time the articles were stolen for Sands' arrest, which could not be found, after he was arrested, so that his trial was practically a farce. This warrant has since been found, and Sands may be re-arrested.\n\nI am justified in saying, that I have done everything possible, to have those goods, found and re-claimed. I might further add, that after Sands was arrested late in May, and previous to his trial, that Mrs. McPherson, was very anxious to leave the Island, that she might not be detained on her holidays, to attend Court and give Evidence.\n2.\n\nTrusting that this will clear this matter up, I remain,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

This room has never been papered since the school was built and is in a most unsightly and dirty condition. I believe that the same rooms are now occupied, I should like to have the room repapered. The first room is a parlor and is very expensive to keep up and is a great deal of trouble to get cleaned. But I am sure we are paid for the institute and we hope to telephone to the Dept. of Indian Affairs to see my further expenses.\nThere is need of a new pair of curtains as it will be 3 years since the last were bought in 1922. Some can be repaired but two new pairs are necessary.\n\nNew sheets and pillow covers are needed. I believe the school order 3 pairs of sheets and 3 pair of pillow covers. One set for each bed and an extra set to allow changing. The last bed linen was bought 2 years ago this month and is in the corner quite threadbare.\n\nI think this matter your immediate attention as I would like the teacher's residence in first-class condition when Mr. S. makes his next visit of inspection to the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMarie Macpherson.\nIN YOUR HANDS TO\n\nNo.\n\nIN THE OFFICE OF THE INDIAN AGENT\n\nJan. 11th, 1927\n\nEnclosed you will find letter just received from Mrs. Mariette H.

In a reply from him, dated the 10th instant, he stated that he was making the necessary arrangements and would have this chimney built.

H. Abraham. The Department wrote the late Mr. Abraham on that date, authorizing him to have a new brick chimney, suitably located, erected during the coming Easter holidays. In a letter dated the 19th instant, he replied stating that he was making the necessary arrangements to have the chimney built. The Department is not aware exactly what arrangements the late Mr. Abraham made, but it is not likely that he had done very much in regard to the matter.\n\nIt is most important that the erection of this new chimney be given early attention, and, in view of Mr. Abraham's death, I have to request that you will look after the matter personally, and make immediate arrangements for the purchase of the brick and the securing of the necessary labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

I have taken this matter up with a contractor in the City of Sarnia, and he estimates that a kitchen, 14 x 16, with upstairs, can be built for $1,006.00, finished in a workmen like manner, including lining and paper between lining and clap board siding, plastered, and two coats of paint inside and outside. He also gave an estimate on a one story lean too, same size, at $753.00.\n\nBoth plans connecting with the present teacher's apartment. I would recommend that the two story kitchen be built so that the teachers if necessary could have separate apartments. The building of a kitchen is really necessary, and I would recommend that the Department give this matter their most serious and favourable consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 6, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of September 30th, last, relative to the erection of a kitchen to the teachers' residence at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School. It is regretted that your letter was inadvertently mislaid and that the same was not replied to at an earlier date.\n\nWe have no funds available at the present time to arrange for the erection of a kitchen, and, as the season is now late, this matter will have to stand over until next spring. Please draw this matter to the attention of the department early next spring, giving further particulars as to the size of the kitchen which you recommend be erected, the approximate cost of same and how you would recommend having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBarnia, Ont.\nOttawa, January 20, 1936\n\nI have to submit the following report on the school at Walpole Island for 1927.\n\nI had been asked to visit the No. 1 school and proceeded there from the Parish Hall. This school is in charge of two teachers, mother and daughter, there being two classrooms. The living accommodation for two teachers is far from satisfactory. The building was very poorly planned in the first instance and if our present staff consist of mother and daughter I am sure their condition sooner or later will be unpleasant conditions. As it is, it presents the only living and dining room they have is an extension of a hallway which divides the two classrooms.\n\nMore inadequate accommodation would be hard to find. Cooking is also done in this hallway. Two bedrooms are upstairs and the stairway occupies the front part of the hall. An extension could easily be built on the back of the school, of two stories which would increase the accommodation and with some minor alterations in layout provide adequate quarters for two teachers.\n\nWe cannot always expect to have our present staff there and even were this possible it is unfair to ask them to continue living under such circumstances. I would strongly recommend that steps be taken to put an addition on the rear of the school building and alter the layout accordingly in order that adequate quarters may be available for two people.\n\nActing Inspector\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Dec. 6th, 1927, relative to the erection of a kitchen to the teacher's residence at the Moi School, Walpole Island Indian Reserve, in which you stated, please draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next spring, giving further particulars, etc.\n\nI would recommend that this kitchen be built, as to size, not less than 14 x 16, sidewalls 16' high, that is a two-story, kitchens as the upper rooms, might some time be very necessary.\n\nThis kitchen is to be built on a concrete foundation. I understand from the teachers, since their recent visit to Ottawa, there is $1,000.00 available for this work, and I would recommend that the work be carried out by contract.\n\nAs I have no assurance how long I may continue my visits to Walpole Island, and would not like to start this work without being able to see it fully completed, would like to be advised by return of mail.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D.

Please have a responsible and competent carpenter or contractor prepare a rough sketch and list of materials concerning what is required and submit an offer to the Department. I agree that a 14 x 16, two-story addition is what is required and that it should be on a concrete foundation. Your early attention is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Should be started as soon as possible.\n\nAll plans have been approved by the various contractors whom Mr. Paul, the Indian Agent, has brought to give estimates. We are now in receipt of a written estimate from Mr. Paul.\n\nRecently the Wallacetown lumber company of Wallacetown, our nearest town, have put in an estimate... they have sent in a set of plans here and done so. Mr. Paul at Iarminia, but as he is still unable to have other contractors give estimates, we decided perhaps it might hurry matters a little if we forwarded these direct.\nThe plans are coming along, and a reliable firm from which to purchase the materials needed for the school has been located. The workmen are very satisfied and the work will be able to start immediately. Waiting for other contractors to submit plans which are not at all come within the amount allowed, only seems to be wasting time. The plans are being forwarded under separate cover also.\n\nFollowing our conversation with you re., our warrant officer being unsatisfactory, we wrote to Mr. Paul, requesting that he visit the Indian Constable to report in the office. In present circumstances, Mr. Allan Grace is a Polychrome Indian, hence does not receive favourably by the Chiefs and Chipewa. He is quite frequently intoxicated and does not visit the schools regularly. Mr. Paul says he has not forwarded this request to you.\ncould the be arranged for next school year, if not now.\n\nWalter Sanders, the Indian who caused so much trouble over his son Emerson who has recently been expelled from the white school at Whitehead, is again agitating the Indians against this school.\n\nHe has solicited Mr. Beckworth's aid in having the boy admitted to some school. The boy is approximately 16 years of age. Mr. Beckworth recently visited here and was the boy's case.\n\nThe city council has been informed in case further complications should arise.\n\nVery Sincerely Yours,\n\nHarriette Macpherson.\nSpecifications Covering Addition to Walpole Island School #1.\n\n**Foundation Work:**\n\nFor foundation - excavate to depth of 16\" around entire building and mix 5 parts of clean river gravel to 1 part of cement, and bring foundation up to the height of wall in the present building.\n\nBuild brick chimney on platform with 8 x 8 flue, to height shown on plan.\n\n**Carpenter Work:**\n\nAll material for frames and all finish lumber must be dry and suitable for purpose it is to be used.\n\nAll joisting, studding, rafters etc., to be of standard 2\" (thickness) hemlock or its equal.\n\n**Joists:**\n\nJoists in both floors are to be of 2 x 8 - 14 ft. placed at 16\" centres with one row of herringbone bridging.\n\n**Studs:**\n\nAll studs, joists and rafters are to be placed at 16\" centre and firmly spiked.\n\n**Cornice:**\n\nThe cornice is to be of white pine and to match with present building.\n\n**Windows:**\n\nAll windows are casement frames and sash to be hung with loose pin butts and fasteners on inside.\n\n**Sub Floor:**\n\nSub floor to be of white pine DLS. firmly nailed at all bearing points.\n\nAll outside lining on walls to be of #1 quality of shiplap.\n\nThere is to be one thickness of heavy asphalt felt over shiplap, and then to be covered with \u00bd x 5 or 1\u00bd x 6, Red Cedar Lap siding.\n\n**Roof:**\n\nThe entire roof is to be sheathed with white pine sheathing DLS, and covered with 3\u00bd Med Cedar Shingles every course nailed, 3 ply paper & shiplap inside.\n\n(to be used from save of present dormer over new part)\n\n**Inside:**\n\nThe entire walls and ceilings are to be covered with Gyproc and all joists covered with a strip \u00be x 1\u00bc to give same a panel effect.\n\nAll openings are to be cased with B.C. fir and back hand trim neatly put on.\nFinished floors both upstairs and down are to be B.

The furniture was brought down at Easter to furnish the new addition as well stored in an old shed very much exposed to the weather.\n\nThe Maschuga living house built here a few years ago, spoke only of a kitchen building where not even a closet, sun porch, or proper porch... and the interior. Our present sleeping rooms are so small and crowded in the school extending each other and not divided by any kind of partition, and the sleeping porch is very crowded in such case and would greatly improve the satisfaction from proper furniture to furnish it.\n\nI remain, Very truly yours,\n\nHarriette Macpherson\nOttawa, June 30, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 27th instant, relative to the building of the addition to the No. 1 School, Walpole Island, I beg to enclose an extract from a communication received from the teacher.

The new addition to the teacher's residence necessitated changing windows and doors in the old building with the result that the wall paper has been badly torn and an extra place the wall is bare.\n\nAlso in furnishing the two new rooms, if the Dept. could supply linoleum for the kitchen, a small rug for the bed room, curtains, a couch and a box spring, we could furnish the remainder.\n\nThe inside and outside of the school are badly in need of paint. Mr. Evans, the School Inspector, spoke about it during his last visit. The outside of the building has not been done since 1922 and the ceilings inside have never been painted.\n\nWishing you will give this matter your kind attention, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nMarie H. Macpherson.\nOttawa, August 2, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School, in which she requests that certain painting and papering be carried out at the teachers' residence. She states that the new addition to the residence necessitated changing windows and doors in the old building, with the result that the wall paper has been badly torn and in some places the wall is bare. I have to request that you will furnish, at the earliest possible date, an estimate of the cost of having the painting and decorating required by the teacher carried out and state how you would recommend that the work be done. The Department is anxious to have the residence portion of the building placed in a good condition. You might state, also, how the work in the erection of the new addition is proceeding and when it will be completed.\n\nThe teacher states, further, that the interior and exterior of the classroom portion of the building is badly in need of paint; that the outside has not been painted since 1925 and the ceilings inside have never been painted. Please report also on this painting, giving an estimate of the cost of the material and labour required and state how you would propose, if the work is authorized, that it should be carried out.\n\nThe teacher has requested certain furnishings for the two new rooms, viz., linoleum for the kitchen, a small rug for the bedroom, curtains, a couch bed and six chairs. We are requesting her to give us an estimate of the cost, and, if the purchase is authorized, you will receive the necessary authority later.\n\nYou might discuss with Mrs. Macpherson the matter of the painting required. Is the painting of the exterior and interior of the day school portion of the building urgent or could it be left over until next year? Your early reply, giving the information requested regarding this matter, is desired, in order that this work can be completed before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

We are taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Paul and requesting him to forward, at the earliest possible date, an estimate of the cost of the painting which you suggest be carried out. Mr. Paul has been requested to discuss with you the matter of the painting and renovating required.\n\nRelative to the furnishings required for the two new rooms, I shall be pleased if you will furnish an estimate of the approximate cost of supplying the linoleum for the kitchen, a small rug for the bedroom, the curtain material required, a couch bed and six chairs.

There intention are to use a pipe through the floor for drainage this I think would be very unsanitary and in warm weather cause very disagreeable odors. And is also quite close the well.\n\nThe cost of this would be around $15.00 but I would not feel like recommending this without better drainage there could be a pipe run through the outside wall under the floor and empty on top of the ground some distance from the house and well, with much extra cost.\n\nTo do this right there should be a pipe laid underground from the sink to the ditch at the road way some sixty or seventy feet and deep enough to keep from freezing in the winter at the present I am not prepared to make an estimate the cost of this, it could be done much less when the frost is out of the ground.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

If wood is the fuel used at this school, it is thought that a stove of the wood burning type should be supplied. However, if a coal burning stove is considered more satisfactory, the department will approve of your making the purchase of same, also of the necessary quantity of coal for the present winter's use. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, as it is not intended that an expensive type of stove be supplied.

Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nWhile at Walpole Island last week the agent brought to my attention the drainage condition at one of his schools in the village where there is absolutely no plumbing fixtures of any kind. The waste water from the kitchen and elsewhere is thrown out in front of the kitchen entrance, this being unsatisfactory during summer months. These conditions can be remedied by the installation of an enamel iron sink 30\" x 20\" underneath the stairs in the kitchen, also a hand pump which can be connected to the water well outside the building. The waste water from the above mentioned sink can be disposed of by building a cess pool at a distance of sixty feet from the building connected to the house by a four inch vitrified drain pipe with a ventilator placed on it before it enters the building. If granted this work can be carried out by the Indian Agent at a cost not exceeding $10.00.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nNov. 15, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nThe attention of the Department has lately been brought to the present drainage conditions existing at the village school at Walpole Island, which was lately visited by an officer of this Department, and it was suggested that the present conditions can be remedied by the installation of an iron sink 30\" x 20\" underneath the stairs in the kitchen also a hand pump which can be connected to the water well outside the building. The waste water from the sink could be disposed of through the installation of a drain made of vitrified pipe 4\" diameter from the building and discharging into a cess pool placed in the garden at a distance of about 60 feet from the building. As I understand that the above mentioned work has been fully explained to you by Mr. Chene, when he visited our school, I have to request that you purchase the necessary material and arrange to have the work done in the manner already outlined to you. If possible the total cost of the work should not exceed $70.00. An advance cheque which should be used for the payment of wages will be sent to you, as soon as I am advised that the work has been started.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D.

It has been possible to do only the simplest baking in it. The firebox has recently had a hole burnt through it which is about an inch across and gradually getting larger. It is necessary to keep the oven door closed for fear of live coals dropping out onto the floor. We feel that this is rather dangerous. The plates are also burnt out in one section.\n\nThe Savoy Hardware Co., Wallaceburg, have a stove listed at fifty-five dollars. It has a steel body, reservoir and is very modern in every way. We understand that the department is short of money but if you could pay the most of the cost of this stove we would be willing to pay the remainder, waiving all claims to the stove.\n\nWe are sending this request through the office of Indian Agent Bigfield.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nWalpole Island Ont. Jan. 21st 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose a letter from Mrs. Verna M. Daley teacher in the Junior room at No. 1 school in reference to the kitchen stove. This stove is in very bad shape. It is not an old stove having been purchased in the fall of 1930, and I do not understand why it should be so badly burnt out as a cook stove should last at least 15 or 20 years. I have not been in town since the condition of this stove came to my attention, to see if repairs can be obtained. I am rather doubtful if it can be repaired as it seems to be pretty well burnt out. I do not remember just what was paid for this stove but it was low priced stove. While I am waiting your reply I will see what can be done about securing the necessary repairs. I have not priced stove recently so I am not prepared to quote prices at the present time. I will investigate several kind of stove with their prices.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, January 24, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, regarding the condition of the stove in the kitchen at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection I would say that a kitchen stove was purchased for this school in April, 1931, at a price of $45. It is considered, if proper care had been taken, it should not be necessary to make extensive repairs or supply a new stove at the present time. However, if you are of opinion that a new kitchen stove is now required, rather than carrying out any extensive repairs, which might prove unsatisfactory, the Department will approve of you arranging to obtain a price for the supplying of a kitchen range, of a type that would be serviceable at this school, and submitting the price which you obtain. It is considered that a stove not exceeding in cost $60 to $55 would be quite satisfactory, should it be absolutely necessary to supply same.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nWalpoles Island Ont. Feb. 14th 1936.\n\nI have been informed by Mr. Daley that he has had trouble with his stove, quite naturally the iron that remained burnt through in short time. Mr. Daley removed the fire lining to enlarge his fire box for wood and state that the dealer told him he could do this as the fire brick was for coal and the dealer said he told him he could remove the ends for wood as they were for coal only. I examined this stove and it would appear that the back which is burnt out can be removed and properly replaced. I interview Shaw & Shaw the dealers from whom we purchased the stove. No - the necessary repairs can be made now but cannot be put in until it does not leak. If any stoves in your store you have in the store now, but the one at Mr. Daley's house has bolted. In fact, the stove is not detached. This stove is made by the Galt Stove and Furnace Co., Galt Ont. It is known as the Colonist No. 49-18. I could take it up with company if you thought advisable. Any cook stove... not at all of your...\n\nI find stoves at Zavitz in town (not very far) they have Quebec style cook top for $55.00 without highback and warming oven, or $68.00 complete but no warming oven and highback. These can be purchased by the teacher if they desired it. Mr. Zavitz has cheaper stoves but he does not recommend them. He will guarantee the $55.00 stove and he is a very reliable stove dealer. I saw the Glen Hardware for stove but they did not have any in stock.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant regarding the kitchen stove at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School, please communicate with the Galt Stove and Furnace Company, Galt, Ont., and ascertain if you can secure the repairs that are necessary for the present kitchen stove. If so, you may arrange for their purchase and delivery to the school, and forward an account, in triplicate, covering their cost.\n\nIf it is not possible to secure these repairs, you may arrange for the purchase of a new cook stove, at a cost not exceeding $55.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nFebruary 28th, 1936.\n\nMR. HIGHFIELD,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe are just in receipt of your letter of the 24th inst., with reference to #49-18 \"Colonist Banner\" in which the oven front has been burned through on account of the back lining having been removed from the firebox.\n\nIt is quite a job to replace this part, as it really involves dismantling the stove.\n\nA better proposition would be for you to get a piece of steel of the proper size and bolt it over the part that is damaged on the inside of the oven, filling in the space with stove cement. If you will do this, and then put the linings back in the stove, you may still get a good deal of service from it. Any tinsmith could fix up a piece of sheet metal for you, or if there is not a tinsmith with the proper material available, you might send us a paper template showing the shape and size of the part needed, and we would, of course, be glad to fix up a piece of sheet metal for you here. You will then have to drill a few holes in the stove to fasten it in place, of course, but no doubt you have breast irons or electric drills that you can use. If the back lining has been removed and lost, we can supply you with another upon receipt of your instructions. If you order a back lining, please be sure to advise us whether the bottom of the firebox consists of a pair of duplex grates on which either coal or wood can be burned, or if it is fitted with a flat grate for wood burning only.\n\nYours truly,\n\nTHE GALT STOVE AND FURNACE COMPANY\n\nJ3/JM\n(Diot-Feb.27)\nWalpole Island Ont., March 10th 1936.\n\nSir,\n\nI have received your letter dated March 7th, 1936, in which you state that you have been unable to attend the meeting scheduled for March 10th, 1936.

It is unfortunate that you are unable to attend, but I am sure that we will find another suitable date for the meeting.\n\nI hope that you will be able to attend the next meeting, which is scheduled for April 14th, 1936.

The living room had a small composition rug and partly painted board floor. The paint has worn off badly. As the floor itself is not a very good one, we would like to entirely cover it with linoleum also. The following prices are submitted by the J.D. Crothers Store, Wallaceburg, on inlaid linoleums. This kind of linoleum would wear many years as the pattern does not wear off.\n\nThe kitchen is 5' x 4' yds by 4' yds = 23 sq. yds at a cost of $1.38 a sq. yd. = $31.74\n\nThe living room is 7' x 6' yds by 3' yds = 21 sq. yds at a cost of $1.38 a sq. yd. = $28.98\n\nThis would be a total of laying this linoleum, as there is no much cutting and fitting in these rooms, probably $1.50.\nThe curtains in the kitchen are worn out. They have been in use for 4 years, as there are 9 basement windows, it takes 11 3/4 yds. of material. I would be glad to make them up if your Department would supply the material.\n\nThe S.D. Clothiers store quote this material at 35 cents a yd., making a cost of $4.03.\n\nTwo window shades are needed for the bedrooms. They cost 59 cents each.\n\nMr. Daley and I would appreciate whatever the Department can do in this matter of repairs. We fully realize that this involves a great deal of money, but the rooms are so large that it takes too much to cover them. The S.D. Clothiers store is the only one I was advised to buy from.\n\nYours truly,\n(Mrs.) Verna Daley.\nHalpole Island,\nNo. 1 School.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1936.\n\nDear Madam,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 25th ultimo, the Department regrets that, owing to lack of funds, it is not possible to authorize the purchase of the linoleum requested in your letter for the teachers' residence at the Walpole Island No. 1 Indian Day School.\n\nYou may, however, purchase curtain material at a cost of $4.03, also two window shades at a cost of 59\u00a2 each.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

No. 3,\nWallaceburg, Ont.\nHalpole Island, Ont.,\nApril 12, 1927\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am herewith submitting a list of repairs needed in the residence of No. 1 school. The kitchen needs redecorating very badly; the linoleum pattern is all worn off and is worn through at the floor in many places so that everyone enters our home through the kitchen. We would like very much to have it changed. It is found by comparing costs that it would be cheaper to paper the walls and paint only the ceiling than paint the whole room since the house of paint has increased. This is also true for the bedrooms above the kitchen except that there is a drop ceiling. It would be better to have ceiling too. The reason for painting the kitchen ceiling is to enable us to wash it as the smoke seems to be new at quickening its redecorating. Has been done in these rooms for four years.\n\nIf the department could supply the following materials for the first two rooms and the paint for the other two bedroom floors we would gladly do the work of painting, papering and laying the linoleum. I have made careful inquiries at different stores and find that the lowest prices are:\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nwallpaper for kitchen walls\nwallpaper for bedroom walls ceiling\npaint for kitchen ceiling and other\nwoodwork in kitchen and bedroom\npaint for 2 bedrooms floors\nlength and width by 13 ft\n\n$340\n$390\n$3.95\n$4.95\n$21.50\n\n$37.70\n\nI wish to thank your department very\nmuch for cooperation... other requests we have\nmade, to keep up the repairs, etc., here.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[signature]\nVerna M.

I have\nnot seen any notice for the month.\nThe next time I came back, the teacher\nasked to get a substitute for a day she\nhad promised to come and work\nbut didn't show up. So I had to get him\nto make out my monthly report when he\nleft and had to go to the hospital.\nHe also said there would be no\nschool tomorrow. I am not sure that\nhe was there for two days.

He is reported to be a hardworking conscientious teacher, making good time.\n\n2. He is a married man with a family, and finds it very hard to live on the present allowance.\n\n3. The teachers in the Church of England and Government schools each receive $300, although the latter has a much smaller number in attendance than Miskokomon.\n\nIf the Department approves of this suggestion, the Missionary Society will bear its share of the proposed increase.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nThe Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nO.M.A., 1st July, 1900.\n\nRev.

I have been a member of the settlement board for several years and have seen how the school has improved under my leadership. However, we must consider the needs of the children and see if there is any way to improve their attendance.\n\nI believe it would be advisable to change the teachers and see if this will make any difference in the attendance at No. 3 School. Both teachers are willing to make the change if it is deemed necessary, as it would be more convenient for both if you think it advisable to change for a time at least. If there is not a better attendance, the only way will be to enforce compulsory attendance.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nOTTAWA, January 1908\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo relative to the attendance at No. 3 Walpole Island school; and in reply I beg to say that the Department approves of your suggestion that the teacher of this school exchange places with Arthur Niskokemon, who has charge of No. 2 school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Cowan & Towers,\nHarristers, etc.,\nSarnia, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have spoken to the School Inspector Mr. Conn, if my salary could be increased. He thought I would be able to get an agent Mr. J.B. Macdonald. I saw the Indian Agent and instructed me to write direct to the Indian Department. My salary is $300 per year. This is not enough to depend on for my living. I have been teaching school on Wolfe Island for two years at the rate of $200 per year. I keep my situation steadily filled. The other school had five change of teachers last year. In my qualification I attended School at Caronia Collegiate Institute completed the form of the high school course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher No. 1 School\nWolfe Island\nOct. 6, 1910.\n\nMr.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant applying for an increase in your salary as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department reports that the general conditions and success attained by you in your work would not at the present time justify it in granting your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. [Name], Secretary.\n\nJoseph Simpson, ...,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 2 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nEXC.\n\nOttawa, 31st December, 1910.\n\nIn your \"Teacher's Report\" for the year ending, recently received by the Department, it is noted that you devote time to the instruction of the pupils in your charge. It is also noted that you have not given the pupils daily instruction as Group 1. I have to state, therefore, that the Department expects you to carry out the instructions more diligently.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy Superintendent.\n\nJoseph Bertram, Esq.,\nTeacher Walpole Island No.2 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nToronto, February 10th, 1911\n\nSir:\n\nVisited on the same day (Feb. 6th) school No-2 in the Pettawatomie district of the reserve and found 10 scholars present. This school as well as the former school was very clean and tidy and the teacher appeared to be a rather superior class of Indian. He has however no particular qualifications for his duties. He does take considerable interest in the scholars and would like if some prizes could be offered to those who attend the most regularly. It would appear to me that these two school districts are both worthy of having as good teachers as the Dept can secure. The equipment in this school appeared quite complete.\n\nJ.G. Ramsden\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\nOTTAWA, FEBRUARY 16, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the No. 3 Indian Industrial school, and in reply I beg to say that I am pleased to learn that you found the road here in good condition and that the teacher is doing fairly satisfactory work under the circumstances.\n\nI will carry out your suggestion to\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, February 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Ramsden, who recently visited Walpole Island, recommends that prizes be given to the children attending No. 2 school in accordance with the request made by the teacher. The Department is prepared to carry out this suggestion and will also allow a small grant at both the No. 1 and No. 2 schools for prizes to be distributed at the end of the June quarter. The scholars should be informed that these prizes will be given as rewards for punctuality and regularity of attendance and diligence in their studies. You will be good enough to bring the matter to the attention of the Department about the month of May and obtain authority for the purchases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't, Deputy and Secretary,\n\nJ.

The accounts should be kept separate and should show in detail the articles purchased with prices. If possible the teachers should arrange to have the presentation of these prizes made in the presence of the parents and should prepare some programme for their entertainment. I would ask you to request each of the teachers to submit a short report on this to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJ. B. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM:-\n\nFor correspondence re purchase of lot No. 237, Pottawatimie Island from Mr. Joseph Isaac for school ground purposes in connection with the No. 2 Walpole Island school see 152943/5.\nWalpole Island\nJune 6th, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nAny alleged complaints should come or have been made against me to the Department in connection with the school, I would kindly return a copy of this letter. A chance should be given to me to explain the matter as well as the other party. The faculty have arranged the school in the past instead of promoting the interests of the parents & school children. A child will imitate the faculty and show manners worse to the teacher. My duty is to uplift the young as well as the old in any way that I can help. No parent has ever visited the children while at school. I am sure that the Public School Inspector is satisfied with my work.\n\nWhen future quarterly school returns are made out may I make the returns in proportions to the number of teaching days with the last month quarter as per in accordance to the instructions of the Department\u2014that a teacher is to be paid a salary according to the number of teaching days in the year. (200 teaching days)\nPlease send a copy Revised Statutes of the Indian Act also a copy of the School act pertaining to the Indian Schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJoseph Simpson\nTeacher.\nOttawa, June 14, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has not of late received any complaints with reference to your work as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 School.\n\nWith regard to your return for the June quarter it should be made out in the usual way. Payment at the rate of two hundred teaching days in the year has only reference to broken periods. You will be paid a full quarter's salary as usual. School may be closed at the end of June.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJoseph Samson, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nReceived the letter no. 404814 dated February 25th, 1913. In reply I beg to say that I shall be ready to attend the summer course at the Agricultural College, Quebec, and make necessary arrangements with someone to look after my place which I am now. July and August being the busiest time of the season will certainly put me back in the work at home. The proposition made by the Department is very good, now I wish to explain my case, having a family of three depending on me. I wrote to the Department sometime ago asking a raise on my salary $300 per year is not sufficient. Salaries on teachers have been raised and I feel competent that I can do as good work to my own Indians as any second class teacher Miss R. Bissett teacher of No. 1 School, Walpole Island receives a salary $8500 per year. I have taught school at Walpole Island since the year October 1900. My qualifications are from High School of Ont. My school is doing splendidly and the attendance is very good. I earnestly ask through you to lay the matter with the Department.\n\nMarch 7th, 1913\n\nWalpole Island\nto raise my salary at least $50 more in addition to my present salary. The other $50 will also be added making the total $400 a year's salary providing that if I make a success in completing the course next summer, I do not wish to leave my home at any time though refused two good positions in the States offering a better salary. We have a good farming country and the climate is splendid. Person who has any ambition can do just as well at home than elsewhere.\n\nRegarding the Agent's monthly School Reports should the Indian Agent fill out the reports instead of leaving the paper there, I fill out the case of ten years that he gives the paper there at the office and do not go out at all to visit the school when he does visit the school, has not even once taken classes to know how his school is doing. His last visit was on March 5th, 1873 which means his visit is in the month of February. If in supply of School Books etc are sometimes ordered less than what my order calls for. When broken pencils run short I usually buy the need for the pupils and few supply for themselves.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nJoseph Sampson\nTeacher\nOttawa, March 13, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, and in reply to that portion in which you apply for an increase in salary I beg to say that the reports received on your work at this school would not justify the Department in granting any increase.\n\nWith regard to the Agent's reports he should be required to fill them up himself and in reference to the supplies in future if the quantities asked for do not reach you be good enough to advise the Department and inquiry will be made. It is presumed that the Agent hands the material over to you as he receives it and if there is any shortage the fault probably lies somewhere else.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. MOLLOY\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJoseph Sampson, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island No. 2 School,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOct. 20th 1913.\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI would like through your kind influence to lay the matter to the Department of Indian Affairs for an increase of my salary. $500 per year is not enough to support a family. I have completed the M.A. course in the high School of Ontario, taught in the School East ten years and three years in the High School here missed a day because of sickness. Salaries of teachers have been raised and why should I not have the same chance? I could have had a larger salary elsewhere but for the sake of helping my own people I remain at my post and your kindness was visited upon me next three years you see my services are needed.\n\nI am taking the Professional Teacher Course instruction by correspondence with two special courses namely Agriculture and Domestic Science from the Barnard College, Rogers, Ohio, if the Dept. desires me to teach the subject of Agriculture providing my salary raised I will do so.\n\nI am,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nJoseph Samson\nAs you will recollect, we have persistently refused to increase Mr. Sampson's salary as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 school. With regard to his letter herewith, I think from my observation of conditions there last summer that if Mr. Sampson would conduct a garden next year, as he claims to be competent to do, the Department would be quite justified in granting him an increase. He is Chief of the Pottawattamies and is a very fair type of Indian. It will be at least sometime before the scheme for a consolidated school can be carried to completion, if the Department decides to undertake it, and I think it would be well to give Mr. Sampson some encouragement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. F. Macdonald\nOCTOBER REPORT OF AGENT T.A. McALLUM ON THE WALPOLE ISLAND,\nNO. 2 SCHOOL.\n\nI have a petition to have a qualified teacher in this\nNo. 2 School. It is to come before the Council next meeting.\nI think it is a mistake having a native teacher. He talks the\nnative language and the children, when they address the\nteacher, mostly in the native language.\n\nDate of Inspection,- October 30th, 1914.\nOttawa, November 10, 1924.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Walpole Island No. 2 School in which you state that you have received a petition from the Indians to have a qualified teacher placed in charge of this school I beg to say that, as you state this matter is to come before the Council next meeting, the Department will await the receipt of the result of the discussion on this matter before taking action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nTo Indian Agent at Wolfville Island and to the municipal council of the Wolfville Island\n\nWe wish to state Wolfville Island, by no call, but attention to the Agent and Council to the conduct of the Public School taught by one Sampson who we are informed is not a qualified teacher, and further we whose names are subscribed hereto are not satisfied with the progress our children are making in the said school, and we also object to paying an unqualified teacher when qualified teachers are easily procurable.\n\nDated at Wolfville Island\n\nThis 3rd day of October 1914\n\nJames P. Teigoshk\nJoseph M. Sword\nE. Dodge\nAndrew Isaac\nMoses Colwell\nJoseph Isaac\nMrs. Dan Thomson.\nSir,\n\nI wish to call the attention to the Superintendent General of the Indian Affairs to the conduct of our police officer David Thomas who has been annoying me for several years past causing trouble in our school section and I strongly urge that the case be stopped; he looks to give me trouble instead of helping the teacher to do any good in our school section.\n\nOn April 3rd, 1912, Thomas came into the school room in a bad humor insulted me while the pupils were leaving for home at 4 o'clock, again on June 3rd, 1913, Thomas came (with Charlie Smith a constable) to the school house at 9:15 A.M., he was angry and spoke unpleasantly before the school. I got him a summons to serve and convicted on June 11th fine $1.00 and cost $1.25 total $13.50. I had somewhat a difficult task to have the matter settled until I wrote to you with evidence papers year ago this month\u2014Dept. directed Thomas to pay his fine and cost; since the trial into court\nhave occurred similar to the paper enclosed, our Indian agent seems to be in favour with Thomas and I want to say a word regarding to our agent in connection with my school in this next letter. I have the school pretty well under control. The daily attendance is very good. The school house have been built by the Potowatomies without any help from the Department. The expenses incurred with them is paid out of the fund of the Potowatomie Band. In the case of Dan Thomas a member of the Chippewa Band do not look good to interfere in our School section and you will notice his name not signed on the petition, he has no child but a step daughter age fifteen who is not at School. We as Potowatomies should have the right to the interests of the School with the help of our own council. The Chippewa children have the same privilege as our children have in attending the said School because the School is closer for them than the No. 1 School so is the same way with the other School if any of the Potowatomie children are at School.\n\nSupporting any of the Potowatomies interfere in\nNo. 1. Chippewa School in result would be a failing house, they would say that the Potawatomies have no business in their school, if same course should it's be understood, so that in future, that no member or members of the Chippewa Band interfere in our School Section.\n\nNames signed on the petition:\nJames P. Keyworth 2 girls attendance bad and are not looked after at home.\nJoseph M. Sword 1 girl age 15 not on the School roll\nMrs. Dan. Thomas 1 ... 15\n\nMoses Colwell 3 boys were attended my school\nJ.

D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nIN THE OFFICE OF THE INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE.\n\nSir,\n\nI have just been speaking to one of the petitioners at your house, and he informed me that he had heard from Mr. Smith that he was going to meet Mr. Johnson tomorrow morning at his house. I have also heard from Mr. Johnson that he will be there tomorrow morning. I am enclosing herewith a copy of the letter that Mr. Smith wrote to Mr. Johnson.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Seal]\nvisited this school on the 1st of October, last, in his report in speaking of Sampson states \"success only fair, but I think his work is improving and the pupils are making somewhat better progress in their studies.\n\nIt would be a difficult matter to obtain a qualified, white teacher for this school, as in the No. 1 School they have had seven teachers in the last four years and the present teacher has sent in her resignation. Sampson has been so long in the employ of the Department I do not think it would be just to him to dismiss him summarily. Mr. McCallum will have to take steps to secure a qualified teacher for the No. 1 School and I think before doing anything with the No. 2 School we might wait to see what success he has. At any rate I would not advocate dispensing with Mr. Sampson's services till the end of the school year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. B. Benson\n\nMr. Sampson should not be moved at present, he might improve from what he is now doing in the place of a qualified white teacher.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 9, 1914.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the petition sent in by some of the Walpole Island Indians asking for the appointment of a qualified teacher to replace Mr. Joseph Sampson I beg to say that Mr. Agent McCallum was asked to report fully on this petition and Mr. Sampson's letter in regard thereto. Mr. McCallum has replied stating that he has known for sometime that a change of teachers in the No. 2 School would be advantageous. He has, however, failed to deal with the points made by Mr. Sampson in his letter, in which he claims that Ohonee, who is the instigator of this petition, is actuated by spite and that some of the signers of the petition have no children of school age, only four out of the eight having children attending the school.\n\nMr. Sampson has been teaching this school for the past fourteen years. The Department is aware that he has no special qualifications and possibly a change would be advantageous. Mr. Conn, Public School Inspector, who visited\nvisited this school on the 1st of October, last, in his report in speaking of Sampson states \"success only fair, but I think his work is improving and the pupils are making somewhat better progress in their studies\".\n\nIt would be a difficult matter to obtain a qualified, white teacher for this school, as in the No. 1 School they have had seven teachers in the last four years and the present teacher has sent in her resignation. As Sampson has been so long in the employ of the Department I do not think it would be just to him to dismiss him summarily. Mr. McCallum will have to take steps to secure a qualified teacher for the No. 1 School and I think before doing anything with the No. 2 School we might wait to see what success he has. At any rate I would not advocate dispensing with Mr. Sampson's services till the end of the school year.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW. Benson\n\nMr. Sampson should not be moved at present, the only change from what he is doing would be for a qualified white teacher.\nOttawa, December 11, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in further reference to the petition from certain Indians of Walpole Island asking that a qualified teacher be engaged to replace Mr. Joseph Sampson, who is in charge of the No. 2 School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department considers that it would be well to have a duly qualified teacher there, it is not prepared to have Sampson removed at present. The Department would like to know what accommodation could be found for a qualified teacher, should one be appointed in the near future.\n\nIn your report on the letter from Joseph Sampson, a copy of which was sent you on the 27th ultimo, you failed to deal with the points made by Mr. Sampson in regard to his claim that some of the signers of the petition have no children of school age and that only four out of the eight have children attending the school and also to his claim that Chooses, the instigator of the petition, was actuated more by ill will against the teacher than in the interests of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThos.

However, we are still waiting for the conveyance and have not heard anything further.\n\nI hope this finds you well and that you are enjoying your time here.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 16, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 27th ultimo, in which you state that it would cost eighty cents a day for a conveyance for the teacher of the No. 2 Walpole Island School, I beg to say that some cheaper arrangement will have to be made, as it would be virtually bringing Miss Warnock's salary up to $760.00 a year, which is more than we are paying to any teacher in the province of Ontario where we have 52 day schools and only four of the teachers are in receipt of more than $600.00. Miss Warnock is only the holder of a limited third class certificate and the Department has not been furnished with any testimonials as to her previous success in teaching.\n\nIf Miss Warnock wishes to remain on she will be paid at the rate of $650.00 per annum, but she will have to make her own arrangements for board or transport.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nSir,\n\nRegarding the school teachers in Wannock or in general, their application was not accepted. I am not sure if it was a common practice to think we are doing everything in the school, but I think that interests should be engaged in various activities around the school. But if we were to consider it was one interest, then there is more to consider.\n\nWife, she was not very active. She does not want children and does not take an interest in the things around her. She does not care for the work she does, nor does she not like to come to things which are often ignored. It is not a question of the children's thought, which will you not give some of attention to? Would you like me to send someone to help us in regard to new teachers whom you have mentioned?\n\nP.S. A.

Should they decide to leave then they should give you timely notice in writing of their intention to do so, so that you may be in a position to consult with the Public School Inspector with a view to obtaining the services of suitable teachers to succeed them.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

If they are not prepared to send in their resignations the Department thinks it would be well to keep them on for a time, provided they will interest themselves in their school work, as it would be a difficult matter to find other teachers at this season.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I am eager to see you and discuss our plans.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\nNo. 52943-1\n\nTO DATE OF THIS LETTER\n\nINDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nSir,\n\nI am requested to inform you that the Indians may be in a better position on the arrival of the steamer if they can get their share of supplies at their own cost without any delay.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, December 9, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 1st instant I beg to say that on the 16th of October, last, you were informed that if Miss Warnock wished to remain on as teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 School she would be paid at the rate of $650.00 per annum, but that she would have to make her own arrangements for board and transport. If she was advised by you to this effect the question of transport is disposed of so far as the Department is concerned and any claim against her for this service will have to be settled by her, as the Department has no authority to withhold her cheque.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that there has been more correspondence in regard to the teachers of the two schools on \"Walpole Island\" than is necessary and, as the Department has no intention of dispensing with their services without better reasons than you put forth, it would be as well to let the matter drop for the present.\n\nIt is noted that you addressed your letter to Mr. Benson of this Department. If you will refer to the head of this letter you will see that all correspondence should be addressed to the Secretary Dept., of Indian Affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nA. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\n\nJ. D.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nOttawa, April 6, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI am sending you herewith an anonymous letter which was received by the Department, in which it is stated that the teacher of one of the schools on Walpole Island is a Roman Catholic and that unless she is discharged and a Protestant engaged to replace her the parents will not send their children to school.\n\nThe Department would like you to find out, if possible, who is the author of this letter. The statement as to the religion of one of the teachers on the island is not correct, as they are both Protestants. You will be good enough to inform the Indians accordingly and that they are to send their children regularly to school and in case of their failure to do so the Department will look to you to have the regulations enforced. The teachers should be required to furnish you with a list of the absentees from time to time and you should instruct the truant officer to carry out sections 6 and 7 of the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

I have not heard any complaint about the position until I received your letter.\n\nI may be able to assist in this matter if you requested the teachers at each school to send me a list of their names so that I may have the names of the teachers to send out about the vacancy.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, April 20th 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant stating that Miss Warnock, teacher of the No. 2 School on Walpole Island, is a Roman Catholic.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Warnock in her report for the year ended December 31st, last, states that she is a Presbyterian.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAas, Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

The Department is advised that you are a Roman Catholic and you state in your report on the Walpole Island No. 2 School for the year ended December 31st, last, that you are a Presbyterian.\n\nKindly advise the Department at once as to whether you belong to the Roman Catholic or the Presbyterian Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

When I came to this Island, I stated clearly to Indian Agent my religious denomination, wrote out my application in his presence and handed it to said agent. At no time have I stated to any Indians on the Island that I am a Roman Catholic or profess any other belief in such time as they have been engaged in religious exercises, musical recitals, or any other exercises in public schools for six years. I have had no trouble with any Indian parents with regard to my religious denominations that I am aware of.\n\nThe natives of Halifax Island evidently know the teachers' business better than to trouble the minister.\n\nYours truly,\nWayne Warnock\nOttawa, May 10, 1916.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 4th instant I beg to say that your explanations in regard to your religious belief are satisfactory and Mr. Agent McCallum is being instructed to inform any busybodies on the reserve that you are not a Roman Catholic.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAsst.

Her explanation is satisfactory to the Department and should the question of her religion be brought up again you will be good enough to inform any busybodies that she is a Presbyterian.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAest.

It is a question that has been raised by some of our people who have been living there for many years. They believe that the land should be sold to them because they have lived there for so long and have made their homes there. They feel that they should be able to keep their homes and not be forced to move away.\n\nI understand that there is a proposal to sell the land to a company called the Northern Pacific Railway Company. I believe that this is a good idea because it will provide jobs and opportunities for our people. However, I also believe that we should be given the opportunity to purchase the land ourselves if we choose to do so.\n\nI urge you to consider these matters carefully and to take into account the wishes of our people.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter no. 152777 dated June 6th I beg to state that when I came to Walpole Island I was asked by several Indians and white people why it was that I never closed school on every Friday at twice as the previous teacher had done. Since I had never been authorized to do so, naturally I came to the conclusion that it was not really necessary to close school on Friday but I would at need to report such to the Chief. If no time have I ever since coming to school me closed it at 2:30 except the last Mr. Abraham visited my school. May be it is allowed the pupils the liberty that day from two thirty.\n\nNow in conclusion to you, the idea on which I took half holidays and no at school also my reasons for doing. I beg further to say that during past year I have given to your school best service I was capable of, I have tried to please most of the Indians who in the past mention had been\n\nPoor Copy\nHours out of school &c.\n\nDec. 22nd. Closed at noon. Had to travel 400 miles to reach home and could not have been able to reach home by any other means left here at noon that day.\n\nJan. 7th 1916. Closed at noon. Had an unaccounted for death result from a cold suffered from. Had to leave school closed Friday afternoon.\n\nOne week in April school was closed on three consecutive days at three because a loud ringing bell at noon broke, perhaps in found out after main class was dismissed. I had four pupils left; this irregular attendance was due to dread of conditions of road at that time.\n\nApril 20th. Closed school for Easter holidays at noon. One of four this was necessary because both rooms were running full of ice and we had to wait their chance to get across. If I left Good Friday could not make proper connections at Edmonton.\ndeplored the Indians' depart because I\nreceived the message from him at his\nown very desire. Hence, the things I tell\nyou are coming to light.

Deputy and Secty.\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, January 3rd, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report which shows that your health is not of the best. In view of this and, also, your advancing age, the Department is reluctantly obliged to request your resignation as teacher of the No. 2 Walpole Island school, to take effect as soon as possible.\n\nI wish to take advantage of this opportunity to state that your services in the past have always been very satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nGeo. Cork, Esq.,\nTeacher,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nOttawa, February 2, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your letter of the 16th ultimo in regard to Mr. Cork, teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 School, I beg to say that Mr. Cork has been informed that, in view of the state of his health and his advancing age, the Department is reluctantly obliged to request his resignation as teacher of this school, to take effect as soon as possible.\n\nKindly state whether you know of a suitable teacher to take charge of this school when Mr. Cork leaves. You should not, however, make any appointment without consulting the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nSir,\n\nYour letter of Jan 23rd, no. 152943-1 received. I could not reply sooner as I wished to see the agent Mr. McCallum before I wrote. I went down to see him last Sunday but he was not at home; then followed a big storm and the roads were a mass of snow and mud. The round trip from the schoolhouse to the agent's residence at the front and back to my place is nearly six miles so could not go down till last evening.\n\nNow I wish to say here that if my remarks are a little vigorous it is without prejudice toward the Indian Department as I appreciate the courteous consideration you have given me during the past seven years.\n\nNow I respectfully, but emphatically, beg to say that any report you may have that states that my health is not of the best is an absolute falsehood. My age I cannot deny and don't\nwish to. I have never had better health in my life than I have at present and I have always had good health. I could show you the amount of work I have done during the last autumn in gathering a small wood in the woods and carrying it in bundles about a quarter of a mile to my house for my winter's supply of fuel.\n\nAs regards my school work I have received compliments indirectly from those most interested, on my efforts to teach the children the English language which has not been done by previous teachers, at least not for a few years past.\n\nI don't know how many are in the plot against me but I do know the instigator of the whole thing, \"and thereby hangs a tale.\" I am the victim of a vile plot. I could tell the whole story but I am not\npleading to stay here only as I shall state shortly. I don't mind the dismissal so much as I do the manner in which it has been brought about by an enemy in the camp.\n\nNow I would respectfully ask for one last favor from the Department. I live alone in a rented log house about 14 miles from the settlement. It is difficult to get supplies as it is about seven miles to Wallaceburg and I have to hire a rig when I go there. It is difficult to get a conveyance and when one does so the Indians consider a white man as their lawful prey so far as money is concerned. Because of these difficulties I have laid in my winter stock of eatables such as potatoes, bacon, apples (that grow on the place), sugar, tea, coffee, flour etc. I have also a big pile of wood referred to above.\nwhich is unsuitable but which serves me well as it is dry and small for my little stand. Now because of these facts, I esteem it a great favor if you could, or rather would, let me stay on till the summer holidays when I shall bid the schoolhouse farewell forever.\n\nIn the mean time, this place is a sea of mud. Even I have some things I must dispose of\u2014a stone table, bedstead and mattress, tools, nails etc.\n\nAnother reason I have is, I may stay here awhile after the school closes, and have some of my family come up from there to stay awhile.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy and Chief,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, February 8, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant asking to be allowed to remain in charge of the Walpole Island No. 2 School until the end of June, next, as you have laid in your winter's stock of supplies.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be glad to grant your request and you may remain in charge of this school until the end of June, next.

It will not be necessary, therefore, for you to take any action in regard to securing another teacher for this school at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\n\nHon. A. McCallum, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island, Ont.\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant regarding the death of your teacher, I do not know of any suitable person to take his place at this time. However, I am afraid it will be too late to close the school house before the fall. Books and other supplies are being sent out. We think he is a great loss.\n\nWhen he came here sometimes he was to go to our house and we never met a nicer boy. He was very kind and I doubt if he is able to school until midsummer unless he has a chance abroad.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nH. H.

The zeal and earnestness makes up for the former, but I am somewhat concerned in regard to the latter. The conduct of the pupils both in school and out of school leads me to believe that they are getting somewhat out of hand.\n\nDate of Inspection.\u2014October 7th, 1919.\nOttawa, October 24, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. Inspector Corn, in a report to the Department on his recent inspection of the No. 2 School on the Salopole Island Reserve, states that there are two defects in the management of the school, namely, antiquated low class methods and a certain looseness in discipline. He states that the conduct of the pupils both in school and out of school led him to believe that they were getting out of control.\n\nYou will be good enough to draw this letter to the attention of the teacher and inform him, with regard to the conduct of the pupils, that it is expected that he will exercise strict discipline over them, and that his methods of teaching should be improved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMrs. Paul, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBerrie, Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy and Secretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Abraham, while in the Department last week, recommended that the salary of Harold D. Watts, teacher of the No. 2 School, Walpole Island Reserve, be increased by $50.00 per annum, which would give him the same rate of salary as is paid the teacher of the No. 1 School. He is at present receiving a salary of $600.00 and the bonus, while the teacher of the No. 1 School receives $650.00 salary and bonus. There is an enrolment of 49 pupils at the No. 2 School and 53 at the No. 1 School.\n\nMr. Watts was trained in England and had thirteen years teaching experience there, and has had five years experience in Canada. The Public School Inspector states that \"the success he met with is reasonably good. The pupils can all speak English. They are making fairly good progress. I believe the work that is being done in agriculture has considerable value. Hygiene and physical culture are receiving proper attention.\"\n\nMrs. McDonald, teacher of the No. 1 School, has only a Third Class certificate but has had twenty-one years experience.\n\nI would therefore recommend that Mr. Watts' salary be increased by $50.00, which would allow him the same salary as is paid Mrs. McDonald and would place them on an equal footing for the same amount of work.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, August 9, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the Department has decided to grant Mr. Harold D.

The parties whom you report as visiting the teacher at night are her relatives. The neighbors who have been interviewed in the matter state that there is nothing wrong in these visits.\n\nI need not point out to you the seriousness of making unfounded reports, or the situation in which you place yourselves if action were to be taken by the teacher or others in having you prove the charges.

Attendance is reported as very good and progress fair. Besides the regular curriculum the pupils are taught knitting, sewing, mending, dressmaking and manual training.

The children are always fighting, and although reported, the teacher does not punish them.\n\n2nd. When the bell rings in calling the children to school, there is no system consequently there is often a jam at the doors causing sometimes injuries to the children.\n\n3rd. Although being a married woman, having a husband living, there is a man at least her almost every day gone there with residence at the school, every day for 4 years.\n\nIn view of the circumstances surrounding the said No. 2 School, there is no discipline at the school, and we deem it necessary that there should be a change of teacher.\n\nSigned,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSee next Page\n\nAllen Isaac\nHeyman Smith - one boy\nSolomon Sword - one boy\nPeyton Vincatary - one girl\nJames Williams - two boys and one girl\nSam Shipman - two boys\nJune Shipman - two boys\nLucian Pithes - one girl\nEd Hinkley\nSam Johnson - three girls\nE.

Dept. of Indian Affairs\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter Oct. 20th No. 40-2-1 I beg to say that the Indian Agent did not inquire into all complaints as I asked some of the Complainants who informed me that he was not interested in them.\n\nHe told me he had no complaints and while he tried to make improvements still showed discrimination against my children and is still doing so.\n\nThe new teacher came shortly after he arrived and he was very kind and attentive.\n\nWe have heard nothing but a report of the attitude of the Indians and the way they treat the Indians. We have been here since the school opened and have only heard good things about the school. We have heard nothing but good things about the school and the teachers. We have heard nothing but good things about the school and the teachers.\n\nMy children do not attend school.\nShe used send my children home at 3 o'clock every day while she keeps the other children till 4 o'clock.\n\nIf there is no improvement in the treatment of my children I am inclined to keep them at home till there is a change of teacher.\n\nAs I am not the only parent whose children are not improving I believe that there is dissatisfaction among us and a necessity of a change of teachers.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAllan Isaac\n\nLaura Isaac.\nOttawa, December 10, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a further communication from Allan Isaac, relative to the complaints made by him regarding the teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School. He states that she continues to show discrimination against his children, and that she has reported them as being absent from school when they were in attendance. He also states that the teacher sends his children home at three o'clock, while she keeps the other children in school until the regular closing period.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange at your earliest convenience to interview both Allan Isaac and the teacher with a view to straightening out any difficulty there may be between them. This man should understand that it is expected his children will attend school regularly and comply in all respects with the regular discipline. You should also inform the teacher that it is expected she will see that no discrimination is exercised by her against any of the pupils who attend. The Department desires that the frequent complaints of Allan Isaac will cease, and you should use every endeavour to smooth out any difficulties there may be between the teacher and himself.\n\nPlease inform the Department of the result of any action taken by you in the matter; also inform Allan Isaac that his communication has been received by the Department and that you have been instructed to deal with the matter of the complaints made by him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. Macdonald,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nOttawa, February 23, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, enclosing a communication which you received from Mrs. George, teacher of the Walpole Island No. 2 Indian Day School, regarding a pupil, George Isaac, son of Mr. and Mrs. Allan Isaac. The Department has noted the trouble this boy has occasioned and the difficulty the teacher has had with him and his father.\n\nIt is considered that action should be taken to prevent Allan Isaac interfering with the classroom work and discipline of the school. You may, therefore, in conjunction with the R.C.M.P., lay a charge against Allan Isaac, provided that, after due warning, he does not cease his interference with the work of the school and annoying the teacher. He should be made to understand that his son is to be amenable to the discipline of the school and is to conduct himself properly in the classroom. It is necessary that Mrs. George be protected in her duties as teacher and that all pupils comply with the discipline of the classroom.\n\nThe Department does not consider it advisable to have the boy placed in a reform school. We regret that at the present time there is no vacancy in any of our residential schools in which he could be placed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. H. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. H. MacKenzie,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\nSir,\n\nRe-Schools.\n\nFor your information I would beg to say that owing to the death of Mrs. Ethel George father there was no school at No.2 school from Tuesday Feb.24 to Monday Feb.27 being closed 4 days the 21,22,23,24.\n\nMrs. James Daly teacher in the Junior room at No. school, owing to illness was not able to teach Thursday or Friday the 23 and 24. This morning Dr. Rowland said it would be necessary for Mrs. Daly to remain in bed another two day and that she should not teach again this week. What are the regulations on the reserves in respect to day allowed teacher under pay for time lost for illness? There are qualified teacher available here now, I suggested to Mr. Daly that he secure one of these teacher to take charge of Mrs. Daly's room for a week. Mr. Daly did not care to do so and become responsible for the pay, and I felt that the Department would not care to pay two teacher for the same room.\n\nWhat would be the Department wish if Mrs. Daly sickness should be extended for a longer time or in the future if a similar case should arise.\n\nSection 103 sub-section (4) of the provincial school act said in part:- Every teacher shall be entitled to his salary notwithstanding his absence from duty on account of sickness for a period not exceeding four weeks in any one year of his employment if the sickness is certified to by a Physician.\n\nThe Secretary,\nYour obedient servant,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont.\nOttawa, March 4, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 27th ultimo, informing the Department that, owing to the death of her father, Mrs. George closed the No. 2 School, Walpole Island, for a period of four days; also that Mrs. James Daley, teacher of the junior room at the No. 1 School, would not be able to teach for a period of over a week owing to illness.\n\nWhen it is necessary for a teacher to be absent for a few days on account of illness or for family reasons, school will have to remain closed. Should it be necessary for a teacher to be absent for any lengthy period, the matter should immediately be reported to the Department, stating the probable length of such absence. When, if considered necessary, authority will be given to obtaining the services of a substitute. When a teacher is absent for a period of over five days on account of illness, a doctor's certificate should be forwarded, in order that salary can be paid.\n\nAs Mrs. Daley will, no doubt, be able to resume duties at an early date, it will not be necessary to obtain a substitute. If Mr. Daley cannot arrange to take a number of the junior pupils into his room, the junior room will have to remain closed until Mrs. Daley is able to resume duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Highfield, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWalpole Island,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir,\n\nRe-Eldridge McGahey,\n\nEldridge McGahey was returned to his home from the Shingwauk home, owing to a bad habit which he practiced on himself as well as other boys.\n\nSince his return home he has been attending No.2 school. The teacher Mrs. Ethel George would rather this boy did not come to school. Eldridge is now 15 years old. Eldridge is the fourth form. Mrs. George had thought that if he done well he might try his entrance June next. He does not seem to be trying very hard. Mrs. George feel that the school would be better without his attendance.\n\nWould the department think it advisable to compel his attendance at school, or allow him to discontinue?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian affairs.\nOttawa [signature].\n\nIndian agent.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata":
