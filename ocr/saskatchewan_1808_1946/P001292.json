dear old woods, where I have roamed\nAt eve of summer day,\nNo hidden dangers haunt your glades,\nIn the Green Isle, far away.\n\nThe clear Assiniboine winds free\nThrough many a fertile vale;\nThe antlered deer and graceful hind\nBound o'er the wooded dale;\nBut I miss the quiet rural scenes\u2014\nThe farm-house, thatched and grey,\nThat memory fondly pictures now\nOf the Green Isle, far away.\n\nThe Sabbath morn its holy calm\nBreathes o'er the prairie lands,\nAnd the answering heart hears Nature's psalm,\nAnd the wild woods clap their hands.\nBut I long to hear the church bell's sound\nTell to these wilds that day,\nWhen thousands meet to praise and pray\nIn the Green Isle far away.\n\nHere life lays hold of brighter things\nFor the fair years to be,\nBut the deathless Past and all her dreams,\nOld land, belong to thee!\nThe buried love, the buried hope\nOf youth's glad summer day,\nThat blend with unforgotten scenes\nOf the Green Isle, far away.\nAnd while we love this pleasant land\nAnd own it good and fair,\nOur hearts' first love goes backward\nAnd fondly lingers there\u2014\nBack to the dear home country,\nThen forward to that day\nWhen all shall meet together,\nFrom the Green Isle pass'd away.\n\nSONG.\n\n\"In the gloaming, Oh, my darling.\"\n\nOh! green-bosomed Isle, as the summer-day's gloaming,\nLies dreamy and dun on the prairie's wild breast\nThere my worn, wayward heart o'er the wild waves is roaming\nFar, far to the scenes that are dearest and best.\n\nAs by bluff and by woodland, by swamp and by meadow,\nThe gloom gathers round in its dim, mystic pall,\nThen my fancies come forth, spirit-children of shadow,\nSlow gliding from haunts where the lone night-birds call.\n\nWhen the wind, ardent lover, in songful caressing;\nSpeaks low to the grasses that bend to his breath,\nAnd the dew woos the rose with the balm of its blessing\nAnd steals it with love from the shadow of death.\n\nThen I seek the wild glen, when the new moon is beaming\nAll weirdly and wan, through a cloud's fleecy haze,\nTill I stand, young and free, in the land of my dreaming,\nClasping hands with the phantoms of happier days.\n\nAnd then, oh! mavourneen, in grey distance flying\nThe present, the real, grows dimmer, and dies,\nI see but the moonbeams, but hear the winds sighing,\nAnd bask, fancy bound, in the light of your eyes.\n\nMy own! though the years in the gloom of their sadness\nStand, frowning, 'twixt me and the light of my star,\nAnd memory can feel the wild might of love's madness;\nOr scoff as rude Time its first sweetness would mar.\nAgain, by the banks where Moyola is flowing,\nWe stray as the moonbeams smile sweet through the dell.\nUnheeded the moments, unmarked in their going,\nNor dreamed we of woe in the sound of \"farewell.\"\n\nIs it lost\u2014all the light of the fair morning vision?\nIs spirit to spirit unanswering, cold?\nNo, it never shall die, while in memory's Elysian\nIt lingers in beauty and brightness untold.\n\nLove is love, and though Fate-blasts our hope-vines may sever\nFrom the stay which their tendrils in fondness entwine,\nYet the past of our joy we must cherish forever\nAnd spirit meet spirit at memory's shrine.\n\nA MEMORY.\n\n\"Indulgent Memory wakes, and, lo!

still flaunted\nThrough my dreamings, love enchanted,\nFramed by busy Fancy haunted,\nBy glad visions of delight,\u2014\nMorns of light, and sunsets golden,\nDreams of legends, grand and olden,\nHopes for future years, withholden\nFrom our youthful, yearning sight.\n\nPast and gone! Ah! vain my sighing,\u2014\nHope's dead leaves are round me lying,\nBut their fragrances, undying,\nLike a hallowed incense rise;\nAnd I feel, with joy unspoken,\nThat the spirit love unbroken\nLeaves this Memory for a token\nOf its truth, that never dies.\n\nIn that land whose beauty vernal\nThrough the ages blooms eternal:\nThou, in bliss undreamed, supernal\nBasket in the glory-light\nWhere celestial joys inspire\nAll heaven's vast, unnumbered choir\nWith sweet songs that never tire,\nThrough the fadeless summer bright.\n\nHere, how sad this dreary roaming,\nThrough the shadows of earth's gloaming,\nWaiting for the longed-for coming\nOf the lingering Morning Star;\nBut swift time is onward fleeting\u2014\nBackward is the past retreating,\nNearer, nearer draws our meeting\nIn the future, dim and far.\nAFTER LIFE'S FEVER.\n\nObit June, 1882.\n\n\"And then, a flood of light, a seraph's hymn,\nAnd God's own smile, forever, and forever.\"\n\nOh! pale, calm face; eyes by the Death-kiss sealed,\nCold hands, upon the silent bosom folded;\nOh! soul, set free\u2014of all sin's sickness healed,\nBasking in light, from mortal eyes withholden,\n\nIn caelo quies.\n\nStill heart, that ached and throb'd with human passion,\nLocks, white with snow of many a winter past,\nTired body, weary after earth's poor fashion,\nSleep calmly till the waking trumpet blast\u2014\n\nIn caelo quies.\n\nAll over now\u2014the heart-ache and the burning\nOf thoughts, so trammelled by this \"mortal coil\"\nThe soul has cast behind its moans and yearning,\nThe hands are resting from the long life's toil\u2014\n\nIn caelo quies.\n\nI, mournful gazer, watching by the portal\nWhence thou, from death to life, hast entered in,\nWould fain catch one stray gleam of light immortal,\nTo tell me, ever drowning earth's wild din,\n\nIn caelo quies.\n\nI might not hear the angel welcome ringing,\nNor see the pearly portals open wide;\nWherein the ransomed band, the new song singing,\nIn white robes wander by life's river side,\n\nIn caelo quies.\n\n\"In caelo quies,\" while the storms are beating\nAlong earth's desert moorlands, wild and wide;\nWhile skies shall lower, and angry waves are meeting\nThy bark is moored\u2014thou art beyond the tide,\n\nIn caelo quies.\n\n\"In caelo quies\"\u2014Rest, pure, deep, eternal,\nPeace, in a perfect, blissful, endless calm;\nCharmed by the beatific joys supernal,\nLull'd by the melody of seraph's psalm,\nIn caelo quies.\n\nHere, we but dream it all\u2014the rest\u2014the glory,\nHere we but yearn for it in sob and pain;\nTill knees wax weary and till locks grow hoary,\nStill \"westward journeying,\" at length to gain,\nIn caelo quies.\n\nBut thou mayest sleep; thy toilsome warfare ended,\nThe long, rough life-path has been nobly trod,\nAnd with our lost ones, thou sweet songs hast blended,\nTo hail them found, beside the throne of God?\nIn caelo quies.\n\nLIGHT AT EVENTIDE.\n\nRound us in the stillness spreading,\nComes the night.\nMortal ears can't hear the treading\nOf her footsteps, soft and light.\n\nDusky veil that shades the valleys,\nBringing rest;\nShadowy glooms in greenwood alleys,\nTwilight dreamings, sweet and blest.\n\nAll the day-time cares are ended,\nAnd instead,\nNow by unseen bands attended,\nFar, in fancy, we are led.\n\nMisty forms of mystic seeming\nHover near;\nMemory's myriad tapers gleaming\nLight old scenes and make them clear\u2014\n\nMorn's vain hopes, and noon's stern sorrows,\nTears and cares;\nDays of toiling, and to-morrow's\nBringing less of wheat than tares.\nAnd the chequered, varied pages\nOf life's book\nSeem a sea whose calms and rages\nNow the tired heart cannot brook.\n\nEvening calm! ah, best and purest;\nTime of peace;\nSoothing balm, when hope is surest,\nTo bid all vain doubting cease.\n\nPointing on, when near the pleasant,\nRest awaits;\nWhen we leave this weary present\nAnd have gained the pearly gates.\n\nAnd as evening shadows, creeping,\nGather round\nDim eyes, worn so weak with weeping,\nLearn to smile as peace is found.\n\nIn the hope so full of cheering\nAnd delight\u2014\nHome, sweet home! our rest we're nearing!\nEvening time shall bring us light.\n\nLight of heaven!

Nature rebels, and Hope whispers, \"Arise.\"\nThere are regions unknown in the glad sunlight shining\u2014\nIn the paths of thy calling where happiness lies!\nOh, linger not weeping, in gloom and in sadness,\nThe days that are coming thy healing shall bring;\nAnd a love, brighter far, born of Truth and of Gladness,\nShall Phoenix-like up from the dead ashes spring!\nSUMMER LONGINGS.\n\nThere's a sound of woe in the forest lands,\nA weeping sigh in the wild wind's breath;\nThe woods are waving their naked hands\nAs they mourn fair Summer's death.\n\nThrough the leafless groves in the twilight hours\nCome gusts of music that sink and swell,\nAnd I cry; \"Come back, with your light and flowers,\nFair Queen of the year that I love so well!\"\n\nCome back to gladden the earth again,\nFor the woods are grim in their winter woe,\nThere's a dreary look on the lonely plain,\nAnd the hills and mountains are crowned with snow.\n\nAnd I fancy I hear from the distant hills\nA blast of wind sweeping o'er the sea,\nFrom the grey old hawthorns and foam-clad rills,\nTo tell a word of their woe to me.\n\nOh, Summer, so lovely, lost and dead,\nI miss your sunshine and balmy hours,\nAnd blissful calms, when the noontide shed\nIts dreamy radiance on fields and flowers!\n\nI miss your bird-songs that called me up\nTo welcome the blush of the golden morn,\nWhen the dew-pearls gleamed in the harebell's cup,\nAnd the lark soared high o'er the fields of corn.\n\nI miss the hush of the quiet eves,\nWhen the gloaming stole through the silent wood,\nAnd the low-toned zephyrs that stirred the leaves\nWere like elfin harps in the solitude.\n\nOh! Spring, return with your tender buds,\nAnd thousand splendours to deck the earth;\nCome back and reign in the grand old woods,\nAnd Winter shall fly at your welcome birth.\nCome back, and wide o'er the hills and vales,\nThe birds your welcome in glee shall sing;\nAnd their songs shall float on the gentle gales\nTill the earth in gladness and joy shall ring!\n\nMY TREASURES.\n\nYes, I have treasures\u2014not of gold or silver,\nYet they are hoarded with a miser's care;\nCherished and loved more tenderly and fondly\nThan purest gems, or jewels rich and rare.\n\nOnly a scrap of paper, old and faded,\nOnly some withered rose-leaves, sore and dry;\nAnd one long tress of hair, all bright and golden,\nDear relics of the happy days gone by.\n\nWell I remember that long, dreamy summer,\nWith all its sunshine and its cloudless days;\nThe pleasant rambles through the lanes at even,\nWhen earth was glowing in the sunset rays.\n\nAnd when the Autumn, in his mellow splendour,\nClothed field and forest in autumnal dyes,\n'Twas sweet to wander in the still, weird twilight,\nAnd watch the moon ascend the eastern skies.\n\nOhr! blissful hours! ah, vows so softly spoken,\nYe held a subtle witchery for me;\nI dreamed a heart of love and trust unbroken\nWas mine\u2014and mine alone\u2014through time to be.\n\nAlas! not mine that blossom that I cherished,\nAnd hoped would bloom through all the coming years;\nDeath's chill hand fell upon it, and it perished,\nAnd left with me but memory and tears!\nOh, woods! though Autumn left you bare and leafless;\nSpring has returned, and brought you life and mirth,\nBut the dead dream of youth's bright golden morning,\nOf love and beauty, can it wake to birth?\nIt cannot be; the times that have departed,\nThe days of gladness, can return no more;\nAnd I am lonely left and broken-hearted,\nLike some sad exile on a foreign shore\u2014\n\nWho, gazing backwards, through the years can picture\nA time when love and friendship were his own;\nThen turning to the present, lone and cheerless,\nFinds all his happiness in life is gone.\n\nSo, now, life's evening shadows, grim and dreary,\nIn deepest gloom, are round my pathway shed;\nThe beams of hope are growing dim and weary,\nAnd all that once was bright is cold and dead!\n\nOh, long-lost love! the gloomy years are fleeting,\nThrough life's dark dream they ever hurry fast;\nGreat waves upon the brink of Time they're meeting,\nAnd, mingling, rush to form the shadowy Past!\n\n---\n\nTHE GIFTED.\n\nSay, are the gifted born the sons of woe\u2014\nThe favoured ones on whom kind Heaven hath smiled,\nAnd dowered so richly with its priceless store;\nThe lords of earth, the monarchs of the soil\u2014\nMen who are bless'd with minds that angels have:\nAre these to bear the jibe of vulgar tongues,\nTo feel the taunts fell Envy madly hurls,\nOr brook the scorn gaunt Jealousy may show?\nTo them such things are but the angry blast\nThat mars the bosom of the placid lake,\nWhich smiles in dimpling ripples at its wrath!\nThey have their \"world of flower, and song, and gem,\"\nThe land of beauty where the poet dwells\u2014\nHis green Parnassus where the Muses reign:\nNot hidden nor unseen; oh! look abroad,\nAnd tell me if thine eye no beauty sees.\nThe solemn grandeur of the Autumn woods,\nBright-crimsoned with the dying Summer's blood;\nThe mountains in their hoary splendour drest,\nThe valleys with their fields of golden grain,\nThe glens deep hidden, where a thousand flowers\nIn modest beauty shun the noon-tide glare;\nThe wild-birds' song, the murmur of the streams\nThat through their heathery banks of fragrance glide\u2014\nAll these are theirs\u2014their solace, their delight;\nEach with its charm of mystic beauty fraught;\nThe gleams that pierce the clouds of common life,\nAnd let the light of Heaven's own sunshine in!\nThey have their dreams in twilight's shadowy hour,\nWhen they can strike their golden lyre, and feel\nThe holy joy the poet calls his own.\nAnd the soft breeze that sings among the boughs\nIn numbers like the famed Zolian harp\nSeems blending with its tones, till earthly cares\nMelt, as beneath the syren's spell, and die!\n\nThus lightly o'er the waves his bark goes on,\nHope for a beacon shining bright above.\nWhile firmly at the helm stands fair Content\nTo steer him safely till he reach the shore.\nAnd then, when Death's grim portals open wide,\nAnd he has reached the Land he dreamed and sung;\nOh! bliss to wander o'er the streets of gold,\nHis harp-notes mingling with the choirs of Heaven!\nHis hopes all realized, \"faith lost in sight\"\u2014\nHis life a poem which God Himself hath read!\n\nMORNING.\n\nThe gladsome Morning looked across the hills,\nClad in his richly tinted robes; the opal dawn,\nFaint blushing in the East, grew clear and brighter,\nTill the resplendent sunrise decked the sky.\nIt shone upon the woods\u2014the birds awoke\nTo chant their welcome to the god of day:\nIt shone upon the meadows, and the flowers\nOped their eyes, where the bright dew-tears glistened\nAs they had wept thro' the long hours of night;\nheedless of how the star-beams smiled and played;\nAnd the pale, tender moon, with pitying ray,\nLooked down upon their lowly, drooping heads,\nNow lifted gladly to the morning light,\nTill the warm sunshine kissed their tears away.\nAnd clouds of fragrance from their beds arose,\nThat amorous zephyrs, as they wandered by,\nWafted, like sweetest incense, to the sky!\nIt shone upon the rivers, as they flowed\nThrough fertile meadow-lands, so rich in loveliness;\nSweet streams, that, rippling on in restful song,\nTook up a tone more joyous in that hour;\nAnd whispering leaves, and birds that, far and near,\nFrom grove and hedgerow, warbling clear and sweet\nIn blending music, trembled in the air\u2014\nLike matin hymns, that on Creation's wings\nWere upwards borne to the Creator's Throne!\n\nANOTHER YEAR.\n\nAnother year has well nigh passed,\nWith all its smiles and tears,\nAnd joys and sorrows that are cast\nIn Time's great stream, whose waters vast\nRoll to the ocean of the Past,\nBearing our hopes and fears,\nWhere 'neath its waves they mingle fast\nWith all our vanished years.\n\nAnother year! a span of Time,\nThat tells of lifework done;\nA book, some pages dark with crime\u2014\nSome grand, and holy, and sublime;\nA trumpet, telling every clime\nOf battles lost and won;\nA knell of woe\u2014a joy-bell's chime,\nHope dead, and bliss begun!\n\nAnother year! In Spring's sweet hours\nWhat blissful thoughts we knew!\nWhat hopes, that came with opening flowers,\nWhat visions, nurt in spring-wreathed bowers,\nWhen Fancy lent her magic powers\nTo trace in brilliant hue\nCastles of air, and dream-built towers\nToo soon to fade from view!\n\nAnother year! and I can trace\nFootprints o'er Summer's way,\nBut turn to find a vacant place,\nWhere once I met a cherished face,\nAnd well-loved form of youth and grace,\nNow pass'd from earth away\u2014\nThis year the goal of one bright race,\nThe close of one fair day.\n\nAutumn is dead. The year is old,\nThe dull November days are chill;\nThe bare woods dreary to behold;\nThe northern blast blows keen and cold,\nFar sighing over waste and wold,\nO'er wintry vale and hill;\nAnd in its moan are requiems told\nFor true hearts dead and still!\n\nSo must it be. Each passing year\nStill bears some joy away;\nSome darling treasure, held too dear,\nIn trembling bliss, in hope and fear,\nWhich we would fancy safe and near,\nDeparts, and seems to say\u2014\n\"We have no lasting city here,\nEarth's life is but a day!\"\n\nBut Christmas, coming round again,\nShall bring his wonted cheer;\nAnd Pleasure, in his jovial train,\nWith rosy mirth and glee shall reign,\nTo chase these thoughts of gloom and pain\nThat haunt the dying year;\nAnd grief-parched lips the cup shall drain\nOf \"Peace and good-will here!\"\nWITH A SHAMROCK.\n\nHere, in these triple leaves, oh! read from me,\nWhat I, for thee, have dreamed their mystic spell,\nFaith, Hope and Love, joined hand in hand, I see,\nAnd this the message that they seem to tell:\n\nLove, for the present, and the time to be,\nFaith, that its might and truth can never die;\nHope, that beyond the future clouds and mystery\nPoints to a smiling scene, and cloudless sky.\n\n\"WAITING FOR THE MAY,\"\n\n\"Ah! my heart is weary waiting, waiting for the May!\"\nOld thoughts come back from the old time,\nWhere, at even, the sunset light\nGilds wood and world, ere the glory dies,\nAnd darkness gathers along the skies\nAnd the world is left in night.\n\nOld songs float round in the gloaming,\nSweet fragments that come and go;\nThey are echoes, I know, from the olden times,\nHoly, as music vesper chimes,\nIn the days of \"Long Ago!\"\n\nAnd faces shine in the firelight;\nAnd laughter rings through the rooms;\nAnd memories of bygone springtime eyes\nCome back to my lone heart that aches and grieves\nIn the chill of life's winter glooms,\n\nThen, the May of love that I longed-for\nWas hid in the future haze;\nI dreamed it a land of joy unknown,\nWhere bliss and beauty would be my own\nThrough the length of life's fair days.\n\nSo in hope for the May I waited\nAs gay as the joyous hours\nThat sped so fast, on their lightsome wings,\nThro' flowers, and sunlight, and glorious things\nThat lived in youth's fairy bowers;\n\nBut the hopes I nursed in that springtime\u2014\nAh! me, but those times were bright!\nAre withered now, and no fruit I see,\nThough the blossoms were fair on every tree\nIn the glow of their promise-light!\n\nYet, when by the grave where I buried\nThose hopes, I stand and weep,\nI hear Faith say, as the storm-winds blow,\u2014\n\"If in patience, and sorrow, and tears ye sow,\nThe guerdon of joy ye shall reap!\"\n\nA W A K E N E D.\n\nThe glories of fair April's pride\nAre smiling round on every hand,\nAnd springtide beauties, far and wide,\nAs with a garment clothe the land.\n\nIn shady nooks, in lonely glades,\nIn forest alleys wild flowers spring,\nIn budding stalks, in twilight shades,\nIn lonely woods the birdies sing.\n\nThe violet's bloom on many a bank\nIs mirror'd in the waters sheen;\nAnd 'mongst the grasses long and rank\nThe yellow primrose flower is seen.\n\nIn yon dim wood the throstle sings\nAmong boughs that clasp hands overhead,\nAnd through the air his glad song rings,\nAs in that April long since dead.\n\nThe brook has still the same soft flow,\nWhose murmur filled the evening air\nIn those old days of long ago,\nThough I may never wander there.\nI shut my eyes, and see no more\nThe hurrying throng of city ways,\nAnd call to life that dream of yore,\nAnd feel the thrall of bygone days.\n\nThe passion'd yearning for the time,\nThe glorious time that was to be,\nThe restless young heart's dreams sublime,\nOf all the future held for me.\n\nAh!

bereft of all your wiles\nDead dream whose sweetness all is o'er,\nThe memories of your tears or smiles\nCan touch my wakened heart no more.\n\nI lay you in your grave to-night\nAnd seal the stone without a sigh,\nRejoicing that your gloom and blight\nNo more can cloud my brightening sky.\n\"ONLY.\"\n\nOnly relics, yet precious and pure\nAre the dreams of the days of old,\nThough they tell of wounds that no charm can cure\nAnd of bright hopes, dead and cold.\n\nOnly visions of forest ways,\nOnly thoughts of happier days,\nOnly the glow of Life's sunrise haze\nWhen the morning sun was shining.\n\nOnly, it may be, a lock of hair,\nOr a flower sere and dry;\nOnly a pictured face, how fair\nIn the light of the times gone by!\nOnly a sigh for what may not be,\nOnly a yearning wish to see\nThe light beyond the mystery\nThat for weary souls is shining.\n\nOnly thoughts of the gladsome time\nWhen the world of youth was bright;\nOnly memories of joys sublime\u2014\nThe gleams of youth's fairy light,\nOnly sweet flashes that come and go,\nOnly the thrall that sets heart aglow,\nOnly the spells we were wont to know\nWhen Fancy's rays were shining.\n\nOnly voices we hear no more,\nBut the echoes haunt our ears;\nOnly dreams that are past and o'er\nThat we mourn through the lonely years\nOnly to find that the sunny gleam\nOf earth's love fades like a passing dream,\nOnly to wait for that deathless beam\nThat \"beyond the tide\" is shining.\n\nOnly the clasp of a parting hand\nOn the silent rivers' shore,\nAs the dear one sails for the unseen Land\nAnd we see his face no more,\u2014\nOnly to gaze o'er the waters drear,\nOnly to wait till the call we hear,\n\"Come over now, for rest is near\nWhere the true life light is shining.\"\n\nOnly the burden all must bear,\nOnly earth's weight of woe;\nOnly to learn from each dreary care\nThe patience the pure must know.\nOnly this:\u2014but what welcomes wait\nTo hail us home at the pearly gate;\nOnly to toil until night is late\nAnd awake where the Morn is shining.\n\nFIRST PSALM.\n\nHow blessed are they who turn their steps\nFrom paths the wicked choose,\nWho stand not in the sinners' ways,\nAnd scorers' seats refuse.\n\nWho take their solace and delight\nIn meditation pure\u2014\nThe law of God\u2014its depth and height,\nIts wisdom, might, and power.\n\nThey, like the trees on verdant banks\nWhereby sweet rivers flow,\nShall bring forth fruit, and fadeless leaves,\nAnd prosperously grow.\n\nBut such is not the sinners' end\u2014\nLike the light chaff are they,\nWhich when the softest winds arise,\nAre quickly swept away.\n\nThey shall not in the judgment stand,\nNor sinners, scorning grace\nBe in the congregation found\nWhere righteous men find place.\n\nThe Lord himself the righteous knows\u2014\nHe marks them from their birth,\nBut godless ways of sinful men\nShall perish from the earth.\n\nHER NAME.\n\nThe purple heather on the brae\nWas all abloom; by glen and wold\nThe wild birds sang the live-long day,\nThe corn-fields ripened into gold.\n\nThe garden blooms were wonderous fair;\nRed roses blushed in regal glow;\nCarnations scented all the air,\nPure was the lilies' virgin snow.\n\nBut fairer than the garden flowers,\nOr all the summer blooms, I ween\nWas she, whose smiles beguiled the hours\u2014\nWas she, whose presence charmed the scene!\n\nOh!

Never in mercy spared the blow\nOf the untold memory that, and weeks that passed\nWith the dear heart\u2014felt not then my woe.\n\nStill, you have never loved, and cannot know\nHow dear and hopeless youth itself may seem:\nThe long, blank lovesless years to wander through,\nWith painful, slow memory of a bygone dream.\n\nBut snow falls now; we may laugh or weep.\nStill Time by stealthy gliding steals away:\nAnd winter shows again its white and deep.\nAnd cheer again they welcomed Christmas day.\n\nI watched them with sad eyes that knew no smile,\nAnd a cold mind from which all hope had flown.\nA deeper heart that nothing could beguile.\nBack to the gladness that it once had known.\n\nThe dull December twilight grey and cold,\nFell weird and grim upon the lonely moor;\nThe wild wind raged o'er wintry waste and wild;\nAnd in the storm a stranger sought our door.\n\nHe asked a shelter from the bitter night.\nMy father's brown cheek blanched to hear that tone.\nHe led him forward to the rick-log's light.\nA lost\u2014'tis mourned, but now a new-found son!\n\nBut sweetest welcome on the wanderer fell!\nThe last of our long race\u2014returning home:\nHome to the long-forgotten hearts that loved him well.\nNo more an exile, by strange shores to roam.\n\n\"Bide not here,\" he said, \"until you know\nI have a friend who claims his welcome now,\nFor, but for him, the depth of Alpine snow\nHad been my grave, and you had lost your son.\"\n\nThen wherefore wait?\" my mother gently said,\n\"Let him come hither till I bless his name!\"\nAnd Roderick turned; and forth the stranger led\nAnd once again, I looked on Hector Graem.\n\nNow welcome-glow lit up the old man's eye,\nSurprise or anger seemed to hold him dumb,\nMy mother clasped his hand with sob and sigh,\nBut to full hearts the fewest words will come.\n\nThen Hector kissed her hand with courtly grace;\nBowed lowly to my father, half in scorn,\n\"Old ills\" he said \"are hardest to erase.\nFrom hearts where gratitude was never born.\"\n\nBut as he spoke the glistening tear-drops fell\nFrom those old eyes, that seldom tear drops knew,\n\"You here,\" he said \"love breaks hate's hateful spell,\nAnd gratitude comes forth to yield her due!\"\n\nLet feuds and errors perish with the Past,\u2014\n'Tis thus I lay them in a deep dug-grave!\"\nAnd, beckoning me beside him, there, at last,\nHis blessing, once refused, he fondly gave!\n\nAh! life is very fair, and love is sweet!\nThe dark sky cleared, the sun shone out again,\nEarth seemed a heaven, with perfect bliss replete,\nAnd new-born gladness healed the sting of pain.\n\nAnd standing by the window hand in hand,\nHearing the storm howl o'er the wastes of snow,\nWe were the happiest of the happy band\nThat merry Christmas\u2014fifty years ago!\"\n\nBEGINNINGS.\n\nAt dawn sweet flushes softly creep\nAlong the brightening sky,\nPale watchers whom lone vigils keep\nPerceive the sign, and cry,\nThe night is gone, the bright day comes,\nAnd gladsome light the East illumes!\nBright blossoms on the branches burst,\nThen Autumn fruits grow there;\nSo dreams that sickly hope had nurt\nGrown real, make life fair.\nAnd dreams we prize as holy things\nThat haunt our path on mystic wings.\n\nAnd so, across life's weary road,\nMade dark by many a woe,\nWe hear the tender words of God,\n\"Come, follow where I go!\"\nAnd listening to that gentle voice\nIs fixed the best and earliest choice.\n\nFirst, we must pray, and watch, and wait,\nAnd bear the daily cross,\nAnd, till we reach the Master's gate,\nCount earthly gain as lost,\nThen hear, \"good servant, nobly done,\"\nBy patience hath the crown been won.\n\nIN REPLY TO \"ALONE.\"\n\nIt is the joyous time of June,\nAnd Nature glads the smiling land.\nArrayed in garments gay and green\nBestowed by nature's lavish hand.\nOh! soft the lullaby of streams\u2014\n'Neath shadow of o'er arching trees,\nWhen all sweet, summer music seems\nTo float around us on the breeze.\nIt greets us in the greenwood glades\u2014\nBy forest aisles and alleys lone,\nWhere, wandering in the twilight shades\nThe poet calls the hour his own.\nPerchance he dreams some minstrel hand,\nWakes woodland harps to heavenly song,\nWhile spirits from the golden land\nOn white wings bear the notes along.\n\nBut to thine eyes the world is grim,\nAnd life is dark through falling tears;\nHath Hope's soft ray grown dull and dim,\nAnd paled the brightness of your years?\nI know your woe\u2014for I have knelt\nBeside the new-made, grassy mound\u2014\nThe anguish of bereavement felt\nAnd moaned beneath the piercing wound.\n\nThrough the soft azur veil of o'er\nThe stars look down with watching eyes,\nBeacons to life our souls to heaven\nAnd tell of love beyond the skies\nTo tell, tho' earth is bright and fair,\nStill Heaven must be our lasting home;\nA land untouched by sin and care\nWhere pain and parting never come.\n\nNot far away; scarce out of sight,\nA shadowy veil, a misty cloud,\nIs roll'd between us and the light,\nFrom mortal eyes the bliss to shroud.\n\nOh, thou whose poet-mind can feel\nThe magic spell of beauty's powers\nLet these, His \"meager works,\" reveal\nThat fairer life that shall be ours,\nWhere we shall find in fadeless bloom\nThe love Time's withering blast had slain,\nRestored from death and from the tomb\nTo life, immortal life again.\nAnd while we weep for earth-joys fled,\nOr sigh to feel ourselves \"alone,\"\nWhile fragrant memories of the dead,\nLike perfumes round our path are strewn;\nLet us not think them wholly lost\u2014\nThese flowers that glad the wondering vision,\nSlept 'neath the winter storm and frost\nThen sprung to beauty half Elysian.\nFair blossoms deck the orchard bough\nThe promise-fruit of harvest hours;\nNought have we but that promise now,\nYet faith already shows it ours.\nOh! sweet the light around our tombs,\nWhere promise-buds in faith are sown;\nFaith's eye discerns eternal blooms,\nIn stature of God's fullness blown.\nStill ours\u2014the true and tender heart,\u2014\nThe form that trod these paths awhile;\nWe said \"good-night\" content to part.\nUntil the morning light shall shine.\nOh! blessed hope! Oh! promise sweet!\nThe harvest of the Lord is sure;\nHis Hand shall give the guerdon meet\nTo all that to the end endure!", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06",
