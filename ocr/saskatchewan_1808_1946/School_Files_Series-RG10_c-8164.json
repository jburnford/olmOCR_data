D. McLean Esq.,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing herewith an account of the Indian schools of Huron, Brant, and Pelee. Under separate headings I have given the schools visited, as far as possible, a brief account of what I have seen and found them to be doing. I am glad to note that during my visits to these schools, being made at the commencement of the school term, I found that all children had returned from their studies after the long vacation. I felt it would be useless to do more than tell you that the teachers had the children properly classified.\n\nIn the report sent in, you will notice that the Red Ground school was omitted, and the reason is this: Since last school term, the school was closed due to the absence of the teacher and the teacher, in consequence, is obliged to help his children in one of the homes of the Indians.\nall and was none of the necessary\narticles in school work such as maps,\nblackboards, lesson cards etc., so that it\nis impossible for the teacher to do any\nkind of work. There were only five child\npresent the day I inspected the school and\ntwo of these were too young, but as I\nunderstand an objection is made by the\nIndians to going to the chief's house, and\nI learn from the teacher Miss Schultzy\nthat the chief's wife is not easy to get\nin with. I fear no progress can possibly\nbe made until the children have proper\nschool accommodation.\n\nI should recommend therefore\nthat the school house be finished as soon\nas possible and supplied with the necessary\nteaching outfit.\n\nI should like the Department to\nstate how often it desires me to visit the\nschools\u2014whether or not I have a free\nhand in the appointment of teachers\nshould any of the present teachers be\nfound incompetent, or leave their schools\nwhether or not I am to submit reports\non school matters, or my application for\nnew teachers.\nThe Department would state definitely what duties it would greatly help me in the discharge of my office.\n\nI should like a supply of Stationery, large and small, and whatever else may be needed for my work.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Mary Isaacs, Teacher of the Eel Ground Indian School, Eel Ground, Northumberland Co., I may say, that she took charge of this school on the Sixth day of January last. As to her experience she has been teaching Fourteen years, and holds an Elementary Diploma from Carleton Convent, of the Province of Quebec. She has taught English, French and Micmac, also Music, Singing and Knitting. She was Thirty-one years of age on the Twenty-second day of February last.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 7th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nIn view of the fact that Miss Isaacs, who has been in charge of the Eel Ground School since January last, has recently married it will be necessary to secure the services of a new teacher for this school to take charge, if possible, after the Christmas holidays. The Department desires to obtain a fully qualified teacher and will be prepared to pay a reasonable salary for such. I have to ask you, therefore, to make inquiries with a view to securing a teacher and any applications that you receive should be forwarded to the Department for its consideration. Great care should be taken in the selection of a teacher for this and other Indian schools if the results hoped for by the Department are to be achieved! On no account should any appointment be made by you until the consent of the Department is obtained. The Superintendent of Schools for New Brunswick is also being communicated with in connection with this matter.\n\nMiss Isaacs should be notified that her services will not be required after the end of this quarter, but in the event of the Department not being able to secure a teacher it would be glad if she would consent to take charge of this school for a time next term. Be good enough to acknowledge the receipt of this letter at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. A.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your report on the Bel Ground School, and in reference thereto I beg to say that the Department has decided to dispense with the services of Miss Isaacs at the end of this quarter and she will be so advised through the Indian Superintendent.\n\nThe Department desires to obtain for this school the services of a qualified teacher and I should be glad if you would make inquiries with a view to securing such. Mr. Irving has been asked to make similar inquiries. Any applications received by you should be submitted to the Department for its consideration.\n\nI may also add that the new out-houses have been provided at this school and the account for the same has been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev.

In fact, they seem to be opposed to the wishes of the Indians.\n\nI shall wait for a few days longer in the hope of hearing from Mr. Wapfley and if I hear still let you know what he says in the matter.

You will remember that I informed you that Miss Mary Isaacs the present Teacher, had resigned and that Miss Francis Schulte who was in charge of the School previous to Miss Isaacs appointment, was endeavouring to again secure the appointment as Teacher of that School. I have received a petition from the Chief and 23 members of the Band, asking that Miss Maggie Isaacs, sister of the present teacher, Miss Mary Isaacs, be engaged. They do not want Miss Schulte and when I decided to make a change some time ago, and had Miss Schulte displaced by Miss Isaacs, I did so in the interest of the Indian education among the members of the band. You promised me to write Father Duffy in reference to the matter and I would like for you to advise me under the circumstances as to what you would recommend being done.\n\nThanking you in advance, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Signed) R.

We have engaged Miss Maggie Isaac to take the school after it goes as the present teacher has tendered her resignation to close on the 30th June. Isaac is a sister to the one that is teaching now and a second class licensed teacher so it will be to the interest of the band that Miss Shultz's services be dispensed with for we don't want her.

Some short time after the receipt of her resignation I interviewed Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, and informed him of the above resignation and also told him that I had received a petition from some of the members of the Band, asking that Miss Maggie Isaacs, a sister of the present Teacher, who holds a Diploma or similar qualification to that of the present Teacher, be engaged to take the school next term. Miss Schulz who was Teacher of this school previous to Miss Isaacs engagement, has I understand been endeavouring to again get the appointment as Teacher, although she has made no direct application to me, but, you will notice by the petition and a letter from the Chief, which are both herewith enclosed, that some of the members of the Band are not in favour of giving the School to her. When I spoke to Father Ryan, he promised that he would write Father Duffy the Clergyman in charge of the reservation, and get his opinion upon the matter. Not hearing from Father Ryan I wrote him on the 27th., of November last, a copy of which letter I herewith enclose, and I did on the 7th., of December Instant, receive from Father Ryan a reply to my letter, which is also\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may also state that when Miss Isaacs was given the Bel Ground School, in preference to Miss Schultz, it was done as I considered in the interest and advancement of education among the Indian people, and at their request, as they stated if the latter Teacher was retained, they would not send their children to School.\n\nI am making enquiries with a view to securing a Teacher for next term, and any application that I receive, shall be forwarded to the Department for its consideration, as requested by your letter,\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 15th, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant with enclosures in reference to the appointment of a teacher for the Mel Ground School, and reporting that you have an application from Miss Maggie Isaacs for the position, which is approved by a number of the Indians on the reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Miss Isaacs should make application to the Department for the position, stating her age, experience, etc., and forward her certificates and testimonials, which will be returned to her.\n\nIn the case of any other applications care should be taken to state their ages, qualifications and experience, if any, and forward copies of testimonials.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nsecretary.\n\nR.

I may say I have had some talks and some correspondence with Mr. Irving about a teacher for his school, but as much as I have heard and know, as well as others, we try to have his school, a home teacher restored to its position. Mr. Smith taught at El Dorado following at the Johnson's (or) Bishop's School. While Mr. Irving's name is only mentioned in our catalogue, no one else has heard of him. If you should be interested, I would be glad to put him down in his case.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Then, while Mr. Duff wrote to me, Mr. Duffy wrote to the Agent strongly recommending the reinstatement of Mr. Duff. Placing the Agent in a position to allocate positions\u2014in so much as he could\u2014Mr. Duff did not object to offer Mr. Duff any influence he could give to write to Mr. Duff about the matter. This I did.\n\nPersonally, my belief is to stick in firmly both the Indians and to do whatever is at all possible to do to gain their good will. For I feel that such a big success as here in our Indian School will be due to their active cooperation\u2014at the same time also think they may stand to be unreasonable in their demands, but that in the judgment of those competent to judge, and who also have been concerned\nAllam demands a fair and just settlement of the Indian children. He has charged while in the service of the government.\n\nIn this spirit, I wrote to Mr. Smith, Secretary of the Department, saying once more that it was going to be a hard matter to maintain her. Mr. Smith replied that the Indian Agent had lately taken hold of the Indian Affairs in a good style and it was impossible for him to have competent Indians in his charge. He said he would try to make the best of it.\n\nI am obliged to agree with the Secretary's opinion. I cannot imagine that any possibility exists for me to do anything to provide you assistance or cooperation in helping to make the best of it.

Others, among her friends, who were teaching in the chief's house at a considerable distance from the chief of the Assiniboins, and probably owing to these two facts, her attendance was very small. They were but 5 children present.\n\nShe had no accommodation\u2014no means to blackboards\u2014in fact, her room was not fitted out. She stated in the report of his school which I sent to the Inspector, that she said if any dormitory were set up that would change conditions she would willingly do better.\n\nWhen the new school was built a new teacher was placed by the missionary. This teacher came from the Red River settlement. He had been educated at the Red River College. His wife was also educated at the Red River College. He was a man of good character and was very kind to me. He was very attentive to my family.\n\nStill, Miss Schulz was a very good and kind-hearted woman.\nmodest change in conditions.\n\nMiss Isaac's sister, I am informed by Mr. Irving, is an applicant for the position vacated by her married sister, and a letter has been signed by the Indians that has sent him in favor of appointing her as teacher. Personally, I think nothing of the young lady, she may be a very efficient teacher, but there is doubt that she will be able to do some future time start a school of domestic economy for the Indians or Dr. Brantock would bring charges against her for incompetent to instruct the children under her care. The paid teacher?\n\nThe young lady graduates of the normal school, as a rule, are generally too weak in character to teach such a class, for they are usually obliged to do more than half of their work at home, whereas Indian girls are not equally capable for such work owing to lack of home training.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss Isaac's sister, which I have had the honor of a short time\nI wrote a day or two ago to the \nHon.

Geraghty. The Department would like to have any testimonials that Miss Geraghty has in her possession, and Mr. Irvin, the Indian Superintendent, has been asked to forward certificates and testimonials from Miss Isaacs. Although Miss Schultz was in charge of this school for sometime the Department has no official report of inspection on record. It would, therefore, like to have full information with reference to her age, certificates, etc., and copies of her testimonials also.\n\nThe Department is desirous of obtaining the services of the best teacher possible for this school and when all the information asked for in reference to these applications is laid before it a decision will be arrived at. In the meantime it is presumed that the present teacher, Miss Mary Isaacs, will remain in charge till her successor is appointed.

I have again written them since the receipt of the above letter to send me their testimonials and told them that their applications would not be dealt with until the testimonials were received. I also wrote Miss Schultz for any certificates which she held and I stated to you in my previous letter, that Miss Muzeroll held a third class License of the Province of New Brunswick. The respective ages of the different applicants have been sent you. I received no application from Miss Geraghty. The Reverend Father John J. Ryan, wrote me stating that he had received an application from this young lady, and that he was sending me the same, but he did not enclose it, and I wrote him to that effect. I may say, that when I received your letter of the 7th., of December, asking me to make enquiries, with a view of securing a Teacher, I immediately telephoned the \"Advocate\" a Newspaper printed and published in Newcastle, in the County of Northumberland, and asked them to insert a local that a Teacher was wanted to take charge of the \"Kel Ground\" School, after the Christmas Holidays; Salary $200.00 per year. I did this, in order to expedite matters, as I did not know to whom to make enquiries of, nor did I know any teachers in that locality to whom\nI could enquire or write. I regret exceedingly, that you think I took upon myself too much authority in this matter, but I can assure you, that in doing as I did, I acted in good faith, thinking that I was only doing my duty, and that your letter of that date, enquired the same of me. Miss Mary Isaacs the Teacher who has been in charge of the school last term, said some time ago, she was willing to continue in charge until another teacher was appointed, and I have already written you, to that effect. You might kindly advise me as to whether or not I will secure her services for such time as an appointment is made.

He states, that the members of the Band will not send their children to school, other than to Miss Maggie Isaacs, and that they will not allow any other Teacher to teach there, as it is the wish of the band that Miss Maggie Isaacs be employed. I promised to communicate the above facts to you for your consideration.

The Department considers that it would be unwise to re-appoint Miss Schultz in the face of the opposition of the Indians, and, as there are several other applicants to choose from, it has decided to accept the services of Miss Lydia E.

Geraghty, will not be available until after next summer holidays, only seven of them have to be considered. The names of the applicants are as follows:\n\n| Name                  | Certificate                        |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------|\n| Miss Margaret Isaacs  | Elementary English Diploma (Quebec)|\n| Miss Frances Schultz  | No certificate.                    |\n| Miss Laura C.

Bryenton  | Second Class.                      |\n\nTwo petitions have been received from the Indians, one signed by the Chief and 26 members of the Band asking for the appointment of Miss Isaac; and the other signed by 13 Indians and 22 others, presumably whites, including the Parish Priest, asking for the reinstatement of Miss Schultz.\n\nOther things being equal it would appear politic to try to please the Indians in making this appointment; hence I think we should consider only the applications of Miss Isaac and Miss Schultz.\n\nMiss Schultz previously taught this school for nearly three years and was dismissed by Mr. Superintendent Irving.\nIrving without the authority of the Department, acting, as he considered, in the best interests of the Indians. Miss Schultz worked under a great disadvantage while at this school. The school was held in an Indian's house not centrally located; now they have a new school with modern equipment. But the fact remains that she holds no certificate and her success is at best problematical.\n\nOn the other hand Miss Isaac, who has the support of the larger number of Indians, has been in charge of the Maria school for 4\u00bd years. Her record there has been good and she would in all probability be still in charge of that school had it not been for the unfortunate friction which arose between Rev. J. D. Morin, our Agent, and herself. Miss Isaac holds an Elementary Diploma (Quebec) and understands the Micmac language. I quote from Mr. School Inspector Marquis' last report on her work at Maria as follows:\n\n\"In short, I am strongly convinced that the teacher, Miss Margaret Isaac, whose mother tongue is Micmac but who speaks English and French equally well, performs the task that is entrusted to her with confidence and devotion and the pupils of this school receive careful education and instruction.\"\n\nI am strongly of opinion that the best interests of the Indians would be served by the appointment of Miss Isaac. One essential to success is their good-will, and evidently the Chief and his followers would be antagonized were anyone else appointed.\n\nOf late the Department has been paying a great deal of attention to the betterment of day school conditions in New Brunswick and with an appreciable measure of success. Therefore the appointment of a new teacher at this juncture is one of paramount importance. While the Department is always glad to have the recommendations of members of Parliament in connection with these appointments and, other things\nthings being equal, to appoint their nominees, the interests of the school should receive the first consideration.\n\nIn the present instance, in view of the strongly expressed wish of the Chief and Councillors, who are the leaders of their people and whose influence is essential to harmonious and effective work, for the appointment of Miss Isaac, I am afraid that any other course on the part of the Department would nullify any efforts to improve conditions on this reserve, which are not at present what they ought to be.\n\nOf course it would be pleasing to have Mr. Loggie's concurrence in Miss Isaac's appointment, and when the facts are laid before him I have no doubt that he will appreciate the desire for improvement which animates the Department, and be willing to aid in carrying out this policy by agreeing to the appointment of a qualified teacher who has the confidence of the Indians.\n165 Mo.

Irving, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to state, that I visited the Indian school at Bel Ground last week, and I find that the children are getting along nicely and that Miss Maggie Isaacs is taking considerable interest in teaching them, knitting, sewing, fancy work etc., Last month she gave them a treat of candy and fruit at her own expense, and she informed me that she considered it a good means of encouraging the children to attend School. She thought that if a small expenditure of $20.00 or therabouts was allowed for Christmas for gifts and a treat for them at the end of the term, that it would materially increase the attendance of the children at school, thus having a tendency to have them take more interest in school attendance. I would recommend that the small expenditure of say $20.00 be allowed for this purpose and I would also recommend that Miss Isaacs be allowed an increase of $50.00 per year in her salary, which would give her the same salary as Miss Geraghty, Teacher of Burnt Church Indian School. I think that all Teachers of the Indian Reserves should be allowed the same salary, as by allowing one more than the other, it has a tendency to cause dissatisfaction and jealousy.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\n\nDept.

This is considered a sufficiently large amount to make a liberal distribution.\n\nIn reference to the increase in salary I beg to say that the Department is prepared to carry out your recommendation and give Miss Isaacs $50.00 from the first of the current quarter. This is given as a reward for merit and not for the purpose of raising her salary to put her on the same footing as Miss Geraghty. The Department cannot agree with you that all teachers should be allowed the same salary.

When in conversation with her some few days ago, she informed me that she intended getting the Indian women together and was going to lecture to them on cooking and dressmaking etc., in fact she has been assisting them all along in similar work.

Ward, who was the caretaker at the time the teacher complains of, had resigned and that the Chief and Councillors had appointed John Ginnish to succeed him. The Chief was informed that, if Mr. Agent Sheridan approved of him as caretaker, he might be appointed. It is, therefore, hoped that there will be no further cause of complaint on the part of the teacher regarding the duties of the caretaker.\n\nThe truant officer for this school is Thomas Sahipass, and it is noted from the return forwarded by Miss Schults that there was an enrolment of twenty-six pupils, with an average attendance of twenty-one, which is considered satisfactory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. F. C.

This same teacher was dismissed from the school some time ago through lack of advancement; the same thing is in evidence again, as soon as the Band can learn she was placed there through the influence of Father Dixon & Father Ryan. I am asking the department to notify Rev. Fr. J. Ryan to have Miss Shultz dismissed and replaced by Miss Mary Agnes Metatawabin, Indian girl teacher from Penney Island, B.C., who had the Chief and officers of the reserve been notified of her reappointment they would have objected to it.\n\nKindly let me hear from you early.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief\n\nEl Ground Reserve\nOttawa.

I might add, however, that the appointment of an Indian girl cannot be considered, and, if in your opinion, the services of Miss Schultz should be dispensed with at the end of the present school year, efforts should be made to obtain the services of a white teacher who would be suitable for this school.\n\nAfter your next inspection you should report as to the work being done by Miss Schultz and whether you consider that her services should be dispensed with.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

She was obliged to close the school for the day, but able under treatment to reopen school the following day.\n\nI would suggest that the Dept. instruct their Agent to proceed to this Ind. school, and in his presence, have the lad ask pardon of teacher & school for his conduct, at the same time have the teacher administer a good slapping on each hand.

She also states the Chief is threatening her with dismissal. I enclose hereewith copy of a letter which we are today writing to Chief Dan Paul.\n\nRegarding Miss Isaacs, I am writing you at this time with a view to obtaining your opinion as to the desirability of dispensing with her services at the end of the present school year. I may say that this Department has contributed a large amount in the education of the Isaacs family and for that reason we do not wish to deal unjustly in her case. We have recently got rid of her sister at the Big Cove School, and if you consider that a more fully qualified teacher should be secured for the Eel Ground School after the summer holidays, it might be well to make a change.\n\nI will be pleased to have your opinion regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I have to inform you that it is expected that, as Chief, you will set a good example to the other Indians of the Band, and do all you can to encourage them to have their children attend school regularly.\n\nYou should be very careful in circulating reports regarding the teacher's character, which, if called upon in court to prove, you might find difficult to do.\n\nI have also to inform you that you have no authority to dismiss the teacher, as we have been informed you have threatened to do. I would point out that the Department pays the entire cost of conducting this school, and that the Indians or yourself are not called upon to contribute anything towards the expense.\n\nIt is hoped that there will be no further cause for complaint, and that there will be no further interference by you in the work of the school on the Eel Ground Reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

He has given false and bad reports concerning my character, stating that I harbor white men all hours of the night, & have witness to prove that I keep good house. Last evening he called on my house and said that within two weeks,\nshe would choose me away. Kindly settle this matter at once as it is causing much trouble.\n\nWill oblige,\n\nP.S.

This is the third time he has gone to the school and abused the teacher, he is determined to force her to leave. It was no doubt Chief Paul's actions which caused Miss Schultz to leave the school. Paul is untruthful and is prepared to make any statement to carry his point. If he is allowed to act in this way it will be impossible to secure a teacher for this school.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Supt.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, May 18th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, enclosing a communication from Miss Rebecca Isaacs, teacher of the Eel Ground Indian Day School, regarding the interference by the Chief, Dan Paul, with her work at the school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a similar communication was received from the teacher, and we wrote the Chief concerning this matter, copy of which letter is enclosed herewith. It is considered that a lot of these complaints should be settled locally, without reference to the Department.\n\nYou should inform Chief Paul that if he occasions further trouble and interference, the Department will have to seriously consider the advisability of taking the necessary steps to put an end to the condition of affairs mentioned by the teacher and yourself.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Keeping up roads till late hours at this thing the Band will not put up with, as this teacher's sister some time ago did cause the same trouble.\n\nAnd if the Department wish to enquire you will find my statement correct.\n\nThe Band did request me to notify the department that they did not want this teacher past June as if she is kept on there will be trouble as she goes about the roads using revolvers and causing an uproar all the time.\n\nKindly reply (Chief)\n\nDaniel Paul\nEl Ground Reserve\nSUGGESTIONS:\n\nI would be better satisfied if this school could be placed in the hands of a good white teacher, as far as I can judge the teaching of both Miss Isaacs has not been a success. I did everything in my power to give them a good chance, tried them in every way, their pupils would know one or two subjects well, yet be almost ignorant on the other subjects called for in the said standards.\n\nI found this school very dirty and greatly neglected. I feel little interest is being taken by teacher. There will have to be a change. I think Miss Isaacs does not enjoy the best of health; this may be one reason why I have not found her school just what it should have been.\nOttawa, August 8, 1922.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to refer to the suggestions made by you in your report of inspection of the Bel Ground Indian Day School, regarding the services of Miss Isaacs, the Teacher. If you consider it advisable and can secure a suitable teacher, you may inform Miss Isaacs that her services are no longer required. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to deal with as you consider in the best interests of all concerned. Should you succeed in engaging another teacher, I shall be pleased if you will inform us of her name, qualifications and experience.\n\nIt would appear that the children are making very little progress under Miss Isaacs' instruction and that she is not taking much interest in the work. We do not desire to act unfairly with Miss Isaacs, who has been in our employ for some time, and it may be that you would advise her services to be retained until the end of December, next. If no improvement is shown at the time of your next inspection, her services could then be dispensed with.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you at a later date as to what action you take regarding a teacher for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Reports will well explain matters.\n\nChief Dan Paul should at once be removed from Office. He neither fears the Dept. nor any power at Ottawa, or otherwise. It is a misfortune that he was left so long as Chief.\n\nI would suggest to the Dept., in order to keep proper order in this School, and serve as a lesson to all the Indians, -that the Chief, & Constable be made to apologize to School & Teacher & all the Indians, then be deposed from OFFICE. It is true, he only has about four months as Chief now, yet even at that, his removal would certainly act as a good lesson for all.\n\nYou can gather from the inclosed \"REPORTS\", the full trouble, Dan tried to pick trouble with the teacher at different times, and failing to do so, took this course to show the Indians, and all his powers over School & Gov. Dept. & & & &. The Indians now think he is some \"MAN\".\n\nI trust the Dept. will promptly act before Xmas, as most of the Ind. will be home then. To leave the matter thus, to be talked over all during these days will only deepen the wound, and make it much harder to heal.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nInsp. of Ind.

Sir:\n\nRelative to your letter of the 10th instant enclosing reports of your inspection of the Indian schools in the Province of New Brunswick, and with special reference to the Eel Ground School, I beg to say it is noted that you would like to obtain the services of another teacher for the next school year. The copy of the letter which you sent Mrs. O'Shea stating the conditions under which she could return is noted. If you feel that she cannot comply with these conditions, it might be well to dispense with her services and obtain another teacher. However, the Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the arrangements considered by you to be the most advantageous for carrying on the work at this school.\n\nI shall be pleased to hear later as to what you have decided to do in the matter. If you obtain another teacher, the name, qualifications and experience of the person selected by you should be forwarded for the approval of the Department. We will allow salary at the same rate as was paid Mrs. O'Shea.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co., N.B.\nDear Mr. Perrin,\n\nI have just received a letter from Father Ryan, stating that the Eygound Indians, among whom I have been teaching since last Sept., have sent in several complaints against me. Well, that is nothing new, as you are aware; when they wish to dispense with a teacher's services, if they cannot find complaints they'll invent them.\n\nNow Father Ryan said I could have the school again under following conditions:\n\n1. That I could not take my children there now, that includes all, as I live in Mr. Ryan parish. He knows full well and cannot take some of my children, I cannot teach them at all.\n\nI have five children all depending on me for support. The oldest boy nearly 14, is the only one who caused disturbance among the Ind. children. He would not go to the school for English children and he annoyed me considerably by quarrelling.\nI had intended sending them to a good school, and taking most with me. One little girl 11, one boy 5, and one other little girl 6, would all be attending the English school, which is 14 miles distant from hereground, and one little boy of four plays around and bothers nobody. So I can promise you, in future my children will not associate with bad children, either in or outside school hours.\n\nGreater care must be given teaching children their prayers etc.\n\nThis Mr. Ferrier is where I made a mistake apparently. Every morning and evening I used recite all the common prayers, getting children to respond. In addition I used take nearly an hour every day trying to get them to memorize their catechism. I thought I was spending enough time on religion, as they have a nice church, mass & catechism every second Sunday. My chief aim was to get them to read, spell, and learn arithmetic, and to get them to talk better English, and defy anyone to say I wasn't succeeding. I was trying too hard, and that is why children did not thank\nThe attempt was too slack with them.\n\n3rdly some guarantee must be given for better attendance.\n\nIf they appoint another truant officer, that is sufficient guarantee that the children will attend. The last truant officer was afraid to go to force children to school. Rather than pay the burden of better attendance rests with the teacher. I disagree with him there.\n\nIf so, why does government pay a truant officer for work done by teachers? I'll tell you Mr. Reid, I could have a good attendance also, if I let children take charge and do just as they pleased. That is the only way a teacher can have a good attendance in school. I offered prizes for best attendance ground. I offered prizes for best attendance ground. You see result. For the last 3 months I was there, Mr. Reid, truant officer never went near there. Mr. Reid, truant officer never went near there. Children to bring them to school. Mother did she visit school. I asked him why he wasn't doing his duty - he told me \"I'm very busy now teacher, haven't time\".\n\n4th Domestic Science must be taught with better advantage to all.\n\nIt wasn't my fault that the children didn't do\nI wrote twice to Mr. Agent Hudson, asking first for yarn, and lastly for some gingham to make dresses etc., but he ignored both letters. Of course I knew the Indians blamed me. Surely the Govt. didn't expect me to buy yarn etc. for Indians out of my own salary. Or I was not authorized to get it, and have it charged to Government.\n\nYou and Father Ryan will do as you like about school, but instead of taking my position away from me, and allowing my children to go hungry, the Dominion Government should be giving pensions to poor mothers to keep them raise their families, instead of throwing it at rich men, like Fielding, who do not need it. It is the rich the Govt. helps, not the poor, let them work and pay taxes to pension off old men.\n\nThanking you for your kindness shown in the past, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very Truly,\nKatherine Shea\nJuly 20th, 1926\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI am sending you Mrs. O'Shea's letter. She is in Edmonton but says she will be back soon.\n\nI am writing to inquire about the location of her letter. Would you be so kind as to return this letter?\n\nI am not sure whether this school is the best place for her daughter, who has not yet started school, and Mrs. O'Shea would stay home with her husband and children. We could keep her daughter for a year or two until she has been trained in the convent.\n\nI am not sure what Mrs. O'Shea has said about the school, under any consideration now. If so, then we must be the ones to pay everything.\n\nThe neighbors all think that the children should remain on the farm with their little ones, and let the daughter go out and teach. Mrs. O'Shea does not need to teach.\n\nI have made things very clear to you.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6062, file 277-1, part 1)\nOttawa, July 22, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, addressed to Mr. Ferrier of this Department, relative to the services of Mrs. O'Shea, teacher of the Eel Ground Indian Day School and enclosing a communication which you received from her. In this connection I have to state that Mrs. O'Shea has written the Department to the same effect as the letter which you received from her. After reading this correspondence carefully, it has been decided that it would be in the best interests of the work at this school to dispense with her services and we are informing her accordingly.\n\nThe Department would consider the appointment of Mrs. O'Shea's daughter who, you state, has a Second Class Certificate, if you are of the opinion that her services would be satisfactory. I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will forward the name of this girl and state what experience, if any, she has had. If Mrs. O'Shea was retained for another year, we consider that the same difficulty would be experienced in the matter of her children interfering with her devoting her full time to the work. We have noted that it will be no hardship to her, as she can very well stay at home with her father-in-law on her husband's farm. If you do not consider that the daughter would be suitable for the appointment, you should endeavour to obtain the services of a teacher having the necessary qualifications.\n\nPlease inform the Department fully as to the arrangements you are able to make in securing a teacher for this school for the next academic year, to begin duties on September first, next, when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nThe letter which you received from Mrs. O'Shea is returned herewith, as requested.

Owing to the difficulty existing last year through your children living with you at the school, there has been considerable friction and consequent neglect of duty. We are informing Rev. Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, that your services will not be required for the next school year and we are requesting him to arrange to obtain a qualified teacher to succeed you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMrs. Katherine O'Shea,\nSevogle, N. B.\nMiss Lillian Murdock will accept the Ind. Day school at Belgrand. She is a FIRST CLASS LICENSED teacher, has taught 14 years in public schools, and has the best of recommendations. I do trust the Dept. will make her salary somewhat better and thus encourage her to make a reformation on this Reserve /. She is about 38, or 40, never married. She was educated in the Convent and has that rare missionary spirit, which has induced her to accept this school, again she will be near to her brother, Rev. B. Murdock, & her mother.\n\nI learn that we are very fortunate to get this teacher. I have never met the girl, but have obtained my information from good authority.\n\nThis Reserve is in bad shape and I trust we now have what is wanted. Domestic science should be taught at least 3 nights per week, visits made to Indian houses &c., and for this extra work I trust the Dept. will allow an extra $150.00. If she will not do this extra work, then pay her but $65.00.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nInspect. of Ind. Schools for N.B.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If she will undertake the teaching of domestic science, such as sewing, knitting, the making of garments and other related work, in addition to the classroom duties, and visit the Indian homes and instruct the women in their household duties, the Department would be prepared to allow her salary at the rate of $75 per month for the ten teaching months in the year. If, however, she would not agree to carry on domestic science work under definite instructions from you as to what you wish done, we would only be prepared to allow salary at the rate of $65 per month. The Department will leave in your hands the question of instructing Miss Murdock as to what duties you wish her to perform outside the regular classroom work. We would be prepared to supply a reasonable amount of material for instruction purposes upon receipt of a requisition from her as to what she requires.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will ascertain definitely from Miss Murdock whether she will accept the position or not and the services she would be prepared to perform, not only in the classroom, but in the teaching of domestic science to the older girls and women on the Reserve.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, enclosing monthly reports from Miss Lillian Murdock, teacher of the Eel Ground Indian Day School. The Department has examined these reports and the remarks thereon made by the teacher. We have noted that she has failed to comply with your requests to make these reports out each month and submit them to you. We also note that she has failed to give any report on the domestic science work that is being done by her, if any.\n\nWhen Miss Murdock was appointed, her salary was, as you were informed in official letter of July 31st, last, to be at the rate of $75 per month provided she gave the pupils instruction in domestic science. If, however, she did not agree to carry on this work under definite instructions from you as to the duties you wished her to perform, we would only be prepared to allow salary at the rate of $65 per teaching month.\n\nAs Miss Murdock has taken a very arbitrary stand, and is insubordinate, and it is evident from the letter of the janitor of the school to you that she has antagonized the parents, it is considered that, if it is possible for you to obtain another teacher, the services of Miss Murdock should be dispensed with when the school closes for the Christmas holidays. If you can obtain another teacher, you should give Miss Murdock notice as soon as possible that her services will not be further required. Please submit the name, qualifications and experience of the teacher whom you are able to obtain for this school to begin duties on or about January 4th, next. We would allow salary at the same rate as was offered Miss Murdock, the amount to depend on whether she teaches domestic science or not. The Department will leave the matter of continuing the services of Miss Murdock, or the engaging of a new teacher, in your hands, to act as you consider in the best interests of the work. I shall be pleased to hear from you at a later date as to what you have done in the matter.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, N.B.\nI am returning herewith the monthly reports which you received from Miss Murdock, but I am retaining on our files the letter of Mr. Paul, the janitor, to you, as well as a copy of your letter to Miss Murdock regarding her monthly reports.\n\nRelative to the communication which you received from the teacher of the Burnt Church School regarding double doors and windows for the teachers' residence, I beg to inform you that we authorized Mr. Agent Hudson in official letter dated November 27th, last, to obtain and have installed 5 double windows and 2 storm doors. It is presumed that he will attend to this matter. The letter of the teacher to you is returned herewith.\n\nI have also the letter from the teacher of the Big Cove Indian Day School relative to the supplies for the midday meal. We have authorized Mr. Agent Hudson to furnish what he considered a sufficient quantity of supplies for this purpose. I may say that it is not intended to furnish the pupils with a full meal at noon.

She must be encouraged.\n\nI would ask the Department to engage Miss Cahoon's sister as domestic science teacher. She received her training at Chatham Convent, and I am sending to the Department her application. She is certainly a very capable girl. She is at present with her sister on the Reserve and did a lot of this work free of charge this past term. She likes the work. There is a vast amount of work to do for a domestic science teacher in the Indian homes. Many are very unhealthy, also most extravagant. Economy, cleanliness, etc., must be taught to these poor people.\n\nI trust the Department will favourably consider the appointment of a domestic science teacher on this Reserve, and will consider Miss Evelyn's Cahoon's application for the position.\nOttawa, June 18th, 1926.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nRelative to your report on your inspection of the Eel Ground Indian Day School, and pursuant to the conversation with you during your recent visit to the Department regarding an increase in the salary of the teacher, Miss Marion Cahoon, I beg to advise you that the following are the facts regarding her salary:\n\nWhen she was appointed from the 1st of January, last, no reference was made to the teaching of domestic science, and she was given salary at the rate of $650 per year, and you were advised accordingly by telegram on the 2nd of January, last. It subsequently followed, however, that she took up domestic science work, and she was, therefore, allowed $100 for this service, which gave her a total salary at the rate of $750, and she has been paid at this rate from the date of her appointment. In view of the above, we are of opinion that Miss Cahoon is receiving a fair remuneration. Her salary compares favourably with that paid to teachers having her qualifications in neighbouring white schools. We are pleased to note that she has performed excellent services since her appointment.\n\nI have also the application which you received from Miss Evelyn Cahoon for the position as teacher of domestic science. As you were advised when in the Department, we have no funds specially provided to pay for this extra teacher, but have noted the same for our next year's estimates. It is hoped that we will then be in a position to appoint a second teacher at this school from April 1st, 1927. Please inform Miss Cahoon accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, N.B.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, March 28, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Morrisey:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant with an enclosure from Mrs. Katherine O'Shea, who is desirous of returning to Indian school work in New Brunswick. This teacher was in our employ at the Bel Ground Indian Day School for one year and her services were not very satisfactory. I regret that I cannot favourably consider the matter of her re-engagement. The Rev. Father F. C. Ryan, of Red Bank, inspects the Indian schools of the Province and the Department looks to him for recommendations concerning personal services at these schools. In his most recent letter concerning Mrs. O'Shea, he writes that he cannot under any circumstances advise her re-appointment.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nCharles Morrisey, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Reverend Father,\n\nI wish to inform you, Reverend Father, that I wished to resign my position as teacher on the Earl Ground Indian Reserve at the end of the present term.\n\nYours respectfully,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6062, file 277-1, part 1)\nI would suggest that Miss Bransfield be offered another school in order that the two Miss Cahoons could take over this Reserve. Both are wonderful teachers. Miss Bransfield would do better, I think, in a smaller school.\n\nMiss Marion did wonderful work at Eel Ground Reserve, but resigned from the fact that she would be alone another year as her little sister who stayed with her must attend the Convent. She would, therefore, go to Burnt Church to teach provided her sister would remain as the Domestic Science teacher.\nOttawa, July 4th, 1927.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the communication which you forwarded from Miss Marion Cahoon, teacher of the Burnt Church Indian Day School, together with the report of your inspection of this school. It is noted that Miss Cahoon intends to resign her present position, but that she will accept the school at Burnt Church. The Department agrees with your suggestion that Miss Cahoon be transferred as teacher of the Burnt Church School for the school year beginning on or about September 1st, next. If this arrangement can be carried out, the two Cahoon sisters will be together, and this may result in more satisfactory work, both in the classroom and in the teaching of domestic science. I have, therefore, to request that you will arrange, if possible, to carry out the above arrangement.\n\nThe question of obtaining another school for Miss Stella Bransfield will be left in your hands. If you consider that it would be satisfactory, she might replace Miss Cahoon at Bel Ground. It is noted from the communication which you forwarded from her that she might not want to accept another school. If you succeed in transferring Miss Cahoon to Burnt Church, and cannot arrange any other appointment for Miss Bransfield, you should inform her that her services will not be further required.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of the appointment of teachers for the next school year in your hands, and I shall be pleased to hear definitely at a later date what arrangements have been made by you for the teaching services in the schools in New Brunswick.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Everything our child is doing good with education and so in high grades they will send them away from the school without any cause now this is our third child that is put out from Col. Ground School. Our daughter is not age to leave school yet and she is learning good she is in grade VII Silver and I am sorry to see her.\nOut of school, the only cause is she had a few small quarrels with the teacher. But I don't think of them as even middle myself with them. I do all I can to stop my daughters from quarreling with her. But as far as I concern it, the teacher fault as well. She thinks Indian children are too low because she passes remarks about Indians of days gone by. We know that we are Indians. But we have our civilization. This teacher were good to our children and they did learn good and the children had no faults with them. But this is the\nEvery chief has a complaint about his. But it always the way with our white people. When you see an Indian child doing good with education, we shall always have a way as cause to stopping them.\n\nSo now if my child cannot go to the Canadian school I want you through your governing of two Indians to send him in and English school. I am asking this with a good favor and look after this soon as possible. I want my rights as much as Father Ryan... Miss Murphy...\nSchool teachers.\n\nNow I want you to answer this letter to me. If you want it answered through our Agent Mr. Hudson, the privilege that you give him to give it. He will not answer. For he is as bad himself.

In reply I beg to inform you, first, that Peter Barnaby was not at home when this letter was written, and that this child Mrs. Barnaby speaks of is nearly 16 years of age, and is an incorrigible child; One of the reasons that Mrs. Barnaby wishes to keep this girl at school, is that she cannot get along with her when her father is away she is so violent and bad tempered.\n\nThe teacher has been trying her best to make something of this girl, her name is Bridgett Barnaby, but it is impossible so the Inspector and myself gave the teacher permission to let her stay home, as she was demolizing the whole school.\n\nWith regard to the efficiency of the teacher there is no question.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6062, file 277-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nExtract from Inspector Ryan's report on the Belground School visited on June 2, 1938.\n\nIn my twenty years of experience with Indian schools I have never seen such progress in any of our N. B. Indian schools as was shown in this school. In manual training she had over fifty pieces of beautiful wood work. In domestic science as much as four of our other schools. As for her school, I found that her pupils (who under their former teacher, Miss Fitzgerald who gave up this school last Xmas, could do little or nothing) were now transformed into bright children and advanced to their proper standards. The more I think of this wonderful change all the more do I feel like getting new teachers for several of my Indian schools. In just six months these stolid pupils, for the whole school seemed so, were turned into bright children.\n\nA new school should be built at once on this Reserve. This old building has long been condemned. It would be good for a woodworking shop and domestic science hall and should not be sold when a new school is constructed. Please have the interior calcimined and well cleaned, if a new school is not to be built.\n\n(Sgd.) F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed letters have just been received and you will note that they refer to a boy named Allen Francis who is stated to be 14 years of age and who has discontinued attending school.\n\nPlease consider the suggestion made by the teacher and by the Inspector of Indian Schools, Rev. F. C. Ryan, and let me have your comments. When replying the attached letters should be returned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nChas.

B.\n\nDear Reverend Father,\n\nI am writing in regard to one of my pupils, Allan Francis, fifteen years of age, who has been giving considerable trouble the past month.\n\nThis boy acts very strangely, Father. He does not study, takes no interest in anything; at times he will start...\nNewcastle, N.B.\nFeb. 6th, 1939.\n\nReverend Father J.F. Ryan, P.P.\nRed Bank,\nN.B.\n\nDear Reverend Father:\n\nReceived your letter Saturday and wish to thank you for your prompt reply. I quite agree with the Reverend Father that they prefer Allen Francis in the Reform School.\n\nLearned from one of my oldest friends that Mr. Francis said in his home that he told Allen to act as badly as he could and disobey the teacher, as he could have.\nDear Sir:\n\nThis letter will explain itself. This case is one among so many that we have to deal with, in our S.I.B. Ind. School. It certainly is a grave experiment in higher education, again the way it comes about, by parents on its side in their own crafty way, influencing their children of 14 to act in such a way that the teacher must send the pupil home.\n\nSomething must be done, and done at once to curb this all too common situation; the child is not to blame, so is the lazy indifferent parent who wants to run the roads and loaf, thus when their children just get interested in higher education, around 14 years, then act at once within a week or a few days a most obedient child become unmanageable in the school.\n\nP.S. Yours respectfully,\n\nF. E. Ryan\n\nMy suggestion is the Repatriation. It will only take 2 or 3 cases to settle this whole trouble.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 15th instant File 55-3-1 referring to an Indian boy named Allen Fransis 14 years of age. In reply I beg to inform you that it seems to be a perplexing case. If this boy acts as he does on the advice of his father (Mose Fransis) I presume that it is the latter that should be dealt with. But how could it be done? We could compel the boy's return to school, and he probably would act as before, which I understand was in a manner that kept the school in an uproar. This would be only making a bad case worse.\n\nWith regard to sending the boy to a reform school, this cannot be done unless he commits some offence that calls for the sentence from a magistrate.\n\nIf it is as it appears, Fransis keeps his boy home to work I would suggest that his relief be reduced about $1.00 per week as the boy will be able to earn this much at home. I presume that this would be a lesson for any others who might attempt the scheme of putting their children up to act bad at school in order to have them sent home; and they would be more careful in trying it.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 21st instant with reference to Allen Fransis.\n\nThe Department has carefully considered the information contained in your letter and approval is hereby granted for reducing the relief of Moses Fransis by $1.00 a week. You should point out to him the reason why the relief is being reduced.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nOttawa, May 20, 1940.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI am attaching hereto, for your information, copies of correspondence relating to a brutal assault on Miss Delphine Murphy, teacher of the Bel Ground Indian day school, (Northumberland Electoral District) New Brunswick.\n\nIn view of this regrettable incident, it is just possible that we should undertake immediately a survey of our Indian reserves, particularly our reserves in eastern Canada, in an attempt to determine the adequacy of the police protection provided at these centres. The Superintendent of Welfare and Training has on more than one occasion referred to the inadequacy of the police protection at the Caughnawaga reserve, Quebec.\n\nThe Bel Ground reserve has an Indian population of 173 (1934 census). The Indian population of this reserve have been for a number of years in receipt of relief allowances. A part time Indian constable is employed and receives remuneration at the rate of $70.0 per annum.\n\nDirector,\n\nRAH\nOttawa, May 20, 1940.\n\nDear Father Ryan:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 15th instant, in which you refer to the brutal assault on Miss Delphine Murphy, teacher of the Eel Ground Indian day school.\n\nThe Director of this Branch has this morning sent forward, with a covering memorandum, a copy of your letter to the office of the Minister.\n\nI have never been wholly satisfied with the police protection provided on Indian reserves, particularly Indian reserves in eastern Canada. It is my earnest hope, therefore, that this most regrettable incident may effect a change of policy and result in the government extending a greater measure of protection to Indian agents and particularly to Indian day school teachers employed on Indian reserves throughout the country.\n\nI have just learned from the agent that the Royal Canadian Mounted Police have charge of the case. It is my hope that no stone will be left unturned until the party or parties responsible have been adequately punished for this brutal assault.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, Northumberland Co.,\nNew Brunswick.\nOttawa, May 20, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 16th instant, in which you refer to the brutal assault committed by some party or parties unknown on Miss Delphine Murphy, teacher of the Bel Ground Indian day school.\n\nIn view of this unfortunate incident, it is just possible that the Government may have to extend a greater measure of police protection to departmental employees on Indian reserves. It is my hope, also, that the incident may result in a change in our relief policy. I am myself vigorously opposed to extending unemployment relief allowances to able-bodied Indians. If these Indians cannot find work on reserves, they should be placed on farms or at work outside the reserves in return for their relief allowances. It is altogether likely that you will receive definite instructions with respect to a change in our relief policy in the course of a few days.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

B. Indian schools.\n\nIt seems that the Indian Department will not care for this criminal brutal case that almost ended the life of Miss Murphy. I reported the case at two different times to the said Ind. Dept.. It is now over 7 weeks and nothing seemingly has been done in the case. Miss Murphy is one of the most highly respected citizens of the town of Newcastle and the whole country at large holds the Indian Department at Ottawa responsible for this long delay in bringing the culprits to task for such a crime.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nF. C. Ryan, P P\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for N. B.\n\nMy Dear Boy Leonard, will you see the Premier or the Minister of Mines & Resources at Ottawa offer this case?

Murphy, teacher of the Bel Ground Indian Day School, near Newcastle, N. B.\n\nIn connection with this matter I would refer you to my memorandum of May 20, to which was attached copies of correspondence relating to the assault on Miss Murphy.\n\nAs you will note from Indian Agent Hudson's letter of May 16, a copy of which was forwarded with my memorandum of May 20, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police took charge of the case immediately and we have received from them reports dated as follows: May 20, May 26, May 30, June 8 and July 1. The last report reads as follows:\n\n\"Further re the above case, please be advised that to-date no further information has been received. Miss MURPHY is still in the hospital, her condition is good and it is expected that she will be discharged from the hospital soon. However, she cannot remember anything more about the assault.\n\n\"At the present time Madam Paul, Indian from Burnt Church Reserve, is living on Bel Ground Reserve and it is hoped that she may be able to obtain information.\n\n\"An extension of the diary date is requested to July 15th.\"\n\nI think -\nI think you will agree with me that Reverend Father Ryan is not fair to this Branch when he intimates in his letters that no action has been taken. We are not responsible for prosecution of offences under the Criminal Code and you will note from the dates of the reports received from the R.C.M.P. that they have been working on the matter steadily but apparently have not yet obtained sufficient evidence to permit them to lay a charge.\n\nI may add that Miss Murphy has been allowed her full salary to June 30, 1940, on which date the school would have ordinarily closed for the summer holidays.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your No. 40 B 829-6-C-2 of July 1 and previous reports from your Officer, with regard to the investigation he has been conducting in connection with the assault on Miss Delphine Murphy, teacher of the Bel Ground Indian Day School.\n\nAs you are aware, people are very prone to criticize and, as a consequence, we have recently received very strong representations to the effect that there has been undue delay in apprehending the culprit in this case. Besides, unless a conviction is secured, we are likely to have considerable difficulty with many of our teachers on the Indian reserves, especially in New Brunswick, as they will be afraid of a similar occurrence happening to them.\n\nAnything that can be done to bring the guilty party or parties to justice would be very much appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nThe Commissioner,\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police,\nOTTAWA.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nCRIMINAL INVESTIGATION BRANCH\n\nOUR FILE NO. 40 B 629-6-C-2\nYOUR FILE NO. 55-3-1\n\nOTTAWA, August 10, 1940.\n\nReferred by direction of The Commissioner, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, Ottawa.\n\nTO:\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, asked me to take El Ground School.\n\nRecently it was suggested that Miss Murphy and Miss Hogan teachers at Cromocto and Burnt Church respectively, were to exchange schools owing to the condition of Miss Murphy's health.\n\nMiss Hogan did not want Cromocto School and tried to get El Ground School.\n\nAs far as I can ascertain...\nthey came to Rev. Father Ryan with their plan and he said they could not make the change at Eel Ground unless I was willing. I have not consented that I was willing and in spite of the fact, they arranged a letter and had it forwarded to the Department stating that all concerned were willing to make the change, and evidently when Rev. Father Ryan received the letter he thought they had talked the matter over with me and as far as I know Miss Hogan wrote to the Department stating that I was willing to go to Portobello which was false.\n\nIf it was proposed that Miss Murphy was to exchange schools with Miss Hogan why should Miss Hogan have the right to interfere with Eel Ground School and acquire it by false statements.\n\nIf I lost my school through inefficiency, lack of teaching ability or neglect of duty, it would be a different proposition, but such is not the case, as for\nas I can determine it was brought about by Miss Hogan.\n\nAll was done and published in the local paper that I was to take Oronoeto School before I knew about it.\n\nIf you are doubtful about the truth of anything that I have written, you are at liberty to consult Rev. Father Ryan.\n\nIt does not seem fair that Miss Hogan should have the right to take Col Ground School from me where I was having no trouble with the Indian children and propose that I take Oronoeto School simply to comply with her wishes.\n\nWill you kindly give the matter consideration and let me know immediately what you can do for me in respect to my keeping Col Ground School next term.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

A. Stewart and W. V. Bruce, Superintendent, Commanding \"J\" Division. It is noted that in both these reports a reference is made to relief costs at the Bel Ground Reserve and a misunderstanding seems to exist with respect to the source or appropriation from which relief expenditures are made. Corporal Stewart states:\n\n\"I might add that nearly every Indian questioned regarding this case made reference to the question of relief to the Indian families being stopped because of Indian children remaining away from school. This was particularly noticed when talking to the better educated members of the tribe, several remarking the relief they obtained came from moneys placed in a fund for their benefit when the treaty was made, and they considered neither the teacher nor the Indian agent had any right to deprive them of what was rightfully theirs.\"\n\nSuperintendent Bruce States:\n\n\"This report discloses what was probably the real reason for the assault of Miss Murphy.

B.\n\nIndians -\nIndians have in a trust fund administered by the Government a sum of money which accumulates in various ways and which the Indians regard as their own property. This fund is used in part to supply relief to the Indians when they need it.\n\nIt is in the judgment of the Department very disturbing that this misunderstanding has arisen with respect to relief expenditures. A statement was sent to you immediately following the close of the last fiscal year. This statement dealt very fully and in detail with the Indian trust funds of your agency. You must be fully aware that relief costs have not been paid from Indian trust funds at any time, certainly not at any time in recent years. In the case of the Bel Ground Band, their trust funds at this date amount to approximately $3,182.59 capital and $1,166.33 interest. The total expenditures for the last fiscal year made from this trust fund amounted to $4.35.\n\nThe Department is anxious to know what steps have been taken by you from year to year to explain to the Indians concerned the standing of their trust funds, the expenditures made from these funds, the amount of annual interest allowed on such trust funds and such other information as might appear to the Indians or to you relevant to the subject.\n\nWe are anxious that you should acknowledge receipt of this letter and state what steps you intend to take to clear up this particular misunderstanding and any other misunderstanding that may exist in respect to Indian trust funds. You may note in the excerpt from Corporal Stewart a reference to a treaty. It would be interesting to know just what treaty the Indians had in mind when discussing this subject with Corporal Stewart. We have reminded Indian agents from time to time that relief is not the right of any Indian and that relief is extended from time to time, particularly to the old and physically incapacitated, not in fulfillment of any treaty obligations or not as something\nthat the Indians may demand, but to avoid suffering and hardship. The Department reserves the right to withhold this relief at any time in the case of able-bodied men who, with economic conditions gradually improving, should be in a position to become increasingly self-supporting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

I would suppose, however, that individuals have the right to change their mind, even though such change may prove very inconvenient to the Department.\n\nI have very carefully reviewed the correspondence relating to your employment at Eel Ground and your transfer therefrom, including the voluminous reports received from the R. C. M. P., and I am personally of the opinion that it is a mistake for you to report at Eel Ground for duty. I make this statement having had almost 20 years' experience in the administration of public schools and Indian schools and knowing something about incidents such as the unfortunate incident in which you yourself were involved. Despite this fact, however, and in response to your own request and on the recommendation of Father Ryan, you will be permitted to return to the Eel Ground School and to take charge of that school immediately following the holiday period that has been allowed you. However, the Inspector and I must assume full responsibility for this change. You were transferred from Eel Ground at your own request and you are being returned at your own request. Transfers of teachers at Indian day schools are only authorized in very urgent cases and it is scarcely necessary to add that it is not our intention to continue to transfer teachers from time to time in the province of New Brunswick. In order that there may be no misunderstanding, therefore in the future, I am anxious that you should read this letter very carefully, note its contents and acknowledge receipt of it in due course.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\nOttawa, January 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMiss Delphine Murphy will take charge of the Eel Ground School on or about February 3.\n\nMiss Murphy is returning to the Eel Ground School at her own request and on the recommendation of the Inspector of Indian Schools, Reverend Father Ryan. The Police in their reports have suggested that the bodily assault from which Miss Murphy has suffered may have been due in part at least to the reductions that took place in relief allowances, these reductions in some cases having been made on her recommendation. I am anxious that you should discuss this matter with Miss Murphy, immediately following her return to Eel Ground, and following that discussion I am desirous that you should assume full responsibility for the administration of relief on this particular reserve. It is difficult for me to see how a teacher can do her best work and exercise the influence she should exercise if she becomes involved from time to time in relief matters and in the reduction of relief rations. I am of the opinion that the Indian agent, and the Indian agent alone, should modify his relief policy from time to time in a way that will appeal to his own best judgment. It might be advisable, also, to explain to the Indians that you are accepting full responsibility for the administration of relief and that the teacher will be responsible in the future only for the actual classroom work in the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nMr. Charles Hudson,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nNewcastle, N.B.\nJanuary 7, 1941.\n\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been informed by Reverend Father Ryan that my letter of the 23rd ultimo addressed to the Secretary, Mr. MacInnes, has been referred to your attention. In justice to myself I feel that I must write you concerning my request to be given back my former school.\n\nIt is no great surprise for me to learn that you cannot understand why I am now willing to return to Eel Ground. I shall try to explain. From the very first it was my intention to go back to my own school as soon as I felt able to teach. My family would not hear of it as there was so much uncertainty about the outcome of the case, and they insisted on a change. I was assured that the school was still mine, and that the teacher named was but substituting until such time as it would be safe to return.\n\nThe request of a further change to Burnt Church was made without my consent or approval and wholly for the benefit of Miss Hogan. I could not possibly sleep at Burnt Church surrounded by the relatives of my would-be assassins. As stated in my last letter I have been assured of daily transportation to and from Eel Ground so that I shall feel safe.\n\nI submit to you the above facts and I am disposed to think that you will see fit now to allow me to take up the work again at Eel Ground, and have Miss Hogan resume former duties at Burnt Church. I shall greatly appreciate an early reply as I cannot get the full benefit of my leave of absence until this matter is settled.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Pratt\nPrivate Secretary.\nRichibucto, N.B.\nJan. 9th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir\u2014\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Jan. 6th, 1941, Pyle #55-3-1, re assault on Miss Delphine Murphy, Bel Ground Reserve, N.B.\n\nIn reply, I am sorry that such misunderstandings exist, as for nearly 20 years now, I have been, by oral persuasion, trying to impress the Indians that payment of relief to Indians has not been paid from trust funds. In the case of Bel Ground Reserve, the Indians all know that the cost of relief per year is many times the amount of their trust funds. But in the minds of the Micmac Indians, there is the impression that there is a sum of money in the hands of the Department, which they think is inexhaustible, and was placed there years ago for the use of the Indians, and it is out of this fund that they think all sorts of relief is being paid.\n\nI am quite certain that there is not an Indian on the Bel Ground reserve but who knows that the relief expenditure is not paid out of their trust fund. With regard to what steps I have taken to explain to the Indians, the standing of their trust funds, I have not thought it necessary to make any special statement to them concerning these funds, as the chiefs usually receive the report of the Indian Affairs Branch every year, and are just as familiar with the contents as I am myself.\n\nWith regard to what steps I intend to take to clear up this misunderstanding, I don't think there is anything more I can do, as I have repeatedly explained to the Indians that the expense of relief does not come out of their trust funds, and that it is only charity on the part of the Department that they receive relief at all.\n\nWith regard to the treaty referred to by Corpl. Stewart, I will try to procure a copy and forward it to you, although I know it will be of very little value.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nRichibucto, N.B.\nJan. 24th, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 10th inst., file #58-3-1 referring to Miss Delphine Murphy taking charge of the Bel Ground School, about Feb. 3rd. In reply, I beg to inform you that this appears to be a good move, as apparently, all the Indians are desirous that Miss Murphy should again take the school. With regard to reducing, or discontinuing relief on account of children's delinquency, I cannot quite see how this can be done, except on recommendation of the teacher. The way this has been done, and the only way I can see that it can be done in the future, is that the teacher will have to report to me, when any of the children do not attend. However, we will have to improvise a method, whereby the teacher would appear to the Indians, to be responsible for any reduction in relief, that may take place.\n\nI have from time to time, informed the Indians that it was not the teacher's fault, that relief should, or had to be reduced on account of the children staying home.\n\nI never was of the opinion that the teacher of an Indian school should act as truant officer, as it always is the cause of hard feelings between the two. However, I do not think there will be any difficulty in getting things to run satisfactorily at this school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter of the 24th inst., referring to Miss Delphine Murphy taking charge of the Eel Ground School; with reference to the last sentence of the first paragraph, which states, \"however, we will have to improvise a method, whereby the teacher would appear to the Indians, to be responsible for any reduction in relief which may take place.\" This sentence should have read, \"however, we will have to improvise a method, whereby the teacher would NOT appear to the Indians, to be responsible for any reduction in relief which may take place.\"\n\nI am sorry that this error should have occurred, as it altered the entire meaning of the whole letter.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 11, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to advise you that Miss Helen Lawler, teacher Bel Ground Indian Day School, resigned effective January 1, 1941.

Miss Florence Hartney, and Miss Lillian Holchoud, teachers for the Burnt Church School are also going, along with Miss Murphy. I informed Miss Murphy that it would be in order to attend the convention, as I believe in previous years the Department has encouraged the attendance of teachers of Indian Schools attending these conventions. If you do not want these or other teachers of Indian Schools in this agency to attend the convention, I would be glad to have your decision before September 1st, in order that I may inform the teachers accordingly.

Lee Fraser, Indian Agent, Rexton, N.B.\n\nMiss Delphine Murphy, teacher of the Bel Ground School, has recently written a letter to the Minister requesting financial assistance in the matter of transportation to and from the school to her home. A somewhat similar request was received recently from another source and at that time we decided to increase Miss Murphy's salary by $50 a year. In this regard I would refer you to my letter of June 10.\n\nAs you are probably aware, Miss Murphy had an accident some years ago and, although we did not wish to re-appoint her to the Bel Ground School, she insisted on obtaining that school and we reluctantly acceded to her request. It is very unusual for teachers of Indian day schools to write to the Minister, as the Departmental officials are at all times willing to reasonably consider requests from teachers. The Department wishes you to see Miss Murphy at the earliest possible date and point out to her that if she is not satisfied with conditions now existing at Bel Ground it would be advisable for her to apply for a transfer to some other school.\n\nIn her letter to the Minister Miss Murphy states that it will cost her $2.50 a day for transportation during the academic year 1944-45. If this figure is correct, the Department cannot understand how Miss Murphy can afford to pay the amount. Certainly it is not our intention to increase her salary more than the amount about which you have already been advised.\n\nR.A.

I wish to continue my work there but owing to war conditions transportation to and fro has become a problem. Next term I expect to pay $2.50 a day for unsatisfactory service at best, and I know you will agree with me that our salaries are not sufficient for such expense.\n\nAfter due consideration, I think that my problem would be solved if the Department would help me purchase a car that I could use for transportation, or help pay towards my transportation.\n\nI would be most grateful, dear Mr. Maloney, if you would write the Government in my behalf and acquaint them with this matter.\n\nI wish to thank you in advance, and trust to receive a favorable reply at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

It is impossible to procure board and lodgings at or near Bel Ground and as a result, she has to reside at home. The distance from her home to Bel Ground and return, is about 11 miles. I believe she has 42 pupils which is about equal to the number at Burnt Church, where they have two teachers. However, she is not complaining about the number of pupils and wishes to continue with the school, but she feels the Department should meet part of the cost of transportation.\n\nI feel her request is very reasonable and I would appreciate your very kind consideration in her behalf.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Maloney.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nJune 14, 1944\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nDel Ground Indian Day School.\nre: Miss Delphine Murphy,\nTeacher.\n\nWe have had correspondence recently from Miss Murphy, also on her behalf, in regard to her request for some financial assistance in the matter of transportation to and from school to her home.\n\nAttached is a confidential letter from Mr. J.W.

On May 14, 1940, Miss Murphy, while on her way home from school, was assaulted by a certain unknown person, or persons, with the result that she was seriously injured and required hospital and medical care for a number of months. Immediately following her recovery Miss Murphy petitioned the Department for a transfer and was given the position of teacher at the Cromocto Indian Day School. For some reason or another known only to herself, Miss Murphy became dissatisfied with conditions on the Cromocto Reserve and requested to be retransferred to Bel Ground. In this connection I am sending forward, for your information, copies of correspondence that took place between Miss Murphy and the Department at that time. The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nJ.W. Maloney, Esq.,\nNewcastle, N.B.\nMiss Murphy was given an increase in salary in 1942 and will receive an additional increase this year. In other words, Miss Murphy will receive, during the academic year 1944-45, the highest salary paid to an Indian day school teacher in the Province of New Brunswick. This salary will amount to $35 a month, regular salary, plus $14.45, cost-of-living bonus, or a total of $99.45.\n\nWe have never at any time purchased automobiles for the use of Indian day school teachers and I regret that it is not possible to even seriously consider this suggestion in view of the critical period in which we now find ourselves. It is just possible, in view of all the circumstances, that Miss Murphy might well be advised by her friends to seek a new position, preferably in a well-established white settlement in the province.\n\nMay I, however, thank you for your interest in this matter and for the courtesy that prompted you to bring it to my personal attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRAH\n\nIndian Affairs.

Children health and well-dressed. The attendance during September and October was interrupted as a number of children accompanied their parents to Maine to pick potatoes. On their return to the reserve a number of the older boys stayed away from school to cut Christmas trees. These children being absent from school for such a long period interferes with the teacher's work as practically all the lessons must be reviewed and gone over on their return making it impossible for the teacher to obtain the results that she should. Instructions were issued to the Chief to advise the parents of the boys cutting Christmas Trees that they must return to school immediately. There may have been some excuse to permit school children to go to Maine to harvest the potato crop as a war effort. Now, however, the family Allowances, I would strongly recommend that agents in the maritime Provinces, as well as Eastern Quebec, be informed that this practice henceforth must be discontinued. As the branch is providing good schools with capable instructors then we must insist that the children attend regularly during the full school term.\n\nChief Dan Paul stated that it was impossible to obtain the services of an Indian man as janitor for the school for the small sum of $50.00 a year. During the past two or three years Miss Murphy, the teacher, was going to school early in the morning to get fires started, and she was allowed the amount of $50.00 in addition to her regular salary for doing this work. Miss Murphy is most anxious to be relieved of this task, and as a man could not be obtained for the amount allotted arrangements were made that a fourteen year old school boy - Reginal Winish - living adjacent to the school - would look after the fires for the amount\n\n(over)\nprovided. Reginald is a strong, sturdy, boy, and is quite capable of doing the work. Miss Murphy appears to be quite competent, very interested in her work, and has full control of the children at all times.\n\nJ.E. Morris,\nWelfare Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 13th. File-55-3-1, I would say that I visited Miss Delphine Murphy, teacher of the Bel Ground Dya School, at her home in Newcastle, on June 18th, and pointed out to her that it was very unethical for an ordinary employee of the Department to approach the Minister with matters which in their logical course should be handled through the Indian agents office. I feel that Miss Murphy should already have known the proper course to pursue in matters pertaining to schools.\n\nIt is however my belief that in this particular case Miss Murphy had been badly advised, first by a former employee of the Department, whose policy has always been to go directly to the Minister and secondly by the party who enclosed Miss Murphy's letter with one of his own to the Minister.\n\nMiss Murphy when I spoke to her was quite willing to carry on next year with the increase of $50 mentioned in your letter of June 10th, and of which I informed her on June 12th by letter.\n\nI feel that in the future Miss Murphy will direct any requests she may have to make, through the proper channels.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 16, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Maloney:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your confidential letter of June 12 and also letter dated June 6, 1944, received by you from Miss Delphine Murphy, teacher at the Bel Ground Indian Day School.\n\nI may state that this is the third letter I have received in the last few days, all of which asked that special consideration be given to the request for an increased salary or allowance sent forward to the Department by this teacher.\n\nI may state briefly that Miss Delphine Murphy was teacher at the Bel Ground Indian Day School during the school year 1939-40. On May 14, 1940, Miss Murphy, while on her way home from school, was assaulted by a certain unknown person, or persons, with the result that she was seriously injured and required hospital and medical care for a number of months. Immediately following her recovery Miss Murphy petitioned the Department for a transfer and was given the position of teacher at the Oromocto Indian Day School. For some reason or another known only to herself, Miss Murphy became dissatisfied with conditions on the Oromocto Reserve and requested to be retransferred to Bel Ground. In this connection I am sending forward, for your information, copies of correspondence that took place between Miss Murphy and the Department at that time. The subject matter of this correspondence, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nJ. W. Maloney, Esq.,\nNewcastle, N.B.\nMiss Murphy was given an increase in salary in 1942 and will receive an additional increase this year. In other words, Miss Murphy will receive, during the academic year 1944-45, the highest salary paid to an Indian day school teacher in the Province of New Brunswick. This salary will amount to $85 a month, regular salary, plus $14.45, cost-of-living bonus, or a total of $99.45.\n\nWe have never at any time purchased automobiles for the use of Indian day school teachers and I regret that it is not possible to even seriously consider this suggestion in view of the critical period in which we now find ourselves. It is just possible, in view of all the circumstances, that Miss Murphy might well be advised by her friends to seek a new position, preferably in a well-established white settlement in the province.\n\nMay I, however, thank you for your interest in this matter and for the courtesy that prompted you to bring it to my personal attention.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRAH\nTo enable this file to be made available to researchers it has been necessary for IAND officials to exclude some material in accordance with Cabinet Directive No. 46 of 7 June 1973.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nCLOSED FILE\n\nFILE NUMBER 277-1 VOLUME 2\n\nSUBJECT EEL GROUND\nDAY SCHOOL\nGENERAL\n\nCORRESPONDENCE FROM MAY 1936\nTO Aug 1948\n\nNO FURTHER CORRESPONDENCE\nTO BE PLACED ON THIS FILE\n\nNOTE: For subsequent correspondence relevant to the subject matter of this closed file see\nFILE 277-1 VOLUME 3\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs\nSchool Files\n\n(RG 10, Volume 6062)\n\nFile 276-8, part 1\nNew Brunswick East - Burnt Church - Teachers' Residence - Establishment - Blueprint - maintenance - Supplies - Accounts. 1915 - 1916, 1923.\n\nFile 277-1, part 1\nNew Brunswick East - Eel Ground School - Teachers - General Administration. 1894 - 1932.\n\nFile 277-1, part 2\nNew Brunswick East - Eel Ground School - General Administration. 1936 - 1948.\n\nFile 277-3, part 1\nNew Brunswick East - Eel Ground School - Teacher's Salaries. 1912 - 1934, 1942 - 1944.\nProvince of New Brunswick\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\n\nTEACHERS' SALARIES\n\nFOR QUARTER ENDED March 31, 1913\n\n| NAME OF TEACHER | NAME OF SCHOOL | Annual Grant or Salary | Amount Due | Address to which Cheque is to be sent |\n|-----------------|---------------|------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Margaret Isaac  | Del Crounch   | $400 - $100            |            |                                      |\n\nNo. of School days in quarter ...........................................\nNo. days School was open ..................................................\nNo. holidays ............................................................................\nGrant asked for ........................................................................\n\nRemarks:\n\nCertified correct -\n8-4-13.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct.\n\nSupt. or Agent.\n\nNOTE.\u2014The number of school days in the quarter and the number of days for which payment is asked should be stated; payment will only be made for days school was open and authorized holidays.\n\nForm 14.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nIn reply to your letter of June 27th, File 55-3-5 referring to repairs and cleaning of the school room and teachers residence on the Bel Ground reserve, I beg to state that cleaning of this building is necessary, and it will cost about $25.00, to provide the material and kalsomine the interior of the school room and teachers residence, wash the walls, scrub floors and entire woodwork of the interior of the whole building, and also oil the floors.\n\nI can have the toilets cleaned and whitewashed by the Indians without any cost to the Department.\n\nRegarding the bed and other furniture, I think that if two chairs were furnished and about $2.00 worth of dishes supplied, that possibly this would suffice. The bed is not new but still I think it should be alright. If a new one was purchased it will cost about $8.00.\n\nThe pump can be repaired for about $5.00. To carry out all the suggestions in your letter of June 27th, will take about $50.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 8, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the first instant, I beg to say that you may arrange for the necessary repairs and cleaning at the Eel Ground Indian Day School and teacher's residence.

Probably an Officer of the Department might visit this agency next summer, when he could decide whether it would be better to build a new school house, or enlarge the old one.\n\nI might state that the roof of the above named building will have to be shingled next year.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nChas.

As no funds were provided in this year's appropriation for a new building, it is not possible to consider such action at the present time. However, if it is later found that a new building is required, the provision of funds for its erection can be further considered when preparing our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40.\n\nFrom the last paragraph of your letter, I note that you consider the present school should be reshingled and some other repairs and alterations made. Our funds are extremely limited, but you might let me have an estimate of the cost of the work that you consider absolutely necessary. If the material required will cost over $50.00, you should let me have detailed information in this connection, in order that the order may be placed through our Purchasing Branch.\n\nFunds at our disposal will not permit giving favourable consideration to painting the building this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.

In construction, it might be well if a rolling partition could be so arranged that if required, it might be used, making in this way two class rooms.\n\nIt could be built in wood.\n\nThe old school should be retained in a dormitory, breezeway hall, etc., or if required, the school be used as a primary department.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF SITE AND CONDITIONS; SUBMIT PLAN; NORTH POINT:\n\nNATURE OF SOIL, DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS AND ANY OTHER PARTICULARS:\n\nTop soil sandy, subsoil clay or shellrock, sandstone base. Basement will require a drain silted to cess pool that could be near school, or to river 350 yds. from school.\n\nShould be concrete foundation large enough for installation of furnaces and boilers if flush-boilers used, also for wood supply.\n\nWATER SUPPLY: SYSTEM REQUIRED; SOURCE OF WATER, ETC.\n\nWater would have to be obtained from a well and which will have to be drilled near school at a depth of not more than 35 ft.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We do not wish to provide living accommodation at the school if it is not necessary.\n\nWe do not favour supplying a cess pool at an Indian day school. Our experience shows that they are continually going out of order and extra expense is entailed. Would it not be possible to locate the school in such a manner that there would be natural drainage?\n\nIt is not our intention to supply flush toilets in the basement.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRichibucto, N.B.\nJan. 25th,\n1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 20th instant File 55-3-5 referring to erection of a new school on the Eel Ground Reserve, and in reply beg to inform you with regard to teachers' quarters, that I do not consider it necessary to have such an addition to the school, as there is a very fair teachers' residence attached to the old school; I also will add that these quarters have not been used by the teachers for about eight years, as they board with white people near the reserve; but they are in good repair and fit for occupation if needed.\n\nWith regard to toilets, flush bowls were suggested by the Inspector of Indian schools, but my own opinion is that outdoor toilets for this school would be quite suitable, and if these were supplied instead of flush toilets, there would be no need of a cesspool or a long drain.\n\nIf a furnace is installed, and this will necessarily have to be in the basement, we might have to construct an ordinary drain of about 100 feet in length, to keep the basement dry, but I am not sure of this. How would it be to leave the drain until after the school is erected and we find whether it is needed or not. It would not be an expensive job and would not cost any more a little later than it would now. It would take quite a little survey work to determine whether water would lodge in the basement or not, but as the building will be erected on an incline to the river, I do not believe it will.\n\nWith regard to the rolling partition, it was a recommendation of the Inspector of Indian schools and with every respect for his suggestion, but I do not think it is necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept., of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nSir\nyour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\nRichibucto, N.B.\nJan. 25th,\n1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to schools of the Bel Ground Reserve, it might be opportune to mention the repair and painting of the old school, if it is to be used for domestic science and manual training departments.\n\nThe roof of this building will need shingling, and the whole exterior painted. The cost would be about $225.00.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nPROPOSED BUILDING DATA\n\nNAME OF BUILDING: Eel Ground Indian Day School\n\nLOCATION: Eel Ground Indian Reserve\n\nN.B.

Under these circumstances I do not see any necessity for keeping the old school. Only one teacher is employed and it would be very inconvenient to have to go from one building to another. The only portion of the old building that is really required is the section that will be made available for teacher's living accommodation. Please give this matter your immediate attention and let me have your comments. If our suggestion meets with your approval it should not be necessary to expend the amount which you mention for shingling and painting the old building.\n\nYours truly,\n\nChas.

The teachers quarters in this building are a part of the structure, and could not be separated with any satisfaction, from the main building. But if it was it would cost as much as it would to repair the entire old building. In fact if the teacher's residence part of the building was separated from the main structure, it could not be made suitable for a residence at all.\n\nI would not like to make any suggestion that would cause you to change your plan for this school, but it not be as well to use the old building for the domestic science and manual training room, and use the basement of the new building for the purpose of storing fuel. The basement then need not be so expensively constructed and enough expense saved in this way to repair the old building. It probably will not take the full amount of $225.00 for the repair that is necessary. This old building is a very good structure and needs only the roof shingled and a coat of paint.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 15, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant with reference to digging a well at the Bel Ground Indian day school.

As pointed out in my letter of February 2 it is considered that the most convenient method for the teacher is to have the domestic science and manual training taught in the basement of the new school.\n\nIt appears from your letters that any repairs that might be required at the present school building are not urgent and as the Chief of the Training Division expects to visit New Brunswick at the end of May this matter can be brought to his attention at that time. It will then be decided what should be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.

However, if the upstairs location of the teacher's room is not considered desirable, Scheme B shows an alternative arrangement with this room adjacent to the classrooms. You will note, however, that to keep the size of these two buildings equal, it has been necessary to reduce the size of the coat rooms to the absolute minimum. By increasing the size of the building about five feet and making the coat rooms the same size as in Scheme A, the cost of the building would be increased by approximately $500.00.\n\nIt is the opinion of our Architects that Scheme A would be more suitable for this type of school, provided that the upstairs location of the teacher's room is acceptable.\n\nThe cost of these buildings is estimated at approximately $5,100.00, funds for which it is understood are to be provided under the 1929-40 Estimates. I would be pleased if you would kindly submit these plans to the Indian Affairs Branch for their consideration. If either of the layouts is satisfactory, one copy of the drawings should be signed as approved and returned to this office as soon as possible in order that the working drawings and specifications can be prepared. Any additions or minor changes desired should be noted on the approved drawing so that they may be given proper consideration in the preparation of the final plans.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.M.

This building has stood there (an eyesore to the place) until about a week ago when I had Dan Paul, Peter Barnaby, and another Indian John Battust of the Bel Ground Reserve to undertake the job of taking down and removing the debris. These men have the building partly dismantled and now a number of other Indians have joined together and won't let this work proceed. I would like to have definite orders from you as to what course to take in order that this job can be completed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept., of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 26th instant in which you intimate that a number of Indians have joined together to prevent the dismantling of the old abandoned school on the Eel Ground Reserve.\n\nIt is difficult for the officials here to understand or interpret correctly this attitude on the part of the Indians. It would appear from this distance to be an expression of lawlessness. The matter is one that should be taken up immediately with the police. If these Indians are attempting to arrest, in any way, the work at the school, or if they are interfering in any way with the work of dismantling the building, the police should be notified and these Indians arrested and brought before a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I instructed her to have Mr. Maltby make the repairs but I was under the impression that there was only one grate needed. However when he took the furnace down he found the whole firebox had to be built over and he renewed the whole firebox.\n\nThe bill was forwarded to this office late in December and I was rather surprised at the amount of same. When Dr. McGill visited the Agency he told me that I would probably be called into Ottawa some time in January. I therefore decided that I would hold the bill and would give a verbal account to the proper branch if called to Ottawa. Since I have not been called in I am forwarding the bill with the recommendation that it be paid, as the work was absolutely necessary.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 28, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nI attach account amounting to $60.80 covering the cost of dismantling and repairing the furnace at the Eel Ground Indian Day School.

Appearance: dignified, always attractive and lasting. For the reason that brick buildings associate with any surroundings, brick construction is the most attractive in any situation. Ornate concrete, stone or terra cotta buildings are out of place in the average town of the Maritime Provinces. They are too \"new.\"\n\n(B.) Durability: practically speaking, brick lasts forever. The life of a well made brick building is endless. Brick buildings do not require the upkeep and repairs of other buildings.\n\n(C.) Economy in construction, maintenance and insurance rates. Costs little, if any, more to build with brick than with wood. Brick is cheaper than stone for construction.\n\n(D.) Fire resistance. Brick is the greatest known fire resisting material. Concrete and stone buildings are fireproof and non-crumbling, but only the brick chimney standing. Bricks are put through a process of heat and manufacture which does not apply to the same degree.

Now it's not fit to look at, also about painting if the specification did not state to have the window shades painted I think they should be.\n\nI trust the department will see to this.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPeter Venass\nTruant Officer of\nCold Ground School\nCold Ground\nN.B.\nOttawa, September 30, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the building of the new teacher's residence at Eel Ground school, the Department has been informed that the contractor has not finished the painting as required by the specifications, particularly the window sashes, and that the premises have been left in a very untidy condition.\n\nI have to request that you report on this matter immediately.

You may also purchase and have installed 5 window blinds of the dimensions required. We note that you estimate the total cost of furnishing the above supplies to be approximately $25. Please forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to tell you of a few things necessary in dwelling attached to Elginwood school.\n\nIn the first place, the pump, which was installed last Christmas, has been out of order ever since. You see, the cellar is an icehouse in the winter, and the pump froze, but fortunately the pipes didn't burst. And after it thawed out, when we went to pump, the water instead of coming out the spout, went all over the floor. What it needs is a new rubber, and the nuts tightened. Everyone who sees it says pump is no good anyway. I don't think myself it is, as nuts will not stay tight. A point is needed, but Mr. Hudson told me he was going to try for a stint. Also the floors here are in a bad condition. They are badly worn in some places, and paint wears right off. Hardwood flooring is needed for down stairs, and it would take very little, the house is costing.\n\nThen we haven't a blind on any of the four windows. I think Mr. Hudson ordered them.\nbut through some mistake they didn't come.\n\nAnother thing Elginwood is badly in need of, no a telephone. It would take about five days to bring wire from main highway to here. When we want a telephone we've got to go a distance of 2 miles. We badly needed a Dr. badly on two occasions during night, but having no telephone, I had to wait until morning.\n\nNow Mr. Terrell knows you'll be thinking I'm acting too much, but if you'll consider cost, you'll find it won't amount to very much, and what comfort those things would give to any teacher staying here.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKatherine O'Hea\n\nP.S. Mr. Terrell received word from you stating you were having Red Cross Junior papers sent to this school, but up to date have received no copies.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1925.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, regarding the present condition of the pump at the Eel Ground Indian Day School, and requesting that a sink be installed and the floors in the residence part of the school be refloored with hardwood.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are referring these matters to Mr. Agent Hudson, with the request that he take immediate steps to have the pump placed in a serviceable condition. We are also requesting him to report as to the cost of installing a sink and laying the hardwood flooring.\n\nMr. Hudson was authorized to arrange for the purchase and delivery of 2 screen doors and 4 screens for the windows of the teacher's residence. He will, no doubt, attend to this matter in the near future.\n\nRegarding the telephone, I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to authorize the installation of a telephone, which is not supplied to our schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss Katherine O'Shea,\nTeacher, Eel Ground Indian Day School,\nNorthwest Bridge P.O.,\nN.B.\nOttawa, May 28th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from the teacher of the Eel Ground Indian Day School in which she draws attention to the present condition of the pump. She states that it has been out of order since it was installed last Christmas, and that she was informed that it is unserviceable. She also requests that a sink be installed in the kitchen and that hardwood floors be laid in the downstairs portion of the residence.\n\nI have to request that you will give immediate attention to having the pump placed in a serviceable condition. If the present pump is unsatisfactory, you may purchase and have installed a new pump of a type satisfactory to meet the requirements. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the cost.\n\nPlease report as to whether you would advise that a sink be installed, also the hardwood flooring asked for by the teacher. If you recommend that this work be carried out, please furnish an estimate of the cost of installing the sink and hardwood flooring.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will arrange to purchase the 2 screen doors and 4 screens for the windows which you were authorized in our letter of the 26th instant to supply.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nIn reply to your letter of May 28th concerning a communication from the teacher of the Eel Ground Indian Day School saying that the pump was not in a serviceable condition, I would say that I intended to examine this pump when I next visited Eel Ground, and find what repairs it needed: The pump worked perfect when it was installed, I am sure of this as I examined it at the time; the teacher also told me that it was fine. The trouble is, that it was necessary, in very cold weather, to let the priming out of it at night, this she neglected to do, the consequence was that it froze and split the piping. I will have it repaired at once.\n\nI think it would be advisable for me to go up to the reserve in connection with the installing of the sink and placing hardwood floor in the residence, as I don't think it is necessary to do either. I would have to examine the place before making any recommendation, especially for the sink, as it would mean also a cess-pool and this would make it necessary to expend two or three hundred dollars; I think that she could get along without the sink and hardwood floor, but I would not be sure until I would make an examination.\n\nI have already arranged for the screen doors and windows for this residence at Eel Ground.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 8th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 2nd instant, regarding the installing of a sink and the placing of hardwood flooring in the residence of the teacher of the Eel Ground Indian Day School, I beg to say that if by the installing of a sink it would also be necessary to have a cess pool, the Department would not be prepared to authorize the expense, and agrees with you that the teacher could very well get along without the sink.\n\nYou should furnish a report as to whether you would advise that hardwood flooring be laid or not.\n\nWe note you will see that the pump is placed in good condition, also that you have arranged for the supplying of screen doors and windows for the use of the teacher's residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 8th, regarding the installing of a sink and laying of hardwood floors in the teachers residence at the Eel Ground Indian Reserve, I would say that after examining the place where the sink would have to be placed I find that it could be connected with the drain from the cellar, which would make it unnecessary to have a cess-pool, and would reduce the expense very much.\n\nI would recommend that it is necessary to have a hardwood floor in the downstairs part of this residence. The cost of installing a sink and laying hardwood floor in this house would be approximately $110.00 This will cover cost of material and expense of labour.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 23rd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, giving an estimate of the cost of laying a hardwood floor and installing a sink in the teacher's living quarters at the Eel Ground Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of having this work done. It is to be understood that the flooring is only to be laid in the downstairs part of the residence. You should arrange for the purchase and delivery of all material required, obtaining competitive prices if possible. You should arrange for competent labour in the laying of the flooring and the installing of the sink. We note that this sink can be connected with the drain from the cellar. You should make sure that sufficient drainage will be provided from the cellar drain. The cost of the material and labour should be kept down to the lowest possible point, and you should furnish properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the material, such as flooring, nails, sink and any pipe required, also properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost of the labour employed. The total cost should not exceed your estimate of $110. This work should be done during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas.

With the small number of children of school age shown in your Census return, the Department does not see how it would be possible to keep up a sufficient attendance to justify the establishment of a school and the payment of a teacher's salary. As however, it does not wish these children to grow up in ignorance, it would be willing to pay a tuition grant for any of them who would attend white schools in the neighborhood, and it would like you to make enquiries in this direction.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs.

(RG 10, Volume 6063, file 278-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir;-\n\nI have the honour to report that the Indians of the Kel River Band, Restigouche County, N.B. as well as the Reverend Father Boucher, the Missionary of this Band, are desirous of having a school house built and a teacher engaged. In conversation with Father Boucher, he informed me that he would like to have a building that could be used for a school house and chapel as well. He thought a building of about 40 x 25 feet, which would cost in the vicinity of $2,000 would be sufficient. I promised him to refer this matter to the Department for its consideration and am now writing you in reference to the same. I feel that if arrangements could be made whereby a building could be built for this band which would give them a school house and also a place of worship that it would be of considerable advantage to the members of this Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 2, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo in reference to the establishment of a school for the Bel River Indians.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department desires fuller information before it can come to any decision in this matter. You should state the number of families with the number of children of school age in each family who could attend the school and the distance that they would have to go; also whether there are white schools which they might attend and, if so, what distance they would have to travel in this case. You should also state whether these Indians are all permanently located. If the conditions are such as to warrant the expenditure the Department will be prepared to consider the matter of establishing a school. I may say, however, that the sum of money mentioned in your letter would hardly put up a modern building.

Should a school be established, upon the reserve, the distance that the children would have to go to attend school would not at the furthest be over a few hundred yards while the white schools which these children might attend, are located from two to three miles distance from the reserve. A suitable building upon the reserve centrally located can be procured for this purpose of opening a school, at a monthly rental of five dollars per month, should it be decided necessary to do so.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 12, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant reporting more fully upon the conditions at the Eel River Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that these would appear to be such as to warrant the establishment on trial of a school for the children of these Indians. I have to ask you, therefore, to be good enough to obtain as soon as possible an estimate of the cost of fitting up the building to which you refer and to make inquiries regarding the services of a suitable teacher. Any applications that you receive should be forwarded to the Department for consideration.\n\nIt is thought that the rental of the building should not exceed $50.00 per annum, which would be a fair amount, provided it is in good condition and suitable for the purpose. It will be necessary to obtain a lease of this building for at least two years, which should be sufficient time to see whether the Indians are earnest in their desire to have a school established.\n\nI may state that the Department is communicating by concurrent mail with Rev. Father Ryan and asking him to make inquiries with a view to obtaining a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nR. A. Irving, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nBuctouche, N.B.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nRev. Sir,\n\nSometime ago Rev. Father Boucher applied to Mr. Superintendent Irving for the establishment of a day school on the Bel River Reserve. The Department requested Mr. Irving to make inquiries and his report is now to hand. This shows that conditions are such as to warrant the Department in giving a school on the reserve a trial as there is a building that can be rented for school purposes.\n\nIt will be necessary to obtain the services of a teacher before definite action is taken to lease a building or furnish it and I would ask you to make inquiries and submit any applications that you receive to the Department for consideration. Mr. Irving is being asked to do the same thing. It might be that the Missionary, Father Boucher, would have someone in view who would take up this work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. J.

I wrote to Miss Troubly to see if she may come many months. I got busy and found yesterday an excellent teacher Miss Genevieve Fitzgerald who at present was teaching at the convent taking higher studies. However, she will take this school until June. I think Miss Troubly should not return to the said school until next Sept.

Miss Tremblay has written twice to Dr. Meltonson, the last got letter she got from him was that she was coming up to Campbellton.\nand I would call in to see her\nto come to Campbellton but did\nnot call in so Miss Freckley\ndoes not know just what to do.

A. Melvin\nTuberculosis Diagnostician\nI had considerable trouble in having Miss Tremblay take the examination. She complained about the extra expense and was very tired & weak and she had no particular trouble. Her own letter to me just after the test said, stated she found some sort trouble. Mr. Hartt also is improving and even wanted her father, he said than Jane but I send her to a Sanitarium, and not allow her to teach this term. All this seems forgotten at the present; the one only thing of any importance now is the old school and a position to earn. It would also seem by her complaint that she desired either herself or the Dist. Ref. to pay her expenses & her examination.\n\nThese few lines may explain the situation in full.

She has my child away in subtraction and division for a child only seven years old and she don't explain the work to the children. She's a teacher that has no heart for the Indian kids.\nif your fellows only knew what sort of a teacher we have around he surprise. It's awful. We should have a new teacher. This one is too long on her job she thinks she's the real boss here. No mother likes to see her child abused by another, even though we are Indians we have our feelings too, every one is kicking about this teacher. I wouldn't mind if my child was old enough to understand and then she's a puny little thing, I tell you if I have to take my child to a doctor for the bruises she made on my child I'm going to make it snappy for her.\nEven in the winter if the kids pull their caps over their ears she takes them in school and beats them up and put them down on their knees for hours. Do you think that's any sense into that? The kids come home some days their clothes all dirt from her not leaving out to the toilet she uses the kids more than dogs.\n\nI brought my child to the police, Mr. Burton, and he says it's a shame the way my child is treated.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\nMrs. Peter Wm.

I have interviewed the police constable, to whom Mrs. Harvie showed the child, and he says there was a very slight red mark on the child but nothing worth mentioning, and the child herself says that she was not hurt. Mrs. Harvie admits that the punishment was not severe, but that she was mad when she wrote the letter.\n\nIn regard to Mrs. Peter W. Harvie I might say that she is one Indian that is always trying to find some fault to report to the Department. She writes many letters of complaints, to me, about almost everything about the reserve, and I very seldom find any truth in them.\n\nI am returning Mrs. Harvie's letter to you.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 4, 1932.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 16th ultimo, complaining of the treatment received by your daughter from the teacher of the Eel River Indian Day School, I have to say it was found, upon enquiry, that there were no grounds for your complaint.

In reply I beg to inform you that I am acquainted with the situation and have to say that the complaint of this Indian is entirely without reason. This letter has been written by Peter Martin's wife, who is the sort of woman than never agrees with anyone, nor anything; she finds fault with every teacher and tries to annoy them in every way.\n\nIn the case above the teacher has a suit of light overalls for each boy who attends school, and these she gives them to wear at school but they do not take them home, and this is what Peter Martin's wife does not like, she thinks that the boys should take these overalls home and wear them all the time. She also does not approve of the teacher having any material for domestic science work, but says that the material should be given to the Indians to make up instead of the teacher. This Mrs. Peter Martin is just a trouble maker on the reserve, and I know her husband knows nothing of her letter to you.\n\nI am returning the Indians letter as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Indian Agent\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF REV.

I feel they are poor and are anxious to get along. Their home is near the school or rather the reserve, and all this prevents her from taking a much needed rest.\n\nHowever, as I said in this paper, she must gain her health much better to be able to take up her duties in this school by Sept. next.

The Department considers that, if Miss Tremblay does not regain her health and is not able to teach continuously without having to close the school at frequent intervals on account of illness, it would be advisable to dispense with her services and engage a qualified teacher for the coming academic year. If, after you receive the report of the doctor who examines her, you consider a change of teacher should be made, you should notify Miss Tremblay that her services will not be further required and you should then nominate a qualified teacher to succeed her.\n\nThe Department will leave this matter in your hands, to take the action which you consider advisable regarding the teaching services at this school for the coming academic year.

For years I have been engaged as teacher of the Indian School in Kelowna. I have on file a letter from the Indian Agent, dated June 15th, stating that the Dept. informed me that I was to remain in charge of the school for the year 1936-37. Believing myself re-engaged I did not apply for other schools.\naccepting for three I had applied for in May and I refused accepting the Summeride School in Darlington so I felt I was now bound to keep the Indian School and also because I was content with my former position.\n\nJuly 15th. Received a letter from Mr. T. C. Ryan, the Inspector of Indian Schools stating that he had engaged a first class teacher in my stead. He also stated that when he inspected the school that he had told me this was to be done. This is not so, I am sorry to say. He did say that the Dept. intended reducing the number of reserves in N.B. to four and in that case it would be better for the teachers to look for other schools, but I asked him if no such change were made if I would be re-engaged, he said \"yes so far as I know.\"\nI do not know what report was made against me but I have discharged my duties just as faithfully as usual and do not feel guilty about my conduct.\n\nAs you see that I have lost all chances of obtaining another position as it is now too late so I was discharged July the 24th only, could you be so kind as to use your influence to obtain for me a position with the Indian Dept such as clerking in the Book Dept, or a librarian or any such work even though the salary would not be very high.\n\nThanking you so much.\n\nI am,\n\nYours most obliged,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hartney\n\nI, the undersigned chairman of the above school board cannot find words by which to express myself to the good character and ability of Miss Hartney who has been our teacher for the past 3 years. The good care taken of the school property, the good discipline used in the school and the kindness and love of her heart shown to all pupils at all times are only a few of her good qualities. And for the past 26 years or more that I have been a trustee of the school the closing exercises of the school each year and the...\nwonderful advancement made by the pupils under her good care and management were the best I ever witnessed. In saying the very least Miss Hartney is well worth the money paid to her by my school Board employing her as their teacher.\n\nYours Very Sincerely,\n\nAugustine Williams\nChairman of S.Brook\n\n7A R no 2, Chalk corn\nAPPLICATION.\n\nFor Position in New Brunswick Indian Schools.\n(To be forwarded to \"Inspector of Indian Schools\",\nRed Bank, Northumberland County, New Brunswick).\n\nPosition for which application is made Any Indian School\n\nApplicant's name in full Bernette Mary Wesley\n\nP.

This, in itself, is hardly sufficient reason to presume that she would be unsatisfactory, particularly as she holds a first class licence and has had three years' experience.

The changing of this date to Sept. 1, with the month of January taken off, leaving the school opened for a new months' period as ordered, is, I consider, a profitable change for the following reasons:\n\n(1) During the first month of school, the attendance at school is always larger than during the cold month of January. The fact that the children are poorly clothed accounts for this.\n\n(2) Closing schools for the duration of the month of January would mean a considerable saving in fuel.\n\n(3) From my experience as a teacher, I am not in favour of too long holidays. Three months' holidays without interruption, is too long for the average rural school.\n\nI hope that my application will be considered favourably, but should the department decide otherwise, I shall abide by its decision.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nAlice M. Heppeil.\nRestigouche, July 7, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to include three letters received from Miss Alice Heppeil, teacher of the Eel River Indian Day School, which talk by themselves upon different questions concerning the school for next year.\n\nI am recommending these three questions to be approved by the Department.\n\nDalhousie Convent charged $12.00 per month, board and teaching.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJuly 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant enclosing letter from the teacher of the Eel River School suggesting that this school be open during the month of September and closed during the month of January.\n\nVery careful consideration has been given by Departmental officials to the opening and closing dates of Indian day schools during the coming academic year and it has been decided that all Indian day schools should open on October 1, 1941, and close on June 30, 1942.\n\nA review of the quarterly returns during the period the schools were open for ten months does not indicate that the attendance during the month of September at the Eel River School was any higher than it was during the month of January.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nUpper Charles, N.B.\nJan. 17, 1942\n\nMr. Harold W. McGill,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nLast spring, I took a War Savings Pledge to have four dollars deducted from my monthly pay. In November, I received another appeal for you to take a War Savings Pledge and I filled the enclosed form and returned to you requesting that my first pledge be changed to one of eight dollars. This change hasn't been effected yet but I have received a U.S. Certificate deducted from October's pay.\n\nI would like to know whether an error is being made in making these deductions or am I getting a bonus? My pay remains approximately the same.\n\nMaybe I should address this letter to some other branch of the Department, perhaps you don't deal with such matters but I would be very grateful to you if you investigated this matter and let me know just why deduction is being made in my salary other than for National Defence Tax. As a teacher in an Indian Day School, I am entitled to seventy dollars a month. With or without deductions for War...\nSavings my cheques have never exceeded $66.\n\nWith my first cheque in 1940, I received a memo informing me that 5% was being deducted from my pay from the Retirement Fund. I suppose I am considered a Civil Servant. Does that mean that if, at any appropriate time, I should wish to, I may seek the required examination, get a transfer to some Department in the Civil Service at Ottawa?\n\nI am not writing this letter because I believe I am not getting my due, but just because I'm anxious to know just what deductions are being made in my salary and why taking a $4 War Savings Pledge didn't lower my October cheque (I have not received any certificates for November or December).\n\nThanking you for whatever information you may give me,\n\nYours truly,\n(Mrs) A.M.

I am, therefore, enclosing new forms which must be completed and correct information given. You should also state in your reply whether this teacher is married or single and before returning the forms you should make certain that the proper information has been supplied.\n\nR.A.

The special enameling process operated at a temperature of 1500\u00b0 Fahrenheit, produces a smooth, velvety finish which is satisfactory in every respect. This finish avoids all reflected light so objectionable in the ordinary high luster black Japan cast iron desk. The woodwork, which includes all tops, desk backs and seats, is of the best Hard Maple selected for its degrees of grain and wearing quality, and is regularly finished a rich CHERRY COLOR.\n\nSaving in Transportation\n\nFreight charges are always an important item in the cost. There is a saving of as much as 25 per cent in the shipping weights of steel over the best cast iron desk. In addition to this initial saving, there are the added economies due to the complete elimination of breakage in transit, in setting up, and in usage; and the annoyance and time consumed in obtaining repairs.\n\nGuarantee\n\nIt has been customary to guarantee the ordinary cast iron desk from five to twenty-five years, but this does not protect the purchaser from the expense and annoyance of replacing breakage due to extra costs in transshipment and labor in setting up defective and noisy hinges. We have eliminated by the use of the finest materials all weaknesses such as breakage, noisy hinges, etc., and we give full guarantees of Steel Standard Desks, an additional guarantee against breakage for a lifetime.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | Size of Top | Range of Desk Adjustment | Range of Seat Adjustment | Floor Space | Ages Accommodated |\n|--------------|------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|-------------|------------------|\n|              | 23\u00bd x 16   | 26\u00bd x 32\u00bd                | 13 to 18                | 28 to 30    | 10 up            |\n|              | 22 x 11    | 26\u00bd x 32\u00bd                | 13 to 18                | 28 to 30    | 10 up            |\n|              | 19 x 9\u00be     | 26\u00bd x 32\u00bd                | 13 to 18                | 28 to 30    | 10 up            |\n|              | 16 x 8      | 26\u00bd x 32\u00bd                | 13 to 18                | 28 to 30    | 10 up            |\n|              | 17\u00bc x 12    | 26\u00bd x 32\u00bd                | 13 to 18                | 28 to 30    | 10 up            |\n\nAll Dimensions are in inches.\n\nMade also with either Lifting Lid or Sliding Top on each side.\n\nWOODS\u2014Top, Bookshelf, Back and Seat, Cherry Finish.\n\nSTEEL\u2014Book Box and Standards, Enamel Gun Metal Finish.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Every pupil should have a seat of such height that the feet rest easily on the floor. The desk should be high enough not to touch the knees, and yet allow sufficient space for school books within the desk top low enough for the arm to rest comfortably without much raising of the elbow. The neck should support the proper slope and sustain the correct angle with its back, which back should support the spinal column at the small of the back, also at a point just below the shoulder blades. The seat should be near enough so that the scholar may reach the desk for writing without leaning too far forward, and thus losing the support of his back. The seat should not be so close as to cause pressure against the side of the hip or rear end to interfere with easy sitting. It must be wide enough not to extend fourteen inches from the front edge of desk to seat back, and the seat must not project under the desk more than four inches.\n\nOur Stationery Desks are built in six sizes, one inch apart to meet the above conditions on the mouth of schools. Where more accurate adjustment is desirable, we would recommend Adjustable Chair Desk, which can be adjusted to the fraction of an inch in all directions, normal or otherwise.\n\nThe materials employed in desk construction, as mentioned elsewhere, are also important. The feet of desks should be so constructed as not to harbor germs or bacteria, and sufficient space allowed for thorough and efficient cleaning by either hand brush or vacuum methods. You will find all these demands are fully met by our GLOBE STEEL SANITARY DESKS.\n\nGLOBE STEEL ADJUSTABLE DESK AND CHAIR\n\nMade in Three Standard Sizes\n\n| DESK NUMBERS | All Dimensions are in Inches |\n|--------------|-----------------------------|\n| 1 or A       | 3 or B                      |\n| Size of Top  | 23\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 16      | 20\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 14 |\n| Size of Box  | 22 x 11                     | 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) x 12 |\n| Back Inside  | 19 x 9\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)       | 16 x 8                 |\n| Range of Desk Adjustment | 26\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 32\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 22\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 27\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Range of Chair Adjustment | 15 to 18\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) | 12\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) to 17\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) |\n| Floor Space  | 24 x 30                     | 21 x 27                |\n| Ages Accommodated | 10 up                      | 6 to 11               |\n\nMade Also with either Lifting Lid or Sliding Top in all sizes.\n\nWOODS\u2014Top, Back Shelf, Seat and Chair Rails, Cherry Finish.\n\nSTEEL\u2014Book Box, Standards and Pedestal, Enamelled Gun Metal Finish.\n\nTABLE OF SIZES\u2014All Dimensions are in inches.\nThis desk is designed to secure the maximum of comfort and efficiency.

The commissioner came today and he looked over the school and there is some repairing to be done and this work could be done by Indians any time that there is work about the school. There is always the old idea I mean the white people they always get the job which there is no need to get it done by\nThere is what ever that particular work that is to be done will notify Mr. Hudson but there is lot of work that we can do among our band and it will be better done that the outsiders would do any time the work is done by the outsiders its never half done and they send in an awful appeal to Dept. for it what ever work has been done before its always by the outsiders now I want to make a change whatever their is work to be done inside.\nI want to ask you to please ask Mr. Hobson to work to me for I am the head man in this reserve and I see that the work is done by outsiders it's not done right at all because if we don't get the work in our Reserve we will have to ask Dept. to give us more help because we have nothing to stand on for this is no work for the Indians and I am closing this letter I remain your truly James\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is communicating with Mr. Agent Hudson relative to your request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. James Pietou,\nBel River Reserve,\nDarlington P. O.,\nN. B.\nOttawa, June 23, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from James Pietou, of the Bel River Reserve, in which he requests that any repairs required to the school or other work on the reserve be given to the Indians to perform. He complains that all work is given to white people. I am informing you of this request, in order that the same will receive your consideration when any work is required to be carried out on the Bel River Reserve. Pietou is being advised that you are being communicated with in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nRev. Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the El River Indian Day School, recommends that the ceiling of the classroom be kalsomined, the interior woodwork washed and the floor scrubbed and oiled. The Inspector also states that new stove pipe is required, as the stovepipe at present in use is dangerous. He further states that the roof of the school building should be shingled.\n\nYou may arrange to have the kalsomining and cleaning and oiling of the floor carried out before the school re-opens after the summer holidays. You should also purchase and have installed any new stovepipe required. Accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nRelative to the shingling of the roof, I shall be pleased if you will forward a report as to the work you would advise be carried out, stating whether same is urgently needed. An estimate of the cost of the material and labour required should be given.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. P. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.;\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo referring to recommendation of Rev. Father Ryan, that the roof of the Indian Day School, Mel River Reserve, needs shingling, I have to say that this roof does need to be shingled. It was recommended last year that the roof of this building be shingled but the Department decided that it should wait until this year. It is now in very bad condition as some of the shingles have decayed and blown off, leaving the roof so that the water runs through when it rains.\n\nI would recommend that the roof be shingled, and given two coats of creosote stain. This job will cost about $70.00 for material and labour.\n\nI also have to recommend that the toilets of this school be cleaned and white-washed. The cost of this work will be $5.00.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Agent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, July 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, relative to the repairs required to the roof of the Bel River Indian Day School building. It is noted you recommend that this roof be reshingled and given two coats of creosote stain.\n\nThe Department will approve of having this work carried out during the present summer. You should purchase the shingles and nails required, also the creosote stain and see that a good grade of shingles is obtained. You should also arrange for the labour in having the work done and see that a satisfactory job is completed. When the work is finished, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all material and for the labour in performing the work. We note that you estimate the cost for material and labour to be approximately $70. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible.\n\nYou may arrange, also, to have the toilets at this school thoroughly cleaned and whitewashed so as to place them in a sanitary condition. We note that you estimate the cost of this to be approximately $5.\n\nI might state that, if possible, the above mentioned amounts should not be exceeded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

He reports also that the closets should be thoroughly cleaned and placed in a good, sanitary condition.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish the Department with an estimate of the cost of sheeting the ceiling of the school, including the material and labour.

I gave another Indian named Peter Martin this work to do but Pictou stepped in and would not let him do it, and did it himself. This was after I had left the reserve, and I did not know anything about Pictou interfering with Martin until the work was finished, and so when I received the account from Pictou I refused to submit it for payment.\n\nThe excuse that Pictou will give for doing this work, will be that he had done the work other years and thought he should have the job this year, but as he had other employment I thought it fair to give it to Martin who had no employment and needed the money.\n\nThe voucher I submitted in August last, in favour of Peter Martin for the amount of $7.00 was for a different job altogether it was for cleaning the interior and oiling floors of the school building.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nIN ACCOUNT WITH\n\nJACKSON MILLER\nDEALER IN\nGROCERIES, MEATS AND FEED\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have remarked that the foundation starts only on the top of ground and the frost works and brakes cement end rear part of the building. This damage have to be repaired this summer in building new cement foundation at the rear part and little repairs at few other places.

If you consider that a cement foundation would be more satisfactory, the Department will approve of having the work done. You should purchase the cement and other materials required, from firms on the approved list, and arrange to have the work carried out. Indian labour should be utilized as far as possible. The Department will rely on you to see that a satisfactory job is completed and at the least possible expense. Our funds are extremely limited, and it is hoped that the installing of the foundation under the rear of this school will not involve a large amount.\n\nI have to request that you will give this matter your early attention and have the work completed during the summer holidays. Itemized accounts, in triplicate, should be obtained, covering the cost of all material. These, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment.

Ont.\nOttawa, July 23, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, regarding the cleaning of the interior of the Eel River Indian Day School and the oiling of the floor.\n\nIt is considered that the greater part of this service is properly the work of the janitor as part of his regular duties. He should see that the woodwork and floor is thoroughly washed. The Department would pay the cost of the floor oil and the work in oiling the floor. The other cleaning, however, should be done by the janitor. The total cost of the oil and work in oiling the floor should not exceed approximately $5 or $6. This work should be carried out during the present summer holidays, and, when completed, you should forward accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should also arrange to have the repairs carried out to the foundation at the rear of the school building, as authorized in official letter of the 10th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nDear Sir:\n\nHere is my report for the job I did cleaning the school yard and fence.

I understand that these parts have been renewed quite recently but they do not seem to last. I think it would be wise to purchase a new one. In looking over new stoves it seems to me that the Quebec heater would be the most suitable, they have fire brick lining and are made to give long service. The largest size would cost about $20.00.\n\nIf you wish me to purchase one of these stoves please advise accordingly.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nJ Murray Robertson\nRestigouche, August 27th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department that on the first week of August I have examined the stove at Eel River Indian School, and having found it in bad condition I have asked F.

Although no provision has been made in the year's estimates for that new school, I would ask the Dept. to consider the possibility of the erection of a new school for Eel River reserve.\n\n[Signature] Edgar Renault, Agent.\nVILAS FURNITURE COMPANY LIMITED\nMANUFACTURERS OF\nSCHOOL & HOUSEHOLD FURNITURE\nCOWANSVILLE, QUE.\n\nSold to Department of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nShip to Peter W.

Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Sir:\n\nAs school was opening this morning Sept. 7 I went to open it and it was in a terrible condition. The inside was supposed to be painted, the desks fixed, new chairs and desk for teachers, water supply, sink, door steps fixed, floor washed absolutely nothing done also about the new fire system, and it is quite hard for me to keep these pupils and myself healthy in such a dirty school. The stone is in no condi...\nfor this winter and also\nthe school will be close half\nthe time. I would really\nlike an oil heater as it\nis very clean for a school.\nIf you think it will be\nhard for you to find a\nman to paint I could have\none any time now, and\nwe really need water to\ndrink and also a place\nto wash our hands.\nYou want them to be\nhealthy but there is no\nway for them to be,\nthe toilets are not fit for\nno one. No arrangements\nof any kind for the pupils\nat school.\nI can't teach in a school\nlike that.\nI wrote Mr. Arsenault\nmany times but no reply\nof any kind. I asked him\nfor a medicine list and\nI didn't get it yet. I filled a few forms this summer. I hope you received them.\n\nAbout Jane Nannie who completed her Grade IX she did not get no satisfactory answer about going to college, now that the school are all open and quite late for college she would like to go to Dalhousie school which is about three miles from her home and quite hard for her to travel. If she could get a bike I think she would be pleased for this year come really I have eight grades and its more work for me without taking Grade IX. I am very anxious to see my school work so there is one but with more comfort. I am taking all call every morning until\neverything is clear up,\nI hope you will understand\nand that you will see fit\nat once.\nI made all my complaints\nat the end of June but\nno attention to it.\nHope I am not annoying\nyou too much and I would\nlike a prompt answer,\nThanking you in advance,\nYours truly,\n[Signature]\nVeuillez exp\u00e9dier la d\u00e9p\u00eache suivante aux conditions mentionn\u00e9es au verso auxquelles je consens par les pr\u00e9sentes\n\nSend the following message, subject to the terms on back hereof, which are hereby agreed to\n\nMr E Arsenault\nSuperintendent Indian Agency\nRestigouche Que\n\nSEND WRITTEN REPORT IMMEDIATELY TO DEPARTMENT\nON WORK DONE KEL RIVER SCHOOL AS PER INSTRUCTIONS OUR LETTER\nJULY THIRTEENTH stop ALSO ANSWER OTHER QUESTIONS RAISED\nTHAT LETTER -\n\nBernard Neary\nSuperintendent of Education\n\nCharge Indian Affairs\nMines and Resources\n\nIndian Affairs.

Affairs:\nOttawa,\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have the honor to inform you that there are now 30 Indian children living at present, without a school on the Island Reserve, some 9 miles below RICHMONDTON, Kent Co., N.B.\n\nIt appears that 5 or 6 of these children have been going to a French school in past years; five or six more going to Big Cove Ind. school, as their parents moved there to give their children an education; four or five others are at Baddeck. Again there were a number that have only attained the school age this past year. There are now over 25 children on this RESERVE; I understand they are all young people and a number of children were born there within the past year. This seems to be a coming RESERVE.\n\nAll have large families and are healthy, and I understand good living people. A number of our young Big Cove Indians have married and gone to live there. I would suggest that a house be at once rented and a school provided for them; they are very anxious for a school. I trust the Dept. will at once move in this very important matter. We could, in TWO WEEKS, by the good will of all, have our school going.\n\nThe Ind. Agent informs me that there is a good house there now vacant that could be rented until a school is built.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian schools for N.B.\n\nP.S. The French school was closed this year; they have no school now. This school was about 1/4 mile from this Reserve.\nI beg to report on a situation which is developing on the Indian Island reserve, in fact the time has already arrived when I think something will need to be done in order that the children can get schooling.\n\nThere are now twenty six children belonging to this reserve, and of these there are about 15 of school age, the remainder are younger. Some of those children did go to a Provincial school that was situated about 2\u00bd miles from the reserve, but now that school is closed and may not open again, and this leaves the Indian children without any chance to go to school.\n\nThere is a building owned by an Indian woman on this reserve, that could by some little repair, be made suitable for a school room and teachers residence: This I think could be rented from this woman if the Department so desired. I would not recommend that it would be satisfactory as a permanent school.\n\nWould you please let me know what the Department thinks best to do about this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report on a situation which is developing on the Indian Island reserve, in fact the time has already arrived when I think something will need to be done in order that the children can get schooling.\n\nThere are now twenty six children belonging to this reserve, and of these there are about 15 of school age, the remainder are younger.

In this connection I would point out that the last census returns (1926) show that there was a total population of twenty-seven Indians all told on this Reserve, four only of which were children of school age.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state if these Indians are now residing permanently on the Reserve and, if a school was opened, if it could be regularly conducted, or would it only be at different periods during the year. You should also report further regarding the house which you state could be rented and whether the owner would be prepared to make any repairs in view of this Department paying rental for the use of the building. If not, you should report the cost of fitting up the building, and state whether desks would be required, or if tables and benches could be made locally that would be suitable until it is ascertained whether the school would prove a success. Please also state whether you have any teacher in view and the amount of salary that it would be necessary to pay, also if suitable boarding accommodation could be obtained near the school. When we have this information, consideration will be given to the providing of school facilities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6064, file 279-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, November 6th, 1929.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, relative to the providing of school facilities for the Indian children residing on Indian Island Reserve, some nine miles below Richibucto, Kent Co., N.B.\n\nThe Department is taking this matter up with Mr. Agent Hudson, and requesting that he supply further information regarding the situation on this Reserve. When the Department has full information, consideration will then be given to obtaining a suitable building for classroom purposes and the providing of a salary for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, N.B.\nTO Chas. Hudson Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNortheastern Division N.B.\n\nSIR:\n\nI recommend that the children of school age of Indian Island Reserve be supplied with a school house and teacher to teach the standard curriculum of N.B. and household science.\n\nMy reason for making this recommendation is that there is no school. The children are neglected, dirty and illiterate.\n\n[Signature]\n\nTRAVELLING NURSE\n\nINDIAN OFFICE AT Richibucto, NB\nOct. 25, 1929.\n\nTO THE SECRETARY\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nSIR:\n\nThe following action is being taken regarding above recommendation:\n\nNo action has been taken on above recommendation for the following reasons:\n\nAm writing the department in separate letter about this subject.\n\n(Sgd.) Chas. Hudson.\nINDIAN AGENT\nOct. 25, 1929.\n\nExtract from the report of Miss Mary Murdoch, Travelling Nurse for New Brunswick.\n\nThe families of Indian Island Reserve are, as a whole, very dirty and shiftless. They are much in need of a day school, particularly for the sake of household science.\n\n(SGD) Mary L. Murdoch,\nTravelling Nurse.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 6th instant. File 55-6-1 referring to the establishment of a school on the Indian Island reserve, and in reply will say that there are 18 children permanently resident on this reserve: Ten of whom are between the ages of 5 and 16 years. There are then three families with 8 children who belong to the reserve but who move away in the winter. Those Indians should be on the reserve if the children could go to school, as some of them go to white schools now and then, which is not satisfactory.\n\nIn regard to the length of time a school could be open I would say that it should be conducted throughout the whole school year. And I would add that it appears to me that a domestic science department would be the most necessary part of the school. A teacher to take charge of this school should be qualified to teach the regular classes and also domestic science. At present I have no one in view who would undertake to conduct such a school, but I think one could be found.\n\nThe building I spoke of in my letter of October 29th, can be rented for $25.00 per month, and the owner make all necessary repairs without charge.\n\nAs for the seats and desks, if the Department does not have any second hand ones on hand in this Province, I think tables and benches that I could have made, would answer the purpose until we could know if the school would be a success.\n\nIn regard to the salary of a teacher for this school I think it would be better for the Department to set a figure that they think suitable. In this case I think the teacher could reside in the same building as used for the school and provide their own board, as there are two comfortable rooms in the building besides the room to be used for teaching. Salary should cover teaching regular, and domestic science classes; also board.\n\nIf there is any other information that the Department requires in connection with this subject, I will gladly furnish it.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6064, file 279-1, part 1)\nOttawa, November 29, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, in further reference to the establishment of a school for the benefit of the Indian children on the Indian Island Reserve.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that the funds of the Department for the present fiscal year, owing to many demands, are limited, and it is considered that the fitting up of a building for classroom purposes and engaging the services of a teacher could stand over until next summer, at which time arrangements could be made to open the school at the beginning of the next school year. In the meantime, however, you might state whether all the children referred to by you are wards of this Department, also whether the building which you state can be rented for school purposes is centrally located. It is noted that the teacher could reside in the same building as used for school purposes and provide her own board. It is presumed that the services of one teacher, who, besides carrying out classroom duties, would also teach domestic science to the older girls, would be sufficient.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKemie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of Nov. 29th, 1929, File 55-6-1 referring to the establishment of a school on the Indian Island Reserve, I beg to state, all the children that I have mentioned in connection with this school are Indians, wards of the Department.\n\nIn regard to the building that can be rented for a temporary school house, I wish to say that it is right on the reserve and is centrally situated, and can be easily reached by all the children on the reserve.\n\nIf it is at all possible I would recommend that a school established on this reserve would be a great benefit to the Indians.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, June 16, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, with reference to the proposed Indian Island Indian Day School. I note that all the children are wards of this Department. You may arrange with the owner of the building which can be rented for school purposes to put it in repair and to have it ready for occupancy on September first, next. The Department approves of the rental of $25 per month. You may correspond with Father Ryan, Inspector of Indian Schools, with a view to securing a suitable teacher, who is qualified for both academic and domestic science instruction. After you have found a suitable applicant, you might recommend what salary should be allowed. I shall write to you again with reference to desks for this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nExtract from Inspector Ryan's report on the Indian Island School visited on June 1, 1938.\n\nThe school building is very small and cold. It is an Indian house rented by the Dept. with a partition through the center making a school room and living quarters for the teacher. The teacher has very poor accommodations, while the pupils fall all over themselves in trying to get into class formation, and the strange part is there is no place for a proper class formation. Mrs. Savage being up in years and having her daughter with her is about the only teacher we could get to take over this school. She is doing fair work.\n\n(Sgd.) F. C.

Please state whether they are double or single desks and, if possible, the name of the manufacturer. We are opening a new school on a reserve in the province of New Brunswick, and it is thought that if any of the desks that were in use at the Shubenacadie School are serviceable they could be used in this new school. You should also state whether there is a teacher's desk and chair on hand and the condition of same. Your early reply is requested giving full information regarding the desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nD. B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nRev. F.C. Ryan  \nInspector of Indian Schools  \nRed Bank N.B.\n\nRev. and Dear Sir:\n\nOn Indian Island reserve, which is situated about nine miles from Richibucto, there are about 26 children 15 of whom are of school age. These children have now no opportunity of getting schooling. There was a white school situated about 2 miles from this reserve, and some of the Indian children attended that school, but now it is closed with no prospect of ever being opened again, and the Indians are without any chance of schooling.\n\nI might say that at the present time some of those children are with their parents away from the reserve but would come back immediately if a school was established on the reserve. A few are attending a white school, and this is not satisfactory, as I often have complaints, and have been asked why I could not keep the Indians in their own schools.\n\nIn regard to a school for this reserve, I wish to point out that a Domestic Science branch would also be necessary, as the Indians of this reserve are very much in need of instructions along these lines. In regard to this I could refer you to Miss Mary Murdoch, as she is familiar with conditions on the Indian Island reserve.\n\nI would like to have your views of this matter, as I know the Department will be willing to do anything that is fair in establishing a school on this reserve if they know it is necessary.\nI would also say in connection with this matter that there is a building on the reserve which can be fitted up, without much expense, that would do temporarily for a school and teachers residence, until we would know if the school would be a success.\n\nI might mention that a teacher whom I think would be capable of conducting such a school can be secured at any time.\n\nTrusting that you can give this matter your attention at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\nRed Bank, North Id. Co., N.B.\n\nJune 13th, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nAll Indian schools have been visited but as I will be absent for a few days, it may be the 2nd week in July before the Dept. receives my Reports,- I might say that little repairs are required, but a new School must be built on Indian Island Reserve near Richibucto. I asked the Indian Agent to give me a Report on same, one that he could \"SWEAR\" to, so that I would be in a position to carry on, I feel you can fully rely upon the inclosed REPORT, I am rushing this to the Dept. so that there may be plenty of time to have the said school completed before Sept. next. We have now gone too long without this school. I would kindly advise the Dept. that I fear a move will be made soon in a political way to show up how this reserve has been neglected. Please rush plans &c. It might be better for the Dept. to send a man to look over this reserve. We must get things moving to offset any possible trouble that could very easily come out of this case.\n\nF. C. Ryan.\nOttawa, June 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Maxner has forwarded your letter of the 20th instant, relative to the condition of the desks that are on hand at the Shubenacadie Indian Day School. It is noted that these desks are more or less defaced and in an unserviceable condition. It is thought that they are not worth shipping to the proposed new Indian day school which is being opened in New Brunswick.\n\nRelative to the teacher's desk, it is noted that this is in good condition, and I have to request that you will arrange to have same shipped by freight, charges prepaid, addressed to Mr. Charles Hudson, Indian Agent, Richibucto, N.B. Please prepay the freight charges, and obtain a receipt for same. This you should attach to a voucher form, in duplicate, for the amount of the freight charged prepaid by you, and send to the Department, when a refund will be made you for the cost of the freight. We are informing Mr. Agent Hudson that this teacher's desk is being shipped to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nD. B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nWindsor, N.S.\nOttawa, June 27, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter of the 16th instant relative to the proposed Indian Island Indian Day School, I have to inform you that you may arrange to have temporary desks or tables built locally for this school. This equipment should be of a type that will be satisfactory until such time as it is ascertained whether the work at this point will be a success or not. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and, after these desks have been built and placed in the residence which is being rented for school purposes, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nThis Department recently closed an Indian day school at Shubenacadie, N.S., but we are informed by the local Agent, D. B. Lawlor, Windsor, N.S., that the pupils' desks are in very poor condition and are not worth shipping for use in the proposed Indian Island School. There is, however, a teacher's desk in good condition at Shubenacadie, and we are requesting Mr. Agent Lawlor to arrange to have this desk shipped to you at Richibucto, N.B., and to prepay the shipping charges. There is no teacher's chair, and you may arrange for the purchase of an inexpensive chair for the teacher's use. When the teacher's desk arrives at Richibucto, you should arrange to have it taken to the Indian Island School.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nYour File 55-6-5\n\nIn further reference to the proposed Indian Island Day School I beg to inform you that Mr. N.H. MacPhail, of the Northern N.B. Agency, tells me that there are a number of school desks and seats on the Tobique and Edmundston reserves, that are not in use. Would it not be wise for you to have those sent to me for the above named school. I understand that they are in good condition, and would be more satisfactory than temporary ones that I could have made.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, relative to the desks required for the proposed Indian Island Indian Day School. The Department is communicating with Mr. Agent McPhail, Perth, N.B., to ascertain from him the number and condition of the desks which are not in use on the Tobique and Edmundston Reserves. We have requested him to make an early reply and, as soon as we have information as to their condition, if they are satisfactory, Mr. McPhail will be given the necessary instructions to have them shipped to you. You will be advised later in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nOttawa, July 17, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nIn a communication received from Mr. Chas. Hudson, Indian Agent, Richibucto, he states he has been informed by you that there are a number of school desks not in use on the Tobique and Edmundston Reserves. This Department is opening a new day school on a Reserve in Mr. Hudson's Agency, and any of the school desks referred to above, which are in good condition, might be forwarded for the use of this new school. Please advise the Department as soon as possible of the number and kind of desks, i.e., whether double or single, and the sizes of same and where they are at present located. When we have information regarding the condition of these unused desks, you will be forwarded further instructions relative to having them shipped to Mr. Agent Hudson.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nN. H. McPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.B.\nPerth, New Brunswick,\nJuly 31-1930.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to Departmental letter #55-6-5 of July 17th. I have on Tobique Reserve about twelve double school desks, large size about four feet long, which might be suitable for Mr Hudson's purpose. I have not yet learned how many there are in Edmundston but I think there must be about twenty-five.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.H. MacPhail, Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 14th ultimo, relative to the desks required for the proposed new Indian Island Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department has been informed by Mr. N. H. MacPhail, Indian Agent, Perth, N.B., that there are available on the Tobique Reserve 12 double desks, large size, and, also, approximately 25 at Edmundston. I have to request, therefore, that you will communicate with Mr. MacPhail and inform him of the number of double desks that will be required for the use of the Indian Island School. You might state whether the desks required are small, medium or large. It will, no doubt, be possible to provide suitable seating accommodation for the new Indian Island School from the desks which Mr. MacPhail states are available. We are requesting him to arrange for shipment when he hears from you.\n\nI should be pleased if you would give this matter your prompt attention and advise Mr. MacPhail. You should, also, furnish him with the necessary shipping directions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie.\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N. B.\nOttawa, August 5th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, informing the Department that there are 12 double school desks, large size, not in use on the Tobique Reserve and, approximately 25 at Edmundston. We are advising Mr. Chas. Hudson, Indian Agent, Richibucto, accordingly, and requesting him to notify you, as soon as possible, of the number of desks he requires and the sizes of same. You could arrange to have them shipped from the Edmundston Reserve. Mr. Hudson will furnish you with the necessary shipping directions and, as soon as you hear from him, you should take immediate steps to have the number of desks he requires forwarded. I should be pleased if you would arrange to prepay freight charges, obtaining a receipt for the amount. You should prepare a voucher, in duplicate, covering the charges prepaid, to which you should attach the receipt, and forward same to the Department in order that you may be reimbursed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nN. H. MacPhail, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPerth, N.

R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.B.\nIn further reference to the Indian Island Indian Day school I have to recommend that a shed be erected to store the fuel for the school building. This need not be an expensive building and I think it can be erected for about $50.00 the party from whom the building is being rented did intend to erect this shed but they are unable to bear the expense.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 26th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, regarding the erection of a shed in which to store the fuel for the use of the Indian Island Indian Day School.\n\nIn this connection, it is noted that the owner of the building which has been rented for school purposes is unable to bear the expense of erecting a shed, which, you estimate, will cost about $50. It is not the policy of the Department to erect buildings on property which it does not own and I have to request that you will ascertain from the owner if he would consent to the rental of the building, viz., $25 per month, being applied towards the cost of erecting a suitable shed. If so, the Department will approve of your arranging to have a shed of the size and type required for storing fuel erected at as low a cost as possible, having in view the putting up of a suitable building. If the owner agrees to apply the rental to the cost of the building, you may arrange, as soon as possible to have the shed built, forwarding to the Department properly certified accounts, in duplicate, covering the cost of all materials and labour. Please advise the Department as to the arrangements you are able to make with the owner, as mentioned above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes.\nFor Secretary.\n\nChas.

She helps her mother in house visiting and in general work. She moreover scrubs this school room twice a week, sews for the Indians and helps her mother in teaching Domestic Science.\nOttawa, November 5th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nRev. Father Ryan, in a report on his recent inspection of the new Indian Island Indian Day School, states that the work is progressing satisfactorily under the charge of Mrs. Savage and that both the Indians and their children are taking an interest in the school. The Inspector states that a cupboard is required in which to keep all school material, also that another stove is necessary. I have to request that you will give an estimate of the cost of having a suitable cupboard built in the school or having one purchased. You should, also, state whether another stove is required and, if so, the type and price. These matters should receive your early attention.\n\nYou may purchase and have delivered three pounds of laundry soap, an inexpensive looking glass and a steel comb, forwarding certified accounts in the usual manner covering the cost.\n\nFather Ryan has also recommended that Miss Mary Savage, daughter of the teacher who is assisting her mother in the work and performing janitor's services and who also sews for the Indians and helps her mother in teaching domestic science and in visiting the Indian homes, be granted a small remuneration for these services. The Department will allow Miss Mary Savage payment at the rate of $10 per teaching month for her services as janitor and the other work which she is called upon to perform. Payment at this rate will be made from October 1st, last. I have to request that you will prepare, at the end of each quarter, an account, in duplicate, for the amount of salary due Miss Mary Savage at the above rate. This should be certified by you in the usual manner and forwarded to the Department, when payment will be made. You should state on the voucher that it is in payment of her services as janitor and as assistant in the teaching of domestic science. Please inform Miss Savage of the amount that has been allowed her for these services.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nChas.

He states further that the door is poorly made and it will be necessary to have a new door installed before next winter. As you are aware, this is a rented building. Would it be possible to arrange with the owner to have this window installed and also a new door? If not, would she consent to the Department having this work done, the cost to be deducted from her rental? Please interview her at your early convenience and inform the Department, giving an estimate of the cost of any material and labour required.\n\nFather Ryan also recommended that the outhouses be thoroughly cleaned, repaired and placed in a good condition. I have to request that you will have this work carried out during the present summer holidays. He further states that a pail, a broom and an axe are required, and you should arrange for the purchase and delivery of this equipment.\n\nFather Ryan has drawn attention to the supplies required by the teachers of the Indian schools for their domestic science work. He states that several complained to him there was delay in receiving the necessary equipment. The teachers should anticipate their requirements and should prepare and forward to you requisition for transmission to the Department when authority will be given for you to purchase the articles considered necessary. After you receive the authority to make the purchase, you should give the matter prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas. Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto,\nN. B.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of the 14th instant File 55-6-5, re Indian Island Indian Day school, and in reply will say that the owner of the building is prepared to have a large sized window installed and the door replaced with a new one. This work will be done during the summer vacation.\n\nThe outhouses will be cleaned and any necessary repairs made before school opens after the summer holidays, and the broom, axe, and pail will be supplied.\n\nIn regard to the complaint of teachers about delay in receiving supplies I would say that they are not inconvenienced very much by any delay that has occurred. The teachers seem to think that as soon as they give me the requisition I should purchase the things immediately, and apparently they do not know that the Department has to be communicated with first. Of course there may have been some cases of delay on my part in purchasing after I had received your authority. I will be more careful in future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nRichibucto N.B.

The two deer in the picture with the hippopotamus are particularly good.\n\nWith respect to the Department's criticism of the false etymology given for the word \"testament\", I may say that if in his little essay Mitchell Sappier had said that generally where the word \"testament\" is used in the Bible the real meaning is \"covenant\" no exception could have been taken, for such is the case; but it is distinctly incorrect to say that the word \"testament signifies alliance or covenant\" simply because in a figurative or inexact form of speech it is so used in the Bible. Commentators on the Bible explain this. The word \"testament\" is the English\n\nJames Farrell, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFredericton, N. B.\nform of the Latin word \"testamentum\", which means\nthe written will or testament, called in English\nlaw the \"last will and testament\". The Bible is\nconsidered to be the written will of God, and there-\nfore it is called the Old and New Testament, the\none division consisting of books written before the\ntime of Christ being known as the \"Old Testament\"\nand the other written since the birth of Christ being\ncalled the \"New Testament\".\n\nJudging generally from the specimens of work\nsubmitted by the teacher, the Department considers\nthat she deserves to be complimented on the suc-\ncessful results of her teaching.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nSir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo enclosing one from Miss Frances McGinn, Teacher of the Kingsclear School, respecting the specimens of work done by her pupils; and in reply I have to request that you will be good enough to inform Miss McGinn that the Department is much pleased with the evidences submitted by her of the progress made by the pupils under her tuition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Monaghan, who was appointed in January, 1902, at a salary of $300.\n\nMr. Brown says that she is a splendid teacher and is having great success. He considers her one of the best teachers in his whole field and on the occasion of his last inspection he was accompanied by the teacher of the nearest white school, in order that she might profit by seeing Miss Monaghan's methods and manner. He considers it a great pity that a teacher like Miss Monaghan is obliged to work for the same salary as some other teacher who may not achieve half the success and thinks that this should be remedied.\n\nAs a recognition of Miss Monaghan's long service and successful results, the Department would be justified in giving her a substantial increase, not less than $100 a year, as it is to its interests to retain the services of efficient and painstaking teachers.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

If this request be granted I shall go on with this extra work and shall not feel that I am putting in a useless existence living among and teaching school and having no social life I am sure that a salary of $350.00 per annum is not nearly sufficient. Teachers of my acquaintance who are not very far from this part of Canada are doing much better considering circumstances and as for the schools in Western Canada, a teacher there receives about twice this salary.

She is an earnest and painstaking teacher and has her pupils under good control. Sewing and fancy work are taught the girls and lessons in hygiene explained.

Children from distant towns refuse to go to school for the teacher. They give them inferior books; they have nothing but old books. We have in our school mostly girls. The boys have retired from our school. Teach the girls sewing lessons once a week. You can see the difference between the older students who have been going when the other teachers were here and now. The children that are attending school now she is not taking much interest in them may be just because we are Indians. She has been ill treating our children in many ways. Call them monkey names which our children do not deserve. She also uses too much time attending to visitors who frequently come. The children are afraid to go to school because she punished them so severely and sent them out twice orders. She says she gets from Mr. Smith the Indian agent.

Her pupils are not too bright, yet there are only a few, most all very small, thus the four or five older ones should have had more attention. We could try her for another year but after that if there is no greater improvement she should be changed.\n\n(Sgd.) F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa,\nDecember 5, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have carefully read your reports regarding your inspection of the Indian schools in New Brunswick during the latter part of September. For your information I enclose a copy of a letter which is being forwarded to Mrs. McElligott, teacher of the St. Mary's day school.\n\nThe three Indian Agents in New Brunswick are also being written and instructed to inform the teachers in their Agencies that the Department expects each teacher to regularly attend a teacher's convention.\n\nOn recent requisitions received from the schools in New Brunswick we have been ordering the text books authorized in that Province although it is felt that the books that have been supplied in the past should fully meet the requirements.\n\nI note that both the enrolment and the average attendance at the Kingsclear and Indian Island schools has decreased to such an extent that the Department is really not justified in operating schools at these points. Due to circumstances beyond our control Mr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, was unable to go to New Brunswick this year but he intends to go in the spring of 1939. At that time you can discuss with him what action should be taken to provide education for the children who have been attending these two schools. In the meantime you should advise each of the teachers that it is not likely that their schools will be reopened after the end of June. This early notice will give them an opportunity of securing a position in a white school if they so desire.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. F. C. Ryan,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRed Bank, North. Co., N.B.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have recently read the report of Inspector Ryan regarding his inspection of the Kingsclear Indian day school on September 26. At that time there was an enrolment of 9 but only 2 pupils were present on the day of inspection.\n\nIn view of the very small enrolment it is not possible to justify the continuance of this school. Inspector Ryan has been so advised and requested to notify the teacher that it is unlikely that her services will be required after the end of June, 1939.\n\nMr. Phelan, Chief of the Training Division, was unable to visit New Brunswick during the past year but will go to that Province next spring. At that time it will be decided what arrangements can be made for the education of the children who are at present attending the Kingsclear school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nFredericton, N.B.,\nDecember 13, 1938.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge your letter of December 6, File No. 58-2-1. I not that you contemplate closing the Kingsclear Indian Day School, in view of the fact that on September 26th, there were but two pupils at school when Inspector Ryan visited there. I do not wish to appear presumptuous, but I would feel that many details had been neglected, if I did not set before you the facts as I see them.\n\nI wonder why the Department has waited all these years to close this school for the same conditions have existed over a period of years, i.e., that the people of this reserve are more industrious than the rest of my Indians. They go each fall to the State of Maine and pick potatoes and the families, including the children go with them and in a great many instances work in the potato fields. The money they make is used to clothe themselves and make it possible for the children to attend school without any assistance from the Department.\n\nI have gone into this matter very thoroughly and would outline to you the attendance during the potato picking season in the Kingsclear School from 1927 until the present time.\n\n1927. On September 12, school opened with 9 pupils. Pupils left at different times for potato fields and on September 30th, 6 pupils were enrolled. Full attendance of 13 on October 31st, continuing all school year. Inspector's visit October 17th, 7 pupils.\n\n1928. September 2nd, school opened with 8 pupils. Gradually left and on September 17th, 5 pupils enrolled. Full attendance again on Oct. 16th continuing all school year. Inspector's visit October 8, 5 pupils present.\n\n1929. September 9, school opened with 6 pupils attending during the month of September. The number gradually\n\f\nIf I may take the liberty to comment, I think that under the circumstances, i.e., that the children do go away with their parents, that this is a very good record. I feel that I do understand the situation, when there is never a week, but I visit the schools and Kingsclear is without a doubt one of the best in every way. I have repeatedly written to Inspector Ryan asking him to stop at my office on his way through Fredericton, so that we might talk the matter over, but for reasons of his own, he has not done this and I do not hesitate to say that a person cannot know very much about conditions as they are when they are inspecting four schools lying some eighty miles apart in one day, between the hours of nine and four. Now what is the solution?\n\nTo close the school, how would we educate the children. To have the Indian children attend the white school is simply out of the question. It could not be done. Possibly our school at Kingsclear could be closed during the month of September. Possibility of teaching the month of August instead of September. Of course this teaching in August is not such a good idea after all, as many of them leave around the middle of August.\n\nI was much disappointed that Mr. Phelan, chief of the Training Division did not visit us during the past year, but will look forward to meeting him this coming spring and as you say, at that time it will be decided what arrangements can be made for the education of the children, who are at present attending the Kingsclear School.\n\nIn my opinion there is but one way to educate them and that is the continuance of our school here with the school opening first of October rather than September.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nR.

To Miss O'Brien's credit, I must say that she has faithfully fulfilled not only the three R's, but also this training in religious matters.\n\nI have recommended Miss Rita McDade as one that I would consider not only qualified in educational matters, but also one that I feel will give the children a good example in religious life. She is a first class teacher and has the necessary qualifications to fill the school.\n\nMay I ask you to help me to have Miss McDade appointed in Miss O'Brien's place? Thanking you for past favours and soliciting your help in this very important matter, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. M. A.

Considering that condition, would it be possible to have Mrs. Lloyd Edwards, formerly Miss Stella O'Brien, who is still living in this Parish appointed to the school to finish out the present school year. In that case before the opening of the next school year we would be able to find a suitable teacher according to the requirements that you gave me when I visited you in your office over a year ago. I have spoken to the Liberal Committee here in York County and also to Mr. Peter Hughes of the Federal Committee, and they are both agreeable to the appointment of Mrs. Edwards until June.\n\nI think that you understand my position here and you must realize that I have at heart not only the education of the children in temporal things, but also the religious welfare of the children as well, and it would be to my mind a much better arrangement to have Mrs. Edwards appointed temporarily and thus give us time to find a suitable teacher for a permanent appointment for the next school year. May I hope to hear from you regarding this matter.\n\nI had hoped to see you, but no doubt the pressure of business kept you from touring our part of the country this year.
