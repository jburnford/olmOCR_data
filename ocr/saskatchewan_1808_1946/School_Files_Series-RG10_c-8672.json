In reply I have to say it is noted that both these ladies are performing satisfactory service.\n\nRegarding your request that they be granted an increase in salary, I have to say that, as our funds this year are extremely limited, the Department will, in view of the salary at present allowed Miss Faithfull, grant her an increase from the 1st instant at the rate of $15 per teaching month. This will make the total salary allowed her from that date at the rate of $60 per teaching month, and she will be rated as assistant teacher from the date mentioned.

If this building is to be put up this year it will be necessary to commence building operations at an early date and in order to do so a decision should be arrived at.\n\nThe building of the school-house and the teacher's residence on the Red Pheasants Reserve was also held up, as no tenders were received for Little Pines within the time limit and it was proposed to take up with the Agent the question of having these buildings erected by day labour. It is very doubtful whether any tenders would be received if called for in the papers and it might be well, if Mr. Mutch is given the contract for the Little Pines School, to ask him for a price, if he is willing to undertake the work, or take up with the Agent the matter of having it done by day labour.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is because almost all their pupils at the present time are drafted from that reserve. Funds will be available from the current appropriation, if the work is begun before the first of April, 1913, and there will be ample funds from the appropriation for the maintenance of the Battleford Industrial School to meet the expenditure next year.

(RG 10, Volume 6288, file 612-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFor Amateur Painters\n\nPaint, applied to any surface actually covers that surface with a coat of mail, metallic effect in technical parlance. This plating, or armor, protects the surface from the destructive action of corrosion or \"oxidation\"\u2014of the air's oxygen, and from the mechanical action (in the case of paint surface exposed to the weather) of the elements\u2014rain, snow, chemical action, the attrition of dust, etc.\n\nEvery layer of this plating that is put on any surface\u2014every \"coat of paint,\" that is,\u2014of course increases the thickness of that armor.\n\nThis is the reason why a priming coat and even two thin coats of paint will always yield at least two thick coats without any priming beneath,\u2014something it is usually hard to make the amateur painter understand. The oil in the priming fills the pores of the surface covered, and therefore economizes the oil in the after coats, and it leaves the thin films of metallic oxides on the surface which provides a good foundation for the thicker films that are on top of it.\n\nNow, the amount of resistance paint can offer to the destructive forces named depends upon what that paint is made of, how it is made, and how it is applied. This is the question to ask for the two factors, the user for the other one. If you do your own painting, you can safely answer for it if you follow the Hints About Painting printed in another part of this leaflet\u2014and do not endeavor to improve them.\n\nChoose M. L. Paint not because it looks alright. Any paint looks alright.\n\nChoose M. L. Paint not because its price compares with other brands. Any half-way decent paint costs about the same as M. L. Brand.\n\nChoose M. L. Paint not because of its covering power of 400 square feet, two coats, to the gallon. Some paints claim to cover more surface,\u2014but how long will the covering last?\n\nChoose M. L. Paint because it will do all any other paint does in beautifying; and fully a third more in protecting.\n\nHOW MUCH PAINT WILL IT TAKE?\n\nFor outside house-painting, to find the quantity of M. L. Paint needed for two coats over a priming coat\u2014Multiply the average height of the outer walls, from ground to cornice, in feet, by the distance around the building in feet. Divide the total by 400. The answer will show the number of gallons required to cover two coats.\n\nFor inside work\u2014One quart of M. L. Paint will finish, with two coats, both sides of any ordinary door, the frames of two windows, and all the rest of the woodwork of a room.\n\nFor floors\u2014One quart of M. L. Special Floor Paint will put two coats on a floor 12x16 ft., or about 200 square ft. of area.\n\nFloglaze, the ideal floor finish, will surface 500 square feet to the gallon with a brilliant, washable and wear-proof surface.\n\nColors marked thus (*) are Higher in Price.\nWHY?\n\nCan you answer this question\u2014\"Why did you buy M. L. Paint rather than Somebody else?\"\n\nOur answer is simply this:\n\nM. L. Paint covers more surface to the gallon, costs less money per square foot of surface covered, lasts longer and looks better than any other paint there.\n\nThat is true of M. L. Paint because we not only use the best materials the markets of the paint-world sell\u2014the purest quality of White Lead; the best quality of Oxide of Zinc; the best quality of coloring pigments made by the best known paint raw materialists, and so made RIGHT; the best Pure Raw Linseed Oil\u2014but we put these together by processes improved beyond the knowledge of most paint makers, and with machinery not excelled anywhere.\n\nAnd to these ingredients, selected with the greatest care for quality, we add\u2014in the case of all our indoor and outdoor paints\u2014special ingredient peculiar to the M. L. Brand.\n\nThis ingredient is the outcome of years of ceaseless study and experiment, expended freely with the purpose of improving M. L. Paints to the last degree of excellence. That study and experiment has been at our own expense, not at the consumer's; and it has paid off in at least uniform and unwavering quality in M. L. Paints which insure the buyer off the premises against the many paint-troubles he must suffer with other kinds.\n\nWith the addition of this ingredient, thoroughly incorporated with the other M. L. materials by special methods, every square inch of surface covered with our indoor and outdoor paints will resist the elements longer and preserve its fresh, new appearance better, than is otherwise possible.\n\nDurability is the big thing to consider in buying paints,\u2014for the real measure of paint value depends upon the length of time that paint will endure. As the chief consideration is the life of the paint, and not the price of the paint itself, it must be clear that any paint which\u2014like the M. L. Brand\u2014will last three years to another brand's two, is at least one-third cheaper in the long run.\n\nHints About Painting\n\nIf you use M. L. Paints and obey the directions here given, you cannot fail to get a painting job that will be thoroughly and lastingly satisfactory to you. And, moreover, you will get full value for what you spend in money or in labor, or both.\n\nPreferably, employ a practical painter to do any considerable painting. He knows how, far better than you could learn unless you spend much time learning as he does. His charges will be reasonable enough; and the job will be far better done than you could do it, at best. But, if for any reason you cannot hire a painter, these hints will help:\n\nStir the contents of M. L. cans thoroughly, and from the bottom. Stir a good deal longer and harder than you think is necessary. Then pour the paint, after stirring, from one can to another at least eight times. Twice times is better.\n\nBefore applying the heavy paint, use a good priming paint. You can't find a better kind than M. L. Primers. Never use an Ochre Primer. If you do, the after coats will crack, flake or blister,\u2014bound to do so.\n\nNever spread paint on a damp surface, nor on a frost-coated surface.\n\nNever spread paint on a greasy, sooty or smoked surface.\n\nDon't try to paint green lumber, nor lumber full of pitch.\n\nNever put a coat of paint on top of another coat which is not dry.\n\nAlways put the paint on thick and spread it out thin, stirring it in thoroughly,\u2014brush it in and brush it in again. This is the \"knack\" of the practical painter; and it is a knack well worth what he charges to use it.\n\nDon't thin M. L. Paint with anything but raw linseed oil\u2014and be sure it is pure, high grade oil, like the oil that is in M. L. Paint when you get it.\n\nUse\u2014on all new work, at least\u2014a priming coat and two coats of paint.

You may, therefore, purchase desks of this kind and also a teacher's desk and chair. It is not considered necessary to expend the amount mentioned by you in the purchase of a teacher's chair, as an ordinary arm chair will be sufficient. You may also purchase window shades for the school-room.\n\nWith regard to the ranges I beg to say that the Department will supply these, as they will be used in the preparation of the mid-day meal for the pupils. Be good enough to consult those interested and ascertain what kind of a range would be suitable and submit an estimate of the cost.\n\nThe Department will also supply window shades for the residences on the Red Pheasants and Little Pines Reserves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I bought some myself last time to do the untidy parts in the house. We could do the house ourselves but it would be impossible for us to do the schoolroom and children's dining room. If the Kalsomine was provided I could get it done quite reasonably. In a work like this it is so necessary to have the surroundings as nice as possible.\n\n2. There is no basement cistern here and it is impossible to haul more water than is needed for drinking and cooking purposes as over forty children especially can get away with a great deal of drinking water during a school day. Dishes, floors, towels, etc., and the washing of all hands at least once a day, are all very necessary. At present we only have the two wooden barrels for hauling water and two small tanks in the house. We manage during the winter by melting snow.\nSir:\n\nI beg to forward herewith, requisition for school supplies from Miss Cunningham of the Little Pine Day school.\n\nMiss Cunningham makes a hard try to keep her place in an exceptionally clean and tidy condition and if it was possible, I would ask the Department to allow her the faint and Kalsomine asked for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 5, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant, I beg to say that you may purchase the following supplies for use at the Little Pines Indian Day School:\n\n- 3 gallons paint,\n- 2 quarts varnish,\n- 10 packages calcimine,\n- 1 galvanized water tank.\n\nThe above should be secured at the lowest possible cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Under these circumstances, it has been decided not to take any action, at the present time, on the request from the teacher of the Little Pines School for paint and kalsomine. You might write again, about the middle of June, giving an estimate of the cost of the interior decorating at each of the schools in your agency. The Department will then be in a position to decide what amount, if any, can be allowed.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, it will not be possible to consider any exterior painting this year, and, therefore, it will not be necessary for you to give any estimates in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

It is estimated that this work can be done at a cost of approximately $55.00 for each of these schools.\n\nThe Thunderchild day school, which is a log building, will also need some repairs, but most of this can be done by Indian labour. It will require repairs to plastering both inside and out, and kalsomining the interior of the school. This work could be done for approximately $45.00, and I trust that the above amounts can be allowed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nSLM/AEL.\nOttawa, September 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the third instant, giving an estimate of the cost of the redecorating and repairs required at the Little Pines and Thunderchild Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $55.00 in decorating the school buildings and children's dining rooms at each of the schools.\n\nYou may also incur an expenditure of $45.00 in carrying out the repairs to the Thunderchild school building. It is noted that this building will require repairs to the plastering, both inside and outside, and kalsomining of the interior.\n\nIndian labour should be utilized as far as possible in having the above work carried out at these two day schools. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward separate accounts, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of any materials supplied at each school, and also accounts, in triplicate, for the labour. The number of days or hours employed and the rate paid should be definitely stated. If possible, the total cost should be kept within the estimate submitted by you. I would request that you arrange to have the work completed at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nS. L.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nWhile at Little Pine School last week, I took a notion to inspect the Heating Systems in the School and house and it is a marvel that these buildings ever survived last winter.\n\nThe furnace in the Residence has nearly half of the outer covering broke in and corroded through and the pipes were rusted through and fallen apart in several places and the grates were just warped rods.\n\nThe furnace in the school is worthless or not worth repairing.\n\nTo verify this, I took out M.A. Holiday, Steam fitter etc to check this a make an estimate of cost\n\nThe Residence Furnace would need grates 20.00\nRepairs to casing and Pipes, including labor 55.00\nTotal 75.00\n\nThe school furnace will have to be discarded, a new one would cost about $350.00 and I doubt then if it would be much use as the cellar for it is too small and there is no way of getting registers except to one end, so I would recommend stoves, there is one wood heater there in good order.\n\nOne Furnacette would be required 70.00\n8 Inch Galv pipe 30 feet Rivetted also 7 inch pipes cut in from 2 stoves, including installing 39.00\nTotal $109.00\n\nTo close off basement and trap door to Coal bin about $15.00.\n\nThis is a rather late date to apply for this, but as it was never reported to me I had no idea of the condition and it will certainly be needed before winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept of Indian affairs,\nOttawa.\nEX'D.\n\nOttawa, October 3rd, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 28th ultimo, you may expend an amount of $75.00 in making the necessary repairs to the furnace in the teachers' residence at the Little Pines Indian Day School.\n\nYou may, also, purchase a new Furnacette and galvanized pipe, at a cost of $109.00, for the classroom in the Little Pines School.\n\nIf you consider it necessary to close off the basement and trap door to the coal bin, an expenditure of $15.00 may be incurred in doing this work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

As the blinds were not a vital necessity during the winter, I did not then reply regarding them, but now that the summer season is approaching, blinds for this school are necessary, and I am just in receipt of a letter from the teacher again requesting them.\n\nThey ask for 10 translucent, sanitary window shades, size 36 x 72. These are priced in Christie's Catalogue at $4.75 each. They are no doubt good window shades but it seems to me that they are rather expensive. This catalogue also shows Hartshorn Rollers, being No. 105, 37 inches wide and 7 feet long, at $1.65 each, which I think, would be just as suitable and would give the necessary shaded light if supplied in light buff or tan colour.

L. Macdonald,\nIndian Office,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThis year we found it necessary to divide the schoolroom and use it for both junior and senior classes. The children's dining room has been used formerly for the juniors, but it was so cold last winter, and the teacher was kept so busy firing constantly, that the juniors were moved into the senior room and a curtain used for a partition. Under this arrangement the children were very nice and warm, but the noise was somewhat distracting to both classes. We would suggest, that when work is being done on the school buildings this year, a folding partition be built between the classes, and another outside door be made for the junior children.\n\nConcerning Miss Stewart's departure, the enclosed speaks for itself. For the past two years I have been paying Miss Stewart's salary out of my own. Would it be possible for the Indian Department to provide a junior teacher's salary, or at least part of it? I would appreciate very much having my salary continued for the remaining time I shall be here. Miss Armitage, who is one of the most devoted Indian workers in the province, and is keenly interested in every phase of reserve life, never being off duty throughout the term, should have an increase in salary. Both church officials and reserve realize she is a valuable worker.\n\nYours truly,\n\nH. L. Cunningham\nI beg to forward attached letter from Miss A.E. Cunningham, for the Department's advice and would certainly recommend that her requests be considered, as this school is and always has been outstanding in Day schools and she has for the last several years paid a Junior teacher from her own salary and Miss Stewart just resigned was one of the best teachers we ever had and the regular Assistant, Miss Armitage is also outstanding, in fact they were a combination that were hard to beat.\n\nWith regard to the partition asked for, one as required would cost approximately $48.00 without painting and this could be done next year when the repainting of these buildings will be necessary. As to an extra outside entrance, this would require high outside steps and in my opinion not necessary in a building of this size, but the partition I would recommend, as also an increase for Miss Armitage and an allowance for a Junior Teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 4th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 24th ultimo, enclosing a communication received from Miss A. L. Cunningham, teacher of the Little Pines Indian Day School, you may arrange for the erection of the necessary partition, which, it is noted, will cost approximately $48.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Dr. Robertson,\n\nThank you for your letter of November 2nd. As you have asked, we can say from experience that the children could have rice pudding two or three times a week until the end of June, if four cases of milk were supplied. We think there is enough rice for this. Then as cocoa is very cheap, twenty-five pounds more would give them cocoa on alternate days. This with the regular soup and biscuit, would make a very nourishing meal.\n\nI forgot to mention that the Farm Instructor supplies a certain amount of meat from the second week in November until Easter. The remaining months, I bought soup bones myself for the last few years, until last Easter (1937), when I was given permission to get $3.00 worth of soup bones per month at Paynton.\n\nAll this efficient thought for the reserve is most encouraging to both workers and Indians, especially as the last two or three years were unusually difficult.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.L. Cunningham.\n\nMilk, 4 cases.\nCocoa, 25 lbs.\nDear Sir;-\n\nSome time ago I visited the Little Pine Day School. In checking over the amount allowed for the mid-day meal I could not see how a good nourishing meal could be supplied. On questioning the teacher I found that she herself had been supplying some of the material. I asked her to submit a letter setting out what would be necessary in addition to what she was then receiving to furnish this meal up to the end of June. The attached letter is her reply.\n\nI would recommend that authority be given to supply her with four cases of milk and 25 lbs of cocoa in addition to what she now receives.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 15, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 9th instant, you may authorize Indian Agent Macdonald to purchase 4 cases of milk and 25 pounds of cocoa, to be used for serving a hot drink at the Little Pine Indian Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Macdonald Esq.\nIndian Office,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe excellent health this winter - due chiefly to the good noonday meal - has resulted in better attendance than that of last year; consequently we have used more cereal. Last spring I purchased 50 lbs. of pot barley myself, and we were supposed to be allowed that extra amount last fall. We should be glad to have 50 lbs. each of barley, rice and beans for the two and a half months after Easter.\n\nLast year we were allowed $3.00 per month for soup bones from Easter to the end of June. May we count on the same amount this year?\n\nYou will remember that we received only forty seven boxes of biscuit last fall, instead of the usual seventy two. We probably have enough for the next two weeks, but need more for use immediately after the Easter holiday. Would you very kindly enquire about this?\n\nWe have proved the great value of the mid-day meal, so hope that there will be no difficulty in obtaining these supplies.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDo you expect the buildings will be painted this year, or shall I requisition paint as usual for the floors?\n**Requisition for School Material**\n\n*Date: 8th April 1938*\n\n**For:** Little Pine School, Battleford Agency\n\n**NOTE:** Teachers should secure from the Department of Education of the Province in which the Indian School is located, a list of the text books authorized for use in the white schools.

The Department approves of this work, also any necessary repairs and puttying the windows on the outside.\n\nIf the material that is needed costs more than $50.00 it will be necessary for you to forward me full details in order that the articles may be purchased through our Purchasing Branch. If, however, the material costs less than $50.00 you may arrange to have the work done as soon as you consider it advisable.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nS. L.

Macdonald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have Department letter No.105-2-5, Jan 7th, re Inspector Mr Brown and Manual training for boys at Little Pine Day School.\n\nIn this respect, I might say, that both at this school and the Red Pheasant Day school, we have long recognized the need of manual training, but till the last two years could never get any support for anything other than the routine courses, but with the support we have been getting for tools and equipment, there is already a showing at these two schools, but as Mr Brown states, space is wanted, we have already anticipated this and you will note that on my Estimates for next year, allowance is made for full basements at both the above schools, to allow for a good big room for manual training and also recreation, as both these schools are really overcrowded now. We have also recently sent a requisition for $10.00 lumber and small hardware for this purpose at Little Pine, Mr Warden our new Farmer at that Point and his Wife, who is a B.A. and Ex-High school teacher, take a great interest in the school and the above materials was requested so that during the present winter months, when his outside duties are not so heavy, he intends to teach the boys to make cupboards, doors etc. As this school has only Lady teachers, this kind of co-operation is appreciated, I might add, that Miss Armitage resigned last year was very handy with tools and carried on some of this work and her successor Miss Good, whose Father is Carpenter is also handy for a girl, so we are making some progress. Last spring, I sent the schools, each a booklet on Making Bird Houses, outside seats, trellis etc and they have made a very good attempt at copying them.\n\nMr Morgan, our Teacher at Red Pheasant, has also been using a lot of time in boy training, he has model Indian home plans and is trying to have every boy that leaves the school able to build one when starting on his own, Carpentry is his hobby and he is a handy mechanic in any way, is interested in the Indians and the school work and I might say, one of the best teachers we ever had.\n\nAt present none of this is possible at the Thunderchild Day School, but when a change is made, which I hope will be at the end of the present teaching year, that the Manual training be a condition, as, especially to the Indians it is the most useful training they can get.\n\nI have written rather fully in this reply, to show that some progress is being made and we have most certainly had Dr Robertson's full support in all our efforts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJanuary 24, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant with reference to manual training at the Little Pines, Red Pheasant and Thunderchild day schools in the Battleford Agency.\n\nIn our appropriation for the fiscal year 1939-40 provision was made for an amount of $900.00 for a basement and other repairs at the Little Pines school. It was not possible to provide funds for a basement at the Red Pheasant school in the coming year's appropriation.\n\nAbout April 1 you should again write to the Department giving full details regarding the material needed for the basement at the Little Pines school and arrangements will be made to have the material secured by our Purchasing Agent. At that time you should also state if any white labour will be necessary and, if so, the tradesmen required and the approximate length of time they will be employed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nS. L.

They are, however, in much better condition than the Red Pheasant School. This school is badly overcrowded at the present time and a number of pupils have had to be turned away owing to lack of space. At the opening of the next session there will be at least 50 children who will want to attend that school, and there is no doubt that the Red Pheasant School should receive first attention.\n\nAt one time, I discussed with Mr. Macdonald the advisability of moving the school and residence to a more level piece of ground and to a point where water is available, as the water is a question at this point. When at Battleford recently, I asked Mr. Macdonald to take a contractor out to the school and ascertain in the first place if the buildings could be moved, and if so, the approximate cost. I also asked him to get figures on extending the school 20 feet, that is, making it 20 feet longer, and putting in a full basement.\n\nI am now in receipt of a letter from Mr. Macdonald in which he states that he took a Mr. Wayman, a contractor, out to the school, and he reported that to move the residence would wreck it, as it is poorly braced and has plaster walls, consequently the idea of moving the buildings must be abandoned.\n\nMr. Wayman estimated that a 20-foot extension could be put on the\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nschool, a full basement with an 8-foot ceiling, all cement walls and floor, would cost (for material) about $700.00. This would mean using Ten-test for the walls of the school, which he claims is cheaper and warmer than plaster.\n\nA good wood-burning furnace would cost $250.00 and labour about $150.00, a total of about $1100.00. In explanation of the labour cost being so low, I might point out that the Indians have offered to do the excavating free for the privilege of using the basement as a Community Hall until such time as they can get a Hall of their own, and the work could be done largely by Indian carpenters with a white foreman.\n\nYou will note, in your letter of April 26th, that you state the appropriation for Little Pine is $900.00 and Thunderchild $125.00, a total of $1025.00, of which $75.00 has been spent for a cistern, leaving a balance of $950.00 for this work. The estimate for this work is therefore $150.00 above the appropriation, but in view of the necessity for this work, if it would be possible to find the money for it, I would strongly recommend that it be done.\n\nIn the meantime, I have advised Mr. Macdonald to make no further expenditure on Little Pine or Thunderchild schools until further advised.\n\nWith regard to the water situation, I would say that some time ago a well was dug to the depth of 30 feet, when they struck a stone. A small quantity of water is in this well, not sufficient for the purpose, but sufficient, I would say, to satisfy us that there would be no great difficulty in securing water at this point at a little greater depth.\n\nI would also point out that Mr. Morgan, our teacher, as well as Mrs. Morgan, his wife, are carrying on splendid work at this school, both among the children and the women. I would place Little Pine, Red Pheasant and Sandy Lake as the first three day schools in the Province.\n\nYours truly,\n\nThos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nTR/FMc\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you intimate that in your judgment repairs at the Red Pheasant School are more urgently needed than the repairs for which provision was made at the Little Pine School.\n\nI note with interest your reference to the site of the Red Pheasant School and the advisability of having this school established on a more suitable location. If the present site is unsuitable, I hesitate to proceed with repairs until the condition is remedied. I have been wondering if it would not be advisable to proceed with the repairs at the Little Pine School this year, on the understanding that a fully modern school with full basement accommodation would be built to take the place of the Red Pheasant School next year. If the new school were built during the holiday season, a certain amount of the lumber at the present school could no doubt be utilized. However, if you consider the present site is reasonably suitable, I can see no serious objection to the expenditure of money on the Red Pheasant rather than the Little Pine School. I shall be glad to have an expression of opinion from you, with respect to this matter, just as soon as you can conveniently send it forward.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Please let me know why you did not comply with the purchasing regulations. It makes it extremely difficult to administer the schools if Indian Agents do not strictly follow out all instructions that have been given to them. When your reply is received I will endeavour to have the Purchasing Agent issue the necessary authority for payment.\n\nPlease let me know the date of the letter authorizing you to incur any expenditure in connection with the furnace at this school. We have reviewed our files and are unable to find that any authority was given to you.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

They are all back to school now. The epidemic affected practically every family and in many cases, the women as well as the children. Three pre-school age children died, but we hope that now the worst is over.\n\nLast year there was an abundance of berries, which were dried and stored for winter use and the people had plenty of vegetables also. This year, very unfortunately, there were no berries and no vegetables except potatoes. We were without Cod Liver Oil for four months and the lack of fruit and vegetables also has been hard on the children, who needed building up after the long sickness. For this reason we are asking for tomatoes to supply what is lacking in the present restricted diet.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.L.Cunningham.\nRequisition for School Material\n\nDate: 22nd November 1936\n\nFor: Little Pine Day School, Battleford Agency\n\nNOTE:\nTo avoid delay, teachers should give full particulars regarding each article required.\n\nThe name, series, number of grade, and name of author and publisher of all books required should be given as fully as possible.\n\nWhen ordering kindergarten material, the catalogue number of some well known firm should be given for each article required.\n\nOnly one item should be specified on each line of this requisition and no entry should be made under heading \"Number Authorized\".\n\n| ARTICLES | NUMBER ON HAND | DATE OF LAST RECEIPT | NUMBER REQUIRED | NUMBER AUTHORIZED |\n|----------|----------------|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|\n| Tomatoes | 0              | -                    | 6 cases         | 2\u00bd's              |\n\nCost $19.50.\n\nThere is a shortage of vegetables at Little Pine reserve and the children need the tomatoes to make a partially balanced diet during the winter months.\n\nThe wild berry crop was a total failure.\n\nAverage attendance 30 pupils.\n\nN.B.\u2014Explicit information regarding address must be furnished.\n\nName: Miss A.L. Cunningham\nSchool: Little Pine\nPost Office (nearest): Eyton\nExpress Office (nearest):\nProvince: Saskatchewan\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that I have examined this requisition, and that the articles asked for by the teacher are necessary and are such as are in use in the Provincial Schools.\n\nIndian Affairs.

An amount of $47.66 has already been expended leaving a balance of $27.34. If you consider that tomatoes should be supplied you may purchase them at a cost of $19.50 and this expenditure will mean that there will only be a balance of $7.84. Our funds are limited and it is not possible to consider authorizing a further amount than that already mentioned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.F.B.

The letter of authority for this work was quoted to me by Dr. Robertson as Departmental Letter 105-6-5, dated June 9th, 1939.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.F.B.

Vouchers have been submitted and paid for these months.\n\nI have to advise you that Miss A.L. Cunningham, the teacher took upon herself to continue the services of the driver for ten days during month of April, though I had informed her authority was only until March. She took the stand that as she had not used the full amount during December on account of the mild weather, she saw no reason why this credit could not be carried over until April. On account of so much water lying around the early part of April it was difficult for the children to reach school.\n\nMiss Cunningham has guaranteed orders to the amount of $20.00, I advised her I would take the matter up with you to ascertain if you would consider paying for ten days during April, though I was doubtful if you would as she had definite instructions that authority ended March.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.P.B.

It may be necessary for you to only serve a midday meal during some months in order to permit you to keep within the amount provided.\n\nIf you consider the work necessary and the labour will be done without cost to the Department you may purchase 2 gallons of paint, 10 packages of kalsomine, 2 lbs. of putty and 5 panes of glass.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.P.B.

Will it be the policy of the department to continue providing supplies for the mid-day meal, or will same be discontinued, and for the parents of children attending school to provide lunches out of the money they will receive under the Act?\n\nWith the increased attendances the teachers will not be able to supervise the preparation of meals as has been the case in the past, without interfering with class work. We would also have to provide more cooking utensils, and perhaps engage help preparing meals and cleaning up.\n\nNow would be the opportune time to advise parents they will have to assume the responsibility of providing lunches for children attending school. Teachers would be able to check lunch kits, and if suitable lunches were not furnished, we would then be able to take the question up with parents and insist that better food be provided. Failing to follow out instructions of either Teacher or Farming Instructor, a recommendation would then be made that allowances be discontinued.\n\nI would be in favour of providing a hot drink of cocoa to pupils with their lunch, which would not be too much for the teacher to prepare.\n\nC.S.

Bell, In charge of Indian Agency Office,\nBattleford, Sask.\n\nIn checking the September quarter return,\nof the Little Pine Indian Day School, it is noted that\nthe teacher states we have refused supplies for midday\nmeal purposes. This is not a fact, as we have already\nordered the nutritional biscuits, which I presume have\nreached the school.\n\nHowever, I reviewed our file and find\nthat on May 19 I wrote you a letter, acknowledging\nreceipt of a requisition which had just been received\nfor various supplies for the Little Pines School. While\nwe later purchased the paint and lumber, it now appears\nthat I neglected to authorize the following items:\n\n1 wash board, 1 wash tub, 1 boiler,\n10 bars of soap, 1 pane of glass, for front door,\n1 pkg. tacks, 2 cases milk,\n10 lbs. cocos, 50 lbs. sugar.\n\nThe Department is not discontinuing the provision of mid-\nday meal supplies, but we are not increasing the amounts\nallowed in previous years.

The rate per month was $3.00, but on June 26, 1945, you forwarded voucher No. 94 for a total of $6.00 for hauling water for the months of May and June. This voucher was correct. The next voucher you issued for this service was voucher No. 321. On this voucher you requested payment for hauling water for the months of September and October, for a total of $12.00, or $6.00 a month. In other words, you doubled the amount previously allowed, without any authority. We have paid at the six dollar rate since that time.\n\nI feel that this is rather high, as at other schools in your agency we allow only $5.00 a month.

On account of the higher wages now paid for such labour, Indians would not haul water for less than $6.00 per month. It has to be hauled a considerable distance and it breaks into a half day for man and team of horses, each week, and at $1.50 per trip this cannot under the circumstances be considered unreasonable.\n\nI have gone into the question why a well was not dug years ago. Two deep wells were sunk without finding water, and I am very doubtful if we engaged the services of a well digging outfit we would locate water now.\n\nC.S.

Considering the purpose for which this stove is intended to be used, it is thought that a smaller and consequently cheaper range, should be satisfactory. Please give this matter further consideration and let me have another recommendation.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, May 19th, 1947.\n\nMr. C.S.

As Mr. Spence has tendered his resignation as teacher I will do nothing in connection with purchase until new teacher is appointed. It appears to me that the department should not be called upon to furnish a kitchen range for teacher's residence. No doubt the one now in use was purchased by the department years ago when salaries were considerably less than they are now.\n\nC.S. Bell,\nIndian Agent.\n**THE SPORT SHOP**\nFRANK I.

During the last ten years the people on Little Pine have moved so far from the Day School that it is now found necessary to have two sleighs and drivers instead of one. One driver picks up children east of the school and then has to cross the river for four families over there. The other driver gathers children from the west and south.\n\nThese trips would not be so long if the people lived in settlements but the houses are all scattered around the hills and valley, and the drivers must run a zig-zag course to reach all the homes, adding miles to their trips. This necessitates a very early start for them in the morning, and a late arrival home at night.\n\nA boy of twelve lives across the river, four miles from the school. Boys of thirteen, twelve, eleven, nine and eight, and a girl of seven live across the river about three miles from school.\n\nDown the valley, west of the school, live boys of eight and seven, with three miles to come. Another of seven has nearly two miles. South-west, with three and a half miles to walk are a girl of fourteen and two of seven. Within a mile radius of the school are about seven children from nine to twelve years. East of the school, with about one and three quarter miles to walk are boys of fourteen, nine and eight, and girls of thirteen, twelve and eleven.\n\nBecause of great distances to travel to reach the scattered homes, and the badly drifted trails which are hard on their horses, the drivers will not do the work for less than 75 cents a trip. This means $1.50 each, a day, or a total of $3.00 a teaching day.\n\nAt present thirty children, including one white boy, are attending school very regularly, and for the good of the children and the progress of the school I would like them to continue to attend. There are about twelve in school under nine years of age and I expect most of them would be most irregular in attendance after the snow.\nthe snow comes, because of roads, cold and distance.\n\nBad weather is usually from November till March, inclusive, and I feel if the transportation could be extended from the present period, to cover four months, November, December, January, February, that the attendance, so vital to any school would be very greatly improved on Little Pine Reserve. This would be roughly 75 teaching days, at $3.00 per day, or a total of $225.00 for the season.\n\nI would strongly recommend that authority be granted to engage drivers to the amount of $225.00, as we have a first class teacher in Mrs. Sprague who should be given every encouragement in her work as teacher.\n\nC.S.Bell,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 30th, 1947.\n\nMr. G.S. Bell, Indian Agent,\nBattlesford, Sask.\n\nWe have your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to transportation of children on the Little Pine Reserve. Officials of various Departments of Education agree that children under ten years of age can walk two miles each way to school daily; pupils over ten years of age should be able to walk three miles daily each way.\n\nThe conditions may be more severe on your reserve and might justify transportation. The Department has decided to allow you the amount you request, namely $225.00.\n\nHowever, we wish a very careful tally kept of the attendance so that you will be able to supply us with a report at the end of March next showing how many children attended school regularly as a result of providing transportation.\n\nBernard F.

Neary,\nDept. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI enclose a list of the children in Little Pine School and their attendance while school transportation was provided. The school was open for 74 days, and 25 children attended 60 days or more. Of the 37 on the roll, 5 have been in our school only since February when they came from Delmas Residential School. Two girls, 7 years old, living nearly 4 miles away, had the poorest attendance. The trails were so bad that the school sleigh could not get up the hill to their home and they could not walk to the sleigh which followed a\nroute 3/4 of a mile from their homes. Nearly all the other absences were from sickness.\n\nFebruary and March have been very cold and stormy, with deep and drifting snow, making the trail almost impassable. The attendance would have been very small on many days if transportation had not been provided. The drivers were very regular, and deserve great credit. The school and the people are very grateful for the increase in transportation allowance.\n\nThe allowance was for 75 days, but the closing for the Easter holidays made it 74, so probably there will be one day's driving in April.\n\nI hope the good attendance we have had so far this year will not be lowered by the spring thaw. The valley down the middle of the Reserve becomes flooded. Last year children living across the Battle River\nwere absent 9 weeks during\nthe break-up of that year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.A. Sprague.\n\n(Mrs. M.M. Sprague).\nBattleford, Sask.\nApril 6th, 1948.\n\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing for your information report received from Mrs. M.A. Sprague, Little Pine Day School teacher, in connection with transportation of children to school. There is no doubt in my mind if transportation had not been provided attendance would not have been as high as it has throughout winter months.\n\nC.S. Bell,\nIndian Agent.\nApril 14, 1946.\n\nMr. G. S. Bell,\nIndian Agent,\nBattleford, Saskatchewan.\n\nTransportation, Little Pine Day School.\n\nReference your 131-105 of April 6 -\n\nWe have noted the list of children forwarded by Mrs. Sprague, teacher at the above Day School. It is being returned, attached hereto. Would you please have Mrs. Sprague indicate those children for whom transportation was provided. It is, of course, possible that all of these children rode on the school sleigh, but it is not clear from Mrs. Sprague's letter.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

Allow me to make some few remarks on the subject.\n\nI must say, from the start, that I am very little in favor of day schools for Indian children. From a long experience of over twenty years in this country, I must say that day schools for Indians have been, are and always will be, a complete failure. It is waste of time and money. This may not be perhaps a very great consideration for some; but what is more pitiable, it is waste of labor, of devotedness and of the best energies that it is in the power of men to consecrate on behalf of others. I have seen men and women devoting themselves, from day to day, and all through the long years, with exhibitions of self-denial which are above all pain, and the long-cherished hope of seeing, some day, the results of such efforts was never realized.\n\nWe may be sure that the result will not be different in the case of Onion Lake agency.\n\nThere are, on this Reserve, two Boarding Schools: one Catholic...\nMy other protestant. The Indians have full liberty in making their choice. They have the greatest opportunity of having a real education and permanent training given to their children.\n\nThe day school at Long Lake would be only a sham. At its best, it would still be very irregular. The labor spent on the children, for a few hours, on certain days, would amount to no permanent good. And, to say all my mind, if the Indians themselves claim for a day school, it is only to have a pretext not to put their children at the Boarding Schools. It seems to me that the Department should not give them such pretext.\n\nThe Long Lake Reserve is some twenty miles distant from the Onion Lake agency, where are the Boarding schools. It is a convenient distance for the parents to visit their children when they wish to do so. So that I consider that the Department has every reason not to establish a day school at Long Lake, if it is a question of guarding the true interests of the Indians themselves.\n\nPardon me for having expressed my mind so freely, because I have a decidedly settled opinion on the whole subject.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nYour most respectful & obedient servant,\n\n+ Emile J. Legel, Bp. of St. Albert.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIndian Affairs.

On this account, in each of the enclosed lists, I have shewn the ages of the children so that the probable attendance may be ascertained. The great majority of the people belong to the R. C. Church, but do not seem particular as to which denomination the school should be under,- C. of E. or R. C.- The C. of E. was the Protestant denomination spoken of; the Protestant boarding-school at Onion Lake being under that denomination, and the one these Indians know most about. The Indians agree to haul the necessary logs, and put up the walls, if it be decided to put up a log building, and provided they are amply rationed while the work is proceeding, and they also offer to whipsaw the lumber that is required. If however the matter receives the Department's favourable consideration, the R. C. would probably be the favoured denomination, and from St. Pauls deMetis, where the R. C. Mission manufacture their own lumber, it could be supplied, of better quality than the Indians could make.\n\nIf I may be allowed to offer an opinion, I believe\nbelieve a day school with an energetic teacher, would be a success on Kee-hee-win's Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Sibbald,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, February 14, 1907.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nMr. Agent Sibbald writes the Department that the Indians of the Kesheewin reserve are anxious for the establishment of a day school and that they are not particular whether such school should be placed under the supervision of the Roman Catholics or the Church of England. The list inclosed with Mr. Sibbald's letter shows that there are about 17 children of school age on the reserve, and he thinks that if one were established it would be a success.\n\nIn connection with this matter the Roman Catholic Bishop of St. Albert has written the Department saying that he is very little in favour of day schools for Indian children and pointing out that one is not required on this reserve, as they can easily attend one of the boarding schools at Onion Lake, which is only twenty miles distant from the reserve and the parents could visit their children when they wished to do so.\n\nI think the Bishop's reasons against the establishment of a school are entitled to consideration, and as there is no provision for a teacher or a school building and as the children could be placed in one of the boarding schools at Onion Lake, there does not appear to be any great necessity for acting on Mr. Sibbald's suggestion.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

E.J. Cunningham,\nPrincipal,\nOnion Lake (R.C.) Boarding School,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nExtract from letter dated August 11th, 1910, addressed to the Minister by Mr. Agent Gibbald.\n\nSchools:- One petition was for a day school on Keeheewins reserve, Long Lake. About 3 years ago this matter was represented to the Department, and at that time the Department was not prepared to open a school there, as there are two Boarding Schools at Onion Lake, 55 miles distant, which the children could attend. There are about 35 children of school age, of whom 9 are at one or other of the boarding schools at Onion Lake. The large majority of the Indians of this band belong to the R. C. Church.\nOttawa, October 20, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the letter addressed by you to the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs on August 11th, last, it is noted that among other things the Indians on the Keeheewins reserve have asked for a day school.\n\nSome four years ago they applied for the establishment of a boarding school, which the Department was not prepared to consider, and in reply to their application for a day school I have to ask you for a full report on this matter. For your information I may say that on several of the reserves in the west the Department is conducting what are known as improved day schools. Competent teachers are provided and liberal salaries paid to those possessing the necessary qualifications. A simple mid-day meal is prepared by the older pupils under the direction of the teacher and served at the noon hour to supplement the lunches brought by the children. On some of the reserves also are provided to carry the children to and from school, where found necessary. Having a school of this class in view you will be good enough to send with your report a sketch of the reserve showing the location of the Indians, number of children of school age in each location and the distances they are situated from the site that you would recommend for the\n\nW. Gibblad, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nthe erection of a day school. The religious denomination of the parents should also be given in each case. In your report you should also make any suggestions which might prove of use to the Department in considering this question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Deputy Supt.

The location of the Indian houses will be found, with the owners names written alongside; also, in red ink, a figure indicating the number of children of school age belonging to that family. It will also be noticed that the map is divided into quarter sections, one half mile square, so that the distance that each child would have to travel to reach the proposed site of the school (also shown) can be readily judged. A few families of this band, No. 123, are not living on the reserve, but these with children will probably move on to it soon after the close of this winter.\n\nThere are 13 children belonging to this reserve already at school, viz.:\n- 1 at High River Industrial School\n- 1 at C. of E. Boarding School, Onion Lake\n- 11 at R. C. Boarding School\n\nand all the other children of school age are Catholics, the band being almost purely Roman Catholic. I also enclose a table classifying the children of school age, which may be found useful.\n\nIn connection with this reserve, I would inform you that within a few days the sawing into lumber of about 2000 logs will commence; the track is now being laid and\nthe saw and engine will soon be in position. It is likely that when the Indians have their lumber, they will take up new positions on the reserve and be more evenly distributed, so that the proposed position of the school would then be more convenient than it appears to be at present. The Indians themselves pointed this out to me.\n\nI explained at each house, the department's proposition with regard to the school, and all with one exception welcomed the idea. Nothing was said with regard to the style of building, but they have in view the sale of lumber to the department for its erection; in this matter I would say that the legs cut by the Indians are mostly 12 feet long, which might be useful information to the department in deciding the measurements of the building; another thing to be remembered is that, wherever the location may be, it will be necessary to sink a well. With regard to the location of the school, I would not advise that it be determined upon definitely, until it is seen what effect the whole matter has upon the band, when they have talked it all over thoroughly among themselves.\n\nTrusting that this information will be satisfactory,\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 14, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the establishment of a day school upon the Keshoowin's reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that in view of the fact that these Indians are not at the present time permanently located the Department is not prepared to immediately take up the matter of the erection of a building. As you are aware the question of obtaining additional land at the north end of their reserve is under consideration and the acquisition of this land, if consummated, will probably have an effect upon the permanent locations of those interested. This is an important matter, however, and the Department does not wish you to lose sight of it and you will be good enough to report upon it again at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Gibbald, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of the Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSaint-Albert, Alta., 7 Dec 1910\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI understand that it is proposed again to establish a day school on the Reserve of Keeyiwin, at Long Lake. Some few years ago when this question was first agitated, I volunteered to make some representations the justness of which was readily acknowledged and the project was abandoned. The conditions have not changed in the least since then. There is no reason whatever for a school at that point. I can predict a signal failure for such school, and an average of 4 or 5 pupils at most, for only a few months in the year, in spite of the noon meal and the hired team to bring the children to school.\n\nThis school without being of any usefulness would markedly injure the two Boarding schools at Ponoka Lake, because it would afford a pretext to the Indians for not sending their children to these schools.\n\nThe experiment of such Day schools has been made recently at Blackfoot Reserve, and I believe that one experiment of that kind should be sufficient for the Indian Department to come to the conclusion that Day schools are not and will not be, for a long time yet, adapted to the class of Indians of this country.\n\nI beg that this letter be submitted to the Superintendent General for his personal consideration, and I remain,\n\nYours sincerely + [Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nR.P. of St-Albert.\n\nIndian Affairs.

I may add, for Your Lordship's information, that it is not proposed to take any action in the immediate future.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

The Indians here renewed their request for the establishment of a day school on the reserve. There is sufficient population to justify such a step and all the children of school age are Roman Catholics; but the population is quite scattered, and what is still more unfavourable, they are as yet quite unsettled as to their locations. Several are likely to move to other parts of the reserve; but by another year they will probably be more settled.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nW. J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of December 14th last,\n\nNo. 304033, regarding the establishment of a day school on Keechewin's reserve, No.123, I have the honour to report as follows -\n\nThe matter was left in abeyance because an enlargement to the reserve was contemplated, and it was wiser to wait until the Indians had become permanently settled.\n\nThe proposed addition has been made to the reserve; six new houses are now in course of erection, and the best of the houses already in existence have been roofed with shingles, so that the location of Indian homes on the reserve may now be considered as settled. The position of the new houses does not necessitate the altering the site for a school which previous to their erection would have been most convenient.\n\nWith regard to the advisability of at all opening a day school on the reserve, I enclose a letter which I have recently received from His Lordship, Bishop Legal, also my reply to it. What he says with regard to the Indians withholding their children from either of the boarding schools at Onion Lake, is quite true with regard to most. In speaking with them, trying to get them to send their children to one or other of these schools, those who object say they will promise only to send them to the day school which they hope will soon be opened on the reserve. These Indians...\nIndians are anxious to have a school. Once they asked for a boarding school, but the department could not consider their request; later, when they asked for a day school, their request was favourably considered. It will, therefore, be a disappointment if they do not get one.\n\nIt appears there is a desire on the part of the Roman Catholic Church to build a church on the reserve; if there is any intention of the department conforming to this, and a school is also to be built, it would be well, as the interests of church and school are somewhat in common, to have them close to one another and not far removed from the farm, at a spot convenient for water. When at the reserve last month I suggested a location, but they asked me not to decide until they had talked the matter over among themselves, and they would give their opinion when next I paid them a visit.\n\nShould it still be an open question whether or not a day school is to be opened, I would ask the department to let me know as soon as convenient.\n\nIn connection with this I would say that the Indians will now not have any lumber for sale for building purposes.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSt. Albert, Alta., Nov 3, 1911\n\nDear Mr. Leibald,\n\nI understand that the Indians at Long Lake prefer sending their children to the Boarding Schools, because they always expect a day school to be organized at their own place. On the representations made by me to the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, I have been assured that no decision has been reached yet on that point, and I hope that the decision will be adverse to that plan. In my opinion our Indians are not prepared as yet, to avail themselves of the benefits of day schools, and it will be at least till several generations of the parents have been trained in the boarding schools.\n\nThe training in these Boarding Schools is certainly more easy, more satisfactory to the teachers, and more thorough for the children, and it would be a pity to deprive the Indian children of this training. As you may well know as well as myself, a day school here would be only a sham; the attention would be illusive and this school would stand there only as a pretense not to send the children to Boarding schools.\n\nThey have two Boarding schools to send their children attending to their faith. Let them profit by this splendid opportunity that so many white people envy to them. I think it would be good policy to try to make them understand that a day school would be rather a nuisance to them, and I would be very much grateful to you if you would kindly use your wide influence in that direction.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-1, part 1)\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nNovember 21, 1911.\n\nMy Lord Bishop,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been honoured with your kind letter of the 3rd instant, and in reply would inform you that the establishing of a day school on Keeheewin's reserve was proposed some time ago, but, because the Indians were not permanently located on their places and an enlargement of the reserve was contemplated, the matter was left in abeyance. The piece of land the Indians asked for has now been added to the reserve; several new houses are in course of erection, and the best of these already in existence have been roofed with shingles, so that permanent homes may now be considered as settled. I note what you say with regard to day schools, and, until the department has decided its course of action, you may be assured I shall continue to use my best endeavours to persuade the Indians to send their children to the boarding school at Onion Lake.\n\nSome years ago the Indians applied for a boarding school on the reserve, but the department was not prepared to consider the request; later, they asked for a day school.\n\nI quite agree with you that in many cases day schools, of the new obsolete type, were not a success; but no doubt in the opening of new schools the department will in a great measure be guided by the success of the improved day schools which are now in operation on some reserves. However, not having come in contact with any of these schools, I am unable to form an opinion regarding them.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Lordship's most obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Lord Bishop of St. Albert,\nAlta.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nDear Sir,\n\nHad I thought about the matter when you came to see us with Mr. Peart last week, I would have asked you if you could give me any information as to a school being located on the Indian Reserve in the near future. We have heard rumours of it. I am very anxious about my little son's education. He is nearly 8 years old and I think it is time he had regular schooling. I hear that teachers are difficult to get in these lonely parts and wonder if there should be a school, whether I might apply for the position of teacher. Perhaps you will be so kind as to advise me. I have been used to teaching and have, I am told, great patience and the ability to teach. If references should be required, I can give the highest, having taught to cousins of Mr. Asquith (the Premier) and his wife and also in schools.\n\nP.S. Beliede, a Canadian\nCertificate is necessary or not? Of course, I have not that, nor do I think I could go into a town in order to take one. Perhaps, considering I have had a good deal of experience since leaving school and have many subjects which I can teach besides the ordinary routine, such as drilling calisthenics, dancing, music, singing etc., they (in the Government whom I should apply) will not press for a Canadian certificate. Should be willing to teach any children, regardless of creed or race, and there seems to be a good many wounded. I shall be much obliged if you will kindly write me, and let me know if there is any chance of an appointment should there be a school thought.\n\nHoping I am not troubling you,\n\nFaithfully Yours,\n\nE.H. Lamb.\nSir,\n\nThey have been here with a letter received from (Mrs) E. Lamb applying for the position of teacher should it happen that a school be opened in Katherine Reserve No. 123 at Long Lake.\n\nIn this connection I would enquire if there is any change in the position since the receipt of your letter of Dec. 19th last No. 304033.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nW. Webbald\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOct.\nOttawa, July 17, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant with an application from Mrs. E. R. Lamb for the position of teacher should a school be opened on the Keshewins Reserve at Long Lake.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that no further action has been taken with regard to the establishment of a day school for reasons which are known to you. In any event it is presumed that Mr. Lamb is a Protestant and if a school were opened on this reserve it would probably be under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Sibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of 6th Sept. No. 415845 on the matter of a prospective R.C. Church on Keehewins Reserve.\n\nThe contents of your letter were communicated to the Rev. Father Cunningham by letter since then we have referred to the matter verbally only. Father Cunningham visited the reserve about the end of October and had a meeting of the band. I was at the reserve on Nov. 1st and also had a meeting. My meeting was not so largely attended as the Fathers, but Peter Thunder who is always spokesman for the band attended and reported what had taken place at the other meeting and said that he wished to express to me the opinion of the band in the way as it was expressed to the Rev. Father.\n\nThe whole thing can be put into few words. The Indians are not asking for a church, they want a school, they have repeatedly asked for one and cant understand why they do not get one.

Not long ago I met His Lordship Bishop Legal and in conversation with him he spoke unfavourably of the improved day schools and as you know discouraged the opening of one on the Keeheewins reserve. Of course it must not be forgotten that a fairly successful R.C. Boarding school exists at Onion Lake which would not be benefited by the opening of a day school at Keeheewins.\n\nSgd. W.

This is shown on our reserve for a Day School.\n\nThat is our wish to the Department in regards to a day school.\n\nAlso we all hope that they will be no longer delay in giving us a day school.\n\nAlso in regards to the school mentioned, we do not wish for a school of a sectarian religion but any school to teach the children to talk English or to give them an education.\n\nSignatures will be found on next page.\nPeter Thunder his x mark\nSimon Gadwa his x mark\nPaul Wahpisonow his x mark\nMahoose his x mark\nJoseph Pipe his x mark\nMoosapadyo his x mark\nJoseph Mahoose his x mark\nLouis Watchmaker his x mark\nMichael Paul his x mark\nPierre Gadwa his x mark\nSam Badger\nGeorge Marshall\nAlexander Gadwa his x mark\nFrench child his x mark\nSolomon French child his x mark\nJ.B.

Gibbald\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 22, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a petition from the Indians of the Keecheewins Band requesting the Department to establish a day school on their reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will give this application consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. Stewart\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. Gibbald, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, April 22, 1914.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to inform Your Lordship that the Indians of Keeheewins Band have again requested the Department to establish a day school on their reserve. Similar applications have been made to the Department for the past seven years and it was chiefly owing to Your Lordship's attitude in regard to this proposition that the establishment of a day school there was not favourably considered. The Indians are very anxious to have a day school for their children, about forty in number, and are also opposed to the idea of sending them to the Roman Catholic boarding school at Onion Lake. They claim that there is room on their reserve for a day school.\n\nThe Department is of opinion that it might be well to accede to their request in view of their persistent refusal to avail themselves of the educational facilities offered them at the residential schools and that under the terms of the treaty they would be entitled to a day school. I have, therefore, to request that Your Lordship will be good enough to state whether you would be willing to withdraw your objections to the establishment of an improved day school there.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRight Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt is very kind of you to have kept me informed of the movement started again for the establishment of a Day School on Keechenu Reserve. I do not think that the conditions have been materially altered, in the least, since I sent my objections to the Department. They are the same now as they were some years ago. The day school would a perfect failure, and moreover a pretext for not sending the children to the Boarding School.\n\nAs the great majority of the Indians there are Catholic, it would be in order to engage a Catholic teacher for such day school, and for my part, I do not know of any one who could be induced to assume this most thankless of all tasks. So, I believe that the Indians should be clearly told that there is no hope for a day school on this Reserve, and that they must send their children to the Boarding Schools, if they really want them to be truly educated. It seems to me that it should not be too difficult to make them understand that these day schools amongst them have been tried, and always found to be utterly ineffective.\n\nTherefore, I hope that the Department will agree with me and not allow any school to be built there until the time when it shall be advisable to build a new Boarding School on this Reserve, to take the place of the one now in operation.\n\nAnd I remain, Dear Sir,\n\nYours very respectfully,\n\nEmile Regal\nArchbishop of Edmonton.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The 275 pounds asked for were provided for in the estimates and will be sent from the Department's warehouse, Winnipeg.\n\nThe quantity asked for Long Lake School appears to be large, compared with the quantity asked for Frog Lake School. For Cold Lake School the Department is sending 1000 pounds which is a year's supply for an average attendance of 20 pupils.

The attendance during the quarter was good being nearly 16 and the Indians are well pleased with the progress and hope that next year a building will be erected suitable for a permanent school.\n\nWith regard to the rent asked for by the owner of the house, Sam John, there seems to be some misunderstanding. When Sam John agreed to let his house be used for a school, and although I have no recollection of having made any promise, it would seem that the Indians understood me to say that I would ask the Department to pay Sam John a small rent. I saw Sam John at the agency about the 10th of this month and he spoke to me again about rent and intimated that if he did not get rent he wanted to have the use of the house. I told him...\nI would ask what could be done\nand got his promise to allow\nthe house still to be used as\na school house until I heard\ndefinitely from the Department.\nI would ask again that\nunder the circumstances he\nmay be allowed a rent of\n$600 per month.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Legal, Archbishop of Edmonton:\n\nAnother of their demands is concerned with school of said reserve of Long Lake. The school has been opened for about a year with an average of 20 pupils, but it is held in the private house of an Indian who may at any time take possession of his house and leave them without a school. Therefore they respectfully ask that a proper school house be built for them without delay.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the extract from the letter from Archbishop Legal of Edmonton regarding the Long Lake School I beg to say that this school was opened on the 20th of March, 1916, and since that date has had an average enrolment of 29, with an average attendance of 14. There are said to be 31 children of school age on the reserve.\n\nThe school is kept in a rented building belonging to an Indian, for which the Department pays $5.00 a month. We have had no notice of any probability of the Indian wishing to take over the building, which is a log house, 16 feet by 18 feet. These dimensions will give floor space for 18 pupils and the required amount of air space for 12 pupils; in fact it would not be overcrowded with the largest attendance they have had. The owner is apparently satisfied with the rent, as he fixed the amount himself.\n\nThe teacher, Francis Dion, is an educated Indian and\nand is said to be giving satisfaction. Mr. Agent Sibbald says he is painstaking and is doing the best he can to get the children along.\n\nThe school-room is kept clean and scrubbed every Saturday. There is seating accommodation for 20 children, which is more than the average attendance and the building is in fair repair.\n\nThe teacher's wife is paid $100.00 a year for giving instruction in sewing, knitting, etc. The pupils are furnished with biscuits and bacon for a mid-day meal.\n\nSo far as the records of the Department show the present building answers the purpose.\n\nMartin Benson\nAugust 3rd, 1917.\n\nMost Rev. Sir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to that portion of your letter of the 27th ultimo in which you make known to me the wishes of the Indians of Long Lake regarding the erection of a school building. I am informed that the house now used for the purpose is satisfactory and provides fairly good accommodation, and I think you can safely assure the Indians that the present arrangement will not be disturbed. At some more opportune time we will take into consideration the erection of a school-house for them.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. E. J.

When last at the reserve, on Sept. 20th, the Indians expressed a desire that the school be reopened. The building was soon reoccupied by the owner, an Indian, from whom it was rented but I do not anticipate that there would be any difficulty in getting the use of the building again should we be able to make use of it. I did not ascertain positively because the owner was absent, but one of the councillors informed me that he believed the Department could purchase the house for $100 or $120. He also said the owner has been drawing a rent of $5 per month at which rent I suppose we could get it again but I think it would be more advisable to purchase the building right out.\n\nThe greatest hindrance lay in being unable to secure a suitable teacher.\nbut now I believe a suitable man has been found. His name is James Kyatapew or Stonechild who has been living on Onion Lake for some time. He belongs to Sanson's band of Hoblins Agency and wishes to be transferred to this agency and has obtained the consent of Sanson's band to his leaving that land but so far the acceptance has not been signed by any of the bands of this agency. Onion Lake band is the one he wished to belong to in this agency but since the time of the influenza epidemic when he lost his mother and his daughter her husband, he has become unsettled. He speaks English well, writes well and expresses himself well when writing, and says he is equal to the work of teaching Indian children. His wife can speak a little English but has had no education but can sew and make clothes. He was educated at the Red Deer Industrial School and has a knowledge of tailoring and as he says himself she can be of much help to him. When he married he became a Roman Catholic and has been baptized in the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nI have much pleasure in recommending James to the position of teacher and his wife to the position of sewing mistress. Both have been recommended by Rev. Father Thomas Principal of the Onion Lake Boarding School. The new teacher can live where the old one lived, in a building belonging to them to the church.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. Dion, and his wife, who acted as matron and instructed the children in sewing, resigned. Mr. Dion was paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum and his wife received $100.00.\n\nThe building in which the school was conducted is owned by an Indian and the Department paid a rental of $5.00 per month. The Agent recommends that this house be purchased at a cost of about $100.00 or $120.00. He states that it would be possible to rent it again at the former figure. He recommends James Kyatapew or Stonechild, an Indian of the Ssasko's Band and a graduate of the Red Deer Industrial School, as teacher, and his wife, an Indian woman who speaks very little English, as instructor in sewing and to assist with the mid-day meal. The enrolment at this school was 16 pupils, with an average attendance of 7.\n\nIt is a question whether it would be advisable to appoint an Indian and his wife as teacher and matron. The man has had very little education and his wife can only speak a little English and has had no education. The children would not be very much benefitted by the instruction they would be likely to receive from teachers of...\nof this class.\n\nI should like to be advised as your instructions in the matter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Teacher has performed his duty in excellent manner, as the rules are, to which the pupils are entitled to do. They are more intelligent than they were before.\n\nI have strongly urge the Band to send their children daily to the School, and so far, they have done it. I do everything so as to help the Teacher so the pupils may keep up their conduct in satisfactory manner.\n\nAs far as I concern, that is the kind of Teacher.\nWe want, he is far more smarter than the one we had before, so therefore we all like him, as he is honest and has performed his duty satisfactory.\n\nI therefore ask in your favour to permit us, the Band, to have him to teach the children as long as he wants to serve in teaching. I do hope to hear from the Department to answer our wish.\n\nWe had a meeting last week, and our future intention is to erect a new schoolhouse, so we hope to start this after seeding time along on May. So this is all I have to say in your honor.\n\nI remain\n\nYour very faithful servant\n\nSam Waskwitsch\nNew Chief,\nGuneyville P.O., Alta.\n\nFrom Kechevin's Res.\nNo. 123.\nP.S.)

Children unclean, many of the pupils require dental treatment. Two cases of tonsils (each one side) affected. About 50% of the pupils appear bright intellectually. One case of tubercular glands.\n\nI have instructed all teachers to train the pupils in proper breathing exercises. So many children among the Indians are \"mouth breathers\" have stooped shoulders, indolent walks, very poor carriage and physiques.\n\nH. P. Johnston,\nTravelling Nurse.\nSir,\n\nOn November 18th, I accompanied Nurse Johnston on a visit to the Long Lake Indian Day School. This school had been re-opened on November 2nd by Mr. J.F. Dion, whose appointment as teacher and his wife as assistant to teach sewing, was approved by the Department in letter dated September 9th, East, No. 115-5-1.\n\nMr. Dion left his wife at their old home, close to Edmonton, and is at present living with Farmer Stephenson on the Long Lake reserve; it is arranged that his wife will join him at the New Year.\n\nAt the time of my visit to the school on November 18th, there were present seven boys and four girls. It was a very cold day, otherwise, I believe there would have been several more in attendance that day.\n\nI would ask that a school register may kindly be mailed to Mr. J.F. Dion, Gurneyville P.O., Alberta, for use at this school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 24, 1923.\n\nSir,-\n\nThe Department has not yet received the June quarter return of the Long Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIf this school was in operation during that quarter, you should request the teacher to prepare and forward a return showing the pupils in attendance, days taught, etc., in order that the amount of salary and bonus due may be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The vouchers you enclosed have been paid. The Department notes with satisfaction that a suitable classroom has been erected and I am pleased to inform you that proper equipment will be provided. You are authorized to expend the sum of $10 in the purchase of blinds for the windows, a broom, a pail and a dishpan. You are also authorized to prepare the old school house for a teacher's residence. The estimate of $100 for this purpose should not be exceeded, if possible. In the purchase of materials please secure competitive prices, and, when forwarding properly certified vouchers in duplicate for payment, support them with Abstract of Tender forms showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nI have examined the school register and have determined the sizes of the desks that should be supplied. I have noted your request for ten double seats, but I have to inform you that the Department considers the single desks are advisable. Please intimate without delay if this change will be satisfactory. On receipt of your answering communication, arrangements will be made for the supplying of a teacher's desk and two chairs and the children's desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\nKEEHEEWINS (LONG LAKE) DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI called at this school on the evening of October 8th. The teacher was absent and I did not see him.\n\nThere has been considerable improvement made to the buildings. The teacher's house has been re-shingled; the school building has been wainscotted inside and sided outside, and is now being painted.\n\nThere are only 11 children attending at this school.\nLONG LAKE DAY SCHOOL (R.C.)\n\nI visited this school on March 1st, but being Saturday there were no children present and the teacher was absent.\n\nThe buildings at this school present an attractive appearance since they have been painted, and the premises looked tidy.\n\nI have received good reports regarding this school.\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 118-1-1 of the 19th instant, with reference to recruits for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School from the Long Lake and Frog Lake reserves.\n\nAt present all the children of school age are either attending a day school on the reserve or are in residence at one of the Indian residential schools at Onion Lake. The Department has a day school in operation on each reserve with an enrolment of nine and twelve respectively, and it is quite obvious that recruits cannot be supplied to Blue Quills School without having a very serious effect on these and probably result in their closing. While our residential schools at Onion Lake have their full complement at present it was only made possible by drafting 98 from the Battleford Agency. These schools will be passing out a number of seniors at midsummer and more recruits will be needed, but it is quite possible that they will be able to get their requirements from the same source. In view of the fact that Blue Quills requires recruits and in the interest of economy, I would respectfully suggest that the Long Lake day school be closed and the nine children enrolled, all of whom are Catholics, be transferred to Blue Quills.\nOttawa, February 8, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, with reference to recruiting for the Blue Quills Indian Residential School from the Long Lake and Frog Lake Reserves. In this connection it is noted that at present all children of school age on these reserves are either attending the reserve day school or are in residence at one of the Indian residential schools at Onion Lake, leaving an enrolment of only nine pupils at the Long Lake Day School and twelve at Frog Lake.\n\nWith reference to the Long Lake School, the Department concurs in your recommendation that this school be closed and the children placed in the Blue Quills Residential School. This school may remain in operation for the balance of the present school year, until June 30th, next, when it is to be closed. You should inform Mr. and Mrs. J. F. Dion in due time of the closing of this school and that their services will not be required after the end of June, next. After that time you should see that the doors and windows of the school building are properly secured and the classroom supplies distributed to the other day schools in your Agency, where required.\n\nEarly next summer you should take the necessary action to have the children of school age, and in good health, on the Long Lake Reserve placed in the Blue Quills Residential School. Mr. Murison is being informed that the Long Lake School will close the end of June, next, and that you have been authorized to have the children placed in the Blue Quills Residential School. You should forward applications and certificates of health for their admission, and, if possible, arrange to have them sent to Blue Quills during the coming summer.\n\nYou have been written in a separate communication regarding continuing the day school at Frog Lake.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If it is so, the same Indians are pleased and the majority even ask for the closing of this day-school.\n\nIf, however, the Department of Indians Affairs wish that this school be opened next year, they ask to you, Honourable Sir, that a teacher else than Francis Dion, the actual teacher, be appointed for this school.\n\nWe, Indians of Long-Lake, do not accept that Francis Dion be maintained as teacher, because the above-said man misses often to teach school on the due time, and chiefly because he is a drunkard and gives bad example in the reserve.\n\nYou will find enclosed a list of the Indians of Long-Lake asking for the change of Francis Dion as teacher.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nMr. Antoine Jebeaule,\nLong Lake Reserve,\nGurneyville P. O.,\nAlberta.\nGurneyville Alberta\nMarch 31, 1933\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI heard that there is talk of our little day school being shut down.\n\nOn behalf of the Keechewin's band of Indians, I wish to state that we are strongly opposed to the movement.\n\nI do not see where anyone is going to benefit through the closing of this particular school.\n\nThe following are a few reasons why we wish to retain same:\n\n1. The enrollment at the present time is too little once - about all of the children of school age there are on the reserve. At a meeting of the local women's institute a short time ago, it was resolved that they would never submit to their children being moved to a boarding school until such time as these children were able to look after themselves.\n\n2. We feel that the day school is indispensable in that it gives the child a start at home and makes it much easier for him to accept the routine of the boarding school when the time comes for him to enter same.\n\n3. The average child is naturally afraid to leave home and\nbegin his studies in a strange place, he has not the slightest idea of what to expect. The school teacher gradually\u6d88\u9664 this fear from the child's mind and prepares him for the next step until he is more than willing and he is confident that he can take care of himself.\n\n4 I do not see where the little beginner is going to receive the attention he requires when he first enters the boarding school where there are over one hundred other children demanding the teacher's supervision.\n\n5 As we have no stores nor public places of any kind on this reserve, the school has played an important part as a gathering place for our young men and boys, especially during the long winter evenings. I have personally attended on two different occasions during the past winter and I found that besides being a diversion, these gatherings are educational as well and should be encouraged.\n\n6 I am sure that the Dept. is as anxious as I am to see improvements on this reserve. I wish to state that the shutting down of the day school will be taking us several steps downward instead of up.\n\nI want to ask the Department to consider very carefully before deciding to close our little school, knowing as I do that the welfare of the Indians depends on the encouragement given them in their various reserves.\n\nSigned: Chief Gustave Dion\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-1 part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to forward the enclosed petition from Chief Gustav Dion, of the Keeheewin's band of Indians, Long Lake reserve, regarding the closing of their day school.

Hill,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 11, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing a petition from Chief Gustav Dion, of the Keeheewin's Band, regarding the closing of the Long Lake Indian Day School, and, in reply, have to say that same has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nMay 15, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nWith reference to the closing of the Long Lake Indian Day School, on the Kehiwin Reserve, No. 123, as from June 30th next, I have to say that this action was taken upon recommendation of Mr. Agent Hill, Onion Lake, on account of the small attendance. The highest enrolment during the present school year has been 10 and the highest average attendance, 7 pupils. Frequently, the daily attendance is only three to five pupils.\n\nThe teacher, Mr. J. F. Dion, is paid at the rate of $65 per teaching month, less 10%, and Mrs. Dion, assistant teacher, receives $20 per teaching month, less 10%. The total cost of operating this school during the past two fiscal years has been as follows:\n\n| Year   | Cost     |\n|--------|----------|\n| 1931-32 | $1,272.40 |\n| 1932-33 | 926.52    |\n\nThe difference in cost was occasioned by the 10% deduction in salaries.\n\nA number of children from the Kehiwin Reserve are attending the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. Agent Hill recommends that, when the Long Lake Day School was closed, the few children remaining be placed in the Blue Quills Residential School, there being ample accommodation for them and this school having difficulty in recruiting up to its full number. Grant is provided at the rate of $170 per capita for Blue Quills.\n\nIf the full number, nine children, available at the Long Lake School, were placed in Blue Quills, it would cost approximately $1,530 a year, while the cost of operating the day school is as shown above.\n\nI might add that the Provincial School Inspector who inspected the school in November, last, states that the services of Mr. Dion, the teacher, are fairly satisfactory. However, complaints have been received regarding his conduct and services.\n\nInstructions have already been given to close this school, but, if it is intended that it be continued in operation and the services of Mr. and Mrs. Dion retained, the Indian Agent and Mr. Inspector Murison should be advised.\n\nJ. D. Sutherland.\nMay 15, 1933.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nMr. Sutherland has furnished me with the attached memorandum in reference to the Long Lake Indian Bay school, the subject of our telephone conversation of a few days ago. Action has been taken for the closing of the school upon the recommendation of Mr. Agent Hill, Onion Lake, and the concurrence of Inspector Murison.\n\nThe memorandum sets out the facts as displayed by our files. We feel that the recommendation of the Agent and Inspector should be given some consideration, but if it is the Minister's direction that the school should be kept open and the services of the teachers continued, any steps already taken can be cancelled.\n\nincl.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je re-\ntard\u00e9 apport\u00e9 \u00e0 pour cause l'esp\u00e9rance qu'une solution favorable viendrait\npour la question de l'\u00e9cole du jour de la \"R\u00e9serve Indienne de Keeheewin\"\nou \"Long-Lake Indian Reserve\", Alta.\nCe n'est pas mon habitude d'\u00e9crire souvent au d\u00e9partement indien pour me\nplaindre mais si je le fais aujourd'hui c'est pour \u00e9 par le d\u00e9sir d'accom-\nplir mon devoir, et m\u00eame de donner quelques points pr\u00e9cis sur la question\ndes \u00e9coles du jour dans l'agence Indienne d'\"Onion-Lake\".\nAu mois de juin dernier, l'ordre est venu d'Ottawa de fermer les \u00e9coles in-\ndiennes du jour dans l'Agence d'\"Onion-Lake\" et par le fait m\u00eame celle de\nKeeheewin est ferm\u00e9e depuis juin dernier.\nPuis-je dire, monsieur, que la fermeture de cette \u00e9cole de Keeheewin est un\nmalheur pour cette r\u00e9serve, et je parle avec connaissance de cause, \u00e9tant\ncharg\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9serve depuis quelques ann\u00e9es d\u00e9j\u00e0. Dans cette \u00e9cole, il y\na eu une attendance journali\u00e8re de 10 \u00e0 12 \u00e9l\u00e8ves. Le ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9cole, mon-\nsieur J.Fran\u00e7ois Dion, ancien \u00e9l\u00e8ve de l'\u00e9cole indienne d'Onion-Lake, nous\na donn\u00e9 un r\u00e9sultat satisfaisant depuis ses 16 ans qu'il enseigne.\nCe que je ne puis comprendre c'est pourquoi l'\u00e9cole de Frog-Lake, Alta., dans\nla m\u00eame agence indienne d'Onion-Lake, reste ouverte quand il n'y a pas ou\npresque pas d'enfants qui fr\u00e9quentent cette \u00e9cole du jour. Depuis plusieurs\nann\u00e9es on parle de fermer cette \u00e9cole du jour et, quand l'ordre de fermer les\n\u00e9coles, celle qui devrait fermer la premi\u00e8re reste ouverte et les autres qui\ndonnaient assez bonne satisfaction demeurent ferm\u00e9es. Pour l'\u00e9cole de Frog-\nLake je parle en connaissance de cause, car j'ai \u00e9t\u00e9 charg\u00e9 de cette r\u00e9serve\npendant quelques ann\u00e9es et je puis dire que le nombre d'enfants fr\u00e9quentant\ncette \u00e9cole est tr\u00e8s limit\u00e9. \u00c0 l'appui de cette assertion, voyez les rapport\u00e9\ndes inspecteurs et f\u00e9d\u00e9raux et provinciaux. Il y a donc l\u00e0 une influence in-\ndue. Je n'ai absolument rien contre le ma\u00eetre d'\u00e9cole de Frog-Lake, mais je\ntrouve injuste qu'il soit maintenu dans sa position et gardant son \u00e9cole ou-\nverte quand les autres \u00e9coles sont ferm\u00e9es. S'il fait office de fermier ins-\ntructeur, qu'il soit pay\u00e9 comme tel et non comme instituteur et s'il veut\nenseigner la classe de sa volont\u00e9 libre et sans r\u00e9mun\u00e9ration, personne n'au-\nra rien \u00e0 redire.\n\nDonc nous protestons fortement contre cet \u00e9tat de choses. De\nplus Monseigneur l'archev\u00eaque d'Edmonton doit de nouveau protester et offi-\nciellement.\n\nUne chose qui semble bien incompr\u00e9hensible, c'est que les deux \u00e9-\ncoles indiennes du jour sous la domination des \"Anglicans\" Frog-Lake, Alta., et\nLittle Island Lake Sask., demeurent ouvertes et dans la m\u00eame agence indienne\nd'Onion-Lake tandis que nos \u00e9coles du jour de Keeheewin et de LeGoff Alta.,\ndemeurent ferm\u00e9es. De m\u00eame aussi celle de Big-Island Lake, Sask., qui \u00e9tant ou-\nverte et support\u00e9e par initiative priv\u00e9e n'est pas encore reconnue officiel-\nlement par le d\u00e9partement.\n\nCes r\u00e9serves indiennes de Keeheewin et de LeGoff, sont deux r\u00e9serves enti\u00e8-\nrement catholiques et nous avons comme fermiers instructeurs des protestants\npour ces positions.\n\nDonc je demande que l'\u00e9cole du jour de cette r\u00e9serve de Keeheewin\nsoit ouverte imm\u00e9diatement et sous la direction de notre instituteur ordinai-\nre J.Francis Dion.

It was delayed in the hope that a favorable solution would come for the question of the day school of the Sioux reserve at Keechewin or Long Lake Sioux Reserve, Alta.\n\nIt is not my habit of writing often to the Indian Department to complain but if I do today it is on account of my desire to accomplish my duty, and even to give a few precise points on the day school of the Onion Lake Indian Agency.\n\nDuring the month of June last, order came from Ottawa to close the day schools of the Onion Lake Agency and on that account the school of Keechewin is closed since last June.\n\nMay I say, Sir, that the closing of that school of Keechewin is a calamity for that reserve, and I am well aware of the fact having been in charge of that reserve for a number of years. At this school there is a daily attendance of 10 to 12 pupils. The school master Mr. Francis Dion, an old pupil of the Indian school of Onion Lake, has given most satisfactory results during the 16 years he has taught. What I cannot understand is why the school of Frog Lake, Alta., in the same Agency of Onion Lake, remains open when there is not or hardly any children frequenting that day school. For several years there was a movement to close that day school, and when the order came to close the schools, we found that the one which should have been closed first remained opened, while the\nothers which were giving fair satisfaction remain closed. For the school at Frog Lake I know what I am talking about, for I was in charge of that reserve for a few years and I can say that the number of children attending that school is very limited. To sustain this assertion you can consult the reports of the federal and provincial inspectors. There is consequently bad influence somewhere. I have absolutely nothing against the school teacher at Frog Lake, but I feel it unjust that he should be maintained in his position and that his school be kept open while the others are closed. If he is employed as farm instructor, he should be paid as such and not as a teacher, and if he wants to teach school at his own free will and without pay, no one would have anything to say.\n\nConsequently we should protest against that state of affairs. Furthermore His Grace the Bishop of Edmonton will protest against it officially.\n\nA thing which does not seem comprehensible, is that the two Indian day schools under the direction of the Church of England at Frog Lake, Alta., and Little Island Lake, Sask., remained opened and in the same Indian Agency of Onion Lake, while our day schools of Keechewin and St. Geoff., Alta., remain closed. In the same way that Frog Lake, Sask., which was opened and supported by the initiative of private subscription, is not yet officially recognized by the Department.\n\nThese reserves of Keechewin and St. Geoff., are two reserves which are entirely catholic and we have as farm instructors protestants holding such positions.\n\nHence, I request that the day school of that reserve of Keechewin be immediately opened and placed under the direction of our nearest\nteacher Mr. J. Francis Dion. There will be at least a dozen of children that will attend to it; because the Indians here are very anxious to have the school opened on their reserve as in the past.\n\nIf someone preaches economy in all the departments of the government, that economy should be applied with justice for everyone and not only for a few.\n\nHoping dear sir, that this letter will bring a favorable reply.\n\nI subscribe myself\n\nYours devotedly,\n\n(J.S.) J. E. Pratt, Trustee\n\nO.M.D.\nOttawa, October 25, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, relative to the closing of the Long Lake Indian Day School, on the Kehiwin Reserve.\n\nIn reply I have to say that this school was closed on account of attendance. It is considered that the children of school age could be placed in the Blue Quills Indian Residential School, as there is ample accommodation for them and this school has had difficulty in recruiting up to its full number. Our funds this year were so limited, that it was necessary to close a number of day schools. The Frog Lake School was continued, owing to the fact that there was no accommodation for these children in the Onion Lake Anglican Indian Residential School. At the Cold Lake School, which has also been closed, there were very few Indian children, and these children can be placed in the Blue Quills School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. E. Pratt, O. M. I.,\nCold Lake, Alta.\n| CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS | CENTRAL REGISTRY | REFERRED TO | DATE REC'D | INITIALS |\n|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|-----------------|-------------|------------|----------|\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n|                 |             |            |          |                 |             |            |          |\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. Dion, and he and his wife, who is employed as seamstress, and children are living in a small Indian house which they have borrowed for the purpose, and which is not at all suitable for them. The Indians of the band, being desirous of retaining the services of Mr. and Mrs. Dion, have taken out logs to erect a building which could be used as a schoolhouse; with the idea that the building now used for that purpose could be used as a residence for the teacher. This plan Mr. Dion assured me would be most acceptable and satisfactory so far as he and his family are concerned. The new building would be built close to the present schoolhouse and would be about 22 by 26 feet in size, and the Indians have offered to furnish the logs and lumber, and perform the labour, free; but have asked me to request the Department to supply shingles and tar paper for the roof, and doors and windows for the building; costing approximately $100.00 made up as follows:\n\n- Shingles: $45.00\n- Nails: $5.00\n- Tarpaper: $6.00\n- 2 doors @ $6.00: $12.00\n- 5 windows @ $4.50: $22.50\n- Locks, screws, hinges, etc.: $9.50\n\n$100.00\n\nI promised the Indians to ask the Department to allow this expenditure.\nthis expenditure, but gave them to understand that, if allowed, none of the money would be spent before the walls of the building were erected and the material asked for, actually needed to complete the work.\n\nI would ask the Department to kindly give me authority to incur this expenditure, if the Indians of the band erect the building.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant.\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOTTAWA, June 6th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo regarding the erection by the Indians of a log building for school purposes on the Kecheewin's (Long Lake) Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the Indians undertake the work of putting up this building, the Department would be prepared to authorize an expenditure not exceeding $100 in the supplying of shingles, nails, tarpaper, doors, windows and hardware, as per your estimate. These supplies, however, only to be furnished when the walls of the building are erected, and the material asked for actually needed to complete the work. You are hereby authorized to purchase the above mentioned supplies at the time when you consider the work of putting up the building has sufficiently advanced to warrant the goods being delivered.\n\nIt will be necessary, in making the purchase, to obtain competitive prices as far as possible, and you should forward properly certified vouchers covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYou should encourage the Indians to proceed with this work and, when it is started, it should be proceeded with until completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

As Amahoose has been receiving a rental of $60.00 per annum for the building, I have hitherto shelved the matter by pointing out to him the folly of wanting to sell a building so profitable to himself. However, he persists in his desire to sell the house, and I would respectfully recommend that the Department purchase it for the amount named; more especially as the building is likely to become the residence of the teacher, Mr. J. F. Dion, in the near future, and he would feel unsettled living in a building which the owner was continually trying to sell.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 12th June, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 27th ultimo, recommending the purchase of the building which is used for a day school at Keeheewin's reserve for the sum of $100.00.\n\nIn reply I beg to enclose a quit claim deed which you will be good enough to have executed by the owner of the property in question and signed in the presence of yourself as witness. A space has been left on page one of this document in which you will be good enough to fill in a description by metes and bounds of the land on which this building is situated and which is to be transferred along with the buildings.

SCOTT.\n\nWith reference to that portion of the letter of Chief Sam Waskawitch, forwarded by F. O. Loft, Toronto, regarding the school building at Long Lake, on the Keechewin's Reserve, Onion Lake Agency, No. 65, and the school at this point is at present being conducted in a building which the Department purchased from an Indian in July, 1922. Previous to that time rental was paid for this building at the rate of $5 per month. It was found that this building was unsatisfactory for classroom purposes, and the Indians agreed last winter to get out logs for the erection of a new school building. This they did, and the walls of this new building are now partly built. The Department has supplied shingles, window frames and doors, and the Indians themselves were to do the work in completing the building.\n\nThis matter could be taken up with the Indian Agent to ascertain definitely what amount of work the Indians have already performed in the erection of the building, and what further material, if any, in the way of interior finishing, such as flooring, nails, etc., is required. Mr. Inspector Murison, in a report dated March 3rd, last, on a visit to this school, stated that it was expected that the Indians would have the building completed by the end of March, 1923. We have no further information as to what has been done since the Inspector's visit. The building purchased, which is now used as a classroom, was to be fitted up as a residence for the teacher when the new school building was finished.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 8th, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to request that you will inform the Department as to the progress that has been made by the Indians in erecting a building for school purposes at Long Lake, on the Keehewin's Reserve. In your letter to the Department dated May 27th, 1922, you stated that the Indians of the Band had taken cut logs to put up a building for school purposes, with the idea that the building which was purchased from an Indian named Amahoose, and at present used as a school, could be used as a teacher's residence. At that time you requested authority to supply the Indians with the necessary shingles, nails, doors, windows, etc. An account was paid in March, last, to the amount of $71.00 for shingles, windows and doors. If the Indians have not yet completed this building, you should endeavour to have them do so as soon as weather conditions permit. If any further material in the way of interior finishing, such as flooring, etc., is required, you should forward a list of the same, stating the approximate price. It might be that the teacher would see that the Indians perform the work satisfactorily, and complete the building at an early date.\n\nWe shall be pleased to hear from you as to the present state of the new building, and also when the Indians purpose having it completed and ready for occupation for classroom purposes. Your early attention to this matter will oblige,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 8th instant, No.135-5-5, with reference to a new school building in course of erection by the Indians of Kesheewin's reserve.\n\nAlthough progress has been slow with this building it has not been neglected. The delay has been caused chiefly by the difficulty some of the Indians experienced in getting the necessary lumber. However, it is mostly all there now, and at my last visit a few days ago, the Indians were only waiting for the weather to turn warmer to complete the building. The log walls are already built and the necessary rough and dimension lumber is on hand. The inside measurements of the building are 16' by 24'.\n\nThe only further outlay in connection with this building that I would ask the Department to bear, is as follows:\n\n| Item                  | Cost   |\n|-----------------------|--------|\n| Flooring (and freight)| $48.00 |\n| Nails                 | $12.00 |\n| Locks, hinges, etc.   | $10.00 |\n| Plastering            | $25.00 |\n\n$95.00\n\nI told the Indians who are putting up the building that I would not expect them to do the plastering (mudding up) but that I would ask the Department to allow me to pay some of their old men and women to do that work.\n\nI feel reasonably sure that we will have this building completed and ready for occupation early in April if weather conditions permit.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo, reporting on the progress made by the Indians in erecting a building for school purposes at Long Lake, on the Keecheewin's Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that the lumber for the erection of the building is now nearly all delivered on the ground, and that the Indians are only waiting for the weather to turn warm to complete the building. You may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the quantities of flooring, nails, locks, hinges, etc., required to complete the interior of the building. If possible, competitive prices should be obtained and the purchase made from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should arrange to have the purchase made and the above materials delivered in order that there will be no delay by the Indians in completing the building when the warm weather sets in.\n\nRegarding the plastering, the Department will pay for the labour required. You should keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed.\n\nWhen the material authorized above is purchased, and the plastering (mudding up) is completed, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nWe note you are of the opinion that, when the above supplies are delivered, the building will be completed and ready for occupation early in April, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ltd., St. Paul des Metis, Alta.\n\nfor Flooring - New Day School Keeheewin's reserve\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. 115-5-5 dated March 3, 1924.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of March 3rd, last, No. 115-5-5, in connection with a building for school purposes which the Indians of Keshewin's reserve were erecting; and to enclose herewith Vouchers No. 12 and 13 for payment of material purchased.\n\nThis school is now completed and a very nice substantial building has been put up. It is of logs, the inside measurements being 18' x 24', and is of two stories with a well shingled roof. The upper story is to be used as a dining room for the pupils for their midday meal and is entered by a flight of stairs running up from the outside, which leaves the whole of the ground floor space as a classroom.\n\nThe building of this school is a credit to the whole band. The Indians not only took out the logs and hewed them, but they also supplied the rough lumber required and did all the labour of building without pay. I complimented them upon this work and told them that I would try and have their new school properly equipped. I would therefore recommend that before the building is taken over for occupation it be supplied with desks. There are no desks in the old school building only two large tables and four forms. The number and kind of desks required are ten, medium size, double Preston desks. A teacher's desk and chair would also be very useful and would be much appreciated. It will be necessary also to purchase six blinds for the windows, and a broom, pail, dishpan, etc. These could be purchased locally at a cost not exceeding $10.00.\n\nI may mention that it is intended to fix up the old schoolhouse as a teacher's residence. An amount of $100.00 was placed in Estimates for that purpose.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 16, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 99-2 of the 7th instant, with reference to the new building at the Long Lake Indian Day School. The vouchers you enclosed have been paid. The Department notes with satisfaction that a suitable classroom has been erected and I am pleased to inform you that proper equipment will be provided. You are authorized to expend the sum of $10 in the purchase of blinds for the windows, a broom, a pail and a dishpan. You are also authorized to prepare the old school house for a teacher's residence. The estimate of $100 for this purpose should not be exceeded, if possible. In the purchase of materials please secure competitive prices, and, when forwarding properly certified vouchers in duplicate for payment, support them with Abstract of Tender forms showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted.\n\nI have examined the school register and have determined the sizes of the desks that should be supplied. I have noted your request for ten double seats, but I have to inform you that the Department considers the single desks are advisable. Please intimate without delay if this change will be satisfactory. On receipt of your answering communication, arrangements will be made for the supplying of a teacher's desk and two chairs and the children's desks.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

A flight of stairs, outside, at the back of the building, lead to an upper floor over the classroom and it is in this upper room the midday meal is eaten. Most of the work on this building had been performed by the Indians free, but a little finishing work was required to be done, and this I agreed with Indian Solomon Youngheier, who is quite a handy carpenter, to pay for. Most of the time covered by the accompanying voucher is, however, for work on alterations to the old schoolhouse to make it suitable for a teacher's residence. There were ceiling joists in this old building but no flooring on them; flooring has now been put down and a stairway made leading to this upper room, the whole of which can now be used as sleeping quarters. Partitions have been put in on the ground floor and two suitable living rooms have been made. At my last visit to the reserve on October 7th, the work was not quite completed, but the teacher, Mr. J. F. Dion, expressed himself as being well satisfied with the work done, and I have no doubt he is now living in the building with his family.\n\nIt was necessary to install a stove drum to heat the upper floor of the Day School; this I instructed Mr. Stephenson, the Farm Instructor, to purchase locally and put in.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n**Onion Lake Agency**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs**\n\nTo Mr. J.

The teacher's house is not completed, and requires extensive repairs to make it habitable for winter. The school house is a very good one, and would be in good repair, were the interior re-plastered, the upper room plastered and the gable end shingled. There is no foundation. There is a small but good garden; this and approximately one acre about the teacher's house is fenced. The water supply seems satisfactory.\n\nWith regard to what Inspector Crispo says re two buildings which are owned by the Department and which require repairing, I have taken this matter up with Mr. Inspector Murison, who understands the situation, and he thinks that with an expenditure of $50.00 the work could be accomplished. I would therefore ask for authority to incur this expenditure.\n\n(Sgd.) W. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 4, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to refer to the report of the public school inspector on his inspection of the Long Lake Indian Day School, relative to the condition of the school building and teacher's residence, which require certain minor repairs to make them comfortable for the coming winter. The Department will approve of an expenditure of approximately $50 to have the necessary work done. We note that you have taken this matter up with Mr. Inspector Murison, who understands the situation at this school, and that he considers the above amount will be sufficient to complete the repairs required at the present time. I shall be pleased if you will make arrangements to have the work considered necessary carried out.

I found the health of the children was good at the time of my visit and they presented a clean appearance. Four wash basins are provided, as well as separate towels and they are also provided with toothbrushes. For recreation they have one swing, a tester, football and baseball. They also join in organized games under the direction of the teacher. The teacher's wife receives $15.00 per month for taking care of the school and looking after the cleanliness of the children. She also teaches them sewing and knitting. The teacher has a garden and provides the children with vegetable soup while the garden stuff lasts. The teacher also supplies milk to the children from his own cows and when milk is plentiful they boil their biscuits in it. There is no mid-day meal provided at this school. The only thing given by the Department are two biscuits per day for each child. Many of the people on this reserve are poor and there are times when the children have very little to eat at home. There is no doubt that the kindness of the teacher in supplementing their mid-day meal has added greatly to the attraction of the school for the children. Mr. Francis Dion, the teacher, is a graduate of the Onion Lake Residential School. He is very earnest in his work and has made a great effort to acquire a knowledge of teaching methods with a degree of success, which in my opinion reflects credit upon him. I found the buildings and premises in a clean and tidy condition. The comfort of the teachers dwelling has been added to by lining the house with V joint. The buildings are log and are plastered with mud, which, of course, washes off with the summer rains and entails considerable amount of work replastering each year. If this\nmud were replaced with lime and sand, it would be much more satisfactory. It is difficult to keep the children at this school after they reach the age of twelve years and the people are being encouraged to send their older children to residential schools.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-5, part 1)\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI am enclosing herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Onion Lake Agency. The report is very complete and the Inspector has gone into matters very thoroughly.\n\nThe work that is going on at the Keeheewin Day school seems to be quite satisfactory, but the building in which this school is held should be plastered with lime and sand this summer. The cost would not be more than $100.0 and probably a great deal less. It is poor business plastering with mud.\n\nW. M.

It is noted you estimate the cost to be approximately $100, or possibly less.

Nov. 23rd, 1928.\n\nINSPECTION REPORT ON SCHOOLS ONION LAKE AGENCY\n\nDear Mr. Graham,\n\nI visited this school on October 31st and found 4 boys and 2 girls present out of an enrollment of 10. The teacher's 3 girls were also present. They are attending the school, but are not shown on the register.\n\nMr. Francis Dion, the teacher, continues to be quite faithful to his duties, and I considered his work quite commendable, considering the disadvantages that he has to work with, particularly insofar as the irregularity of the attendance is concerned.\n\nThe children were quite clean and tidy and healthy looking.\n\nThe school building was also clean and presented a good appearance. Since my last visit this building has been plastered with lime and sand and whitewashed. Only the school was re-plastered with lime and sand. When I suggested the re-plastering of these buildings in my last report, I included the teacher's residence, but the agent apparently was under the impression that only the school building was to be done. I think that the teacher's residence should be re-plastered with lime and sand. It is a difficult matter, where they live in houses the year around, to keep them looking decent. These buildings would look better if the roof and the gable ends were painted. The outside closets should also be painted. The teacher has asked for doorsteps in front of the school. These might be supplied and also 1 large and 1 small iron gate for the fence.\n\nA new well is also required at this school. The present well does not furnish an adequate supply for the use of the school and teacher's residence.\n\nThe teacher also asks if he might be provided with pictures of the King and Queen and some other prominent men as well. We have pictures of the King and Queen in practically all of our schools and I would recommend that the Department supply these.\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nCommissioners Office, Regina, Sask.\nNov. 25th, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nWith reference to the Inspector's remarks regarding the teacher's residence at the Keeheewin Day School, probably the reason that the building was not re-plastered was because it was the intention of the Agent to line it with siding. This has been asked for in the Estimates that were forwarded, also an amount for painting the interior. I think if this were done it would make a better building.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, December 6th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, in a report on his recent inspection of the Long Lake Indian Day School, states as follows regarding the building:\n\n\"The school building was clean and presented a good appearance. Since my last visit this building has been plastered with lime and sand and whitewashed. Only the school was replastered with lime and sand. When I suggested the replastering of these buildings in my last report, I included the teacher's residence, but the Agent apparently was under the impression that only the school building was to be done. I think that the teacher's residence should be replastered with lime and sand. It is a difficult matter, where they live in houses the year around, to keep them looking decent. These buildings would look better if the roof and gable ends were painted. The outside closets should also be painted. The teacher has asked for doorsteps in front of the school. These might be supplied and also one large and one small gate, iron, for the fence. A new well is also required at this school. The present well does not furnish an adequate supply for the use of the school and teacher's residence.\"\n\nIt is, no doubt, too late this season to have the work recommended by the Inspector carried out, but you should draw the various matters referred to by the Inspector to the attention of the Department early next spring. You should give an estimate of the cost of the labour and material required in having the teacher's residence replastered with lime and sand, also in having the roof and gable ends and outside closets painted, and in having doorsteps installed in front of the school. You should also state the cost of supplying a large and a small iron gate for the fence.\n\nYou will note what the Inspector states regarding the well. You might, when giving information regarding the buildings, also furnish a report as to what steps you would recommend be carried out in providing an adequate supply of water at this school and the cost of same.\n\nIn the meantime, it is hoped that conditions will be satisfactory for the carrying on of the work and that the teacher and pupils will be comfortable during the present winter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nLang Turner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This would probably cost from $75.00 to $150.00, according to the depth it would be necessary to bore, which I do not think would be more than between 60 and 80 feet. However, I will report with respect to a well for this school later.\n\nIn my 1929-1930 estimates, I have placed an amount of $200.00, for covering the exterior of the school-house with drop siding, and painting both exterior and interior. I would be glad to have authority to do this work,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may, therefore, arrange to have the following work performed as soon as weather conditions permit:\n\n- Teacher's residence to be replastered with lime and sand,\n- Exterior to be painted; also outside closets,\n- School building to be covered with drop siding and painted both inside and outside,\n- Doorsteps in front of school building to be repaired.\n\nYou may also arrange for the purchase of a large and a small iron gate for the fence around the school building.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the total cost of the material and labour in carrying out the above work to be approximately $381.00. You should arrange for the purchase of all the material required and for the labour in having the work carried out, and you should see that a satisfactory job is completed and all expense kept as low as possible.\n\nAfter this work has been completed, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and for the labour in carrying out the work. Funds for the purpose will be available in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year. Should you require an advance to pay for labour, the same will be sent you upon request.\n\nIt is noted you will report later relative to a well for this school. At that time, you should give an estimate of the cost and state how you propose having the work carried out.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Alberta, for articles purchased for use in Long Lake Indian Day School; Onion Lake Agency.\n\nThis expenditure was authorized by Departmental Letter No. dated\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nForm No. 101\nOnion Lake Agency\n\nOnion Lake, Saskatchewan,\nApril 10, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of the 26th ultimo, No.115-5-5, and to request that I may be favoured with a cheque for $110.00 for labour, etc., in connection with the Long Lake Indian Day School at this Agency.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to refer to the last paragraph of your letter of March 26th, last, No. 115-5-5, with respect to a well for the Long Lake Indian Day School at this Agency.\n\nI had heard of a man with a well boring outfit at Heinsburg, a small town situated to the south of, and between, the Frog Lake and Long Lake Indian Reserves; so, on the 27th instant, I visited him and obtained his prices for boring a well two feet in diameter. These are $2.25 per foot for the first 20 feet with an increase of 25\u00a2 per foot for every additional 20 feet. At this rate, and estimating the depth of the well at 75 feet, the cost would be $195.00; which, together with the cost of the cribbing, $30.00, would bring the total cost to $225.00. I do not think it will be found necessary to go so deep as 75 feet for water, but thought it safer to estimate at that depth.\n\nIf the Department decides to authorize me to have this well made for the Long Lake School, it might be well to consider having one made at the same time for the Frog Lake Day School. This school has never had an adequate water supply, although several shallow wells have been dug there. I believe that the cost of a well for this school would be, approximately, the same as that for the Long Lake School.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, May 8th, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, giving an estimate of the cost of boring a well for the use of the Long Lake Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of your arranging for the well boring outfit mentioned by you to bore a well at this school. We note that the approximate cost, including cribbing, will be approximately $225, depending on the depth to which the well will have to be bored. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of a pump of a suitable type, if same is required, and you should see that the well is satisfactorily completed in all respects and that there is an ample supply of water for school use.\n\nRelative to the boring of a well by the same outfit, and at the same cost, at the Frog Lake Indian Day School, I have to say that the Department will also approve of your arranging to have a well bored at this school. It is hoped that it will not be necessary to expend any larger amount in having the work done at this school than at the Long Lake School. You may also arrange for the purchase and installation of a pump, if same is required.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of having the wells satisfactorily completed at both the above schools in your hands to have the work carried out at the least possible expense, and after these wells have been bored, you should forward accounts, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I therefore had the old shingles taken off and replaced with new ones. This extra work has almost used up the amount which I had estimated, and I would ask the Department to kindly give me authority to expend $100.00 more for this work. I should add that I have placed an estimate in next year's estimates to cover the shingling of the teacher's residence which will not now be necessary.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 5th, 1929.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, relative to the repairs which you were authorized to have carried out at the Long Lake Indian Day School and teacher's residence. It is noted that these repairs have now been completed with the exception of the painting. You may incur an expenditure of approximately $100 in having the necessary painting carried out.\n\nIt is noted that you found it necessary to have the roof of the residence reshingled and that this extra work used up the amount which you were authorized to expend in official letter of March 26th, last.\n\nIn connection with these repairs, I would refer you to your letter of April 29th and the Department's reply thereto of May 8th regarding the boring of a well at this school. It is hoped that this work has been completed.\n\nPlease forward accounts in duplicate, properly certified, covering any further amount due for the repairs, also accounts covering the cost of the drilling of the well and for the painting, when same is completed.\n\nIt is hoped that, as a result of all the work which you are authorized to carry out at this school, the buildings will be placed in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nLang Turner, Esq.\nIndian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to enclose herewith Voucher No. 255, amounting to $239.25, for a well for the Long Lake Indian Day school; and also a letter which Mr. Warne, the farming instructor at that reserve, has sent me with reference to having a well drilled at the farmhouse there.\n\nSome seven or eight years ago a well was bored at the Long Lake farm, and the water was good for some time, but afterwards became very alkali, and is still so and cannot be used. This well also is 75 feet deep, and experience with this and other wells in the district has proved to us that the alkali comes into the well about 40 feet from the surface and runs into the good water, which is deeper, and spoils it; and it seems that the only way to overcome this difficulty is to have a well drilled, like the one just completed at the school, and drive an iron casing past the alkali, thus shutting it off, down into the good water which lies at a depth of about 75 feet.\n\nIf the Department consents to allow me to have a well made at the farmhouse, I would ask it to kindly wire me, as the outfit is being left on the reserve for the present. I may add that if I had known of the success which we would have in obtaining water at the school on this reserve, I would have placed an item in my estimates to cover the cost of a well for the farmhouse.\n\nI should add that the cost of drilling this well will be, approximately, the same as at the school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n**DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS**\n\nTo Lang Turner, Indian Agent,\n\nOnion Lake, Sask.\n\n**CREDIT VOUCHER**\n\n| DATE       | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| November 25| To Advance Cheque No. 301, for $110.00, for account repairs at Long Lake Indian Day School, as per receipts attached. |        |\n| July 1     | Paid Dumas Maison, freighting                                           | $ 2.00 |\n| September 6| \" E.

I will report on these schools in the order of their visitations.\n\nLONG LAKE DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school is situated on the Keeheewin Reserve. The classroom is a 1\u00bd story log building, and is quite well adapted for its purpose. It is roomy and well lighted, and I found it in a cleanly condition. There are 5 boys and 5 girls enrolled, 8 of whom were present on the day of my visit. The average attendance is 5.\n\nI found the children clean and healthy looking. Three wash basins and individual towels are provided in the classroom. A mid-day meal, consisting of soup and biscuits, is given the children. This is prepared by the teacher's wife who also gives them instruction in knitting and sewing. The children are also given instruction in gardening during the summer. For recreation they have a football and a teeter, which is also used as a merry-go-round.\n\nThey have a good well 24 ft. deep with an ample supply of excellent water. The teacher asked W. M. Graham, Esq., Indian Commissioner, Regina, Sask., if he...\nLONG LAKE DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nif he might be provided with a wooden pump as his present iron pump head freezes up in winter. I pointed out that all that is necessary will be the wooden pump head, which is an inexpensive matter.\n\nThe teacher, Francis Dion, is an ex-pupil of the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School. He is a man of good habits and is earnest in his work. The trouble at day schools on outlying reserves, where the Indians devote a great deal of their time to hunting and trapping, is the intermittent attendance, and it cannot be expected that a teacher, not matter how well qualified, could get satisfactory results under those conditions.\n\nI found the premises in a tidy condition, and the fence in good repair.\n| DATE     | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| November | To the following supplied Onion Lake Agency,                             |        |\n|          | for the Long Lake Indian Day School.                                    |        |\n| Oct.     | 50 lbs.

(RG 10, Volume 6288, file 613-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES  \nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES  \nCANADA\nInspector Murison's Report on Schools in the Onion Lake Agency\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit the following report of a visit I made to the Residential and Day Schools in the Onion Lake Agency during the month of October last.\n\nLONG LAKE DAY SCHOOL\n\nI visited this school on the 7th March last and again on the 18th of October. On both occasions I found the school in a clean and tidy condition. The children were well clothed and presented a clean and healthy appearance. On my last visit I found five boys and four girls in attendance, their ages ranging from five to eight and one half years. As the Indians of this Band still follow their avocation of hunting and trapping in season as a means of livelihood, the attendance varies; the average attendance during the cold winter months being better than during the fall. In February last the average attendance was eight. In October it was 4.84. Apart from the classroom work, the girls are taught knitting and sewing by the teacher's wife.\n\nA garden, comprising one and one half acres of land, is kept in good condition and the boys assist with the work of weeding etc. during the summer months. During the winter months the children are given a hot bowl of vegetable soup; the produce of the garden being utilized in this way. In my opinion, providing this soup is a valuable feature in maintaining the health -\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nmaintaining the health of the children. They have in addition two biscuits each. The cost of providing the small quantity of meat required for the soup is very low and I feel that the soup is of much greater value to the children than other hot drinks which have been suggested, such as cocoa, milk etc. I was informed by one of our Day School teachers that when the children return from their summer vacation, many of them are found with skin infections and after a few weeks at school, receiving a large bowl of hot soup daily, their skin clears up and their health improves. Indians, as a rule, are not vegetable eaters and the only vegetables that many of these children get regularly are what they get at the school in their soup. I can remember very well that when the question of supplying a hot drink for the children during the winter months was first suggested, the intention was simply to provide a hot bowl of soup to supplement the biscuits during the cold weather; but this privilege was taken advantage of at many points and a full mid-day meal provided requiring the services of additional help. It is not my idea to provide a mid-day meal, but I certainly would recommend that where a hot drink is being provided for the children, soup would be much more valuable and beneficial to the children than cocoa or tea, and the cost is very little, if any, greater. The vegetables required can be raised at the school, so the only cost entailed would be some cheap joints of meat. This can be obtained very cheaply at the present time.\n\nThe Teacher, Mr. Francis Dion, is an ex-pupil of the Onion Lake R. C. Residential School. The Provincial School Inspectors have taken an interest in this man and have given him valuable instruction which he has taken advantage of and they speak quite favorably regarding his work. He is a good influence on the Reserve.\n\n- A women's circle -\nA women's circle has been formed and meetings are held weekly in the upstairs room at the school, which are supervised by the Farming Instructor's and Teacher's wives. This brings the women together. They engage at sewing and knitting. This is having a good effect on the social life of the Reserve and tends to increase the interest taken in the manner in which they keep their homes.\n\nW. Morrison\nInspector\nOttawa, December 1, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 309-ll of the 14th ultimo, submitting a report on your inspection of the residential and day schools in the Onion Lake Agency. In this connection it is noted that general conditions at each of the schools referred to in your report are fairly satisfactory and that favourable results are being obtained in the classroom work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nW. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nIndian Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, December 28, 1932.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your Vouchers 233 and 234, covering the cost of beef supplied to the Frog Lake and Long Lake Indian Day Schools during the months of November and December. It is noted that you do not quote any authority for this expenditure. It is presumed that the beef is being used for midday meal purposes. Please advise if you consider the quantity used is absolutely necessary or would a smaller quantity fill the purpose. Our funds are limited and it is necessary to keep all expenditure as low as possible.\n\nFurther consideration will be given to this matter when your reply is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJ. T. Hill, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nOnion Lake, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge receipt of your 115-5-5, of the 28th ultimo, regarding beef supply to the Frog Lake and Long Lake Indian Day Schools. Vouchers 233 and 234 for $10.00 respectively, were for two months supply for each of the above schools. We could not quote authority but it has been the custom here for years to supply each of our four Indian Day Schools monthly with $5.00 worth of beef for the children's midday meal, during the five winter months. Ordinarily 50 pounds, which was considered just enough, was procured for $5.00, and this amount was purchased at five different intervals for each school, but this year, beef being cheaper, 62\u00bd pounds, or 25% more was obtained for the above amount.\n\nThis has not escaped our notice and it was intended to make four purchases of 62\u00bd pounds each which would give the schools their quota and would effect a saving of $20.00 compared with the total paid last year for this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Gooderham's Report on his visit to the Long Lake Indian Day School. Original on file 754-1.\n\nI visited the Day School on the Kihiwin Reserve a week ago today. As it was Saturday, there were no children in attendance but I had a talk with Mr. Dion, the teacher. He stated there were twenty-eight youngsters attending and that all were doing reasonably well, but that they were poorly clad and undernourished. I am asking Welfare to assist with some clothing, because the Indians on this Reserve are in rather dire circumstances this year. I hope you can continue to give the financial assistance that you formerly have given for a mid-day meal. I noted that the biscuits had already arrived.\n\nThis school is a log building of ancient variety. It must soon be replaced by a better structure, though I don't think it has to be anything fancy to get the required results.\n10th January, 1949.\n\nMr. W.K.

Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor\nof Indian Agencies,\n507 Public Bldg.,\nCalgary, Alta.,\n\nLong Lake Indian Day School\nFrog Lake Indian Day School\n\nI have just had a long discussion with Major Clark concerning the erection of these two schools. As the season will evidently be late by the time the supplementary estimates are brought down in the house, I would appreciate your comment on the following proposals:\n\n1. That funds be transferred from other projects to enable the erection of the new schools required at Frog Lake and Long Lake.\n\n2. That these schools be erected in accordance with plan 888 and that they be advertised jointly so that contractors can bid on both projects. We have found elsewhere that we were able to receive tenders much lower than when we only advertised one project.\n\n3. That the site of the Frog Lake school should be on the property previously viewed by Mr. Clark and Mr. Taylor.\n\n4. That the Long Lake school site be carefully investigated. The present school does not seem to serve more than half the available pupils and there is some difficulty due to the water.\nWould it be possible to have a map made of the Reserve indicating the number of children of school age so that we can select a proper site for the school based on present and future needs.\n\nI am sending a copy of this letter directly to Mr. Taylor so that you will be able to contact him directly concerning the points raised in this letter. If you can have an army message sent to me by August 12th, we can arrange to advertise for tenders.\n\nBernard F.

Although there is a slight difference in the plans, contractors would no doubt prefer to bid on three schools.\n\nHe replied and stated that plan 868 would be suitable at Long Lake and Frog Lake except that at the latter the teacher's residence might not be needed. I concur except that I would recommend that the teacherage be included because the home occupied by the present teacher is not very good and is the property of the Church of England. Mr. Taylor states that three contractors are interested in this work. In a letter which you will receive from me after I have had a complete report from Mr. Ragan, it is expected that the day school on the Blood Reserve will not be needed as all pupils can be enrolled in the residential schools. Funds which might have been set aside for the construction of the said school might be used to construct at least one of the above-mentioned schools. Kindly let me know what are your reactions to this suggestion.\n\nG. H. Gooderham,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies\n\nGHG:IDF\n507 Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta,\nAugust 8, 1949.\n\nCol.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRe: Long Lake Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 613-5(E), & 607-5, of the 5th instant to Mr. Gooderham, I beg to submit for your information a map of the Long Lake Indian Reserve, giving family locations, the present location of the Day School, and my recommendation for the new School sight. It will be noted on the map that a good many of the families have been living on that side of the Reserve near Muriel Lake, but the younger families are now scattering over the Reserve as farming is progressing each year, and I feel if the School is more centralized this will keep the Indians from congesting in one area. The homes towards the West and South sides of the Reserve are new (built within the past four years).\n\nAlso attached is a list of the parents, School Children, their ages, Religion, and the Grades attained. There are a few of these children attending the Blue Quills Indian Residential School.\n\nThere is only one draw back to the proposed sight, and that is water. It is very easy to get a well on this Reserve, but the water is not fit for drinking. At the present school sight there is no immediate supply of water, and I feel the further west on the Reserve we put the School, the better chance we have of getting good water.\n\nIn view of the fact that there are only two main roads across the Reserve, I do not feel that it will be any great difficulty for children to travel a distance of three miles across country. Our better farmers on this Reserve live on the West and South east side of this Reserve.\n\nW. K. Taylor,\nSuperintendent.\n\nCopy: To Regional Supervisor, Calgary, Alta.\nSeptember 8th, 1949.\n\nMr. G.H.

It is expected that he will have sufficient funds remaining in the accountable advance for the well at Goodfish to meet all or most of the costs of the well at Long Lake. There is 8 ft. of water in the well.\n\nFor the benefit of Miss Walton, the well-boring machine was then moved over 200 yards and another hole was sunk to 29 ft. and a good flow of water obtained. It was not possible to bore out the last two feet as the water came in too rapidly. This well will be used for the Assistant Agent's residence and in this way we can have the residence and the day school conveniently located side by side in the centre of the reserve. Unfortunately I cannot say whether there will be sufficient water to operate a pressure system. A copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Taylor with a request that he seek technical advice from the St. Paul Foundry.\n\nG. H.

Gooderham, Esq.,\nRegional Supervisor of Indian Agencies,\n507, Public Building,\nCalgary, Alberta.\n\nRe: Proposed new Day School, Kesheewin Reserve.\n\nReference your letter of even file dated Oct. 1st., regarding water supply, and technical advice in the operation of a pressure system at the new wells on the Long Lake Reserve, I wish to advise as follows:\n\n(1) Well No.1 proposed for the School is 31 feet in depth with approximately 9 feet of water. This well can be dried but will be back to the approximate 9 foot level in three hours. The St. Paul Foundry have advised me that this supply is more than sufficient to operate a pressure system for a Day School and teacher's residence. Their figures for the usage by a family of five, is 40 gals. per day per person and it is not likely that more than 40 gals. will be used in one day by Day School pupils.\n\n(2) Well No.2 proposed for Agency use is 29 feet deep with water rising approximately 8 feet. This well can be put down to within 3 feet of the bottom but it has not been possible to drain it. According to the St. Paul Foundry this well should be suitable for more than domestic use. I have also been advised, by the St. Paul Foundry, that, as long as there is 1 foot of water in the well, a pressure system can be used.\n\nW.K.

In all there are 16 of school age, many of these being quite 8 and 9 years old. The Indians themselves are very anxious that something should be done in the matter and seemingly understand the possibilities of a thorough training for their children which can only be given under the guidance of a competent school teacher. In endorsing their application, I would advise that a school house be built at a cost not exceeding $1000.00, in such a way that if found necessary, an addition could be easily attached to the original building.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, December 28, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant recommending the erection of a schoolhouse on the \"new\" reserve.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to state the name of the reserve, as the Department cannot identify it from this description. To avoid confusion the names by which reserves are known to the Department should be used in all cases.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nReferring to your letter of the 28th December 1912 no. 426362, I have the honor to inform you that the number of the new Reserve mentioned in my letter of the 17th, is 106A.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nExtract from Report of Inspector W.J. Chisholm on the Sturgeon Lake Indian Day School, dated June 10th, 1912. Original on File 117330/6.\n\nReserve 106A.\n\nSTURGEON LAKE.\n\nOn reserve No.106A there are 8 children of school age. Two of these, as indicated above, have been in attendance here, but the Indians who have kept them find themselves unable to keep them permanently; and at any rate such young children should not be sent away from home to live with other Indians, except under very exceptional conditions. I have little doubt that if the residence accommodation in connection with this school could be utilized, the parents of all these 8 children would gladly send them to board at the school during the week, at least from Monday to Friday. This would necessitate some further equipment of the residence and furnishing Mrs. Godfrey a good reliable woman to act as matron or at least as help. The school room would also at once be found too small. However this would probably be the best solution of the problem of education for Reserve 106A, where it is not likely it will ever be found advisable to establish a school.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nSgd.W.J. Chisholm,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, March 6, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your communication of December 17th, last, regarding the establishment of a day school on the reserve No. 106A I beg to say that Mr. Inspector Chisholm in his report recently states that there are only eight children of school age, although you give the number as sixteen.\n\nIt has been suggested by Mr. Chisholm that the children from this reserve might be kept at the Sturgeon Lake School from Monday morning till Friday night, provided further equipment for the residence and dormitories is furnished and a good reliable woman engaged to help Mrs. Godfrey. It appears to the Department that this might be a better arrangement than opening a day school on the reserve and I should be glad to have you go fully into the whole matter and report, submitting an estimate of the probable cost of carrying out this plan.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos. Borthwick, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMistawasis, Sask.\nSir\u2014\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., No.426362, re proposed day school on the Reserve No.106A.\n\nI think that Mr. Inspector Chisholm's plan can be carried out to advantage; and a report will be submitted to you, just as soon as I am able to get the required information you desire.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn the undersigned band of Indians residing in New Reserve members of Bands, See La Ronge and Montreal Pass, do hereby cordially request the Indian Department to kindly give us a school for our children.

As soon as the information asked for is obtained the school may be opened.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLellan\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J.

In reference to this I may say that it is difficult to know whether it is advisable in any way to encourage the settlement of this reserve by the owners, who are the members of the Montreal Lake and Lac la Ronge bands. Those who are there. Those who are there are making no use of the reserve, so far as its soil or resources are concerned, except the curing of a small quantity of the native hay for sale to the lumber companies. For the most part they are addicted to the use of liquor, and avail themselves of their favourable situation on the main road to the lumber camps and to several northern trading posts to procure liquor without having to obtain it from the regular dealers.\n\nAs regards a school, I have occasionally spoken on the subject with Ven. Archdeacon McKay, and he entirely agrees with me that it would not be wise to encourage the settlement of this reserve by the opening of a school.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 28, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instant reporting on the application of the members of the Lac la Ronge and Montreal Lake Bands for the establishment of a school on their new reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of your report, the Department is not prepared to comply with their request. As the Department does not know where to address these Indians you might inform them accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J.

I should say that it is not under consideration at the present time. I could point out, however, for your Lordship's information that the Montreal Lake band have only a small interest in this Reserve; the Lac la Ronge band have the larger interest.

It is just north of Sturgeon Lake Reserve, but quite too far for the Sturgeon Lake Reserve school. There are said to be about 20 children of school age. I should like to know what I can do to further this object. The Indians ask for a school. If the I.D. will not build a school, will they make a grant for a teacher, if I can arrange to hold school in a house. That fine young Cree, Wm. Bear, there.\n\nOf course, if the I.D. is taking steps for a boarding school at Montreal Lake (as I think was suggested) that might obviate the need of a day school at the New Reserve, and yet I don't know that there is not room for both.\n\nI remain\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ.A. Saskatchewan,\nBishop.\nDr. Westgate,\nThe Bible House, Alexander Av.\nWinnipeg Man.\n\nDear Dr. Westgate,\n\nYou no doubt will remember our little talk about our little Reserve here. How I have tried to get the Indian Department to do something for the Indian children here, and have failed. I came here in 1912 and it was 1920 before any child from here got any school and they had to go to Brandon. As I understand from you it will be 1924 and perhaps later than that before we can freely send our children to School; a loss of two or more years more. Now do you think it would be best for the Church and Indian Department to give us a small Day School and Field Matron combined, so that our children and homes may benefit by the arrangement? We need it. We need it after all this twenty or more years of passing us by.\n\nI do hope you are well after your trip and that you found all well at home.\n\nYours\n\nRespectfully\n(Signed) William A Bear\nBox 572\nPrince Albert\nToronto, Ontario, Nov. 2nd, 1922,\n41-43 The Bible House,\nAlexander Ave., Winnipeg, Man.\n\nDuncan G.

Mr. Weir reports that in another year or so there will be four more children of school age and that he expects two families, with seven children of school age, to move from Montreal Lake to the New Reserve. Next year the question of providing school facilities will be given serious consideration.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRt. Rev. G. B. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, SASK.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nSome time ago I brought to your notice the request of the Indians on the New Reserve that they might have a Day School on the Reserve the same as the White people outside. You will remember that these are Indians who have left the Montreal Lake Reserve, and come to live on the New Reserve because they want to take to farming. They are an intelligent lot and their desire is to gradually become like the White people surrounding the Reserve.\n\nI have again received representations from them conveyed through Willie Bear, the best educated man on the Reserve, urging that they be given a Day School for their children the same as the White people have.\n\nThey claim there are nine children from the Reserve in the Boarding Schools, and they would rather have them in their own Day School. Five of these are at Lac La Ronge and would gladly be released because they are overcrowded. There are eight more of school age and three nearly ready for school.\n\nJust off the Reserve there are twelve children (white) in unorganized territory, not likely to have any school, and the suggestion is that the Indian Department and the Province of Saskatchewan should be asked to pay a proportionate part for the teacher's stipend.\n\nThe Indians are ready to build the School, if the Department will build the house for the Teacher. The Indians have promised that their children shall attend the Day School all the year round, and they say that several more Indians from Montreal Lake, beginning with Hunt and four children will be moving down in the near future.\n\nIt looks to me as though there is full justification for this Day School on the New Reserve, apart altogether from the consideration of the White children just outside, and I very gladly send forward this request for your favourable consideration.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6289, file 614-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, August 27, 1925.\n\nDear Bishop Lloyd:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, with reference to the establishment of a day school on the Little Red River (New) Reserve. In reply I wish to inform Your Lordship that next year, if there are a sufficient number of Indian children to warrant the expenditure, consideration will be given to a building programme. I believe it would be advisable to conduct an Indian school rather than to combine with the public school district.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. H. Lloyd, D.D.,\nBishop of Saskatchewan,\nPrince Albert, Sask.\nDecember 19, 1925\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFollowing a conference between the members of the Indian and Eskimo Commission, M. S. C. C., and the Saskatchewan Diocesan Authorities, it was urged that four day schools be established in the Diocese, as follows:\n\nMoosomin (north of Battleford) - File 105-4-1.\n\nLittle Red River (New) Reserve (north of Prince Albert) - File 107-4-1.\n\nMinistikwan (north of Onion Lake) - File 115-7-1.\n\nBig Head (north of Onion Lake) - File 115-2-1.\n\n(The Church authorities speak of these points as Moosomin, New Reserve, Island Lake and Big Island Lake).\n\nThe Roman Catholic Church authorities have protested against the establishment of day schools on the Moosomin, Ministikwan and Big Head reserves.\nThe Bishop of Saskatchewan,\nBishop's House,\nPrince Albert,\n\nMy dear Lord Bishop,\n\nAs you know, the Indians on the Little Red River (New) Reserve have been asking for a day school for a number of years. I believe the time has now arrived when the school could be carried on with a reasonable attendance. There are 11 Treaty Indian children, belonging to four families, already of school age, living on the Reserve, at the present time; also one half-breed child and two white families, making in all 7 non-Treaty children of school age. There are also several younger children who will reach school age in the next few years. These children are feeling quite discouraged at not having a school, as the children are growing up without education, and a school has been promised for a number of years. Another factor in the situation is the creation of the National Park which takes away so much of the hunting and fishing.\ngrounds of the Montreal Lake Indians. These people cannot now make a living in the neighborhood of their old Reserve where the Church & School are situated. They are faced with the choice of settling on the New Reserve or farming, or going further afield for employment. If they come to the New Reserve, there is no chance of getting their children educated. But, the Residential schools at Lac la Rose, or Oka, have an effect already with children living nearer to these Reserves. If these people are to be encouraged to settle down and engage in farming, they ought to have the opportunity of having their children educated. A day school on the New Reserve would give them the opportunity that they desire so much.\n\nI consider that a Day School with a good teacher, perhaps a married man whose wife could look after the sick, dispense medicines, would be of untold benefit to these people, contributing greatly to their moral and physical welfare.\n\nHoping that your own efforts, those of the Indian Department will result in the building of a school as soon as possible,\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully,\n\nH. L. Paul (signature)\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6289, file 614-1, part 1)\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nI am enclosing to you a letter from the Ven Archdeacon Paul, who has taken Archdeacon McKay's place in the Indian work of this Diocese.\n\nThis matter of Montreal Lake and the New Reserve has been up a number of times and it seems to me that the time is ripe to begin in earnest in the New Reserve.\n\nThe establishment of the National Park north of Prince Albert and stretching all round Montreal Lake Reserve is rapidly making the position of the Indians there untenable.\n\nThey are already beginning to discuss their next move and it seems to me that every inducement should be held out to them to select the \"farming\" alternative rather than going up to the North end of Montreal Lake to continue \"hunting\".\n\nIf a good school, just as they have been promised a good many times, according to their view of the matter, were planted at the New Reserve at once it would be a great inducement to draw them from the North of Montreal Lake suggestion down to the New Reserve to start farming and gradually drop the hunting.\n\nThe two White families mentioned are hedged in between the Reserve and the border of the National Park and will never have a school of their own.\n\nI sincerely hope that a good Day school will be given to the New Reserve in good time before the people at Montreal Lake begin moving to the North end.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am hopeful that funds will soon be available for the purpose of erecting a school and teacher's residence on this reserve, which is officially known as Little Red River.

I have to inform you that His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan is now urging the Department to provide school facilities. I am hopeful that funds for the erection of a classroom and a teacher's residence will be available this year but, before I correspond with Mr. Commissioner Graham concerning building activity, I wish to have a full report on the number of Indian and other children who could attend a school if centrally located.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-4-1 of the 19th, also advising me that a teacher's residence and classroom may be erected this year on the New Reserve No. 106A.\n\nIf a school should be built the following would have children of age able to attend:\n\n| Boys | Girls |\n|------|-------|\n| William Bear | 1     |\n| Elias Hunt   | 1     |\n| J.

Shaw who is at present teaching at Sturgeon Lake Day School has made application for the New Reserve School, as Mrs. Shaw the Field Matron has not been in the best of health for some considerable time, and Mr. Shaw considers if he could obtain the appointment it would be easier for Mrs. Shaw, I would therefore recommend that his application be given every consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Weir\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 13, 1928.\n\nRt.

Shaw for the position of teacher at the Little Red River Indian Day School. His appointment, at a salary of $800 for the 10 teaching months, is approved - duties to commence as soon after January first as the school can be made ready. There is no position established for a field matron at this reserve, and it is necessary to appoint Mrs. Shaw assistant teacher; but it is understood that she will do the field matron's duties. The salary in her case will be at the rate of $250 for the 10 teaching months. In your telegram of today's date, you suggest that the field matron at Sturgeon Lake be given more than at Little Red River. The larger salary was allowed Mrs. Shaw, because she has been in our employ for some time and was in receipt of still more at Sturgeon Lake.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Weir and Mr. Commissioner Graham are being informed of the appointment.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

SHAW\n\nNot qualified under Provincial regulations.\n\nHealth: apparently good.\n\nSuccess: Fairly satisfactory.\n\nI was sorry to again find Mr. Shaw untidy in person. I suppose there is some excuse in the fact that he has but one arm.\n\nI believe that he is interested in his work and sincere but he does not fall into the ways of public school teachers as readily as the teachers of the other Indian schools I visit. In spite of the peculiar organization of exercises and considerable disorder, the learning process appears to be fairly fertile.\nLITTLE RED RIVER INDIAN DAY SCHOOL (Anglican)\n\nI visited this school on the afternoon of October 24th, and found 4 Indian boys and 9 girls in attendance, out of an enrolment of 17. There are also 9 white children from the settlement surrounding the reserve enrolled. The children looked healthy and well nourished. The average attendance for the month was a little over 10.\n\nMr. Henry M. Shaw has been teaching at Indian day schools for many years and I consider that he is doing satisfactory work at this school. Both he and his wife are looked up to by, and have a good influence with the Indians on the reserve.\n\nSince my last visit a fence consisting of page wire on tamarac posts with a toprail has been erected around the school premises. A small addition has been made to the cottage, which is greatly appreciated, and a frame stable has been erected. The stable has not been painted.\n\nThe school is situated on an 80 acre plot of land and some of the Indians told me that it was the intention of the Band to leave this block of land for the use of the school. A small pasture of say about 40 acres is required for the teacher's horses and cow during the summer months. As Mrs. Shaw acts as Field Matron, it is necessary that she visit the Indian homes and they require horses for this purpose.\n\nThere has been considerable work done towards improving the premises since my last visit and I am sure that Mr. Shaw will continue to improve the appearance of the premises. Everything seems to be running very smoothly at this school.\nInspector Murison's Report on Carlton Day Schools.\n\nLITTLE RED RIVER DAY SCHOOL.\n\nThis school was closed at the time of my visit. There are eight boys and ten girls enrolled, and the average attendance is 12.35. Mr. H. W. Shaw is the teacher, and he has had many years' service in the Indian school work. The school and teacher's dwelling are new. I found them clean and tidy, and in a good state of repair. The stable requires painting. The grounds are surrounded by a neat fence, and the teacher has a very excellent garden. The vegetables from this will be used to help out the midday lunch for the children. All the children of school age on this reserve are in attendance here.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shaw, at one time teacher at Sturgeon Lake, is now in charge here.\n\nThe register, which is a Provincial school register, showed 17 on the roll, and I found 16 present. Six white children also attend this school. An Indian Department register should be supplied.\n\nThe children are backward and do not speak out well. They were clean and fairly well clothed, but, almost without exception, their hair was ill kept and untidy.\n\nThe school and residence are new buildings, and are protected by a well built fence.\n\nA large garden had been harvested. A noon-day meal is provided by Mrs. Shaw, and the vegetables grown are used for this purpose.\n\nMr. H. W.

She is a daughter of Mr. Shaw and previous to her marriage was teaching in the vicinity of Shellbrook.

I shall be pleased if you will inform the Department if Mrs. Risdorf's husband is living, if she has any family, and, if so, whether her marital duties would interfere with her work at the school, also where her husband and family would reside.

Mr. Shaw is getting up in years, though, no doubt, he has done very good work in his younger years. It appears to me that, for the welfare of the children, he has passed his usefulness.\"\n\nMr. H. W. Shaw has been in charge of this school for the past five years.\n\nFrom the report of the Agent, the Department considers that it would be in the best interests of this school to change the teacher. I would appreciate receiving a recommendation from you in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nWm. Murison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-4-1 dated the 16th instant with reference to Mr. Agent Davis' report on the Little Red River Indian Day School. I may inform the Department that I have been inspecting Mr. Shaw's Day School fairly regularly during the past fourteen years, and before recommending that he be replaced, I would like to make another visit to his school.\n\nMr. Shaw is a man who is getting up in years. He has only one arm but I have found that he has been getting as good results as the average Indian Day School teacher. Apart from this he is a man of good, sound, common sense and I consider him a very beneficial influence on this outlying reserve. He is a man whom the Agent can depend upon for reliable information regarding conditions on the reserve, and in the past very little trouble has been experienced amongst Indians who have come under the influence of Mr. Shaw. Agent Davis has very recently taken over the management of the Carlton Agency and as yet is not thoroughly familiar with the men over whom he has supervision.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector,\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nThere are 17 children of school age, 10 of whom attended during the months of January and February. Mr. Henry M. Shaw has been teaching in Indian schools in Canada for, I am informed, over 22 years and before coming to Canada he taught in the United States for 16 years. He therefore has been in the work nearly 40 years. He is now becoming well advanced in years, has only one arm; and, as there is no provision made for the superannuation of Indian school teachers, I really do not know how the man could make a living if he were released from this school. Mr. Shaw's wife died 2 years ago and his daughter is keeping house for him. I have thought that, if there is an opening in any of our Anglican Residential Schools for a boys' supervisor, Mr. Shaw would be a dependable man for that position. I may say that in addition to his school duties, he conducts services in the Church on Sundays and I am informed the attendance is quite large at these services. He exerts a good influence on the Reserve and has the respect of the Indians.\n\nReport on inspection by W. Morrison,\nLittle Red River Agency on\nFeb. 17/36\n\nIndian Affairs.

W. Shaw, was born in 1869, he is now over sixty-five years of age, and P.C. 1/1561 of July 31st, 1933, with amendments of August and November of the same year, provided that all employees reaching sixty-five years of age should be retired.\n\nUnder these circumstances, the matter is being referred to the Honourable the Superintendent General.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. Morrison, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nInspector's Office,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 14, 1935.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,-\n\nMr. H. W. Shaw, teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School (Little Red River Reserve, No. 106 A, Carlton Agency - Federal District of Prince Albert), is 65 years of age.\n\nP.C. 1/1661 of July 31st, 1933, with amendments of August and November of the same year, provided that all employees reaching 65 years of age should be retired.\n\nMr. Inspector Hurison states that, while Mr. Shaw's work in the classroom has been only fair, he has had a very beneficial influence among the Indians on the reserve and is a man upon whom the Agent can depend for reliable information regarding any reserve matters. However, in view of his age, I would submit for your consideration the question of dispensing with his services at the end of the present academic year, viz.: June 30th, next.\n\nI may add that this school is conducted under the auspices of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, who nominated Mr. Shaw for the position when the school was opened, as from the beginning of February, 1929. Mr. Shaw has had 28 years' experience as teacher in Indian schools. Should he be retired, he would be entitled to a gratuity equal to two months' salary.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, May 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer to letter to you, dated March 13th, last, regarding retaining the services of Mr. H. W. Shaw as teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School for the next academic year. Mr. Shaw has passed the age limit for which employees are retained in the government service, unless an Order in Council is obtained to continue their services. Mr. Shaw has given long and faithful service and the Department does not wish to deal unfairly with him. However, it will be most difficult to obtain the necessary Order in Council to retain his services, and, if obtained, it would be for only one year.\n\nI would request that you place the matter before the Church Authorities of the Diocese of Saskatchewan, who nominated Mr. Shaw for the position as teacher at the Little Red River School. I regret there is no provision for superannuation of teachers of Indian schools. The only amount we could provide would be a gratuity equal to two months' salary, upon his retirement. It is possible that the Church authorities can make arrangements to place Mr. Shaw in some position in one of the Anglican residential schools.\n\nYou should also take the matter up with Mr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask., who could discuss the situation with Mr. Shaw. After the matter has been discussed with him, it is possible that Mr. Shaw might wish to forward his resignation at the end of the present school year. Unless there are very definite reasons for retaining him for another year, the Department would be unable to secure the necessary authority, under Order in Council, to retain his services. After you have received the information, you should forward your recommendation to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

W. Shaw, teacher at the Little Red River Day School.\n\nThe only real reason for the continuance of Mr. Shaw's services is that no provision is made for his support after his retirement. This shows once more the urgent necessity for some arrangement being made with the Provincial Government to carry these teachers on their superannuation scheme.\n\nThere is no doubt that the best interests of the school will be served by a change of teacher, and, should the Department decide to do this, I shall be pleased to nominate his successor.\n\nIn the meantime, I again urge the necessity of some provision for old age, and suggest that, as no agreement has yet been entered into regarding superannuation allowance, it would be only fair that a better provision than two months' pay should be made for Mr. Shaw. Had he been on the permanent Civil Service list he would be entitled to a considerable pension.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSgd. Walter Saskatchewan\n\nInspector W. Murison,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Saskatchewan.\nSir:\n\nReferring to Departmental letter No. 107-4-1, dated the 8th instant, in which I was advised that the services of Mr. H. W. Shaw as teacher at the Little Red River Indian Day School would be discontinued at the end of the present school year, owing to his having passed the age limit, I may advise you that I am in receipt of a letter from his Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan in which he states that the only real reason for the continuance of Mr. Shaw's services is that no provision is made for his support after his retirement. His Lordship again urges the necessity of some provision for old age and suggests that, as no agreement has yet been entered into regarding superannuation allowance, it would be only fair that a better provision than two months' pay should be made for Mr. Shaw.

W. Shaw who is employed as a Teacher of the Indian Day School on the Little Red River Reserve, in the Carlton Agency, Province of Saskatchewan, attained the age of sixty-six on the 20th ultimo. Mr. Shaw is in receipt of a salary of $80.00 a month for the ten months of the academic year, and has been employed since November 11, 1918, in the above mentioned position. His services are satisfactory, and the Department of Indian Affairs wishes to retain him for at least another year, to June 30, 1936. The position is exempt from the operation of the Civil Service Act.\n\nThe undersigned begs to request, therefore, that Mr. Shaw be exempted from the provisions of Order in Council of July 31, 1933, P.C. 1/1561, as amended, to June 30, 1936.\n\n(Sgd.) T. J. Murphy\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nDr. H. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nOur Agent, Mr. Davis has shown me a letter from Inspector Murison asking that I should tender my resignation as teacher at the end of the present school year on account of my having passed the age limit for superannuation.\n\nAs there seems to be no provision for me to be allowed any superannuation or pension I would ask if it would be possible for me to be allowed to continue for another year in the service before retirement. As you know I have been in the school service for over twenty one years and during that time have drawn a salary ranging from $500 to $800 there has been no chance to make much provision for the future and a year would give me time to make arrangements in that regard.\n\nDuring the twenty one years that I have been in the work it has not been necessary for me to take a day's sick leave and I am still in the best of health. I feel confident that I will be able to give satisfactory service for an additional year. Will you please give this request consideration and if possible grant it or make other arrangements that will not leave me stranded on short notice.\n\nI am yours Very Respt.\n\nLittle Red River Day School\nMay 23rd. 1935.\n\nHenry W.

Shaw as teacher at the Little Red River Indian Day School at the end of the present school year, I am today in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Davis with which he enclosed a letter addressed to Doctor McGill by Mr. Shaw, which I enclose. This letter was attached to the Agent's letter and not enclosed in a separate envelope.\n\nIt will be noted that Mr. Shaw is pleading to be allowed to continue for another year in the Service before retirement. This man has given long and faithful service. I know that he is not in good circumstances and no doubt it would be very difficult for him to take up any kind of work outside at short notice.\n\nIn view of the foregoing, if possible, I would be very glad if Mr. Shaw's request that he be retained for one more year be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 10, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your two letters, No. 203-11, dated the 22nd ultimo and the 5th instant, with reference to the retirement of Mr. H. W. Shaw as teacher at the Little Red River Indian Day School at the end of the present school year and enclosing a communication from Mr. Shaw, in which he requests that he be allowed to continue in the position.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that a request has been made to the Treasury Board for authority to retain Mr. Shaw as teacher of the above named school for at least another year - until June 30, 1936. When the directions of the Treasury Board in the matter are received, you will be advised. I may add, however, it is considered likely that the Treasury Board will approve of retaining Mr. Shaw for another year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW.

Shaw, teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School, who has reached the age limit for retirement, I have to say that, as you are aware, an Order-in-Council was obtained last year, extending his services for a period of one year, to June 30th, next. It will be necessary for him to retire at that date. The Department is requesting Mr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, Leask, Sask., to inform Mr. Shaw accordingly.\n\nThe nomination of teachers for this school is in the hands of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan, and he is being requested to nominate a fully qualified teacher, preferably male, to begin duties on or about September first, next, the beginning of the next school year.\n\nUnder present regulations, the only provision that can be made for Mr. Shaw, upon retirement, is a gratuity equal to two months' salary, which will be paid him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Shaw, teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School, will have reached the age of 67 years on the 20th of May, next. It is therefore necessary, under present regulations, that he retire at the end of the present school year. I would request that you inform Mr. Shaw that his services will not be required after June 30th, next. Please express to Mr. Shaw the Department's appreciation of his faithful services during the period he was teacher in Indian schools.\n\nPresent regulations permit only a retiring gratuity equal to two months' salary. This will be paid Mr. Shaw upon his retirement.\n\nThe Department is informing Right Reverend Walter Burd, D.D., Bishop of Saskatchewan, accordingly, and he is being requested to nominate the services of a fully qualified teacher, preferably male, to begin duties on or about September first, next, the beginning of the new school year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Shaw, teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School, will have reached the age of 67 years on May 20th, next. It is therefore necessary, under present regulations, that he retire at the end of the current school year. As you are, no doubt, aware, an Order-in-Council was obtained, authorizing his remaining as teacher during the present school year. The Department appreciates Mr. Shaw's faithful services during the period he taught in Indian schools. It is regretted that present regulations only permit a retiring allowance to him, equal to two months' salary.\n\nIt will be necessary to secure the services of a fully qualified teacher to succeed Mr. Shaw, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the coming summer holidays, on or about September first, next. I would request, therefore, that Your Lordship will nominate, in due time, the services of a teacher, preferably male, for the work at Little Red River. The salary allowed will be at the rate of $50 per teaching month - the same as paid Mr. Shaw. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by Your Lordship should be forwarded for approval by the Department.\n\nThe local Indian Agent will be requested to inform Mr. Shaw, in due time, that his services cannot be retained after the end of the present school year, June 30th, next. He will be informed, also, that the nomination of a successor has been placed in your hands.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\nYours truly,\n\nRight Rev.

While Mr. Lumb has only a second class certificate, yet he has special qualifications which make him a desirable person for this post.

Has he been residing there for some time or is he only spending a short holiday? If Mr. Lumb returned to England a year or more ago, the Department considers that it would be advisable to again bring him to Canada simply to teach in an Indian school. There are so many qualified Canadian teachers out of employment at the present time that it is considered one of these should receive the preference.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

Shaw, teacher of the Indian Day School on the Little Red River Reserve, Carlton Agency, Sask., (Electoral District of Prince Albert), has retired on account of age limit. This is an Anglican school, conducted under the auspices of His Lordship the Bishop of Saskatchewan. The nomination of a teacher has always been in the hands of His Lordship and he nominates the services of Mr. F. C. Dey, Southey, Sask., to succeed Mr. Shaw. Mr. Dey took his normal course at Regina and has been teaching in Saskatchewan schools for four years. The Inspectors of the Inspectorates in which he taught report favourably on his work. He is a married man with no family and is 35 years of age. Mr. Dey also taught one year in the File Hills Indian Residential School.\n\nThe former teacher received salary at the rate of $80 per teaching month. The Bishop of Saskatchewan requests, as Mr. Dey is normal trained, that the salary should be higher than that paid Mr. Shaw, who did not have a Saskatchewan normal training.\n\nI would suggest, for your approval, the appointment of Mr. Dey, with salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month. Funds are available, in the Appropriation for Indian Education, to pay the advance in salary.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nTo H. W. Shaw,\nc/o R. S.

She understands the Indian temperament and is most anxious to do her best. She recently taught in our Residential school at Lac la Ronge. Mrs. Risedorf's address is Tweedsmuir, Saskatchewan.\n\nMay I please ask you to let me know your decision as soon as possible because I would like to have these people move to the Reserve before the spring thaw really sets in.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBp/K\n\nHenry B.

Jones,\nDated at Prince Albert, Sask. September 28th, 1948.\n\nI regret to report Mrs. George Halkett, No. 101 of the William Charles Band, and three of her children suffered burns on the evening of the 22nd. Mrs. Halkett and the children were trapped near their home, they made several unsuccessful attempts to break through and finally returned to their home. Mrs. Halkett reports two of her children became panicky and ran out into the fire blazing two hundred yards away. It was at this time, effecting their rescue, that Mrs. Halkett was seriously burned and the two children slightly less seriously. It seems after this Mrs. Halkett and her children again returned to their home to await their fate.\n\nI regret to report that several Indians belonging to the Little Red River Reserve who were working on that particular front, knew or suspected the Halkett's were trapped, but made no effective effort to help them or report their fate until Mr. Hino Pringnitz, husband of the teacher on the Little Red River Reserve, an employee of the Prince Albert National Park, who, on seeing the smoke, proceeded to the Reserve and arrived at the fire line near the point where the Halketts were trapped. The Indians informed Mr. Pringnitz that they believed Mrs. Halkett and her children were trapped.\n\nMr. Pringnitz together with his thirteen year old son drove his truck through the fire in the direction of the Halkett home. On his first attempt the smoke was so dense, he did not locate the home. On his second attempt he located the house, found the occupants laying on the floor in a semi-conscious condition and effected their rescue. The Indians did not accompany Mr. Pringnitz into the blaze.\n\nDr. McFadyen, our Medical Officer, reports Mrs. Halkett's condition is still serious, the children it is pleasing to report are recovering quite favourably.\n\nOn the 24th it was deemed advisable to vacate the children and aged from the Reserve. Mrs. Pringnitz, our teacher, accompanied the children and remained in charge until the danger had passed. Throughout, Mr. and Mrs. Pringnitz proved themselves to be very competent people.\n\n(Sgd) E.S. Jones,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency\n\nIndian Affairs.

His work permits him to be with his family during weekends only. Mrs. Pringnitz has a family of four children, and on my last visit, I learned Mr. Pringnitz has established a herd of five or six head of cattle on the school property. Fences have become broken down, buildings, and in fact the whole set up presents anything but a pleasing picture. I consider the greater part of the Indian homes and surroundings on the Little Red River Reserve are cleaner and better kept than the school property.\n\nI can readily see it is necessary this family have one cow to supply their children with milk. On my last two visits to this point Mrs. Pringnitz was away. It is my intention to request these people to remove the whole of their livestock from the Reserve with the exception of one cow required to supply milk for the family.\n\nMrs. Pringnitz is a .......\nMrs. Pringnitz is a capable person, but it is quite evident she is attempting the impossible.\n\nE.

We are not permitted to give more than five years of credit for provincial experience but naturally your salary would increase each year at the rate of $120, based on satisfactory Inspector's reports. Have you any preference as to the province in which you wish to teach as we are opening new schools in all the Western Provinces? As ours is a Federal School System, we grant recognition to teaching certificates from any Provincial Department of Education.

I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Mrs.) Thelma Fringnitz.\nCol. B.F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Col. Neary:\n\nI very much regret to inform you that Mrs. T. Pringnitz, teacher at the day school on Little Red River (New) Reserve has tendered her resignation. The only reason she gave for this action is a domestic one as she feels that her family require more of her time. I am sorry that she has resigned because from all I have heard she has done excellent work.\n\nI shall endeavour to secure a successor to her, and already we have advertisements in the Prince Albert and Saskatoon papers. I am also concerned about the condition of the Rev. F.H. Donaghy, teacher at Sturgeon Lake Indian day school. Apparently he has not been well for some time and about a month ago I visited him and it would appear that his nerves are not very healthy and, I believe, in consequence he suffers from digestive disorders. I should not be surprised to receive his resignation one of these days although I hope he will be able to carry on. He is a most exceptional man in many regards and during college was a brilliant scholar, taking many scholarships.\n\nI thought I should report the above two matters to you. In the event of securing a teacher for Little Red River Reserve, I will immediately communicate with you. With kindest regards,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHDM: c\n\nIndian Affairs.

It has always cost me in the neighbourhood of $10.00 a month to feed and keep up repairs for team and outfit.

I do not think we would be able to purchase lumber close to the reserve, however, if authority is granted to build stable cost of material and labour would be kept down to the minimum.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 8, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1405-31-A of the 26th ultimo, with reference to a stable and drive shed for the Little Red River Indian Day School.

It is under the auspices of the Anglican Church and was opened on February 13th. 12 Indian and 9 white children are enrolled. The average attendance of Indian children for the two weeks previous to my visit was 12, being the full number enrolled.\n\nThe Indians expressed satisfaction in being provided with this school and there appears to be evidence that it will be a going concern. I am told that the Indians from the north have expressed their intention of coming down in the near future and if they do, it may be only a short time until this school will be filled to its capacity with Indian children.\n\nThe children looked clean and healthy and were warmly clad. They bring their own lunches. The teacher asked if he might be supplied with biscuits and also Drimilk to enable him to give them a warm drink at mid-day. He stated that he does not want to institute the giving of a mid-day meal.\n\nMr. H. M. Shaw, the teacher, was transferred from Sturgeon Lake, and his wife has been retained at half her former salary as Field Matron and is now paid as assistant teacher. Her work, however, will largely be in the homes on the reserve.\n\nIt was noted that there was no towelling or tooth brushes provided.\n\nThis school\nLITTLE RED RIVER DAY SCHOOL (CONT'D.)\n\nThis school is a new frame building 22x30 with 2 front entrances and cloakrooms. It is lighted with four large windows at the north side and heated with a stove. The interior walls are lathed, plastered and wainscotted. It is furnished with 30 single desks and is a very neat and comfortable school building.\n\nThe teacher's residence is a small cottage divided into a kitchen, dining room and two bedrooms. There are no porches. A summer kitchen should be added as the cottage will be very hot during the warm weather. A stable has been authorized and the Agent was making arrangements for building it at the time of my visit. Good water has been obtained at a depth of 34 ft. Material for a fence to enclose the school buildings is required, and also wire and posts to provide a pasture for the teacher's driving horses and cow.\n\nW. Murray,\nInspector of Indian Affairs.\nRegina, Sask., April 15, 1929.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI beg to submit herewith Inspector Murison's report on the various schools in the Carlton Agency.\n\nConditions at the Little Red River Day School appear to be satisfactory. I note that the teacher's residence is a small cottage divided into a kitchen, dining-room and two bedrooms, and that there are no porches. There is nothing in the Estimates to provide for a summer kitchen, and I should have thought it necessary. I think we should allow $75.00 for a fence to enclose the school and make a small pasture for the teacher's driving horses.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\nOttawa, April 23rd, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nRelative to Mr. Inspector Murison's report on his inspection of the Little Red River Indian Day School, forwarded under cover of your No. 303-11 of the 15th instant, I beg to say that you may arrange to have a small summer kitchen built to the teacher's residence, also porches erected at the entrances. The cost of the work should be kept as low as possible.\n\nYou may also expend approximately $75 in having a fence erected to enclose the school and to make a small pasture for the teacher's driving horses and cow.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

They appear to be substantially built. It is to be regretted that the school does not conform to our regulations in Saskatchewan as to orientation of light. The only light in the classroom comes from the north. It is sufficient except on a dark day such as the day of my visit, when the south side of the room was quite insufficiently lighted. It would have been quite as easy to get light from the west. The same floor space might have been had in a longer and narrower room, which would have been much better lighted and easier to supervise. It is too bad that a nice new school should be built this way.\n\nI would like to see a flag pole with a flag flying each school day.\nOttawa, July 13, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection of the Little Red River Indian Day School, recommends that a flag pole be erected and a flag supplied. You may arrange to have an inexpensive pole erected. You should also purchase and supply the quantity of guy wire, pulleys and rope required. When the work is complete, please forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, and also, when considered timely by you, a requisition for the flag. One will then be sent from the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Some repairs are needed, which I discussed\nwith the Agent who was present on the day of my visit.\nThe floor and walls are not very clean. Some interest\nis shown in interior decoration by the teacher.\n\nNothing has apparently been done to improve\nthe play space or to provide play equipment.\n\nA urinal should be provided in the boys'\ncloset to keep the seat dry. The fire guard is a good\nimprovement.\nOttawa, January 16, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Public School Inspector, in a report on his inspection, in December, last, of the Little Red River Indian Day School, states that nothing has been done to improve the play space for the pupils or to provide play equipment. When weather conditions permit next spring, you may arrange to have sufficient ground around the school cleared and levelled for playgrounds for the children. It is not intended, however, that any large expense be incurred for this purpose. The Department would also supply some playground equipment, such as a football, indoor baseballs and bats, upon receipt of a requisition early next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nOttawa, January 21, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, enclosing a requisition from the teacher of the Little Red River Indian Day School for classroom supplies, and requesting that repairs be made to the school well.\n\nIn reply I have to say that an order is being forwarded to the Government Stationery Office to send to the teacher's address the classroom supplies considered necessary.\n\nRelative to the repairs and cleaning of the school well, I have to say that you may arrange to have this well cleaned out and placed in a good state of repair as soon as weather conditions permit. It is noted that the cost will be approximately $25. You should see that a satisfactory job is performed, and after the work has been completed you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nJohn Weir, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLeask, Sask.\nLeask, Sask.\nJanuary 21st, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 107-4-5 of the 16th inst., and in reply when weather conditions permit next spring, I will arrange to have sufficient ground around the Little Red River School cleared and levelled for playgrounds for the children.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nLeask, Sask.\nFebruary 25th, 1931.\n\nSir,\n\nOn January 21st, 1931 letter No. 107-4-5 you granted authority to have the Little Red River Day School well repaired at an approximate cost of $25.00. I find that the cost of repairing well will be more than I had anticipated. I have already spend about $10.00 on the well and have got into blue clay. I am afraid on account of the nature of the ground we will have to go a considerable depth before striking water. Local prices for a well boring outfit are as follows:\n\n$1.25 per foot for first twenty feet and an increase of twenty-five cents per foot for each ten feet.\n\nHowever, I am sure I could get work done cheaper by engaging men at twenty-five cents per hour at this period of year. As it is essential to have water at school will it be in order for me to proceed with work keeping expenditure as low as possible?\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJohn Weir\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 5, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, regarding the cost of carrying out repairs, etc., to the well at the Little Red River Indian Day School. It is noted that difficulty has been met in deepening the well and that the cost will be more than anticipated by you.\n\nAs it is essential to have water at this school, it will be in order for you to proceed with the work of deepening the well sufficient to obtain a good supply of water, but you should keep all expenditure for the purpose as low as possible. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements possible to have the work done at the lowest cost. After the work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

The school was not open that day, being Sunday. I met all the people at the Church and later went on to the school where I had lunch and noted condition of the buildings and made enquiry into matters in general in connection with the school. I found the school building, although a comparatively new building, in very poor condition. The interior walls need replastering and both the interior and exterior of the building requires repainting, as well as some repairs to the woodwork.\n\nThe walls in the interior of the teacher's cottage are badly in need of redecorating and the exterior of the building should be repainted. I was not at all satisfied with the condition of the buildings and premises. They were not kept as neatly as they should have been.\nOttawa, March 8, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector Murison, who visited the Little Red River Indian Day School on the 17th ultimo, reports on the condition of the building at that point. He states that he found this building, although comparatively new, in very poor condition. He recommends that the interior walls be replastered, that both the interior and exterior be repainted and that some repairs be made to the woodwork.\n\nRegarding the teacher's cottage, Mr. Murison states that the interior walls are badly in need of redecorating and that the exterior of the building should be repainted. Further, he states he is not satisfied with the condition of the buildings and premises, as they are not being kept as neat as should have been done.\n\nCertain funds will be available during the coming fiscal year for repairs and improvements to day school buildings. I would request that you submit a report, stating in detail the repairs and renovations which you would recommend be carried out at this school during the coming summer. You should give the approximate cost of each item. We would be prepared to favourably consider any decorating required to the interior of the building but, unless the expense is small, it is doubtful if any exterior painting could be authorized. When we have your report as to the work required and the cost involved, consideration will be given as to the amount of repairs and renovations that can be authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

While I agree with his remarks, I feel that he should have taken the matter up with you before now. I only took over last year and ever since I have been after Mr. Shaw to clean up, but some allowance has to be made on his account as he has only one arm, even with this disability he is an example to some of our teachers who have two arms.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nLeask, Sask.,\nApril 17th, 1935.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter No. 107-4-5 of the 8th ultimo, re repairs to Little Red River Indian Day School and Teacher's residence.\n\nI find that it is not necessary to replaster all the walls of the interior of the school, though there is a certain amount of loose plaster should be taken off and repaired. Material for this work had been granted before you received Mr. Munson's report, nothing was allowed for labour and as Mr. Shaw has only one arm it is impossible for him to do the work which will cost approximately $10.00. Material was also granted for interior decorating and Mr. Shaw is paying for the labour personally.\n\nRegarding painting the outside of buildings I admit they are in bad shape as nothing has been done since they were erected. It will take approximately $135.00 to paint the two buildings with two coats of paint, labour will be about $60.00, material $75.00. I may be able to have work done cheaper, but at present it is impossible to have a painter go out and look over the work to be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\nOttawa, April 25, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, regarding the Little Red River Indian Day School, I beg to say that the Department approves an expenditure of approximately $10 for the labour required in repairing the plaster in the school.\n\nOwing to lack of funds, the Department is not prepared to authorize the amount required for the exterior painting of the building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

The teacher is, I understand, able to teach but apparently does nothing to keep the place in a neat and tidy condition and in my opinion is not the type of teacher who will do much to advance the Indians.\n\nThos. Robertson.\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nSaskatchewan.\nLeask, Sask.\nJuly 22nd, 1937.\n\n208-8-31\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe would like to know if it would be possible for us to expend the sum of $135.00 in painting the schoolhouse of the Little Red River Day School, as set out in our Estimates for 1937-38.\n\nThis school was built a number of years ago and, since it only received one painting since it was built, it is depreciating very fast. This work should be done this year and should commence as soon as possible.\n\nWe trust that you will see fit to give us the authority to do this painting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nDr. Thos. Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nLeask, Sask., July 22nd, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe would like to have your authority to do the work as outlined as follows and is covered on page 9 A of our Estimates for 1937-38.\n\nUnforeseen repairs to all day schools, such as glass, putty, stove pipes etc. Material. $50.00\n\nAll the labour as set out above will be done by Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thomas Robertson.\nLeask, Sask.\nJuly 22nd, 1937.\n\n209-1-3\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe would like to have your authority to undertake the work of having the school fences of this Agency repaired, as outlined in our estimates on page 9. This expenditure would cost $70.00.\n\nThe sum of $35.00 should be expended at the Little Red River School to replace the rotted posts and in buying the necessary wire and staples. The labour necessary in this regard would be done by the Indians.\n\nThe Big River Day School needs the same fence repairs as that mentioned above. In this case the Teacher of this School has probably taken up this matter direct with the Dept., as she is in the habit of doing.\n\nWe trust that you will see fit to authorize these expenditures.\n\nYourstruly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos Robertson,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir;\n\nWe would like to have your authority to do the work as outlined as follows and is covered on page 9 A of our Estimates for 1937-38:\n\n| Description                                      | Material | Labour |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----------|--------|\n| Sturgeon Lake School, painting woodwork and desks | 10.00    | 5.00   |\n| Sturgeon Lake School Residence, kalsomine & paint | 15.00    |        |\n| Labour on the Residence will be done by the Teacher |        |        |\n| Mistawasis School, Kalsomine and paint            | 10.00    | 5.00   |\n| Mistawasis School Residence, material for flooring |        |        |\n| posts, hardware etc.                              | 40.00    | 20.00  |\n| Sandy Lake School, paint and labour               | 10.00    | 5.00   |\n| Sandy Lake School Residence, Wallpaper            | 15.00    |        |\n| Paint                                             | 5.00     |        |\n| Little Red River School, paint for residence      | 10.00    |        |\n| Montreal Lake School, Lime and brushes, paint     | 25.00    |        |\n| Unforseen repairs to all Day schools, such as glass, putty, stove pipes etc. | 50.00    |        |\n\n190.00 35.00\n\nAll the labour as set out above will be done by Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDr. Thos.
