LAMBE.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe discovery in 1883 by Mr. R. G. McConnell of this Survey, of Tertiary beds in the Cypress hills, of later age than any that had been found in the North West, was announced in Dr. A. R. C. Selwyn's Summary Report of the operations for that year.* These beds capping the Cypress hills were assigned to the age of the Miocene by Mr. McConnell in his \"Report on the Cypress hills, Wood mountain and adjacent country,\"** published in 1886. After giving a general statement of the physical features of the country, Mr. McConnell in his report, devotes himself (1) to a description of the geology in different sections of the district in turn, and (2) to an account of the deposits of the formations observed of the Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary periods. In the Cypress hills and vicinity the rocks seen were referred to the Miocene, Laramie and Fox-hill-Pierre formations, of which the last three are conformable, but the first lies unconformably on the Laramie, in places overlapping it and resting on the Fox-hill. The Miocene beds \"cap all the more elevated parts of the range of uplands extending in a direction a little north of east, from the west end of the Cypress hills to the east end of Swift-current Creek plateau; a distance of 140 miles. They have an average width of fifteen miles, and cover altogether an area of nearly 1,400 square miles.\"\n\nThe Cypress hills are divided into two unequal parts\u2014of which the eastern one is much the larger\u2014by the \"Gap,\" a valley of erosion, running in a north and south direction. The Miocene deposits are best developed at the eastern end of the hills, where they attain a thickness of fully 500 feet, and consist of conglomerate, usually formed of quartzite pebbles, cemented together by carbonate of lime, associated with beds of sandstone, sands, clays, and marls. West of the \"Gap\" the formation is represented only by a sheet of hard conglomerate, about 50 feet thick.\n\nTo quote from Mr. McConnell's report: \"the conglomerate which forms such a marked feature of the Miocene deposits of the Cypress hills, is usually composed of quartzite pebbles cemented together by carbonate of lime, but also appears under a number of other forms. In some places the pebbles lie loosely in a matrix of coarse yellowish sand, and in others they are\n\n* Geol. and Nat. Hist.

Survey of Canada, Annual Report (new series), vol. 1, 1885, (1886), part C.\nconsolidated by a ferruginous cement. Beds several feet thick also occasionally occur, which contain nothing but loose pebbles.\" \"Beds of pebble conglomerate, though more frequent and larger near the base of the Miocene, are found at irregular intervals all through it, and are of all thicknesses, from a single layer of pebbles up to beds fully 50 feet thick. In many cases the formation consists of a single thick bed of this rock. Besides the pebble conglomerate, beds composed of angular pieces of clays enclosed in a matrix of hard sandstone, and forming a species of breccia, are occasionally found.\"\n\n\"The sands of the Miocene sometimes form hard beds, from one to two feet thick, but are usually only slightly indurated, and are nearly always affected by false bedding.\"\n\nThe above deposits are best seen in Bone coul\u00e9e which runs almost due north and south about nine miles west of the eastern escarpment of the hills. In this coul\u00e9e two streams have their origin within a few hundred yards of each other, the north fork of Swift-current creek flowing north-easterly, and Frenchman creek (Fairwell creek of Mr. McConnell's report) flowing in an opposite direction to the south.\n\nIt is in this main coul\u00e9e and its tributaries, that the collections of vertebrate remains from this horizon of the Cypress hills have been principally made.\n\nThe first vertebrate fossils received from Bone coul\u00e9e were obtained in 1883 by Mr. McConnell whilst engaged in his geological exploration of that year. Later in the same season Mr. T. C. Weston visited this locality, and secured a collection; but unfortunately all the specimens then obtained were lost by the sinking in Lake Superior of the steamer Glenfinlas on which the collection had been shipped for the east from Port Arthur. During the summer of 1884 Mr. Weston revisited the eastern end of the hills, and obtained many mammalian and other vertebrate remains typical of the Cypress Hills fauna. In 1888, and again in 1889, a short time was spent by Mr. Weston in adding to the collections already made in Bone coul\u00e9e. In 1904 the writer spent some weeks in the eastern end of these hills making a supplementary collection of the vertebrate remains.\n\nThe fossils collected by Messrs. McConnell and Weston in 1883, were submitted to Professor Edward D. Cope, who published a preliminary list of the genera and species in the American Naturalist, 1885, vol. XIX, p. 163.* The result of his subsequent study of the same material appeared in 1886 as an appendix to Mr. McConnell's report of 1886.** Further contributions to the American Naturalist *** by the same distinguished paleontologist, followed in 1889, after Mr. Weston's collection of 1888 had also been placed in his hands for determination and description. Professor Cope's final report on all the material from the Cypress hills, including the specimens obtained by Mr. Weston in 1899, appeared in 1891 as part I **** of this volume.\n\n---\n\n* The White River beds of Swift-current river, North West Territory.\n** Op. cit., part C, p. 79, appendix I.

Survey of Canada, Contr. to Can. Palaeont., vol. III (quarto), pt. I.\nCope, in his memoir of 1891, qualifies McConnell's assignment of the uppermost beds of the Cypress hills to the Miocene by describing them as of Oligocene or Lower Miocene age. Matthew would accord them a more definite horizon at the bottom of the Oligocene, and has expressed the opinion that they are probably of approximately the same age as the Titanotherium beds at Pipestone springs, Montana. This opinion appears to be borne out to some extent by the list of species from Pipestone springs, published by Dr. Matthew in 1903,* and the collections from the Cypress hills, supplemented by the material secured* in 1904. A provisional list by the writer, of the genera and species included in the collection of 1904, appeared in the Summary Report of this Department for that year.\n\nThat the Cypress Hills Oligocene deposits were the result of rapidly flowing water from the west is evident. The thick basal beds of rounded pebbles represent the work of a strong transporting force, such as would be supplied by a turbulent stream of considerable size carrying eastward material from the Rocky mountains. The sands show false bedding as a result of varying currents. With the accumulation of material eastward, and a consequent reduction of the transporting force, beds of finer material were deposited at a higher level, and probably on extensive areas of overflow.\n\nRegarding the Cypress hills as an outlier of the Wood Mountain area, Mr. McConnell has pointed out that, the part of the country \"now covered by the Cypress hills has been changed from a depression in Miocene times into the highest plateau on the plains, which is its present position, entirely by the arrest of denudation over its surface by the hard conglomerate beds which cover it, whilst the surrounding country, destitute of such protection, has been gradually lowered; and so affords an index of the amount of material removed from the neighbouring plains in the age intervening between the deposition of the Miocene and the glacial period.\" \"The absence of any ridge connecting the Cypress hills with the mountains is somewhat surprising, as one would naturally suppose that near their source the pebble-beds would be thicker, and their constituents coarser and better able to resist erosion. This may be due, however, to the fact that the valley of the transporting stream must have been more contracted in its upper part than in the dilated portion in which the existing Miocene beds were deposited. In such a case, its narrow shingle floor would be gradually undermined, and as denudation proceeded would soon perish.\"\n\nDuring his expedition of 1904, the writer examined the exposures of the Oligocene deposits along the eastern escarpment of the Cypress hills as well as on their southern slope in the vicinity of Frenchman (Whitemud) river as far west as Fairwell creek, also in the valley of this creek northward to Bone coul\u00e9e, and for some miles along the upper reaches of the north fork of Swift-current creek. Few fossils were obtained along the eastern, and southern escarpments.\n\nThe greater part of the collection was made in Bone coul\u00e9e and its numerous tributary coul\u00e9es, and in its southern extension for a few miles along Fairwell creek. Here the grass-covered slopes are broken by numerous small and isolated weathered outcrops which at first do not appear very promising from a palaeontological standpoint. A careful and close search, however, reveals an abundance of\u2014for the most part\u2014mammalian remains.\n\n* The fauna of the Titanotherium beds at Pipestone springs, Montana; Bulletin Amer. Mus. Nat. Hist., vol. XIX, article VI, 1903.\nThe most prolific beds are composed of a fine conglomerate that, on disintegration, has freed the enclosed fossils. Associated beds of coarse sand, of a rich brown colour, also yielded some interesting remains. Very few fossils were found in the coarser conglomerates, and, as might be expected, none at all in the beds of loose pebbles.\n\nThe generally fragmentary and dissociated nature of the remains at this locality detracts much from their value as definite horizon markers. Many of the specimens clearly show that they had been broken and often worn prior to being deposited in the beds where they were found. Some excellently preserved jaws with continuous series of teeth were obtained, and many separate and well preserved teeth, but bones of the feet were in all cases dissociated.\n\nAlthough the beds of the Cypress Hills deposits in question probably belong, in a general sense, to the horizon of the Titanotherium beds of Montana, some of their upper members may be synchronous with the Oreodon beds. Whether the time equivalent of the uppermost division of the Oligocene (Protoceras beds) is present at all is problematical. The fossils in the finer conglomeritic beds show in some cases evidence of having been transported from a distance; and on this account it is possible that a certain admixture of remains from slightly different horizons has taken place.\n\nThe Cypress Hills Oligocene faunal list has been considerably enlarged in the following pages by the addition of a number of new species, and species previously known but not recorded, hitherto, from this horizon in Canada. The majority of the additions to the fauna have been supplied by the collection of 1904, but a few forms are represented by specimens from the earlier collections, that apparently were not placed in Professor Cope's hands.\n\nThe species described as new, with those not recorded, hitherto, from this locality, belong to the three classes of fishes, reptiles, and mammals. New species of fishes of the families Amiidae and Lepidosteidae are described. Among the reptiles are two chelonians, of which one species is new; also lizards, snakes, and crocodiles representing the orders Squamata and Crocodilia, both of which are additional to the fauna. The mammals preponderate in numbers and variety and include a marsupial, ungulates, rodents, and carnivores. The artiodactyl genera Anodus, Anthracotherium?, Agriocherus, and Merycoidodon are now recorded from the Cypress hills, as well as new species of horses, hyracodonts, rhinoceroses, and titanotheres. A new species of Leptomeryx is described. Further evidence of the presence of Chalicotherium, an ancylopod, is given. The rodents include four families of which three, the Ischyromyidae, Castoridae, and? Sciuridae, are new to the list. Two known species of the creodont carnivores, three already described species of the Canidae, and one of the Felidae are also added.\n\nThe animals inhabiting this western tract of country during Oligocene times are thus seen to have belonged to a variety of groups. That the number of individuals in some of the groups was large is evident from the abundance of the fossil remains of some forms. Some of the groups have since become extinct, others have undergone great changes and are with difficulty recognized in their descendants of the present day; whilst a few are represented by existing species that show but slight differences in form and structure.\nTwenty-five vertebrate species in all, have, hitherto, constituted the Oligocene fauna of the Cypress hills: this number is now raised to over fifty.

I, p. 2, plate I, figs. 2, 2a and 2b.\n\nCope established this species on a single vertebra from the Cypress hills. No additional material is included in the collection of 1904, to throw further light on the structure of this fish.\n\nAMIA EXILIS, Sp. nov.\n\nPlate I, figs. 1\u20136.\n\nA number of centra, found separately, represent an apparently undescribed species of *Amia*, of small size as compared with *A. whiteavesiana*, Cope, and *A. macrospondyla*, Cope both of which species are from the Oligocene of the Cypress hills.\n\nAll the fossil remains of North American species of *Amia* so far described are of Eocene age, with the exception of the two Oligocene species above mentioned.\n\n*Amia exilis* was about the size of *Amia elegans*, Leidy, from the Bridger Eocene of Wyoming; but had vertebral centra of quite a different shape.\n\nThe centra on which *Amia exilis* is founded are mostly from the dorsal region, and vary somewhat in size, being probably from a number of individuals. The one represented on plate I, figures 1, 2, and 3, from the middle dorsal series, is one of the largest of the specimens, and is about the best preserved (type). Its articular faces are oval in outline with the major axis horizontal, the height being but slightly over two-thirds of the breadth. Its thickness (length), is equal to about half the maximum height and there is a perceptible flattening of the upper surface. The concave articular surfaces exhibit a few concentric lines, but have the general appearance of being rather smooth. A small notochordal foramen, preserved in all the specimens, pierces the centrum at about mid-height. Above, in the median line of the upper surface, the floor of the neural canal appears as a narrow, oblong, transversely concave depression, with a shallowly excavated area, square in outline, on each side of it, marking the position of the base of the neurapophysis. The parapophyses are placed slightly below the middle of the sides; they are circular in section and were\napparently very short. On the lower surface, one on each side of the median line and almost touching, are two poorly defined very shallow oblong depressions\u2014(well defined and comparatively deep in one of the small centra). The sides of the centrum are slightly depressed between the raised margins of the articular faces; here the surface when preserved is seen to be marked by short inosculating ridges directed antero-posteriorly. The structure of the articular faces is dense; that of the remainder, which forms the greater part of the centrum, is finely cancellous.\n\nMeasurements.\n\n| Type specimen, Plate I, figures 1, 2 and 3: |\n|-------------------------------------------|\n| Height of centrum                        | 12\u00b70 |\n| Breadth                                  | 16\u00b78 |\n| Length                                   | 5\u00b78  |\n\n| Smaller specimen: |\n|-------------------|\n| Height of centrum | 9\u00b70 |\n| Breadth           | 11\u00b70 |\n| Length            | 3\u00b78 |\n\nA basi-occipital bone that apparently belongs to this species is shown on plate I, figures 4, 5 and 6. Its posterior termination has the form of a vertebral centrum having a concave surface for articulation with the first vertebra. The bone narrows slightly forward; anteriorly it is incomplete, but apparently only a small portion is missing. Seen from above, (fig. 4), there is a deep excavation in the median line at some distance in advance of the posterior end, representing the hinder basal part of the brain cavity. Above, posteriorly, is seen the floor of the foramen magnum, extending backward from the brain cavity as a narrow smooth surface, on each side of which is an area indicating the probable position of occipital arches such as are found in the living *Amia calva*, Linn. Laterally, and directed upward and outward, occur concave facets for the articulation of the exoccipitals. Inferiorly, (fig. 5), the bone is flatly convex transversely, with a broad median longitudinal groove that does not extend backward to the border of the articulating cup. On each side of the basal surface is preserved the facet for the parasphenoid which evidently in this fossil form terminated posteriorly in two branches as in the living species. A canal enters the basi-occipital at the side (c, fig. 4) and finds an exit from the lower surface beside a similar opening of the corresponding canal of the opposite side of the bone; this pair of foramina have their position in the median line of the bone between the hinder ends of the parasphenoid. The posterior articulating cup, fig. 6, corresponds in general size and contour with the type centrum of *Amia exilis*, its breadth being considerably greater than the height. Slightly above mid-height in the cup is a minute notochordal foramen. As seen from behind, the outline of the cup is rather flat in the centre below, and laterally subangular. The limits of the vertebra forming the posterior end of the basi-occipital, being the third of the three vertebre that are thought to enter into the composition of this bone, are faintly indicated in the specimen.\n\n**LEPIDOSTEUS LONGUS**, sp. nov.\n\nPlate I, figs. 7, 8 and 9.\n\nA species of *Lepidosteus* is represented by an opisthocelous vertebra. A few thick, smoothly enamelled, rhomboid scales, included in the collection, probably belong to the same species as the vertebra.\nThe vertebral centrum is from about the middle of the dorsal series, and is long in proportion to its breadth and height. In end view the articular surfaces are six-sided, the anterior surface is slightly convex; the posterior one as slightly concave. The parapophyses are given off at the mid-height of the centrum a little in advance of the mid-length, fig. 9. Beneath each parapophysis is a deep fossa, long in an antero-posterior direction, occupying the lateral inferior face of the centrum and separated from its fellow by the narrow, flat inferior surface which is broadest at either end, where it is also most deeply impressed by a longitudinal median groove. The surface between the parapophyses and the neurapophyses, n, fig. 7, is deeply excavated. The floor of the neural canal channels the upper surface of the centrum, the depression being greatest at mid-length. There is also a small fossa above, a little behind the parapophyses. The surface of the centrum throughout is quite smooth.\n\nA conspicuous character of the above centrum is its length as compared with its height and breadth; length of centrum, along median line, inferiorly, 10 mm.; height of posterior articular face, 6\u00b78 mm.; breadth of same, 8\u00b73 mm.\n\nThe name *longus* is here made use of for the fossil gar represented by the Cypress Hills specimen.\n\n**RHINEASTES RH\u00c6AS.**\n\nPlate I, figs. 10\u201316.\n\n*Rhineastes rh\u00e6as*, Cope, 1891. The species from the Oligocene or Lower Miocene beds of the Cypress hills. Geol. Survey of Canada, Contr. to Can. Palaeont., vol. III (quarto), pt. I, p. 3, pl. I, figs. 3, 3a and 3b.\n\nA few broken vertebrae are apparently referable to this species. In comparison with the type material, the internal structure of the centrum in the present specimens is seen to be the same, viz., close set vertical laminae parallel to the articular surfaces.\n\nThe vertebrae mentioned in the original description of the species consist of a median abdominal vertebra (the type specimen), and a second centrum that is referred by Cope to this species not without some doubt. There is with this material a third vertebra, not mentioned by Professor Cope, and possibly not seen by him, which is slightly larger, and more perfect than the type. This specimen, with little doubt, belongs to this species, but calls for remark in that it is definitely flattened below, and is without a fossa beneath the base of the diapophysis. In the type the inferior surface is broken away.\n\nIn the 1904 collection are a number of bases of pectoral spines, serrated on both the anterior and posterior borders, probably referable to *Rhineastes rh\u00e6as*. In the genus *Amiurus*, to which the other Siluroid remains in the collection belong, the pectoral spine is serrated on the posterior border only, whilst in *Rhineastes* this spine may be serrated on one or both borders.\n\nAll the pectoral spines are imperfect distally, and show a considerable range in size. One of the most perfect is small, but gives the details of ornamentation well. The sides are covered with low narrow longitudinal ridges which often inosculate. There is no sign of tuberculation here; such as is found in conjunction with longitudinal ridges on the spines of *Arius egertonii* of the middle Eocene of England, and Belgium. On the anterior border there is a median serrated ridge bounded on either side by a well-marked narrow groove.\nThere are nine outwardly directed serrations in a space of 3 mm. A similar ridge likewise occurs on the posterior border with slightly larger serrations, about six of the latter occurring in a space of 3 mm. These posterior serrations show a tendency to point backward, and they are not continued so far toward the base of the spine as are those of the anterior border. The measurements of this specimen are as follows:\u2014length (distal half missing) 13 mm., greatest height at proximal end 6 mm., antero-posterior diameter at broken distal end about 2\u00b78 mm., with a vertical diameter distally of about 1\u00b76 mm. The pectoral spines in the collection are of various sizes, from 4 up to 16 mm., as measured in a vertical direction across the base, with the more anterior part in proportion.\n\nThe serrations in the majority of the specimens have been worn down, and in some cases almost entirely removed, although indications of them can still be seen. In the largest specimen (16 mm. across the base) the number of serrations in a space of 3 mm. is about six on both borders. In all, the ornamentation of the sides is the same.\n\nA few dorsal fin spines, with sculpture similar to that of the pectoral spines, are, probably, also referable to this species. They are broken across at some distance from the base, and the distal end lost. One, of small size and somewhat worn, is serrated on both borders. In a second, a large spine, figs. 14, 15 and 16, the anterior border is rugose, and no satisfactory evidence of serrations can be made out; posteriorly its surface is deeply grooved proximally as in the smaller spine, and the specimen is broken off behind where the serrations would probably begin. The measurements of this large spine are\u2014length of specimen 30 mm., breadth across proximal end 18 mm., antero-posterior diameter at fractured distal end 8 mm. transverse diameter distally 6\u00b75 mm.\n\nA number of fragments from the distal end of spines are, probably, also referable here. They are longitudinally striated, and three are serrated on both borders. Another is serrated at least on the posterior border; whilst one bears on its posterior border comparatively long backwardly curved barb-like denticles (figure 18).\n\nThese spines appear to approach closely, in detail of ornamentation and shape, to those of *R. arcuatus*, described by Cope from the Bridger Eocene of Wyoming. In the Oligocene specimens the serrations of the borders, and the ornamentation generally, are on a smaller scale.\n\n**Amiurus cancellatus**, Cope.\n\n*Amiurus cancellatus*, Cope, 1891.

I, figs. 4, 4a\u2013b, 5, 5a\u2013b.\n\nThis species, founded on two vertebral centra from the Cypress hills, is one of two species of the genus described from this region.\n\nIn the 1904 collection are a few centra, with parts of others, that, judging from their form and structure in comparison with the type specimens, are apparently referable to Cope\u2019s species.\n\nIn the type specimens the dense tissue of the articular surfaces is succeeded within by vertical laminae forming two thin layers which are connected by tissue, disposed for the most part longitudinally, in which are many openings of variable size having their longer axes in\nan antero-posterior direction. This open structure occupies the greater part of the thickness of the centrum.\n\nThe 1904 specimens have this general structure, with a considerable variance as to the number, size, and disposition of the openings in the inner tissue. Superiorly there is a central excavation or fossa, with one more or less developed on either side of the centre. Laterally a fossa is present beneath the base of the diapophyses, and on the lower surface there is a median, single, or double fossa.\n\n**Amiurus maconnelli**, Cope.\n\n*Amiurus maconnelli*, Cope, 1891. The species from the Oligocene or Lower Miocene beds of the Cypress hills. Geol. Survey of Canada, Contr. to Can. Pal\u00e6ont. vol. III (quarto), pt. I, p. 4, pl. I, figs. 6, 6a\u2013b, 7a\u2013b.\n\nThe vertebrae of this species differ from those of the preceding principally in having the inner longitudinally disposed tissue more compact. This tissue, in which there is a conspicuous absence of large openings, is made up of slender longitudinal strands with secondary connecting ones at right angles to the former, leaving small interspaces. As in *A. cancellatus*, there are vertical laminae beneath the dense articular surface layer of tissue, but they occupy a greater thickness and consequently restrict the innermost cancellous tissue to a narrower area.\n\nCope, in describing the two centra on which this species is based, states that they are without a fossa on the inferior face. This is no doubt an error of observation, as in the larger of the two type specimens there is a single deep fossa below, and in the smaller centrum there is also a single median inferior fossa.\n\nA few imperfect centra and large vertebral fragments belonging to the collection of 1904 are probably referable to this species.\n\nThe lower or proximal ends of a few dorsal fin spines, differing from those that have been provisionally assigned to *Rhineastes rh\u00e6as*, are in the collection of 1904.\n\nThese spines may have belonged to one of the two species of *Amiurus* here referred to, or possibly both species may be represented. They differ considerably in size, and were apparently without tubercles, or longitudinal sculpture ridges on their sides. From the specimens it is impossible to state whether serrations were present along the anterior, and posterior edges, or not. The sides of the spines were apparently smooth, but the specimens are either slightly worn or weathered so that, any delicate markings, if they were present, have been obliterated. The largest specimen, figures 14, 15 and 16, has a maximum transverse diameter at the base of 13 mm., the smallest does not exceed 4\u00b75 mm., measured similarly.\n\nThe largest spine is one that has been broken off farthest from the proximal end. It is subtriangular in section above the base, and is excavated longitudinally behind by a deep groove. Above, the ridge bounding the posterior groove on one side persists, on the other side it disappears, so that the spine is not bilaterally symmetrical. The lateral surface of the spine, on the side on which the posterior ridge continues, is convex, the opposite side is slightly concave. In the centre of the angular anterior surface is a longitudinal, shallow, but well-defined, narrow groove. The basal perforation is about 3 mm. wide. Seen sideways the anterior surface curves backward, the posterior outline is almost straight. Measured from back to front, near the distal end of the specimen, the diameter is 12 mm., the transverse measurement at the same height from the base is about 7 mm.\nCompared with a dorsal spine* of *Arius egertoni*, var. *belgicus*, Leriche, from the Eocene of Belgium, the Cypress Hills spine is much more robust above, although the proximal end and the basal perforation are of about the same size in each.\n\n**REPTILIA.**\n\n**CHELONIA.**\n\n*Anosteira ornata?* Leidy.\n\nPlate I, figs. 17, 18 and 19.\n\n*Anosteira ornata*, Leidy, 1871. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., p. 102.\n\nA marginal plate of a turtle from the eastern escarpment of the Cypress hills (collection of 1904) bears so striking a resemblance in general form and ornamentation to those of Leidy's species from the Bridger Eocene of Wyoming, that it is, for the present, referred to that species.\n\nThe plate is triangular in section, the free edge being sharp and smooth, the inner surface excavated (figure 19). It is apparently the eleventh plate from the right side of the shell. The sculpture beneath, fig. 18, consists of distinct, discontinuous, radiating ridges of varying length with a few tubercles at the centre. The upper surface, fig. 17, is somewhat similarly, but more rugosely ornamented, the tubercles here predominating; although toward the margins of the plate they tend to coalesce into short divergent ridges. A furrow across the middle of the upper surface marks where contiguous epidermal shields met. This groove is continued, though very faintly, on the under surface of the plate. Leidy was doubtful as to the presence of shields in this species. In his description** he mentions that the shell \"appears to be devoid of the usual outlines more or less strongly expressed, of the investing scutes.\"\n\nA second marginal plate from the same locality bears a slightly different sculpture. The upper surface is granulose throughout, without the formation of definite ridges, although the tubercles frequently coalesce. The lower surface would be quite smooth but for an indistinct granulation near the free border. The plate is wedge shaped, shallowly concave above, but convex beneath, and grooved on the inner border. A sulcus also in this plate denotes the presence of epidermal shields. The anterior marginals in the type are stated to be smooth beneath, and it is probable that this plate belongs to that part of the shell anterior to the axillary notch.\n\nIn Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, was found another specimen probably belonging to the species represented by the eastern escarpment marginals. It is a lateral marginal, probably the fifth of the right side, and is definitely sculptured in agreement with the type of *A. ornata*. This specimen also bears scute impressions.\n\nMore material is needed to more definitely determine the Cypress Hills species, which, from the evidence now available, and so far as a comparison can be made, apparently very closely resembles the Eocene species described by Leidy. Additional specimens, however, will probably prove the Cypress Hills species to be distinct from *A. ornata*, bringing to light a form representative of the Oligocene deposits.\n\n---\n\n* M\u00e9moires du Mus\u00e9e Royal d'Histoire Naturelle de Belgique, t.

Ottawa Naturalist, vol. XIX, p. 187, pl. 3, figs. 1, 2 and 3.\n\nAmong the chelonian remains of the Cypress Hills Oligocene collection of 1904 are parts of a number of costal plates that were described in 1906, as appertaining to a new species of Testudo, under the above name.\n\nThe specimens were found separately, but were considered to belong, evidently, to the same species. The three figured are the proximal end of the left first costal, the distal half of the left fifth costal, and the proximal end of the left sixth costal.\n\nAll the specimens show decided groove markings. The distal end of the fifth costal plate, (figure 20, the type of the species), is particularly narrow and thick, but its outline indicates that the bone when entire had a considerable breadth proximally. Its upper surface presents a number of parallel shallow furrows in the direction of the length of the carapace. It is thickened along its posterior articular border where it joined the similarly thickened anterior border of the sixth costal, thus forming a stout ridge for the reception of the inguinal buttress.\n\nThe specimen shown in figure 21, is apparently the proximal end of the left sixth costal plate. This costal when complete was evidently much broader toward its outer end. Deep sulci on the upper surface mark the position of the fourth vertebral, also the third, and fourth costal shields. Distinct grooves also cross this plate from side to side near its inner end, where the sutural surfaces for articulation with the sixth and seventh neural plates are preserved.\n\nThe third specimen, figure 22, is the inner end of the left first costal. On its surface are concentric grooves indicating an epidermal shield pattern such as is found in some of the modern species of the genus.\n\nThese specimens show that the costal plates were alternately narrow and broad distally, and broad and narrow proximally: a common character of species of Testudo.\n\nMeasurements.\n\n| Costal Plate | Plate | Figure | Measurement |\n|--------------|-------|--------|-------------|\n| 1st Costal   | I     | 22     | Maximum thickness at centre of proximal end | 7 |\n|              |       |        | Thickness of specimen at anterior suture    | 5 |\n|              |       |        | \" posterior \"                               | 4 |\n| 5th Costal   | I     | 20     | Thickness at proximal end of specimen       | 5 |\n|              |       |        | \" near distal end at anterior suture        | 5 |\n|              |       |        | \" distally near posterior suture            | 8 |\n| 6th Costal   | I     | 21     | Thickness at proximal end                   | 8 |\nThis species is peculiar on account of the extreme narrowness and thickness of the 5th costal plate. The surface of the carapace bore a distinct pattern of grooves which were, anteriorly at least, arranged concentrically within the boundaries of the epidermal shields.\n\n**Trionyx leucopotamicus**, Cope.\n\nThis species was described by Cope in 1891*. The material on which it is based consists of part of a costal bone from Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, (Mr. T. C. Weston\u2019s collection of 1884) and some well preserved fragments from the White buttes, Dakota.\n\nIn the collection of 1904 from Bone coul\u00e9e are a number of fragments of shell, principally broken costals, that are evidently referable to this species.\n\nOther fragments may be assignable to *T. punctiger*, Cope, from the Oligocene (White River) of South Dakota, but the material is too poor to admit of a satisfactory determination.\n\n**Squamata.**\n\n**Peltosaurus granulosus**, Cope.\n\nPlate 1, figs. 23, 24 and 25.\n\n*Peltosaurus granulosus*, Cope, 1878.

A worn portion of a second dentary from which the teeth have been abraded, probably, also belongs to this species.\n\nThe type specimens described by Cope are from the Miocene of north-eastern Colorado; the Canadian specimens were obtained by the writer from the Oligocene beds of Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, in 1904.\n\nIn the dentary shown in figure 23, the teeth are pleurodont, of fair size, chisel-shaped, and apparently in all particulars agreeing with those of the type specimens. There are four of the largest teeth in a space of about 5 mm. The mandibular groove, seen in the inferior surface of the specimen, is of large size, and the dentary canal is well shown, piercing the bone midway between the surface of attachment of the teeth and the exterior surface of the specimen in which occur a few small foramina.\n\nIn the maxilla there are eight teeth preserved, diminishing in size toward the back. Externally the bone curves slightly outward behind, and above posteriorly is seen the surface for the articulation of the jugal. The teeth correspond in size with those of the dentary.\n\nThe Cypress Hills specimens are smaller than the corresponding bones on which the species is based, but there is no evidence to indicate that they belong to a different species.\n\n---\n\n* The species from the Oligocene or Lower Miocene beds of the Cypress hills.

It is quadrangular in shape, flat, longer than broad, and broadest behind, with straight sides, and a convexly curved, sharp-edged posterior margin. It attains a maximum thickness of 0\u00b75 mm. in front and thins gradually to the rear. No overlapping surfaces are seen. Above it is finely tuberculated, the tubercles being distinct from each other, and close set, about three in a space of 1 mm. A well defined median ridge is developed in the direction of its length. This scute differs from those of this species described by Cope, in that it is keeled, and the granulation, apparently, more distinct.\n\nOgmophis compactus, Sp. nov.\n\nPlate I, figs. 26\u201330.\n\nOphidian vertebrae, Lambe, 1905. Geol. Survey of Canada, Summary Report for 1904, p. 366.\n\nFour dorsal vertebrae apparently belonging to the same species were found separately. They are all of different sizes, and, probably, are from different individuals. The maximum breadth is across the zygapophyses, which are broadly expanded laterally; it apparently exceeds the maximum height (unobtainable on account of the abrasion of the neural spine in all the specimens) and greatly exceeds the length measured so as to include the pre- and postzygapophyses. A marked character is the shortness of the centrum. The cup is wider than high with a well defined sharp rim, and is directed very slightly downward. The ball is slightly inclined upward. The zygosphene is broader than the neural canal is wide, and has a plane upper surface, and a straight sharp front margin that slightly overhangs the upper rim of the cup. The neural spine starts as an angular ridge behind the upper surface of the zygosphene. The neural canal is subtriangular in cross section, the angles being rounded with the apical one the most obtuse; its sides are slightly incurved. A low rounded ridge occupies the centre of the floor of the canal longitudinally, corresponding in shape with the hypapophysial keel of the lower surface of the centrum. An angular interzygapophysial ridge is feebly developed, the surfaces above and below the ridge being shallowly concave. The front margin of the neural arch between the postzygapophyses is, in outline as seen from above, deeply emarginate, restricting the space available for the base of the neural spine. The facettes of the zygapophyses and of the zygosphene and zygantrum are inclined at a slight angle to each other, those of the zygapophyses being the less removed from the horizontal. The costal tubercle is not prominent; its articular face in all the specimens is a little worn, but sufficiently well preserved to show that it is single. Its face is higher than broad, and is directed obliquely outward and downward from beneath the prezygapophysis at a level corresponding with that of the cup. In the largest vertebra (No. 3) the articular face is seen to be convex above and slightly concave below posteriorly. A rounded ridge is developed near the base of the tubercle, and passes backward almost to the side of the ball at its mid-height. This ridge leaves a longitudinal depression on either side of the hypapophysial ridge which passes from the ball to the cup, and is well rounded and distinct but not prominent. There are slight variations in the above vertebrae but their general proportions are similar. The vertebra figured on plate I is No. 2 of the table of measurements given below.\n\nMeasurements in MM.\n\n| No. | Length of centrum | Breadth of vertebra ant. | post. | Height of vertebra ant. | post. |\n|-----|------------------|------------------------|-------|------------------------|-------|\n| 1   | 4\u00b73              | 9\u00b75                    |       | 8\u00b70                    |       |\n| 2   | 5\u00b70              | 7\u00b775                   |       | 6\u00b70                    |       |\n| 3   |                  | 11\u00b70                   |       | 6\u00b775                   |       |\n| 4   | 4\u00b73              | 6\u00b700                   |       | 6\u00b74                    |       |\nThis species is distinct from *O. angulatus* described by Cope* from the White River (Oligocene) beds of north-eastern Colorado. The vertebrae of Cope's species approach more closely in general form those of the Cypress Hills species than do those of other described species of the genus. *O. arenarum*, Douglass,** from the Flint Creek beds (Miocene) of Montana, differs in important particulars.\n\n**CROCODILIA**\n\n*Crocodilus prenasalis?* Loomis.\n\n*Crocodilus prenasalis*, Loomis, 1904.

The writer obtained in 1904 the following specimens:\u2014two vertebral centra, two keeled scutes, a fragment of a pitted bone from the head and a tooth. These specimens were found separately, but probably belong to the same species.\n\nThe vertebrae are from the dorsal region. They are concave in front, and prominently convex behind, and in each case the base only of the neural arch remains. One specimen is much smaller than the other, and, probably, belonged to a young individual, as the suture between the neural arch and the centrum is strongly marked. The dermal scutes have numerous deep, rounded pits in the upper surface, are prominently keeled longitudinally, and their margins bear no evidence of having been in contact with other scutes. The under surface is even and flat. The tooth is elongate-conical and curved slightly inward, and backward; its surface is quite smooth. The inner face is defined in front, and behind, by a well developed ridge that extends from near the base to the apex. The base of the tooth is deeply excavated.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n| Large vertebra | MM. |\n|----------------|-----|\n| Maximum length at mid-height of centrum | 35 |\n| Height of anterior articular face | 20\u00b76 |\n| Maximum breadth of same | 22 |\n| Height of posterior articular face | 18\u00b72 |\n| Maximum breadth of same | 17\u00b78 |\n| Length of floor of neural canal | 28\u00b75 |\n| Length of inferior surface | 22\u00b75 |\n\n| Small vertebra | MM. |\n|----------------|-----|\n| Maximum length at mid-height of centrum | 25 |\n| Height of anterior articular face | 15 |\n| Maximum breadth of same | 18 |\n| Height of posterior articular face | 13 |\n| Maximum breadth of same | 15 |\n| Length of floor of neural canal | 18 |\n| Length of inferior surface | 15\u00b75 |\n\n---\n\n* Report U.

The tooth in crown view, is triangular in outline, has three prominent V-shaped cusps, and a strong external style-bearing cingulum. Of the three cusps, the internal one (protocone) occupies the apex of the triangle, the other two (paracone and metacone) form an antero-posterior pair somewhat removed from the external face of the tooth by the strong development of the cingulum. The three primary cusps are compressed antero-posteriorly, the protocone to a less extent than the other two; all have their external slopes well excavated. The protocone is the stoutest, and is of about the same height as the paracone, which is the smallest; the metacone is conspicuously higher than the others. At the base of the posterior spur of the protocone, is a decided though small fourth cusp that may represent the hypocone. Three principal stylar cusps occur in the cingulum. Of these, the most prominent occupies a position only slightly posterior to the mid-length of the cingulum: it is compressed transversely, and has a vertical external face with a somewhat rounded internal slope; its height is nearly equal to that of the paracone. Of the other two stylar cusps one is at either end of the cingulum, the anterior one being the larger of the two. The demarcation between the anterior style and the large one posterior to it is very decided, and is accentuated by a furrow in the vertical external face of the cingulum. On the anterior slope of the central stylar cusp are two inconspicuous secondary styles. The cingulum is continued round the anterior base of the paracone as a narrow shelf. The crown is borne on three short roots.\n\nThis tooth, plate VIII, figures 1\u20134, probably the second or third upper molar, is considerably larger than (slightly more than one-third as large again as) the corresponding molars of Didelphys (Peratherium) fugax, which exceeds in size the other species of the genus described by Cope from the Oligocene of Colorado. For the species represented by the Cypress Hills tooth the name valens is proposed.

Under the circumstances, however, with so little evidence to go on, a provisional reference to the above, mainly Oligocene genus is at present adhered to.\n\nAnother small tooth, plate VIII, figures 5\u20137, from the same locality as the above, deserves attention. It possibly represents an undescribed genus of marsupial of the polyprotodont section, but the one small tooth found is quite insufficient for any definite determination. The crown is triangular in cross section, and consists of a high, apical, principal cusp, subpyramidal in shape, with two less elevated, conical, subequal cusps occupying the base of the triangle. The tooth has one root which would suggest an anterior premolar, but the crown is molariform, and presumably a posterior molar is represented. Regarding the tooth as a lower molar, the principal apical cusp is the protoconid, the smaller pair being the metaconid and paraconid occupying internal posterior and anterior positions respectively. A cingulum is continuous round the base of the crown except internally. Anteriorly, and externally, the cingulum is feeble, but posteriorly it becomes accentuated, and ends abruptly beneath the posterior slope of the metaconid in a minute tubercle. On the internal face of the crown a vertical furrow occurs between the bases of the two smaller cusps.\n\nMeasurements.\n\n| Measurement                                      | MM   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Maximum antero-posterior diameter of crown       | 1\u00b720 |\n| \" transverse diameter of crown                   | 1\u00b750 |\n| Height of external cusp (protoconid)             | 1\u00b780 |\n| \" internal cusps (metaconid and paraconid)       | 0\u00b785 |\n\nThe second lower molar of *Notoryctes typhlops*\u2020, Stirling, has a cusp arrangement very similar to that of the Cypress Hills tooth, suggesting that the dentition of this living Australian marsupial may be primitive in some of its characters rather than specialized. In the Cypress Hills tooth, however, the talonid is only indicated by a minute tubercle, or enlargement of the cingulum at the base of the metaconid, proportionately much smaller than the definite subsidiary cusp of *Notoryctes*.\n\nIt is possible that this tooth, and the upper molar above described, both of the collection of 1904, may belong to the same animal.\n\n---\n\n* On the Evolution of the Australian Marsupialia; with remarks on the relationships of the marsupials in general, by B.

The cingulum in the Cypress Hills molar is conspicuous, and in this respect as well as in its general proportions this tooth agrees better with the corresponding one of *brachyrhynchus* than with that of *americanus.* In the Cypress Hills tooth the mesostyle is prominent in the ectoloph, and apparently more protrudent than in *brachyrhynchus*; the protoconule is well defined and throughout the cingulum is moderately developed.\n\n| Measurements | MM |\n|--------------|----|\n| Antero-posterior diameter | 29 |\n| Anterior transverse diameter | 31\u00b75 |\n| Posterior transverse diameter | 26 |\n| Height of paracone | 13\u00b75 |\n| Height of protocone | 12\u00b75 |\n\nWithin a very short distance of the above tooth, and at the same level, were found four other teeth that appear to belong to this genus, and are probably referable to this species. These teeth are determined as follows:\u2014a left lower first incisor, a right lower third incisor, a right lower canine, and an upper left third premolar, all figured in plate II. The premolar, fig. 2, is slightly smaller than the same tooth in *brachyrhynchus,* but is otherwise very similar, particularly as regards the shelf-like, interno-posterior expansion of the cingulum, which greatly increases the breadth of the tooth behind. As seen from below, fig. 3, the outline of the tooth is triangular, with the inner posterior angle obtusely rounded. The cingulum is continuous throughout, and is conspicuously prominent internally.\n\nThe lower canine agrees in shape with the corresponding tooth of the Hyopotamus from the Lower Miocene of Ronzon, near Puy-en-Velay (Haute Loire), France, as figured by Kowalevsky in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, 1873, vol. 163, pl. XXXIX, figs. 3, 3'. Its crown, viewed from the side, is nearly triangular, sharply pointed above (unworn), with its height slightly in excess of the basal breadth. Its anterior and posterior slopes are sharp-edged, the former curving inward below. The exterior surface, fig. 5, is convex, somewhat flattened behind. Internally, fig. 4, it is excavated, with a median vertical rib breaking the general concavity.\nOf the incisor teeth, the supposed lower third, figs. 6 and 7, is very similar in shape to the canine, but is smaller, less pointed above (worn), and the breadth of the crown below is greater than the height. The crown is set obliquely to the root. The left lower incisor, figs. 8 and 9, probably the first, is considerably worn above where the greatest breadth occurs. Its cutting edge forms an almost straight line across, and the later margins slope gently inward to the root, without the abrupt basal constriction observed in the third incisor. Internally the crown is concave, with a median longitudinal rib.\n\n**Anthracotherium? pygm\u00e6um**, sp. nov.\n\nPlate VI, fig. 6.\n\nA right upper molar of very small size indicates an artiodactyl with dental characters suggestive of an Anthracothere. As the tooth is imperfect, lacking some of the parts most essential for its exact determination, a description of it is given, in the hope that at some future date, better material may be forthcoming. For the present it is referred to Anthracotherium, but it is probable that an undescribed genus is represented. For the species the name *pygm\u00e6um* is proposed.\n\nIn crown view the outline of the tooth is quadrangular, with the antero-posterior diameter internally greater than the anterior transverse diameter, so that the tooth is longer than broad. In Anthracotherium and Ancodus these proportions are reversed. The margin of the tooth is perfect anteriorly and internally, but externally and posteriorly it is damaged. The specimen lacks the mesostyle and the posterior slopes of the metacone and hypocone. The four main cusps are crescent shaped and there is a distinct but small protoconule.\n\nA deep transverse valley separates the anterior from the posterior cusps, a comparatively shallow longitudinal valley occurs between the protocone and the paracone, but a corresponding valley does not exist between the hypocone and metacone. The protocone is larger and more elevated than the hypocone, but both are prominent with steep inner slopes. A broad, median rib occupies the outer, otherwise slightly concave slope of the former. The paracone is low (in the specimen much worn), but the metacone rises nearly to the height of the hypocone, whose outer slope is short, and descends but little to meet it. The outer slope of the paracone (judging from the small portion of it preserved) resembled that of the protocone. The anterior spur of the protocone reaches to the protoconule, which is close to a well-defined anterior cingulum. The posterior spur of the protocone is long, crosses the median transverse valley, and rises on the anterior slope of the hypocone nearly to the apex of the metacone. The basal cingulum occurs on the anterior face of the crown, and in the inner end of the transverse valley. The anterior spur of the hypocone connects with the posterior spur of the protocone almost at the apex of the metacone. The specimen shows the junction of the anterior spur of the metacone with the posterior one of the paracone, but the mesostyle is missing. The parastyle is very feebly developed.\n\nThe approximation of the posterior cusps in this tooth is a character probably sufficient to distinguish the species generically from any of the known genera of Anthracotheriidae. The selenodont form of the main cusps, and the presence of a protoconule, makes it most probable that this species is properly assignable to the Anthracotheriidae. The tooth pattern indicates a closer relationship to Anthracotherium than to Ancodus.\nMeasurements of type specimen.\n\n| Measurement                          | MM   |\n|--------------------------------------|------|\n| Internal antero-posterior diameter   | 9\u00b700 |\n| Anterior transverse diameter         | 8\u00b700 |\n| Height of protocone                  | 4\u00b770 |\n| Height of hypocone                   | 3\u00b780 |\n\nLocality:\u2014Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills.

C. Weston in the Cypress Hills deposits during the summer of 1888, was first described by Professor Cope in the American Naturalist, vol. XXIII, p. 628, July 1889, in his third article on the \"Vertebrata of the Swift-current river.\" Cope's fuller description, with illustrations of the type specimen, appeared in 1891 in part I of this volume.\n\nThe original description of 1889 is worded as follows:\u2014\"Elotherium coarctatum, sp. nov.\u2014Represented by a left mandibular ramus with condyle, which supports all of the molar teeth. The species differs from the *E. mortoni*, with which it agrees nearly in size, in having all the premolars in a series uninterrupted by diastemata, except a very short one between pm. iii and iv.* The second premolar is the most elevated, and the third and fourth are abruptly smaller. The fourth has one compressed grooved root. The molars are peculiar in having the two anterior cusps elevated above the three posterior ones, as in *Miocebus* sp. The posterior, or fifth tubercle, is well developed, especially on the m. iii.\"\n\n\"Length from condyle to edge of canine alveolus, 295 mm.; do. to last molar, 125; do. of true molar series, 67; do. of m.i., 22; width of do., 13; elevation of pm. ii., 21; length of base of crown do., 28; depth of ramus at m.i., 55.\"\n\nAn upper molar, obtained by Mr. Weston at the Cypress Hills locality in 1884, and assigned to *Elotherium mortoni*, Leidy, by Cope in his earlier references** to the Survey collections, was, in 1891, referred to *E. coarctatum* in his final description of the species.\n\nThis upper tooth, plate II, fig. 10, is regarded as m\u00b9 from the right side. It has six low tubercles arranged in two rows transversely, of which the inner posterior tubercle (hypocone) is apparently not separate from the cingulum. The two outer tubercles (paracone and metacone) are well developed, the paracone being the larger of the two. Both the inner tubercles in this specimen are injured, but the protocone has been apparently of fair size. The protoconule and metaconule are well marked but do not attain the height of the outer cones. The cingulum is conspicuous on the anterior and posterior faces of the crown. The tooth has three roots.\n\nAnother right upper molar, fig. 11, belonging to the writer's collection of 1904, is referred to this species. It is the posterior tooth of the series and is of about the same size as the first upper right molar just mentioned. It resembles the last upper molar of *E. mortoni*, as\n\n---\n\n* The usual premolar enumeration from front to back is here reversed.\n\n** American Naturalist, 1885, vol. XIX. The White River beds of Swift-current river, North West Territory, p. 163 (*Entelodon mortoni*, Leidy); and Geol. and Nat. Hist. Survey of Canada, 1885, vol. I, new series, appendix I, p. 84 \u00c7 (*Elotherium mortoni*, Leidy).\ndescribed by Leidy in 1853 in \"The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska,\" plate VIII, fig. 1, but the six tubercles are more distinctly marked in the Cypress Hills tooth. The cingulum is continued round the entire crown, except for a short distance at the base of the inner slope of the protocone; it forms a broad shelf anteriorly, and is prominent posteriorly. Seen from above the crown in outline is unequally four-sided; it is transversely much narrower behind than in front. It is low with six conspicuous tubercles, of which the outer and inner anterior ones (paracone and protocone), are about equal in size and larger than the others. Of the three tubercles forming the transverse posterior row, the inner one (hypocone) is connected with the cingulum.\n\nTwo fragments of the lower jaw of this species were also obtained in 1904. These are a part of the left ramus with molars i, ii, and iii, and a small portion of the right half of the jaw holding the first molar. The teeth agree in all particulars with the corresponding ones of the type specimen.\n\nTwo teeth, the upper third and fourth premolars of the right side, collected in 1904, are, on account of their large size, referred to *E. coarctatum* with some hesitation. They were found together, and probably belonged to the same individual. If they properly belong to this species, and they are apparently not referable to any other described species from the Oligocene, they will indicate that in *E. coarctatum* the upper third and fourth premolars are considerably stouter in every way than the corresponding teeth of the lower jaw. Of these specimens, the third premolar, figs 12 and 13, is a simple robust cone, elongated antero-posteriorly, and supported on two roots, of which the hinder one is the thicker but shorter of the two. A cingulum passes round the base posteriorly and is present, but feebly developed, anteriorly. The enamel is roughened by short vermicular markings, which, toward the base, above the cingulum, pass into conspicuous wrinkles. The crown shows signs of wear toward the inner side behind and along the front slope. The fourth premolar, figs. 14 and 15, is a very strong, three-rooted tooth, with a transverse diameter greater than its maximum antero-posterior diameter. The crown consists of an outer conical cusp with a smaller, less elevated one on the inner side. A strong cingulum is present except at the centre of the base of the external slope. This tooth is also considerably worn on the front and back slopes of the crown, more particularly on the former. Except where worn the surface above the cingulum presents the same style of surface marking observed in the third premolar.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n|                      | MM. |\n|----------------------|-----|\n| Upper right m. iii, plate II, fig. 11:\u2014 |     |\n| Transverse diameter of crown, maximum | 22  |\n| Antero-posterior \u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c | 22  |\n| Upper right m. i, plate II, fig. 10:\u2014 |     |\n| Transverse diameter of crown | 21  |\n| Antero-posterior \u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c | 20\u00b75 |\n| Upper right pm. iv, plate II, figs. 14 and 15:\u2014 |     |\n| Transverse diameter of crown, at base | 29  |\n| Antero-posterior \u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c maximum | 26\u00b77 |\n| Height of crown, external | 23  |\n| Upper right pm. iii, plate II, figs. 12 and 13:\u2014 |     |\n| Transverse diameter of crown at base, maximum | 18  |\n| Antero-posterior \u201c \u201c \u201c \u201c | 32\u00b75 |\n| Height of crown, external | 27  |\nThe reader is referred to part I of this volume for Professor Cope's description of the type of this species.\n\nFive separate teeth from Bone coul\u00e9e may be mentioned here as apparently belonging to *Elotherium*. They resemble incisors in form, and may represent more than one species, as four of them are nearly of a size, whilst one is much smaller. Two of the larger specimens are shown in plate III, figures 1, 2, 3 and 4; the small one is shown in figures 5 and 6 of the same plate.\n\nIn his memoir on the Cypress Hills fauna Professor Cope alludes to the fewness of the remains of *Oreodonidae* in the collection studied by him. The only specimen mentioned by him is a left lower first premolar which was not assigned to any genus.\n\nIn 1904 a few additional separate teeth were obtained by the writer; these are noticed as under.\n\n**Agrioch\u00e6rus antiquus**, Leidy.\n\nPlate II, figs. 16 and 17.\n\nThree imperfect posterior upper molars, one from the left side and two from the right, represent one or more species of *Agrioch\u00e6rus*. Comparing these teeth with the posterior molars of *Agrioch\u00e6rus antiquus*, Leidy, from the Oligocene of South Dakota, as described and figured in the \"Ancient Fauna of Nebraska\" (Smith. Contr. to Knowledge, 1854, vol. vi) p. 24, pl. 1, the same general form of low cusps, pertaining to this genus, and distinguishing it from *Oreodon*, is observed. Of these molars, one is of about the size of the corresponding tooth of Leidy's figured types, the other two are slightly larger.\n\nOne of the above specimens (an upper right third molar, imperfect internally) may with little doubt be referred to *A. antiquus*; its dimensions slightly exceed those given by Leidy for this species. In this specimen the form of the external median buttress (mesostyle), seen also in a molar to be mentioned presently, is low and flattened from without, quite unlike the high antero-posteriorly compressed mesostyle of *Oreodon*. In the other posterior right molar the agreement in form with the teeth figured by Leidy is close, so far as can be judged; the ectoloph is missing and a full comparison is not possible. Its breadth is about the same, and the shape of the inner cusps is similar. This tooth is also referred to *A. antiquus*. The third specimen (plate II, fig. 16), the left posterior molar, has a greater proportionate as well as actual transverse diameter, and may represent a species distinct from *A. antiquus*.\n\nBesides the three above mentioned specimens, there is in the collection of 1904 another left upper posterior molar (plate II, fig. 17). The low rounded form of the mesostyle is here well shown. The tooth exceeds in size the corresponding one of *A. antiquus*, and the proportions of the cusps are somewhat dissimilar; the flatness of the outer slope of the metacone (postero-exterior cusp) is particularly noticeable. In the absence of better material this tooth is provisionally referred to *A. antiquus*.\nMerycoidodon culbertsoni, Leidy.\n\nPlate II, figs. 18\u201326.\n\nA second genus of Agrioch\u00e6rid\u00e6 (Oreodontidae) is represented by separate teeth from the Cypress hills, included in the collections of 1884, 1889 and 1904. They are referred to Merycoidodon culbertsoni, Leidy, of the Oligocene of South Dakota, and consist of the following specimens:\u2014The left lower caniniform premolar, mentioned by Cope in part I of this volume, but not assigned by him to any species (Weston, 1884), a left upper canine (Lambe, 1904) and a right lower second molar (Lambe, 1904).\n\nThe premolar, plate II, figs 18 and 19, agrees closely in size and form with the corresponding tooth of the female skull of M. culbertsoni, described and figured by Leidy in \u201cThe Ancient Fauna of Nebraska.\u201d This premolar shows signs of wear, in front on the outer side, and behind on the inner side, where it closed against the upper canine and the upper first premolar.\n\nMeasurements of lower first premolar.\n\n| Measurement                                      | MM |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Exterior height of crown (worn)                  | 13 |\n| Antero-posterior diameter of crown at base       | 13 |\n| Transverse diameter of crown at base             | 7.5|\n\nThe left upper canine, figs. 20-23, is long, curved, and subtriangular in transverse section throughout its length. The posterior surface, fig. 21, is flattened, and the exterior and interior surfaces are nearly flat, the former being slightly more convex than the latter, fig. 20, in which a low, longitudinal median ridge is developed in the fang above the crown. In the exterior surface a shallow groove is noticed in a corresponding position. The forward angulation is evenly rounded. The crown of the tooth is worn flat posteriorly, where it came in contact with the lower first premolar, and its side angles are sharp. The immediate extremity of the crown is broken off but it seems to have been bluntly pointed. The enamel of the crown extended upward from the point, about 20 mm., measured along the forward angulation. The antero-posterior diameter of the tooth throughout its entire length exceeds the breadth of the posterior flattened surface (max. transverse diameter), otherwise the resemblance of the Cypress Hills tooth to that of M. culbertsoni is strong. In describing the upper canine of this species, Leidy, in his above mentioned memoir (p. 42), states that the posterior side \u201cis a little larger than the other sides,\u201d that is the transverse diameter exceeded the antero-posterior diameter.\n\nMeasurements of upper canine.\n\n| Measurement                                      | MM |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Total length of specimen along anterior curve    | 58 |\n| Max. transverse diameter at base of crown        | 9  |\n| Antero-posterior diameter at base of crown       | 10.5|\n| Antero-posterior diameter near upper end of fang | 12 |\n| Transverse diameter                              | 10 |\n\nThe remaining tooth, referred to M. culbertsoni, is a lower right second molar, figs. 24, 25 and 26. Comparing the specimen with Leidy\u2019s figure of the corresponding tooth (op. cit. pl. III, fig. 4) no difference is noticed, except that the Cypress Hills molar is a little the larger of the two.\nPOEBROTHERIUM WILSONI, Leidy.\n\nPlate VIII, figs. 8 and 9.\n\nThis species, made known by Leidy in 1847 (Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., vol. III, p. 322), from the greater part of a skull from the Oligocene (White River) of Nebraska, is represented in the 1904 collection from the Cypress Hills beds by two separate lower last temporary molars, one of which remains in a portion of the jaw. These teeth are composed of three double lobes decreasing in size to the front. The jaw fragment in which the molar is preserved, has a depth agreeing with that of the lower jaw of the type skull, fully described and figured by Dr. Leidy in 1854* in his classic \"Ancient Fauna of Nebraska\" (Smith. Contr. to Knowledge, vol. VI).

In size the type of L. esulcatus is between one-third and one-fourth smaller than the molars of L. evansi, Leidy. The lower teeth figured by Matthew in his paper on the fauna of the Titanotherium beds, 1903, p 223, fig. 15, and referred provisionally to L. esulcatus, belong evidently to a species considerably larger than the one represented by the type of L. esulcatus.\n\nLEPTOMERYX MAMMIFER, Cope.\n\n?

The best preserved of these latter, the one figured in 1891, may be regarded as the cotype of the species. There are in the collection of 1904 separate upper molars that agree closely in size and form with the cotype, and are, therefore, regarded as belonging to this species. An upper fourth premolar, obtained in 1904, is also thought to be referable to L. mammifer.\n\nIt has been pointed out by Matthew (1902) that one of the characters of L. mammifer relied on by Cope as a distinguishing one, viz., the presence in the lower posterior molar of a \"peculiar column intercalated between the heel and the posterior internal column,\" is in reality the small antero-internal cusp of the heel found in other species of the genus.\n\nNo lower molars are recognized in the collection of 1904 as belonging to L. mammifer.\n\nLEPTOMERYX SPECIOSUS, sp. nov.\n\nPlate VIII, figs. 10\u201315.\n\nA species of Leptomeryx is represented by a large number of separate teeth, of which the upper molars are much larger than the type of L. esuleatus, Cope, considerably larger than those of L. evansi, but not reaching the size of those of L. mammifer. This species is apparently distinct from any of these three species.\n\nIn the upper molars the proportionate development of the mesostyle, the anterior (para-style), and posterior (metastyle) styles, and the ribs of the external face are much the same as in L. evansi. The styles are quite different from the gibbous styles of L. mammifer, as seen in the cotype of that species.\n\nIn the upper molars a moderately strong cingulum is generally present for a short distance at the base of the anterior slope of the protocone, and, in a number of specimens there is a slight indication, as well, of a cingulum on the posterior slope of the hypocone. In two fourth premolars a cingulum is present for a short distance on both sides (anterior and posterior) of the inner crescent. In a majority of the upper molars a median internal cusp is present, smaller than that of the molars of L. evansi.\n\nThe lower molars referred to this species, relying on their size principally for their association here, agree in size and general shape with the mandibular teeth referred provisionally to L. esuleatus by Matthew in 1903, (op. cit., p. 222, fig. 15). The Cypress Hills lower molars have a slight anterior and posterior cingulum in the majority of cases, and there is also in most of the specimens a small median external cusp having about the same degree of development as the median internal cusp of the upper molars. No mention is made by Matthew of a cingulum, nor of a median internal cusp in the Pipestone Springs lower molars, which, however, in other respects, and as regards exact size, agree with the Cypress Hills specimens.\nMeasurements.\n\n| Description                                      | MM   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Upper molar, plate VIII, figs. 10, 11.

The upper molar described by Cope is imperfect, the outer slope of the ectoloph is missing and the anterior part of the tooth, including the protoloph, is much damaged.\n\nThe crown of the molar obtained in the summer of 1904 is practically perfect and had been subjected to little use during the life of the animal; it is most probably the second molar and is shown in figures 10-13 of plate III. This tooth is brachydont, with well developed low cross crests (protoloph and metaloph). The crown, seen from below, is suboblong in outline, transversely broader in front than behind and relatively narrow in an antero-posterior direction. The outer border (ectoloph) rises higher than the cross crests. The latter are unequal in length, the protoloph being longer and better developed than the metaloph. The intermediate cusps (protoconule and metaconule) are both well defined, although the protoconule is larger than the metaconule, and more distinctly separated from the protocone than is the metaconule from the hypocone. The protocone is slightly larger at its base than the hypocone, but both have about the same height. There is no hypostyle. The parastyle is large, and adds considerably to the crown's anterior transverse diameter. The mesostyle and metastyle are distinct, and the ribs distinguishable, the anterior ribs being the better defined of the two. The cingulum is well developed and passes from the metastyle entirely round the inner side of the crown to the parastyle without interruption, except for a short distance on the front inner slope of the protocone; it connects in front\nwith the parastyle, with which the outer end of the protoloph shows a marked tendency to unite. Outwardly the cingulum rises on to the parastyle, but does not cross it.\n\n*M. westoni*, judging of its dental characters principally from the molar obtained in 1904, approaches closely to *M. latidens,* Douglass, in tooth-structure, but its molars are distinguished principally by the presence of an internal cingulum, by the less pronounced parastyle, and a proportionately greater antero-posterior diameter, with the protoloph more nearly equal in length to the metaloph, as well as by other characters. *M. celer,* ** Marsh, and *M. montanensis,* *** Osborn, are two other nearly related, but apparently distinct species, from the Lower Oligocene. The presence of the highly developed internal cingulum is one of the most interesting characters in the dentition of *M. westoni*. This character, together with the absence of a hypostyle, points to this species being probably the most primitive of the known horses of Oligocene age.\n\nA lower second premolar and a lower molar, are included in the collection of 1904. Figures of the two lower molars obtained by Mr. Weston are given in Cope's memoir of 1891.\n\n| Measurements in mm. of upper molar of *M. westoni* obtained in 1904. | Measurements of typical molar of *M. westoni* as given by Osborn. | Measurements of M1 (type) of *M. montanensis* as given by Osborn. |\n|----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Transverse diameter. | 13\u00b70                             | 12+                              | 14\u00b70                             |\n| Antero-posterior diameter. | 10\u00b72                           | 9\u00b75                              |                                 |\n| Height of protocone.   | 4\u00b75                              |                                  | 10\u00b75                             |\n| Height of hypocone.    | 4\u00b75                              | 4\u2013                               |                                 |\n| Height of ectoloph.    | 6\u00b72                              | 5+                               |                                 |\n\nMr. Gidley has expressed the opinion that, the tooth collected in 1904, approaches more closely to *M. montanensis* than to *M. westoni*, and would be inclined to refer it to the former species with some degree of doubt. In comparing it with *M. montanensis* he has noted the somewhat less elevated inner cones and the presence of an internal cingulum, regarded by him as differences of perhaps not more than varietal value, which may be explained by calling the tooth a premolar instead of a molar.\n\nJudging from the characters of the teeth and their size, it is evident that the two species *M. westoni* and *M. montanensis* approach each other closely. The type of *M. westoni* is not as well preserved (nor as accurately figured in the original description) as is desirable, and the absence of the ectoloph and the anterior margin, including the front slope of the protoloph, precludes the taking of exact measurements. That the tooth of 1904 (figures 10-13) comes from the same locality as the type of *M. westoni*, and that it has a particularly well defined internal cingulum, are facts worthy of every consideration in determining its specific affinity.\n\n**Mesohippus pr\u00e6cocidens**, Lambe.\n\nPlate III, fig. 14.\n\n*Mesohippus pr\u00e6cocidens*, Lambe, 1905.

There is an entire absence of an internal cingulum, the cross crests are better developed, and relatively higher, with steeper slopes. The protoconule is relatively larger, and the metaconule, although defined, scarcely breaks the continuity of the metaloph, which unites in a decided manner with the ectoloph. The protoconule is distinctly defined in the protoloph, and connects closely with the forward slope of the paracone. The hypocone has about the same height as the protocone. The anterior cingulum is strong. Mr. Gidley has informed the writer that he \"would expect to see the hypostyle well developed, were that portion of the tooth present.\"\n\n*Mesohippus propinquus*, Lambe.\n\nPlate III, figs. 15 and 16.\n\n*Mesohippus propinquus*, Lambe, 1905.

The hypocone exceeds the protocone in height. The protoconule is well defined and distinctly breaks the continuity of the protoloph. The metaloph is fairly continuous and shows a disposition to unite with the ectoloph, which, however, it does not reach. The hypostyle is connected at its inner end with the posterior cingulum and outwardly abuts against the ectoloph; it is of fair size. In the ectoloph the mesostyle is conspicuous, the parastyle is flattened and connects with the protoloph, and the ribs are faintly shown. There is no trace of an internal cingulum.\n\nMr. Gidley has drawn the writer's attention to the interesting fact that the protocone in these teeth \"is peculiar in having the slope of its anterior face about equal to that of its posterior face, while in *M. bairdi*, and all the middle and upper Oligocene horses, the anterior face of the protocone is always much more abrupt than the posterior one.\"\nA right upper molar, presumably the third, arbitrarily associated with the foregoing, is considerably larger than the corresponding tooth of *M. bairdi*. A flatness of the ectoloph is principally noticeable, as well as the smallness of the hypocone, otherwise its characters are very similar to those of the left upper second molar already mentioned.\n\n*Mesohippus brachystylus*, Osborn.\n\nPlate III, fig. 17.\n\n*Mesohippus brachystylus*, Osborn, 1904.

The internal cingulum is slightly more accentuated than in the corresponding tooth of the type, but the general proportions and the size seem to be the same. In the Cypress Hills specimen the greater part of the ectoloph is unfortunately missing, but enough remains of its anterior end to show that the parastyle was rounded and of a relatively large size. There are certain slight differences of detail to be noticed but nothing apparently of importance.\n\nThe type of *M. brachystylus* is from the Upper Oligocene, Leptauchenia beds of the Cheyenne river, South Dakota, U.S.A.\n\n*Mesohippus stenolophus*, Lambe.\n\nPlate III, figs. 18, 19 and 20.\n\n*Mesohippus stenolophus*, Lambe, 1905.

The differences are: (1) The greater relative size of *m*3, with a more pronounced obliquity of the cross crests in these teeth, (2) the greater length of the metaloph, which in *m*3 is connected with the ectoloph, and (3) the intimate connexion of the hypostyle with both the posterior cingulum and the metastyle. The resemblances are (1) somewhat similar general proportions, with about the same degree of development of the protoconule and a like suppression of the metaconule, (2) the parastyle and internal cingulum similarly developed.\n\nA special character of *M. stenolophus*, seen in *m*3, is the oblique crossing of the parastyle by the external cingulum, which rises rapidly from without and appears very distinct on the\nupper anterior surface of the style (figures 19 and 20). The cross crests are narrow in proportion to their height, a feature suggested in the name that has been given to the species.\n\n**Mesohippus planidens**, Lambe.\n\nPlate III, fig. 21.\n\n*Mesohippus planidens*, Lambe, 1905.

They differ from those of *M. intermedius* in the greater obliquity of the protoloph and metaloph, in which respect they resemble those of *M. obliquidens*, Osborn. The teeth are brachydont, and are devoid of an internal cingulum. Externally, the ectoloph is noticeably flat, with only a slight development of the parastyle and mesostyle, the ribs are absent or but feebly indicated, and the metastyle is particularly inconspicuous. The hypostyle is of fair size, curved and attached at either end to the posterior cingulum. The cross crests are oblique to the ectoloph, well elevated, and moderately continuous, the metaloph more so than the protoloph. The protoconule slightly interrupts the protoloph, and unites with the parastyle. The metaconule scarcely breaks the continuity of the metaloph, which is sharply separated from the ectoloph and develops a rudimentary crochet. The protocone and hypocone are not so elevated as the ectoloph.\n\nThe specific name has reference to the flattened condition of the ectoloph.\n\n**Mesohippus assiniboiensis**, Lambe.\n\nPlate III, figs. 22, 23 and 24.\n\n*Mesohippus assiniboiensis*, Lambe, 1905.

Dakota. It resembles *M. brachystylus*, Osborn, from the Leptauchenia beds of S. Dakota, in the great development of the parastyle, which is, however, more distinctly separated in the Cypress Hills species.\n\nIn the above tooth ($p^2$) the antero-posterior diameter is greatly increased by the separation and large size of the parastyle. The cross crests are short, steep-sided and set almost at right angles to the ectoloph. The two inner cusps (deutocone and tetartocone) are strongly\nand about equally developed. The protoconule* (anterior intermediate cusp) is very much smaller than the metaconule (posterior intermediate cusp), and passes posterior to, and beyond the inner end of, an inwardly directed spur from the protocone (antero-external cusp of the premolar, adopting Scott's nomenclature). The ectoloph has a distinct mesostyle, a broadly rounded and well detached parastyle, and strong ribs, of which the anterior one is particularly rotund. The hypostyle tends to separate from the posterior cingulum, to which it remains connected by a stout bar. The cingulum is robust, high and sharp edged behind, low and forming a narrow shelf abutting against the base of the parastyle in front, and is entirely absent within. The external cusps (protocone and tritocone) rise considerably higher than the internal ones (deuterocone and tetartocone).\n\nThis species, known only from the second premolar, in which the size of the parastyle would be expected to be accentuated, appears to approach most nearly in tooth development to the much smaller *M. brachystylus*. It exceeds *M. intermedius* and ? *M. validus* in size, but apparently, more closely resembles the latter. It is distinguished from the last two species by (1) the greater development of the protocone and deuterocone in this species, (2) the slight development of the protoconule, (3) the more complete separation of the parastyle, and (4) the intermediate height of the ectoloph.\n\nThe foregoing species of *Mesohippus* are related to, or resemble, previously described species of the genus from Montana and Dakota as follows:\n\n*M. westoni*, (Cope.) More primitive than *M. latidens*, Douglass, and *M. montanensis*, Osborn, from the Lower Oligocene, Titanotherium beds.\n\n*M. pr\u00e6cocidens*, Lambe. Nearly related to and more advanced than *M. westoni* (and ? *M. montanensis* of the Titanotherium beds).\n\n*M. propinquus*, Lambe.

Some resemblance to, but larger than *M. validus*, Osborn, of the Protoceras beds.\n\nIt would seem probable then, that the species from the Cypress hills, in their relative degrees of progressiveness, are to be assigned to the horizons of the Oligocene in the following order:\n\n*M. westoni* Lower Oligocene, Titanotherium beds.\n\n*M. pr\u00e6cocidens*\n\n*M. propinquus* Middle Oligocene, Oreodon beds.\n\n*M. brachystylus* Upper Oligocene, Leptauchenia beds.\n\n*M. stenolophus*\n\n*M. planidens* Upper Oligocene, Protoceras beds.\n\n*M. assiniboiensis*\n\n*It has been pointed out by Scott (The Evolution of the Premolar Teeth in the Mammals, Proc.

Royal Soc. of Canada, second series, section IV, vol. XI, p. 37, pl. I, figs. 1, la.\n\nAnother species of Hyracodon is represented, in the collection of 1904 from the Oligocene deposits at Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, by an upper jaw with teeth, giving the complete premolar-molar series. Three teeth are missing, viz., the fourth premolar from the left side, and the second and third premolars from the right. As the form of the tooth in each case is seen in the corresponding one of the opposite side, the details of structure of all the cheek teeth are presented. The ectoloph of the right third premolar remains. The teeth are in an excellent state of preservation and, as they are only slightly worn, evidently belonged to a young animal. The last molar on either side has not protruded from the jaw to its fullest extent. Both jugals are preserved, and, on the right side, part of the squamosal also.\n\nThe specimen to which the following remarks apply consists for the most part of the two maxillary bones holding teeth. These bones are imperfect in their lateral upward extension. The right maxilla is broken off slightly in advance of the first premolar, but, on the left side, the full extent of the diastema, separating the first premolar from the canine, is preserved. The lower margin of the orbital opening on either side is intact.\n\nThis specimen (type) indicates an animal of about the size of Hyracodon nebrascensis, Leidy, from the Oligocene of Nebraska, South Dakota and Colorado, from which, however, judging from its tooth structure, it differed specifically. The species has been described under the above name.\n\nHyracodon priscidens, as compared with H. nebrascensis, exhibits the following characteristics:\u2014(1) The teeth are shorter or more brachyodont, (2) in the premolars the protoloph is continued in a curve round the inner end of the metaloph, the tetartocone being confluent with the deuterocone and arising from the protoloph, (3) in the last molar, m\u00b3, the ectoloph\nis relatively much shorter, with a concomitant greater development of the metaloph, (4) the exterior cingulum is developed only on the posterior half of the base of the ectoloph in the seven teeth, and the internal cingulum is absent in $p^1$, (5) the parastyle in the premolars is only slightly developed, (6) the skull is apparently flatter and relatively more elongate, the lower margin of the orbit being less distant from the alveolar border, and the jugal less curved upward in the posterior half of its length, (7) the diastema in advance of $p^1$ is proportionately longer and its margin is not so arched.\n\nFor this species of *Hyracodon* the name *priscidens* has been proposed, indicative of the less advanced stage of its dentition as compared with *H. nebrascensis*. In the form of its premolars it is decidedly primitive, and implies a position in a direct line of descent from *Hyrachyus*. A progressive character is seen in the squareness of the premolars which in *Hyrachyus* are triangular; also in these teeth the metaloph is much advanced in comparison with the Eocene genus.\n\nIn *H. priscidens*, as in the type species, $m^2$ is much the largest tooth, and $m^1$ is larger than $p^4$. The molars occupy about the same space antero-posteriorly as the premolars.\n\nIn the premolars there is a progression toward the molar pattern, but the advance has been slow. The anterior premolars are more progressive than the posterior ones in some respects. This is shown in the tendency to the separation of the tetartocone from the deuterococone seen in passing from $p^4$ forward. In $p^1$ the tetartocone and the deuterococone are very closely united, but in $p^3$, although still connected to the protoloph, the tetartocone has moved farther toward the posterior border of the crown, lengthening the anterior loph, and also effecting a junction with the metaloph.\n\nIn $p^4$ the cross lophs are unequal in length, the protoloph, in which the tetartocone is very intimately united with the deuterococone, not passing beyond a point in line with the inner end of the metaloph, which is short and curves slightly backward. In $p^3$ the protoloph is increased in length by the shifting backward of the tetartocone, with a tendency to separate from the deuterococone. The two lophs remain distinct, the anterior one passing slightly beyond the inner end of the metaloph, which in this tooth is developed to about the same extent as that of $p^4$, with a like backward obliquity. In $p^2$ the protoloph is still further increased in length, and curves round the inner margin of the crown considerably past the metaloph toward the posterior border of the tooth. The metaloph curves slightly forward and unites with the protoloph at a point some distance in advance of the latter's posterior termination. The increased length of the protoloph is due to the further recession of the tetartocone from the deuterococone, although the union of the two remains complete. In $p^1$ the protoloph is separate from the metaloph, a narrow but distinct sinus dividing them, and the tetartocone arises from the metaloph which in its inner half presents a concave surface forward. A variation is noticed in the right first premolar of the Cypress Hills specimen. In this tooth the sinus, seen in the left first premolar, in advance of the metaloph, does not occur, in which case the tetartocone would still be said to arise from the protoloph which, commencing at the ectoloph, behind the parastyle, forms a high continuous wall curving round the inner border of the tooth for some distance past its union with the metaloph, giving to the protoloph a length proportionately still greater than the corresponding loph of $p^2$. The left first premolar, above described, resembles the corresponding tooth of *H. nebrascensis* as figured by Leidy in plate XIV, figure 5, accompanying his description of the type species in \"The Ancient Fauna of Nebraska,\" 1852, (Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge). The\nother premolars in this figure denote a stage of evolution much in advance of the corresponding teeth of *H. priscidens*.\n\nIn the premolars of *H. priscidens* the deuterocone arises from the protoloph, as in p\u00b3 and p\u2074 of *Hyrachyus agrarius*, Leidy, of the Bridger Eocene of Wyoming and Utah; also, in the second, third and fourth premolars, the general outline of the tooth is quadrangular instead of triangular as in *Hyrachyus*. The transverse diameter of p\u2074 is relatively greater than that of either p\u00b3 or p\u00b2. The second, third and fourth premolars are provided with a well defined cingulum that is continuous round the entire base of the crown, except at the base of the tritocone; at the base of the parastyle the cingulum is feebly shown, with increasing faintness in passing from p\u2074 to p\u00b2. In the first premolar the exterior cingulum is developed only in the posterior half of the ectoloph, the posterior cingulum is strong, the anterior cingulum extends but a short distance from the parastyle, and there is no internal cingulum.\n\nIn the molars the cross lophs are nearly equal in length, the protoloph being slightly the longer, the hypocone is strongly developed and of the size of the protocone, from which it is separated by a deep anterior valley (medisinus). A crista, strongest in m\u00b9, is developed from the ectoloph, and an antecrochet, of fair size in m\u00b9, smaller in m\u00b2 and incipient in m\u00b3, is given off from the protoloph. In p\u2074, in addition to a small crista, and an indication of an antecrochet in the form of a decided tubercle, there is a delicate crochet* which is of interest as a decidedly progressive character. In the molars there is no internal cingulum, but posteriorly, anteriorly, and externally the cingulum is as in the premolars, except that externally it is scarcely more than suggested at the base of the parastyle. As already mentioned, the ectoloph in m\u00b3 is short as compared with that of m\u00b2 and m\u00b9, principally on account of the reduction in size of the metacone, which does not extend, as in the other molars, far posterior to its junction with the metaloph, but is curtailed at this point, in consequence of which there is only a slight indication of the formation of a posterior valley (postsinus) that in *H. nebrascensis* has reached a more advanced stage.\n\nThe order of premolar transformation in *H. priscidens* is apparently an exception to the usual metamorphosis of the Hyracodont premolars, which, as stated by Osborn in his memoir on \"The Extinct Rhinoceroses\" 1898, p. 90, is presented in three successive stages of evolution toward the molar pattern in the second, third and fourth premolars, the last premolar (p\u2074) being the most advanced.\n\nIn *H. priscidens* the fourth premolar is the least advanced, as regards the relation of the lophs to each other, although in other respects, viz., in the presence of secondary crest folds (\"crista,\" \"antecrochet\" and \"crochet\"), a decided advance has been made, and it may be considered in this regard as more progressive than p\u00b9, p\u00b2 and p\u00b3.\n\n---\n\n*Professor H. F. Osborn in his memoir on \"The Extinct Rhinoceroses\" (Memoirs of the Amer. Mus. of Nat. Hist., vol. I, part III, p. 89, 1898), has mentioned that the \"crochet\" is \"peculiar to the true Rhinoceros molars\" and is \"only feebly developed, if at all, in the Amyndonts and Hyracodonts.\"*\nMeasurements.\n\n|                      | H. priscidens | H. planiceps** | H. nebrascensis** |\n|----------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|\n| Upper molar series, length | 62            | 103            | 70                |\n| Upper premolar series, length | 62            |                |                   |\n| M\u2081 width, (tr.)      | 23\u00b72          | 35             | 26                |\n| M\u2082 \u201c                 | 24\u00b75          | 36             | 28                |\n| M\u2083 \u201c                 | 24            | 37             | 26                |\n| M\u2081 length (a.p.)     | 22            |                |                   |\n| M\u2082 \u201c                 | 23            | 3\u00bd             | 27                |\n| M\u2083 \u201c                 | 19\u00b75          | 40             |                   |\n| P\u2081 width (tr)        | 13\u00b75          |                |                   |\n| P\u2082 \u201c                 | 20            |                |                   |\n| P\u2083 \u201c                 | 21\u00b77          |                |                   |\n| P\u2084 \u201c                 | 23            |                |                   |\n| P\u2081 length (a.p.)     | 12\u00b73          |                |                   |\n| P\u2082 \u201c                 | 16            |                |                   |\n| P\u2083 \u201c                 | 16\u00b78          |                |                   |\n| P\u2084 \u201c                 | 17\u00b73          |                |                   |\n\nThe anterior end of the mandible of a Hyracodon, obtained in 1904 from the Bone Coul\u00e9e beds, is of special interest; it is provisionally assigned to this species.\n\nThe specimen (plate IV, figures 3 and 4) consists of nearly half the left ramus with that part of the right ramus anterior to the second premolar.

Hist., vol. I, pt. III, p. 136.\n\nIn his 1891 report Cope assigned certain remains of Aceratheres from the Cypress hills to this species. They consist of parts of two left mandibular rami, and are referred to as specimens Nos. 1 and 2. The first specimen is a section of a left ramus holding the roots of the last two molars, and extending back beneath the base of the coronoid; the fragment is 87 mm. long. The second is part of the anterior half of another left ramus, with premolars 3 and 4 preserved, the roots of premolar 2, and the inner end of the alveolus of a procumbent canine. A figure was given (pl. IV, fig. 2, pt. I of this volume) of this second specimen viewed from above.\n\nA symphysis of a mandible, also from the Cypress hills, described and figured by Cope in 1891, under the name *C\u0153nopus pumilus*, in the same publication as the above, is regarded by Osborn (op. cit. 1898) as properly referable to *A. mite*. The second of the two specimens on which *C. pumilus* was founded (pt. I, this volume, pl. IV, fig. 4) has been shown by Professor Osborn (op. cit. 1898) to be part of the lower jaw of *Hyracodon nebrascensis*.\n\nIn the type ramus from Colorado, described by Cope in 1874, the space occupied by the first three lower premolars (2, 3 and 4) is 80 mm. as given in the original description. A similar measurement, taken from the \"type lower jaw\" (and therefore presumably from the same specimen), is stated by Osborn (op. cit. p. 139) to be 55 mm. In specimen 2 from the Cypress hills (*A. mite*) the three premolars together measure in length 58 mm, and in the symphysial specimen (*C. pumilus*) a like measurement gives 43 mm. In one only of the three Cypress Hills specimens referred to *A. mite*, are premolar crowns preserved, and in the type ramus the crowns of the three premolars are imperfect.\n\nA very perfect lower jaw from the Protoceras beds of South Dakota is referred doubtfully by Osborn (op. cit. p. 139) to this species. The premolar series in this last specimen occupies a space of 47 mm.\n\nAn upper left third molar tooth, obtained by T. C. Weston at the Cypress Hills locality in 1884, is probably referable to this species. Its dimensions are:\u2014antero-posterior diameter, 25 mm., transverse diameter 28 mm.\nA much larger tooth, plate IV, fig. 6, an upper right posterior molar of the 1904 collection, compares favourably in size and general proportions with the third molar of *Leptaceratherium trigonodon*, Osb. and Wort. Its diameters measure, antero-posterior, 31 mm., transverse 37 mm.\n\n**Aceratherium occidentale** (Leidy).\n\nPlate IV, fig. 7.\n\n*Rhinoceros occidentalis*, Leidy, 1851. Proc. Acad. Nat. Sci. Phila., vol. V. p. 276.\n\nThis species is recorded by Cope (this volume, pt. I) from the Oligocene of the Cypress hills. A number of lower jaw fragments, belonging both to the collection of 1904 and to the earlier collections, apparently represent species distinct from *A. mite* and *A. occidentale*, but they are too imperfect for determination.\n\nAn inferior left posterior molar (collection of 1904) evidently belongs to this species. In it the basal cingulum is developed in front and behind but not on the exterior and interior surfaces. Diameters\u2014antero-posterior 32 mm., transverse 21 mm.\n\n**Aceratherium exiguum**, Sp. nov.\n\nPlate V, figs. 3, 4 and 5.\n\nA mandibular symphysis, collected by the writer in Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, in 1904, has entirely different proportions to the symphysis (*C\u00e6nopus pumilus*, Cope) from the same locality, already referred to *A. mite*. This specimen consists of almost exactly the same parts of the jaw preserved in the symphysis of *C. pumilus*, viz., the anterior end of the left ramus, and a short length of the right ramus united with it so as to show the extent and form of the symphysis. No crowns of teeth are preserved, but in the left ramus the roots of premolars 2 and 3 remain. The alveoli for the canine and for one incisor in each ramus are preserved, as well as the alveolus for premolar 2 in the right ramus, and the anterior half of the alveolus for premolar 3 in the left.\n\nComparing it with the symphysial specimen of *C. pumilus*, the following differences are apparent:\u2014a narrower and longer symphysis, having increased depth behind; a more rapid deepening of the ramus from in front backward, with a corresponding increase in transverse thickness; a greater space occupied by the first two premolars; and very much larger canines as indicated by their alveoli. The greater depth of the ramus beneath the first two premolars is very noticeable.\n\nIn this specimen, belonging to the 1904 collection, the diastema is of about the same length as that of *C. pumilus*. The alveoli for the canines are 8 mm. apart in front, and close together at a lower level are those for two incisors, one on each side of the median line. Premolar 2 was a tooth of fair size with two well separated roots.\n\nA small species of Acerathere, slightly exceeding *A. mite* (*pumilum*) in size, is here represented, to which the name *exiguum* is given. The jaw is more robust than in *A. pumilum*, its main characteristics being the contracted and lengthened symphysis and the enlarged canines.\nMeasurements.\n\n*Aceratherium exiguum* compared with *A. mite (pumilum)*.\n\n| Measurement                                      | *A. exiguum* | *A. mite* |\n|-------------------------------------------------|--------------|-----------|\n| Length of symphysis, approx                      | 58           | 40        |\n| Depth in front                                   | 18           | 18        |\n| Depth behind                                     | 26           | 21        |\n| Distance apart of premolars 2                    | 27           | 32        |\n| Space occupied by premolars 2 and 3              | 30           | 23        |\n| Antero-posterior diameter of premolar 2          | 12.5         | 9         |\n| Breadth of jaw transversely across alveoli for canines | 42           | 33        |\n| Height of alveolus for canine                     | 12           | 7         |\n| Width \" \" \" \"                                     | 16           | 10.5      |\n| Depth of ramus below posterior end of diastema   | 38           | 32        |\n| Depth \" \" \" premolar 3                            | 46           | 39        |\n\n*Megacerops angustigenis* (Cope).\n\n*Menodus angustigenis*, Cope, 1885.

In the Cypress Hills species the horns are much farther apart, with a flatter surface separating them. Also the nasals, besides being shorter, expand laterally in front instead of narrowing rapidly as in *M. coloradensis*.\n\nCope, in the American Naturalist, 1889, p. 153, made this species the type of *Haplacodon*, a generic term discarded by him in his later writings.\n\nThe species, of which the full description with figures is given in part I of this volume, is based on two maxillary bones from the same individual, a separate left ramus, and the symphysial part of another jaw. With these were associated, as probably belonging to the same species, an imperfect cranium, and certain separate leg and foot bones. One of the maxillary bones, the left ramus, and the nasal bones with horns and part of the frontal, were figured in plates V, VI, VII and VIII. In plate VI, figure I, a view from above was given of the co\u00f6ssified nasals shown in side and front view in plate VIII, and belonging to the cranium mentioned above. Through an error in the explanation of plate VI, these nasals (fig. 1) were ascribed to *Menodus americanus*, Leidy, instead of to *Menodus angustigenis*. This error has been repeated in Professor H.

It is the most perfect lower jaw obtained so far from this locality, and is the type of the above named species.\n\nThe specimen consists of both halves of the jaw. The left ramus is perfect, with the full number of teeth preserved; the right ramus lacks the fourth premolar, and the molars, with that part of the alveolar border that held these teeth.\n\nThe mandible is of fair size, and belonged to an adult individual. It presents the following dental formula: $I_3$, $C_1$, $P_4$, $M_3$. There is a diastema behind the canine, a character which, taken in conjunction with the presence of three incisors and four premolars, is indicative of a somewhat primitive species. The chief characters displayed are: incisors, in three pairs, with a space between the inner pair; canines, of small diameter, apparently short; a diastema between the canine and the first premolar; first premolar, small; third premolar, becoming molariform, fourth premolar, molariform; symphysial surface between canines, narrow; jaw contracted at the diastema; external cingula, moderately developed; internal cingula, wanting; mental foramen, beneath the second premolar; coronoid process, short.\n\n*Megacerops avus* (Marsh), from the Oligocene of South Dakota, has three pairs of inferior incisors but only three premolars below on each side, and there is a short diastema behind the lower canine. Its dimensions are greater than those of *M. primitivus*. These two species are apparently the only ones of the Oligocene Titanotheres in which there are three pairs of incisors in the lower jaw.\n\nIn the Cypress Hills specimen the crowns of the incisors are of a depressed spherical shape, with a tendency to come to a rounded central point above. The second incisor is the largest, and the first is slightly smaller than the third, which is the most upright. The first is more procumbent than the second. Between the inner pair is a very decided interval, leaving a space of 6\u00b75 mm. between the crowns of the two teeth. The crowns of the canines...\nare broken off (that of the right tooth being restored in fig. 5 of plate VI), and the right first premolar is lost from its alveolus.\n\nCompared with *Megacerops angustigenis* (Cope), (this volume part I, p. 13, plate V, fig. 2 and plate VI, figs. 2, 2a, *M. primitivus* differs in the following respects:\u2014 There are six incisors instead of four, and the breadth of the jaw between the canines, which are of smaller diameter, is relatively greater; the diastema between the canine and the first premolar is twice as long; the symphysis is of greater length, reaching back to a point almost in line with the posterior edge of the fourth premolar (in *angustigenis* in line with the anterior root of the corresponding tooth); the exterior cingula are much less developed; the coronoid process is shorter. In both species the premolars have reached about the same stage of development toward the molar pattern, and the molars have very much the same proportions. In *angustigenis* the internal cingula are partially developed. In *primitivus* the mandible is shorter, proportionately deeper, and not so thick in the neighbourhood of the alveolar border posteriorly.\n\nKeeping in mind the differences due to sex in Titanotheres generally, and the apparent variability, both specific and individual, of certain dental characters, such as the degree of development of the cingula, the presence or absence of the first premolar, the size of the canines, and the number of the incisors, *M. primitivus* is apparently a well marked species, characterized principally, so far as known at present, by the breadth of the mandible anteriorly (as compared with *M. angustigenis*), and the presence of the full number of teeth, with a comparatively long diastema behind the canines.\n\nThis species, for which the name *primitivus* is used, is regarded as representing a rather early stage in the development of the Titanotheres. The general character of the dentition suggests the appropriateness of referring the species to the genus *Megacerops*. That the species is already represented by cranial fragments from the Cypress hills, found separately, is quite possible, and further material will probably prove the identity of some of the species, from this locality, described under different names.\n\n**Measurements of mandible of *M. primitivus***\n\n| Measurement                                      | MM |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Length of ramus                                   | 475|\n| Depth of same at posterior end of fourth premolar | 74 |\n| \" \" second molar                                 | 81 |\n| \" \" from tip of coronoid process to lower border | 247|\n| Maximum thickness of same beneath third molar    | 46 |\n| Length of symphysis                               | 144|\n| Distance apart of inside surface of base of canines* | 31 |\n| Length of premolar series                        | 103|\n| \" molar series                                    | 183|\n| Diameter of canines at base                       |    |\n| antero-posterior                                  | 18 |\n| transverse                                       | 16 |\n| Diameter of second premolar                      |    |\n| antero-posterior                                  | 26 |\n| transverse                                       | 18 |\n| Diameter of third premolar                       |    |\n| antero-posterior                                  | 32 |\n| transverse                                       | 23 |\n| Diameter of fourth** premolar                    |    |\n| antero-posterior                                  | 35 |\n| transverse                                       | 27 |\n\n* In the mandible of *M. angustigenis* (No. II) figured by Cope, op. cit., this measurement is about 18 mm., and in the symphysis of the jaw (No. I, also figured) a like measurement given, by the same authority, as 27 mm., should read 22 mm.\n\n** First premolar in Cope's description of *M. angustigenis*,\nDiameter of first molar... { antero-posterior ........................................ 48\n                           transverse .............................................. 29\n\nDiameter of second molar... { antero-posterior ........................................ 58\n                             transverse .............................................. 33\n\nDiameter of third molar... { antero-posterior ........................................ 82\n                            transverse .............................................. 33\n\nMegacerops assiniboiensis.

In this specimen the three molars and the fourth premolar are preserved, with the roots of the third premolar. The posterior end of the ramus is missing, as well as the anterior end in advance of the third premolar. A part of the right ramus next to the symphysis remains.\n\nThe jaw is much deeper, thicker and relatively shorter than in *angustigenis* and *primitivus*, and the teeth are much larger than in these species. It is narrow anteriorly, and the symphysis extends back to a point in line with the division between the fourth premolar and the first molar. The bone is massive and heavy throughout. The mental foramen is placed beneath the posterior root of the third premolar, farther back than in *M. primitivus*.\n\nThe cingula are very slightly developed. The external cingulum is present for a short distance only, on the anterior face of each of the four teeth, and in the third molar in advance of the heel. The only trace of an internal cingulum is to be seen in the third molar on the posterior slope of the heel.\n\nThe fourth premolar is fully molariform. The teeth are stout, and of about the size of the corresponding ones in *M. marshi*, Osborn, but the jaw is relatively shorter than in this species.\n\nFrom the material available, the species, for which the provisional name *assiniboiensis* is proposed, cannot be definitely characterized.\n\n**Measurements of ramus.

The specimen includes the bases of the horns which are seen to have been placed far forward and some distance apart. The horns apparently pointed laterally outward and upward, as in *M. angustigenis* and *M. coloradensis*, but were much farther forward than in either of these species. These nasals are entirely different from those of *M. selwynianus*, and *M. syceras*; they are short, thick, and broadly obtuse in front where they are but slightly bent downward. The front and lateral margins are thick and rounded, and the former is deeply notched in the middle. The lower surface is, as a whole, shallowly concave, a low longitudinal median ridge marking the line of union of the two bores. The concave surface between the horn bases is shallowly and evenly curved. The horns at the base appear to have been longitudinally oval in transverse section, but a definite statement in this regard cannot be made, as the horn bases are imperfect posteriorly. The specimen is, on the line of co\u00f6ssification of the two bones, 70 mm. back from the front margin, 44 mm. thick.\n\nThe shortness and general robustness of the nasals, with like characters noticeable in the proportions of the above ramus, makes it appear probable that these specimens represent a single species.\n\n**FIG. 12**\n\n![Image](image)\n\n**FIG. 13**\n\n![Image](image)\n\nCo\u00f6ssified nasals of *Megacerops assimilis*, fig. 12 superior aspect, fig. 13 left lateral aspect. One-fourth the natural size.\n\nThe two species, *angustigenis* and *syceras*, have the general form of horn found in the type of the genus *Megacerops*, viz., *M. coloradensis*, Leidy. In the other three species from the Cypress hills the horns are not known. In four of the five species, however, the nasals are known and show a wide variation in shape, all differing from those of the type.\nA comparison of the nasals and horns of *M. coloradensis*, with those of Cypress Hills species, is set forth in the table given below:\n\n| Nasals | Horns |\n|--------|-------|\n| **M. selwynianus.** | Long and narrow, obtusely rounded in front, under surface deeply excavated, lateral margins produced downward. | Unknown; probably short. |\n| **M. angustigenis.** | Thick and rather long, expanded anteriorly, front margin very obtusely pointed, under surface moderately excavated. | Short, far apart, flattened at base on anterior outer surface, and cylindrical above, directed decidedly outward. |\n| **M. coloradensis.** | Of moderate length, thin and bent downward anteriorly. | Of moderate length, cylindrical above, flattened on posterior outer surface at base, directed obliquely outward and upward. |\n| **M. syceras.** | Rather short, evenly rounded in front, stout, shallowly excavated beneath. | Lengthening, close together and upright, more rounded in section near base than in *M. angustigenis*. |\n| **M. assiniboiensis.** | Very short and thick, ending squarely in front, under surface only slightly concave. | Placed very far forward and rather far apart; probably long. |\n\nA series seems to be represented here with *selwynianus* and *assiniboiensis* as extreme forms, and *coloradensis* occupying an intermediate position. Compared with the type species, *selwynianus* has long and narrow nasals, whilst those of *assiniboiensis* are broad and very short. In *angustigenis* the nasals are rather long and the horns short. In *syceras* the reverse is the case, the nasals are rather short and the horns are lengthened. *Coloradensis* has both nasals and horns of medium length. A lengthening of the horns appears to have accompanied a shortening of the nasals, and it is probable that *selwynianus* had short horns and *assiniboiensis* long ones. *Selwynianus*, *primitivus* and *assiniboiensis* are, for the present, referred to the genus *Megacerops*.\n\nA portion of a right maxilla, holding the second, third and fourth premolars, and a separate left horn, are mentioned by Cope in the first part of this volume, under the name *Menodus americanus* (Leidy), dimensions and figures of the horn being given. Two separate horns, also belonging to the Cypress Hills collection of 1884, were referred by the same author in the same publication to *Menodus proutii* (O. N. and E.). These two species are not determinate, and the specimens referred by Cope to them do not present characters sufficient for their identification with described forms. The horns evidently represent two species distinct from *Megacerops angustigenis* and *M. syceras*. It is possible that, with the advent of new material, they may be found to be assignable to two of the other three species of *Megacerops* from the Cypress hills, viz., *M. selwynianus*, *M. assiniboiensis* and *M. primitivus*, of which the horns are not known.\nChalicotherium bilobatum, Cope, 1889.

The species from the Oligocene or Lower Miocene of the Cypress hills; Geol. Survey of Canada, Contr. to Can. Pal\u00e6ont., vol. III, (quarto), pt. I, p. 8.\n\nThe type specimen of this species has been described and figured by Cope in part I of this volume. It consists of the co\u00f6ssified anterior ends of the mandibular rami, of which the left is preserved backward a short distance beyond the posterior end of the symphysis, and displays the alveoli of the second, third and fourth premolars, and of the first molar, with part of that of the second molar. In advance of the second premolar are the remains of alveoli for the canine, and three incisors. The bone is here slightly abraded, the alveoli appearing as distinct but shallow depressions. Of those for the incisors, the first or innermost is the largest and deepest, and the third is the least distinct. That for the canine is narrow transversely and twice as long as wide. A smooth surface to the bone passes outward between the second premolar and the canine, representing a narrow diastema. It is probable that the canine and incisor teeth were not present in the adult animal. There is no indication of a first premolar. The roots of the three premolars are partially preserved.\n\nIn his observations on the genus, following the specific description in the American Naturalist (p. 152), Professor Cope proposed the order Ancylopoda for the reception of the two genera Chalicotherium and Ancylotherium. These remarks, which do not appear in the Contributions to Canadian Pal\u00e6ontology, were as follows:\n\n\"Although this is the first announcement of the discovery of the genus Chalicotherium in America, it is not the first discovery. Professor Scott showed me a series of superior molars from the Loup Fork formation of Kansas, from the Agassiz Museum, which he identified as belonging to this genus. The present species is of larger size than the Kansas form, and is apparently equal to the C. goldfussi of the Upper Miocene of Europe. The occurrence of this form in the Lower Miocene (White River), as well as the Upper Miocene (Loup Fork), of this country, is a noteworthy fact, but is parallel to its history in Europe. Described from the Upper Miocene by Kaup, it was afterwards found in the Middle Miocene (C. grande) by Lartet, and in the Upper Eocene (C. modicum) by Gaudry.\"\n\n\"The remarkable character of this genus, as discovered by Filhol, has been already mentioned in the Naturalist.* It has little relation to the family of Perissodactyla, to which it has given the name, and which it so resembles in molar dentition. It must form a family by itself, and the genera with which it has been associated must form a family to which the name Lambdotheriidae may be applied. The anterior ungual phalanges of Chalicotherium are of prehensile character, and not ungulate, but rather unguiculate. The phalanges resemble those of the Edentata, but the carpus and tarsus are, according to Filhol, diplarthrous in structure, while the Edentata are taxeopodous. We have in the Chalicotheriidae the antithesis of the Condylarthra. While the latter is ungulate, with an unguiculate carpus and tarsus, the former is unguiculate, with an ungulate (diplarthrous) carpus and tarsus.\n\n* \"Osborn on Chalicotherium, 1888, p. 728.\"\nThus the Chalicotheriidae must be referred to a distinct order of ungulicate Mammalia, which I propose to call the Ancylopoda, with the above definition. Two genera belong to the single family, the Chalicotheriidae, viz., Chalicotherium Kaup, and Ancylotherium Gaudry. In the former, the phalanges are distinct; in the latter, the first and second are co\u00f6ssified (Lydekker). Marsh has not yet shown how his genus Moropus differs from Ancylotherium. The species described by Marsh under this name are from the Loup Fork bed of Kansas.\n\nA separate lower left premolar of a Chalicotheroid (collection of 1904) is probably referable to this species. The tooth (plate III, figs. 7, 8 and 9) is regarded as the third premolar, and has an antero-posterior diameter about equal to the space for the corresponding tooth, of which the roots are preserved, in the above (type) mandible. Professor W. B. Scott, of Princeton University, has kindly examined this specimen, and, although agreeing with the writer that it is the lower premolar of a Chalicotheroid, considers it unlikely \"that the genus Chalicotherium should be found in the Titanotherium beds, for that genus is typical of the Middle and Upper Miocene of Europe.\" He is of the opinion that \"much more probably the species of Cope will prove to be referable to one of the genera of the French Oligocene, such as Schizotherium.\"\n\nThe Cypress Hills species needs to be studied from better material before its true generic affinity can be determined.\n\nRODENTIA.\n\nSciurus? saskatchewanensis, sp. nov.\n\nPlate VIII, figs. 16, 17.\n\nA species of rodent, most nearly allied apparently to Sciurus, is represented by a molar tooth. As enough characters are not supplied by the single tooth for the proper definition of the undescribed genus seemingly indicated, a provisional reference to Sciurus is made for the present. The species is described as new.\n\nThe tooth is apparently an upper left molar. The crown, which is borne on three roots, is subquadangular in outline as seen from below, with the antero-posterior diameter slightly less than the transverse diameter. The maximum antero-posterior measurement (length) is near the outer side. Of the three roots, one is internal and is much the largest, the other two are external and subequal. The height of the enamelled surface of the crown is twice as great internally as externally.\n\nThe tooth is only slightly worn. The pattern consists of an external median enamel inflexion, extending inward nearly across the crown, and two fossettes, one anterior, the other posterior. The enamel inflexion has a depth greater than half the height of the external face of the crown but the two fossettes are not so deep. Of these latter, the posterior one is the larger and is complete, the anterior one is closed outwardly but communicates inwardly with the median inflexion. A narrow marginal ridge is continuous round the crown except where it is interrupted by the external enamel inflexion. This ridge is most prominent internally, anteriorly and posteriorly it sinks to a lower level, rising again to enclose the fossettes externally.\nThe inner face of the crown is not strongly tumid as in *Sciurus* typically, but approaches the marginal ridge as a moderately convex slope, in contrast to the other faces, which contract toward the base. The anterior cross crest is formed of two distinct cusps, recalling the subdivision of the crests described by Matthew in *Sciurus (Prosciurus) vetustus*. A minute style occurs in the marginal ridge external to the posterior fossette, breaking the continuity of the ridge to a slight extent. No style is present at the outlet of the median enamel inflexion.\n\nFrom the above description it will be seen that the tooth pattern implies a near approach to *Sciurus*, but the radical differences apparent preclude its definite reference to that genus. The comparative prominence of the marginal ridge in front and behind is probably a primitive character.\n\nMeasurements of crown of type specimen:\u2014Antero-posterior, 2\u00b730 mm., transverse diameter, 2\u00b770 mm.\n\nLocality:\u2014Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, Saskatchewan.\n\n**Ischyromys typus**, Leidy.\n\nPlate VIII, fig. 18.\n\nA slightly worn molar is referred to this species described, originally, in 1856, from the Oligocene of Nebraska. The Cypress Hills tooth is apparently a second lower molar from the right side, and was mentioned in the writer's preliminary list of species contained in the 1904 collection (Summary Report for 1905) as probably referable to this species. Its tooth pattern agrees fairly well with that of the corresponding tooth, figured by Leidy, in his \"Extinct Mammalian Fauna of Dakota and Nebraska,\" 1869, pl. XXVI. In size the Cypress Hills tooth is slightly smaller. The antero-posterior diameter of the crown measures 3 mm. and is about equal to the transverse diameter.\n\nBone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills.

The variation of the tooth-pattern through wear has been worked out by Matthew from a series of lower jaws, and an upper jaw, from the same locality.\n\nIn the writer's provisional list of the fauna of the Oligocene beds of Cypress hills, as represented by the collection of 1904, part of a left mandibular ramus was referred to a species of *Steneofiber* distinct from *S. nebrascensis*, Leidy. This specimen is now seen to be properly referable to *Cylindrodon fontis*, Douglass.\n\n---\n\n*The Fauna of the Titanotherium beds at Pipestone Springs, Montana, 1903.*\nThe Cypress Hills fragment of lower jaw is from the middle of the left ramus, and holds one tooth, the first molar. Anterior to the tooth is part of the alveolus for the fourth premolar, and behind it the alveolus for the second molar, and the remains of that for the posterior or third molar. The tooth is only moderately worn, and has reached the stage of wear shown by Matthew in his figure 8 B. Of the three fossettes in the worn surface of the crown, the anterior one is closed internally, a slight inflexion of the enamel remains to the posterior one, but there is still a very decided inflexion to the median one. When further worn the posterior fossette becomes complete internally, and later the median one also. The crown of this molar measures, antero-posteriorly 2\u00b725 mm., transversely 2\u00b720 mm. The full depth of the ramus is not preserved, but enough of the bone remains to show that the jaw was deep.\n\nMatthew places the species with some doubt in the Castoridae. It is interesting to find this small species included in the 1904 collection, thereby adding to the number of species common to the faunas of the Cypress Hills and Pipestone Springs Oligocene beds.\n\nLocality:\u2014Bone coul\u00e9e, Cypress hills, Province of Saskatchewan.\n\n**Eutypomys parvus**, Sp. nov.\n\nPlate VI, figs. 1 and 2.\n\nA single molar represents this species. In the Summary Report of the Geological Survey for the year 1904, the writer specially mentioned this tooth as being worthy of notice on account of the large number of isolated enamel loops or lakes present in the worn surface of the crown, and in a foot-note, added whilst the report was being printed, the opinion was expressed that it was probably referable to Matthew's then newly established genus *Eutypomys*.\n\nThe Cypress Hills tooth, thought to be the lower third molar of the left side of the jaw, closely resembles, in tooth pattern, the teeth of *E. thomsoni*, Matthew, the type species of the genus* from the Oligocene (Lower Oreodon beds of the White River formation, Cheyenne river) of South Dakota. It is considerably smaller than the lower teeth of the type, and indicates a proportionately smaller animal.\n\nSeen from above the crown is subtriangular in outline, the transverse diameter in front being greater than behind; the antero-posterior diameter exceeds the maximum transverse diameter. A view of the worn surface of the crown is given in plate VI, figure 2, in which are shown the numerous isolated lakes characteristic of the genus. In all about twenty lakes are seen. The tooth is constricted behind its mid-length exteriorly, the crown being well rounded and tumid on each side of the constriction or valley, in which are three or four shallow infoldings of the enamel below the level of the worn surface. On the inside, at mid-length, the crown is slightly inflected above, but the decided constriction of the external surface is wanting. The tooth is two rooted, the anterior fang being much the stouter of the two. The anterior surface of the crown is flattened, and has the appearance of having been preceded by a tooth in front. Posteriorly, however, the surface is rounded, as if no tooth pressed against it from behind; these considerations, together with the somewhat triangular shape of the tooth, suggest its being the last of the series.\n\n---\n\n*Notice of two new genera of Mammals from the Oligocene of South Dakota; Bulletin Amer.

XIV, figs. 9, 9a), to this species. The specimen lacks the upper part of the anterior lobe of P\u2082 and the upper end of the incisor. The posterior molar is missing, but its approximate size is given by its alveolus. The other lower teeth are perfect.\n\nComparing the specimen with the rami of this species figured by Cope, in his \"Tertiary Vertebrae,\" 1884, pl. LXVII, it is seen that the space occupied by the molar-premolar series is slightly greater, but the depth of the jaw is the same, as is also the size of the diastema behind the incisor. The teeth appear to have the same relative size to each other, and the internal enamel inflexion, apparently, has a like development. Matthew has placed this specimen, described by Cope in 1891, in his species *P. brachyodon* (op. cit., 1903, p. 217) which is of the size of *P. turgidus*, but differs from it, as the name implies, by being more brachydont. Other characters ascribed to *P. brachyodon* as distinguishing it from *P. turgidus* are \u2014\u2014 P\u2082 smaller and more conical, m\u00b3 apparently larger, the internal enamel inflexion less persistent.

These distinguishing characters are not apparent, to the writer, in the Cypress Hills specimen, which is here left under Cope's name.\n\nMeasurements of Cypress Hills specimen\n\n| Measurement                          | MM |\n|-------------------------------------|----|\n| Molar-premolar series               | 18\u00b70|\n| Third premolar:                     |    |\n| Antero-posterior diameter           | 3\u00b74|\n| Transverse \"                        | 2\u00b74|\n| Height above alveolar rim           | 5+ |\n| Posterior molar:                    |    |\n| Antero-posterior diameter           | 2\u00b78|\n| Transverse \"                        | 2  |\n| Length of diastema behind incisor   | 11\u00b72|\n| Depth of ramus beneath P\u2084           | 9\u00b78|\n\n**Palaeolagus haydeni**, Leidy.\n\nPlate VIII, figs. 21-25.\n\nAnother species of *Palaeolagus*, distinct from the preceding, is represented by teeth, from both jaws, included in the collection of 1904. These teeth agree in size with those of *P. haydeni*, the type species of the genus (Oligocene (White River) of Nebraska, South Dakota, &c.), established by Leidy in 1856; they are for the present referred to that species. On plate VIII, are figured three of these teeth, an upper premolar, an upper molar, and a lower molar, from which the following measurements are taken:\u2014\nMeasurements.\n\nUpper left premolar, ? fourth premolar (plate VIII, figs. 22 and 23) :\n- Antero-posterior diameter of grinding surface ........................................... 2\u00b70\n- Transverse diameter of grinding surface .................................................. 2\u00b78\n\nUpper right molar, ? first molar (plate VIII, fig. 21) :\n- Antero-posterior diameter of grinding surface ........................................... 2\u00b70\n- Transverse diameter of grinding surface .................................................. 2\u00b76\n\nLower right molar (plate VIII, figs. 24 and 25) :\n- Antero-posterior diameter of tooth above ............................................... 2\u00b73\n- Transverse diameter of anterior lobe above ............................................. 2\u00b72\n\nIt is likely that more than two species of *Palaeolagus* are represented from the Cypress hills. Among the separate teeth, obtained in 1904, are a number of incisors of rodents, some of which are probably referable to *Palaeolagus*.\n\nCARNIVORA.\n\n*Hy\u00e6nodon cruentus*, Leidy.\n\nPlate VII, 1, 2 and 3.\n\n*Hy\u00e6nodon cruentus*, Leidy, 1853.

The alveolus of the canine indicates that the tooth was of large size, directed well upward, and oval in transverse section, with its greatest diameter in an antero-posterior direction. The first premolar, as shown by its alveolus, was single rooted, and followed closely behind the canine. The roots of the first and second premolars passed downward obliquely backward, those of the third and fourth as obliquely forward. The first molar was of small size, its antero-posterior diameter being about equal to that of the second premolar.\n\nAlthough the crowns of the teeth are missing in the Cypress Hills specimen, it is apparently properly referable to *H. cruentus*, Leidy, from the Oligocene of South Dakota and Colorado, judging from its size and general proportions, and the relative spaces occupied by the teeth, in comparison with the published figures of Leidy and Scott.\n\nThe anterior end of the specimen, inside the alveolus for the canine, is broken away, and no trace of the alveoli for the incisors is preserved. Following the plane of the symphysis forward, however, it is seen that there could have been little room for the incisors, which must have been crowded. At the symphysis a small piece of bone, belonging to the right ramus, remains attached to the specimen, and, along the line of junction, indicates a\nrather thorough co\u00f6ssification of the two rami. The hinder end of the symphysis is in line with the front root of the third premolar. Two mental foramina are present, the larger of the two beneath the anterior root of the third premolar, the other beneath a point slightly in advance of the second premolar.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n| Measurement                                      | MM |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Length of specimen                               | 89 |\n| Length of premolar series                        | 54 |\n| 1st premolar                                     | 4  |\n| 2nd \"                                            | 11 |\n| 3rd \"                                            | 15\u00b75|\n| 4th \"                                            | 16 |\n| 1st molar                                        | 11 |\n| Antero-posterior diameter of alveolus of canine  | 10 |\n| Transverse diameter of same, approx              | 7  |\n| Space between alveoli of canine and 1st premolar | 3  |\n| \" \" 1st and 2nd premolar                         | 3\u00b75|\n| Depth of ramus at point between 4th premolar and 1st molar | 34 |\n| Depth of ramus at mid-height beneath same point  | 12 |\n| Thickness of ramus at posterior end of symphysis | 16 |\n\nCollector T.

Headwaters of Swift-current creek (Bone coul\u00e9e), Cypress hills, 1888.\n\nA left lower tooth, found separately in 1904, plate VII, fig. 3, has the proportions of the second premolar of *Hy\u00e6nodon*. The alveoli (containing roots) of the second premolar of the left ramus, mentioned above and referred to *H. cruentus*, indicate by their size that this separate tooth is probably referable to this species.\n\n**Hy\u00e6nodon crucians?

The tooth is not quite as large as the corresponding premolar of *H. crucians*, as described and figured by Leidy in 1869 in \u201cThe Extinct Mammalian Fauna of Dakota and Nebraska\u201d*, but approaches closely to it in shape; it is referred to this species provisionally.\n\nIn the Cypress Hills tooth the protocone is large and compressed, the tritocone (posterior cusp) is small and slightly trenchant, the deutocone (interior cusp) is fairly developed on the inner side in line with the protocone. There is an inconspicuous protostyle (anterior basal cusp) and exteriorly, at the mid-length of the crown, the basal cingulum is feebly developed.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n| Measurement                                      | MM |\n|--------------------------------------------------|----|\n| Max. height of crown of tooth                    | 8\u00b72|\n| \" length \"                                       | 10\u00b716|\n| \" breadth \"                                      | 7\u00b78 |\n\nThe specimen represents a species of about the same size as *H. crucians*, Leidy, but possibly distinct.\n\n---\n\n* The extinct mammalian fauna of Dakota and Nebraska.

II.\n\nThe material on which this genus and species were established consists of a right mandibular ramus, a complete and well preserved right femur, and a left femur, of slightly smaller size, from which the distal end is missing. Cope's full description, with figures, is given in part I of this volume.\n\n*Hemipsalodon* is the representative, in North America, of the European Upper Eocene Pterodon. It differs from the latter in the form of the enlarged posterior lower true molar.\n\nAmong the characters of *H. grandis*, which is the largest of all known creodonts, are to be noticed the great depth of the mandible, the length of the symphysis, and the immense size of the canine, which so crowds the incisors that the second of these teeth is behind the other two. The symphysis reaches back to a point nearly below the middle of the fourth premolar.\n\nThrough an error, in printing probably, the length of the premolar series is given, in the description on p. 6, of part I, of this volume, as 108 mm. This measurement should read 87 mm.\n\nIn the 1904 collection from the typical locality is a large canine tooth, plate VII, figs. 7 and 8, that apparently belongs to this species. Its dimensions, at the point of greatest thickness, agree with those of the canine in the type specimen. In this separate tooth the upper part of the crown is broken off, but the whole of the root is preserved, giving a length to the specimen of 111 mm., with an estimated total length to the tooth, when perfect, of about 129 mm.\n\nCYNODICTIS LIPPINCOTTIANUS (Cope).\n\nPlate VII, figs. 9\u201314.\n\nThere are in the collection of 1904 four teeth that apparently belong to this species, of which Cope was uncertain as to whether it was distinct from, or only a large variety of *C. gregarius* (Cope), one of the commonest of the White River (Oligocene) carnivores described from Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota.\n\nThe teeth from the Cypress hills were obtained separately, and agree in size most closely with those described by Cope under the name *Galecynus lippincottianus* (see Cope's Tertiary Vertebrata, vol. III, book I, 1884, p. 919, pl. LXVIIa). They are, a left lower third premolar, a left lower fourth premolar, and a right lower first molar of which the anterior cusp is missing. Another tooth, slightly damaged, from the left side, is apparently a lower fourth premolar.\nDaph\u00e6nus felinus, Scott.\n\nPlate VII, figs. 15 and 16.\n\n*Daph\u00e6nus felinus*, Scott, 1898. Notes on the Canid\u00e6 of the White River Oligocene; Trans. Amer. Philos. Soc., vol. XIX, p. 361.\n\nThe hinder part of a right maxilla, in which is preserved the sectorial tooth, is referred to this species with a certain amount of doubt. The specimen includes the alveoli of the third premolar and of the three molars.\n\nIn his \"Oligocene Canid\u00e6,\" Hatcher* has made known the complete dentition of this species, from excellent material from the Oreodon beds of Bad Lands creek, Sioux county, Nebraska. In comparing the dentition of the Cypress Hills specimen, so far as its incompleteness will admit, with that of the species as set forth by Hatcher in his description and figures (plates XIV and XVI) it is seen that there is a fair agreement in the size of the sectorial (fourth premolar), and the space occupied by the teeth from the third premolar to the second molar, both inclusive, is almost the same, giving about a corresponding size to the third premolar, and the first and second molar teeth. A difference is noted in the position of the alveolus of the third molar, which is placed farther outward in the Canadian specimen, being in line rather with the exterior borders of the first and second molars than with the inner margins of the same as shown by Hatcher. The alveolus of the third molar is very close to the hinder border of the second molar, and indicates a greater crowding of these teeth, with a probably smaller antero-posterior diameter to the second molar. There seems also to have been a greater backward obliquity to the outer border of the second molar. In the sectorial tooth of the Cypress Hills specimen the antero-internal cusp (deuterocone) is longer and narrower, and is directed more forward, so as to form with the base of the external cone a decided fork, into which the posterior border of the third premolar fitted closely. The deuterocone has a slightly convex upper surface (within the cingulum), on which is developed a distinct longitudinal median ridge. The antero-external cone (protocone) and the posterior cone (tritocone) apparently agree well with the corresponding parts of the sectorial of the Nebraska skull. A basal cingulum is present; it is moderately developed internally, and includes the anterior border of the deuterocone, but is rather weak externally.\n\nHatcher (op. cit., p. 67) has drawn attention to the difference in the position of the upper third molar relative to the two preceding molars in the genera *Amphicyon* and *Daph\u00e6nus*. His remarks appeared as follows:\u2014\"The chief generic distinctions between *Daph\u00e6nus*, Leidy, and *Amphicyon*, Lartet, in so far as they are at present known, are to be found in the relative size of the premolars, structure of canines, and position of the superior third tubercular molar. The canines of *Daph\u00e6nus* are without either anterior or posterior cutting edges, while these are present in *Amphicyon*. The premolars are reduced in size in *Amphicyon*, while those of *Daph\u00e6nus* show little or no reduction. In *Daph\u00e6nus* the superior third tubercular molar is pushed inward and aligned with the internal cones of the preceding molars, while in *Amphicyon* this tooth occupies a more external position.\"\n\nIn the Cypress Hills specimen (1) the canine is not preserved, so that a comparison cannot be made in this connexion, (2) the fourth premolar at least is not reduced in size (*Daph\u00e6nus*), and (3) the third molar is in line with the external cones of the preceding molar (*Amphicyon*).\n\n*Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh, vol. I, No. 2, Sept., 1902.*\nFrom this it appears that the Canadian specimen combines characters that, according to Hatcher, belong to both of the above genera.\n\nThe Cypress Hills specimen represents an animal of about the size of *D. felinus*, and it is provisionally referred to that species, although there is not an exact agreement in the form of the sectorial, and although a difference is noticed in the alignment of the molars. The incompleteness of the specimen precludes a satisfactory comparison.\n\nLocality:\u2014eastern escarpment of the Cypress hills, nine miles due east of Bone coul\u00e9e. Lawrence Lambe, 1904.\n\n**Protemnocyon hartshornianus** (Cope).\n\nPlate VII, figs. 17, 18, 19 and 20.\n\nA left upper fourth premolar (sectorial), belonging to the collection of 1904, is referred to this species. The tooth, from which the inner anterior cusp (deuterocone) has been broken off, is well worn, and probably belonged to an old individual.\n\nThis species is known from rather meagre material from the Oligocene of Colorado and South Dakota. Cope has referred to his species *Amphicyon harlshornianus* certain fragments of jaws, holding teeth, that Leidy, in his memoir on \"The Extinct Mammalian Fauna of Dakota and Nebraska,\" 1869, included in his description of *Amphicyon vetus* (p. 32, pl. I, figs. 3, 4 and 6). The superior sectorial, obtained in 1904 from the Cypress hills, agrees very closely in size and form (without considering the inner anterior cusp which is missing in our specimen) with the sectorial shown by Leidy in his figure 6.\n\nA second upper sectorial, also from the left side, obtained from the Cypress Hills locality by Mr. T. C. Weston in 1884, may belong to this species. It is slightly smaller than the 1904 specimen but is otherwise very similar. The protocone is robust and has a broad anterior face; posteriorly it narrows to a sharp, steep edge directed obliquely inward. The tritocone is compressed laterally and forms a good cutting edge. The deuterocone is of fair size and is well detached from the base of the protocone. A distinct cingulum encircles the entire base of the crown. The posterior root is laterally compressed, its antero-posterior diameter proximally greatly exceeding the transverse one. The root supporting the deuterocone is likewise compressed, but to a less extent.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n| Sectorial of 1884; plate VII, figs. 18, 19 and 20: | MM. |\n|--------------------------------------------------|-----|\n| Length from posterior end to antero-external base of protocone | 12\u00b75 |\n| Length from posterior end to antero-internal base of protocone | 13\u00b70 |\n| Breadth anteriorly at base of protocone | 7\u00b72 |\n| Height of protocone, including cingulum | 8\u00b75 |\n\n| Sectorial of 1904; plate VII, fig. 17: | MM. |\n|--------------------------------------|-----|\n| External length | 12\u00b70 |\n| Internal length | 13\u00b76 |\n| Breadth anteriorly | 7\u00b72 |\n| Breadth anteriorly at base of protocone | 6\u00b73 |\n| Height of protocone, including cingulum | 8\u00b72 |\n\n*1884.

V, figs. 1-4.\n\nA right lower first molar, belonging to the 1904 collection, is referred to this species. The three figures of it in plate VII will give a fair idea of its proportions. The two large cusps, the principal one and the smaller anterior one, together form an admirable cutting edge. The posterior cusp or heel is well developed, trenchant and larger than the heel of the corresponding tooth in *Hoplophoneus*. A small postero-internal cusp is present, high on the posterior border of the principal cusp. There is also a very small anterior basal cusp or tubercle. The tooth has not been subjected to much wear, and its cutting edges are, throughout, slightly denticulated.\n\nAnother tooth, fig 24, an upper canine, probably also belongs to this species. It curves slightly backward and ends below in a moderately sharp point. In transverse section above it is narrowly elliptical. The posterior border is denticulated and sharper than the anterior one on which no denticles are seen. The surface of the specimen is weathered. Length (imperfect above), 28\u00b75 mm.; max. antero-posterior diameter, 14 mm.; max. transverse diameter, 8 mm.\n\n---\n\n*Oligocene Canidae. Memoirs of the Carnegie Museum, vol.

Since the publication, in 1851, of Dr. Charles T. Jackson's descriptions of Albert mine fishes, this particular fauna has not received the attention that it deserves. A thorough knowledge of the character and structure of the various species represented is of importance, as an aid in the determination of geological horizons in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.\n\nIn the following pages will be found the results of a study, by Mr. Lawrence M. Lambe, of the Albert shales fish fauna, based on the large collections of specimens from the typical locality and its neighbourhood, in the possession of the Geological Survey, and on type material and well preserved specimens from the same localities kindly loaned by the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass.; the Boston Society of Natural History; McGill University; and the Natural History Society of New Brunswick.\n\nMr. Lambe's memoir forms part V of volume III (quarto) of 38 pages of text with eleven full-sized photogravure plates.\n\n(Signed) R.

LAMBE\n\nVertebrate Pal\u00e6ontologist.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nALBERT SHALES\u2014AREA\u2014GENERAL CHARACTER\u2014MODE OF OCCURRENCE, ETC.\n\nThe highly bituminous, calcareous shales of New Brunswick, as developed in Albert and Westmorland counties, and known as the Albert shales, can be traced from about two miles west of Elgin Corner, across Albert county in a northeasterly direction, to the Memramcook river, at Taylorville, in Westmorland county, a distance of a little over thirty miles. Throughout this distance they are not continuously exposed, and in Albert county their breadth is seldom seen to exceed half a mile; in Westmorland county their exposed breadth is greater. Slight changes in the physical characters of the beds are found at different localities, and sandy layers and dolomitic-looking limestone are occasionally introduced as thin bands. The shales and sandy layers are bituminous throughout, in a varying degree according to locality.\n\nAssociated with the Albert shales, and lying conformably beneath them, are greenish-grey conglomerates, the whole having an estimated thickness of about 1,000 feet. The shales are of a dark grey and brown colour, and are sometimes much disturbed, being in places faulted and inclined at high angles. They are generally overlaid unconformably by massive beds of dark coloured conglomerate, associated with sandstone.\n\nAt Albert Mines and vicinity, certain layers of the shales are replete with the remains of fishes of the family Pal\u00e6oniscidae. These fish-bearing beds consist for the most part of brown to dark grey shales, of which the brown generally split very readily into thin sheets, and brownish black oil bands, attaining a thickness sometimes of 5 or 6 feet. These latter, on account of their richness in oil and sulphate of ammonia, are attracting considerable attention at the present time, commercially. In this connexion the reader is referred to the report of Dr. R. W. Ells (21), lately published, on the oil-shale industry of Scotland, where similar beds occur, and the very favourable conditions existing in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for the establishment of a like\nindustry in eastern Canada. Dr. Ells expresses the opinion, \"that in general character and value, the shales of New Brunswick\u2014both as regards the products of crude oil and sulphate of ammonia obtained therefrom\u2014compare favourably, and in some cases undoubtedly surpass those distilled in Scotland.\"\n\nThe majority of the fish-remains in the Albert mines area come from the thinly splitting brown and grey shales; but excellently preserved specimens also occur in the thicker and darker layers, and some have been found in nodules.\n\nMr. R. D. Stewart (19) in \"The Chemistry of the Oil-Shales,\" part III of the memoir of the Geological Survey (Scotland), enters fully into the probable origin of kerogen, the term that has been applied to the carbonaceous matter in shale that gives rise to crude oil in distillation.\n\nHe points out that the carbonaceous matter, with clay, was probably deposited at the bottom of lagoons; and that vegetable matter, such as, for instance, pine-pollen, or lycopod-spores, or animal matter such as might be derived from entomostraca (of which some shales are largely made up), or, in fact, any kind of organic matter, may, through the action of microbes, have been converted into kerogen.\n\nHis conclusion is that \"oil-shale may be composed of (1) vegetable matter which has been made into a pulp by maceration in water and preserved by combining with the salts in solution; (2) richer materials of many kinds, such as spores, which nature has provided with means for some protection against decay; and (3) a proportion of animal matter.\"\n\nIt is probable that the waters in which lived the fishes about to be described, were cut off to a great extent from the sea, and formed the lagoons in which the material that produced the shales was deposited.\n\nThe numberless remains of fishes in some of the beds can be attributed only to the occasional wholesale destruction of the fishes.\n\nAny sudden or material change in the condition under which the fishes existed would result in loss of life. Such unfavourable conditions might be caused by the resumption of free communication between the lagoons and the open sea, or the lagoons may have felt the influence of drought, and have, at times, almost disappeared.\n\nThe appearance of the fishes in their fossilized state suggests differences in the conditions affecting them after death and prior to entombment in the vegetable mud forming the bottom.\n\nThe appearance of some seems to indicate that decomposition, to a greater or less extent, took place in the water, while others seem to have been desiccated prior to their entombment. Decomposition would result in an increase in the depth of the body, and, according to the lapse of time, a later partial or complete disintegration with a more or less scattered disposition of the remains; the majority of the fishes from the Albert shales have a disproportionate depth, although some are evidently but little distorted and give a nearly true outline of the body. The latter were probably soon enclosed in the muddy bottom, and thus escaped the action of\nthe air and water, before they had become much decomposed. Some specimens are long in proportion to their depth, and have every appearance of shrinkage and contraction, as if the fish had been thoroughly dried under a hot sun.\n\nThese differences in proportion are most noticeable in the large specimens (*Elonichthys browni*) from the Albert mines.\n\nIn most cases degrees of distortion, due to pressure during fossilization, supplement the earlier disfigurements.\n\n**Previous Work.**\n\nIn the Report of Progress for 1876\u201377, Geological Survey of Canada, 1878, the distribution and geological age of the Albert shales are discussed at length by Professor L. W. Bailey, and Dr. R. W. Ells, in their joint \"Report on the lower Carboniferous belt of Albert and Westmorland counties, N.B., including the Albert Shales.\" The general conclusion reached at that time, as to the geological age of the shales, was that they occupied an almost basal position in the lower Carboniferous formation, the lowest member being a conglomerate, of, at that time, unknown thickness. The presence of fossil fishes belonging to the *Palaeoniscidae* was relied on, in great measure, as an index to the age of these beds. Comment is made on the abundance of fishes, in marked contrast to the paucity of the plant remains, which were, however, considered to be referable to typical lower Carboniferous species (p. 357).\n\nIn 1880, an opinion was expressed by Professor Bailey and Drs. G. F. Matthew and R. W. Ells, in their \"Report on the Geology of Southern New Brunswick, etc.\" (Geological Survey of Canada, Report of Progress for 1878\u201379) p. 16 D, that \"Stratigraphically, the beds of Albert shales, as developed in Albert and Westmorland counties, may belong to a lower horizon than the Carboniferous, and may constitute an upper portion of the Devonian, but the prevailing fossils, both fishes and plants, seem to indicate a lower Carboniferous age.\"\n\nAt a later date in his \"Report on the Geological Formations of Eastern Albert and Westmorland counties in New Brunswick, etc.,\" (Vol. I, New Series, 1885), Dr. Ells retained the Albert shales in his divisions of the lower Carboniferous, recognized in New Brunswick next above a basal conglomerate, presumably about 200 feet in thickness (p. 33 E.) A general section of the lower Carboniferous rocks in this area is given, in ascending order, in this report as follows:\n\n1. Basal conglomerate, sometimes wanting; when present, usually of a dull greenish colour; made up mostly of slate fragments; thickness, presumably about 200 ft.\n2.

Red and grey conglomerates, grey and flaggy limestones and gypsum ........... 1,950 \"\nThe above reports are the principal ones of the Geological Survey in which the age of the Albert shales is discussed, prior to the publication, in 1903, of Dr. Ells' report on \"The Albert Shale Deposits of Albert and Westmorland Counties, N.B.\" (Summary Report of the Geological Survey Department for 1902,) in which the shales in question are definitely assigned to the upper Devonian (p. 361). Dr. Ells writes as follows: \"As to the geological position of the shales as a whole it may be remarked that somewhat diverse opinions have been held from time to time by different observers. Thus in the early days of their investigations it was supposed that they represented an integral portion of the lower Carboniferous formation. This conclusion was reached from the presence in certain bands of the shale of remains of fossil fishes and plants which were supposed to have a lower Carboniferous aspect and to definitely fix their horizon. The investigations made in 1876 showed that however true this might be, the mass of the shales themselves occupied a position entirely unconformable to the true lower Carboniferous sediments, associated with limestones and gypsum, and which are well defined throughout the area, and that with good reason they should, therefore, stratigraphically be assigned to a lower horizon, or regarded as of Devonian age.\"\n\nIn 1871, Sir J. William Dawson (6), in commenting on the great value of palaeontology to the \"practical man and theoretical geologist,\" remarked with truth that \"A simple characteristic fossil is often sufficient to determine the geological age of a formation, and the question of geological age is one that must be ascertained previous to any deductions whether as to the mineral contents or conditions of formation of strata.\" These remarks preceded reference to \"the disputes as to the Devonian or Carboniferous age of the celebrated deposit of Albertite at Hillsborough, New Brunswick.\" These and similar difficulties, Sir William adds, could have been readily settled by a reference to the evidence of fossil plants.\n\nSince these observations were made it has been generally conceded that the remains of vertebrate animals can be relied on to a greater extent than those of plants, and of members of the other divisions of the animal kingdom, as more exact horizon markers, since vertebrates are more susceptible to change in the process of evolution.\n\nThe Albert shale series and its equivalents, named by Dawson \"The Lower Carboniferous Coal Measures or Lower Coal Measures,\" and forming his fifth or lowest division of the Carboniferous system (10,1891), in eastern Canada, are described by him as \"holding some, but not all, of the fossils of the Middle Coal formation, and thin coals, not productive; but differing both in flora and fauna from the upper Devonian, which they overlie unconformably.\" * * *\n\n\"In some localities these resemble in mineral character the true coal measures. In others they present a great thickness of peculiar bituminous and calcareous shales. They usually contain in their lower part thick beds of conglomerate and coarse sandstone, which in some places prevail to the exclusion of the finer beds. The characteristic plants of these beds are Lepidodendron corrugatum and Cyclopteris Aculea, with Dadorylon antiquius, and Alethopteris heterophylla. They also contain locally great quantities of remains of fishes, and many Entomostracans, among which are Leaiia Leidyi and an Estheria, also Leperditia subrecta, Portlock, Beyrichia colliculus, Eichw., and a Cythera, probably new.\" \"This formation is not everywhere distinguishable at the base of the Carboniferous, and is variable in its characters. It is seen in southern Cape\nBreton, in the county of Sydney, and in Hants; but its most remarkable and interesting exposures are at Horton bluff and at Hillsborough, and other places in southern New Brunswick. In the last-mentioned locality, it affords the remarkable bituminous mineral known as Albertite.\n\nFIELD WORK OF 1908 AND GENERAL CONCLUSION REGARDING AGE.\n\nDuring the summer of 1908, the writer, on behalf of the Geological Survey, visited the Albert shales area (22), spending some weeks at the Albert mines, where a large collection of fish remains was obtained, principally from beds of readily splitting brown shales exposed on the western branch of Frederick brook, in an exposure from which two collections, lately received by the Geological Survey, had been made. By searching the dump, a number of specimens, brought from a low level, were also found. To the southwest of the Albert mines, an examination of the beds was also made at Rosedale, Baltimore, Turtle Creek, Mapleton, and Elgin Corner, as well as at exposures seen in brooks and near the road. Continuing the examination of the shale area to the northeast, some time was spent at Taylorville, on the Memramcook river, within reach of Beliveau by road, at both of which places there are exposures of shale. At Taylorville there is a low cliff for some distance along the river front, constituting an excellent exposure of the Albert shales, from which, however, only plant remains were obtained.\n\nThe shales of the Albert mines and Beliveau are similar in character, and have a flora and fish fauna common to both, the Beliveau area, between the Petitcodiac and Memramcook rivers, being a continuation to the northwest of the Albert mines area. All the species of fishes that have been found so far at Beliveau are included in the Albert mines fauna. There is a great similarity between the fishes of the Albert mine and Beliveau areas, and those described by Dr. Ramsay H. Traquair from the Calciferous Sandstone series of Scotland; they belong to the same genera, but differ as to species.\n\nThe genera of Palaeoniscidae, Rhadinichthys, Elonichthys, and Canobius, so abundantly represented in the New Brunswick and Scottish shales, have been considered to be typical of the Carboniferous age. Cheirolepis canadensis, Whiteaves, from the upper Devonian of Scaumennac bay, Quebec, is an early member of the family, and the only completely preserved representative of the Palaeoniscidae known from the Devonian of North America. The species of Rhadinichthys described from the Carboniferous rocks of England, Scotland, and the United States, with R. alberti from New Brunswick, include the known species of the genus, with the exception of three from the upper Devonian of New York state, described from fragmentary remains, with doubtful generic reference, under the names Palaeoniscus antiquus, Williams, P. reticulatus, Williams (both from the Portage beds near Buffalo, New York), and P. devonicus, Clarke, (Naples beds of Sparta, New York). These three species are thought by Eastman to be properly referable to Rhadinichthys. Also, Eastman has lately described (20) a species, R. deani, from the base of the Waverley series in Kentucky, and another of the same genus, not specifically named, from the Chemung of Warren, Pennsylvania. The remains on which R. deani is based were obtained from phosphatic nodules, and, although fragmentary, are remarkable for the preservation of the soft tissues of the head. It is probable that the discovery of less fragmentary remains will prove these Devonian species to be generically distinct from the Scottish Carboniferous species on which Traquair founded his genus Rhadinichthys.\nIn 1908, additional palaeontological evidence was obtained, at Horton bluff, Kings county, N.S., of the Carboniferous age of the beds at this place, exposed in cliffs on the shore of Avon river. These beds were placed by Dawson, on the evidence of their fossils, in the lower Carboniferous, at about the horizon of the Albert shales. Separate teeth and a clavicle (22) were found of a species of *Strepsodus* probably referable to *Strepsodus hardingi* (Dawson), originally described from Horton bluff. Species of *Strepsodus*, and of the closely allied genus *Rhizodus*, are known from the Calciferous Sandstone series of Scotland; both genera are typically Carboniferous in Great Britain and North America and apparently do not occur in the Devonian.\n\nAll the Palaeoniscidae found in the Albert shales of New Brunswick belong to the same genera as, although differing specifically from those of the Carboniferous Sandstone series of Mid and West Lothian, and other localities in Scotland.\n\nThis series of rocks is considered, by the geologists of the British Survey, and others who have made a special study of the oil-shale fields in Scotland, to form the base of the Carboniferous system in that country. According to them the Carboniferous sandstones are the downward continuation of their Carboniferous Limestone series, and rest conformably on the upper Old Red Sandstone. The Calciferous Sandstone series includes fish-bearing shales, which are almost identical in composition and physical characters with the Albert shales.\n\nThe great similarity of the fish fauna of the shales in the two countries can lead to no other conclusion than that they are synchronous deposits.\n\nIt is believed, therefore, that the age ascribed to these fish-bearing shales in Scotland should also be ascribed, on the evidence of their fossils, to the Albert shales of New Brunswick, and that the strata in the two countries are geological equivalents.\n\nWith the foregoing introductory remarks relative to the Albert shales of Albert and Westmorland counties of New Brunswick, the mode of their occurrence and their probable age, we may pass on to a short reference to Dr. Charles T. Jackson's work on this particular fauna, and of that of a number of distinguished palaeontologists in later years. Preceding the descriptions of the species of Palaeoniscid fishes so well and abundantly preserved in these rocks is a statement of the material on which the descriptive portion of this report is based.\n\n**Earlier Descriptions of, and References to Albert Shale Fishes.**\n\nIn the year 1851, Dr. Charles T. Jackson described a number of Palaeoniscid fishes, obtained by himself and others, from the shales at Hillsborough, Albert county, New Brunswick. The results of his study of these fish remains appeared in his \"Report on the Albert Coal Mine (Boston, 1851), pp. 22\u201325,\" and in a paper entitled \"Descriptions of five new species of Fossil Fishes\" in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, vol. iv, 1851, pp. 138\u2013142. At this time Dr. Jackson described and named three species, *Palaeoniscus alberti*, *P. brownii*, and *P. cairnsii*, and gave descriptions of a number of specimens without specific references. In the first named paper reference is made to two plates of illustrations, which, however, were not published. In the second the descriptions are without figures. Lately the original drawings\n\n---\n\n1 It is probable, judging from the references made by Egerton, Dawson, Traquair, and others, to drawings of Jackson's types, that a few copies, at least, of the plates intended for the illustration of the 1851 paper and report on the Albert mine fishes were later distributed to leading interested palaeontologists in North America and Europe.\nof these unpublished plates have been brought to light in the Yale Museum, New Haven, by Dr. Charles R. Eastman of Cambridge, Mass. Through this fortunate find Dr. Eastman has been able to identify most of Jackson's types and figured specimens from among the material from the above locality in the collections of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, and of the Boston Society of Natural History.\n\nIn the Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society of London, vol. ix, 1853, p. 115, Sir Philip Grey Egerton, Bart., under the heading, \"Note on the Fossil Fish from Albert Mine,\" briefly remarks on the fossil fishes from this mine in Sir Charles Lyell's collection, and the museum of the Geological Society. The opinion is expressed that they belong to the genus Pal\u00e6oniscus, and certain specimens are identified with Jackson's species. Sir Philip adds that \"all the species from this locality are remarkable for the remote position of the dorsal fin, and the highly sculptured ornamentation of the headbones and scales. They are also remarkable for the large size of the scales covering the dorsal angle. Some of the larger specimens figured by Dr. Jackson, especially fig. 2, pl. 1, have great resemblance to the forms of Pal\u00e6oniscus, graduating into the characters of Eurynotus and Amblypterus, found at Burdie House and Newhaven, in Scotland. They are all quite remote in character from the Pal\u00e6onisci of the Kupfer Schiefer and magnesian limestone.\" In the same number of this Journal, on p. 110, in a paper \"On the Albert Mine, Hillsborough, New Brunswick,\" Sir J. William Dawson refers to the abundant and beautifully preserved remains of fishes in the Albert shales, mostly belonging to the genus Pal\u00e6oniscus.\n\nIn 1868, in the second edition of \"Acadian Geology,\" p. 231, Sir J. William Dawson again refers to these fossil fishes, and gives a figure, in the text, of Pal\u00e6oniscus alberti (?) Jackson.\n\nIn the Canadian Naturalist, 2nd series, vol. VIII, 1877, in his article entitled, \"Carboniferous fishes of New Brunswick,\" pp. 337\u2013340, Dawson adds two species to the fish fauna of these shales, viz., Pal\u00e6oniscus (Rhadinichthys) modulus and P. jacksonii, and supplies further notes on the original species P. alberti, P. cairnsi, and P. browni, from information gained from additional specimens. A restored outline is given of P. modulus, with figures of the scales (figs. 18a, b, c, d, p. 338). This paper also appears in the same year, without change, as part of the supplement to the second edition of Acadian Geology.\n\nDr. Ramsay H. Traquair had in 1877 (Quart. Jour. Geol. Soc. of London), in his paper \"On the Agassizian genera Amblypterus, Pal\u00e6oniscus, Gyrolepis, and Pygopterus,\" expressed the opinion that \"Pal\u00e6oniscus alberti, Jackson, and more especially P. cairnsi * * *\" and some of the other small Pal\u00e6oniscidae from the Coal Measures of New Brunswick,\" seemed to be allied to Rhadinichthys carinatus (Ag.).\n\nIn Dr. John Strong Newberry's monograph on \"The Pal\u00e6ozoic Fishes of North America,\" (15) p. 187, is to be found an enumeration of the then known species from the \"Lower Carboniferous rocks of New Brunswick.\" These species, which Dr. Newberry remarks are to be assigned partly to the genus Rhadinichthys and partly to Elonichthys, are Pal\u00e6oniscus alberti, Jackson; P. cairnsii, Jackson; P. brownii, Jackson; P. jacksonii, Dawson; and P. modulus, Dawson.\nIn 1891, in part II of the \"Catalogue of the Fossil Fishes in the British Museum,\" Dr. Arthur Smith Woodward supplied brief descriptions of three of these species, under the names *Rhadinichthys alberti* (Jackson), *R. cairnsi* (Jackson), and *R. modulus* (Dawson). *Elonichthys browni* (p. 501) is mentioned under doubtful and imperfectly defined species.\n\nLately Dr. Charles R. Eastman, in his Devonian Fishes of Iowa (Iowa Geological Survey, volume XVIII, 1908), has included references to *Rhadinichthys alberti*, *R. cairnsi*, and *R. modulus*, specifying these species as from the lower Carboniferous of Albert county, N.B.\n\nThe foregoing are the principal references to the fishes from the Albert shales since the original descriptions appeared in 1851, a period of nearly sixty years. Jackson's plates of figures, although a few copies may have been distributed, were not available to most palaeontologists. The fortunate discovery by Dr. Eastman of Jackson's original drawings has made possible the recognition of the types and figured specimens.\n\n**Collections\u2014Acknowledgments -Type material loaned.**\n\nThe Geological Survey of Canada received, in the autumn of 1907, two large collections of fishes from the Albert shales of New Brunswick, one made by Dr. R. W. Ells, of this Survey, the other by Mr. James Robertson, of the Albert mines.\n\nWith a view to reporting on the Albert shales fish fauna generally, the writer, in January, 1908, turned his attention to these collections, and to the material from the typical locality and vicinity already in the museum of the Geological Survey, collected principally by Dr. R. W. Ells in 1876, by Dr. F. D. Adams in 1877, and by Mr. James Robertson in 1891. There is also now available for study the large collection made at the same locality by the writer, during the summer of 1908.\n\nMy thanks are respectfully tendered to Dr. Frank D. Adams of McGill University, to Dr. Charles R. Eastman and Mr. Samuel Henshaw of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Mr. Charles W. Johnson of the Boston Society of Natural History, and to Dr. G. F. Matthew, St. John, N. B.; to Dr. Adams for affording me the opportunity of examining the type specimen of Dawson's *Palaonisicus* (*Rhadinichthys*) *modulus* and other specimens of Albert shales fishes from New Brunswick, the property of the Peter Redpath Museum, Montreal; to Dr. Eastman and Mr. Heushaw, for the loan of Jackson's type, and figured specimens that belong to the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and also for the much appreciated gift of photographs of Jackson's original drawings for his two plates; to Mr. Johnson for the loan of Albert Mines fish material, the property of the Boston Society of Natural History, in which are included the originals of three of Jackson's figures; and to Dr. Matthew for having kindly placed in my hands a number of specimens, from the Albert mines, belonging to the Natural History Society of New Brunswick.\nThe specimens received from the Museum of Comparative Zoology are the originals of Jackson's figures, as follows:\n\nPlate I, figure 1.

No. 7902.\nPlate II, figure 5. Not described by Jackson. No. 7898.\nPlate II, figure 8. Not described by Jackson. No. 7898a.\n\nIt may be mentioned here, that, in that part of Dr. Jackson's report on the Albert coal mine having special reference to the fossil fishes, there are certain discrepancies in the numbers denoting the figures of the plates: thus \"Figures 3 and 3 bis\" (p. 21) should read Figures 2 and 2 bis, the same specimen being referred to at the bottom of page 23 (Fig. 2, 2 bis) and shown in figures 2 and 2 bis of Plate II. Also \"Figure 4\" (p. 21) and \"Fig. 3\" (p. 24) both refer to fig. 3 of Plate II. Again, \"Fig. 8\" (p. 24) should properly read figure 6, as fig. 6 of Plate II illustrates the specimen described.\n\nFrom a study of the type material, and specimens, lent to me, and of the collections belonging to this Survey, there appear to be five species of Palaeoniscid fishes included in the fauna of the Albert shales of New Brunswick. These species are: *Rhadinichthys alberti* (Jackson), *Elonichthys browni* (Jackson), *E. elegantulus*, Eastman, *Canobius modulus* (Dawson), and a species of *Elonichthys* which I regard as new and which I have described on page 29 of this report and named after Dr. R. W. Ells.\nDESCRIPTION OF SPECIES.\n\nRhadinichthys alberti, (Jackson.)\n\nPlate III, figs. 1-6.\n\nPalaeoniscus alberti, Jackson, 1851.

Ibid. p. 261.\n\nThis species is the first of the Albert mine fishes described by Jackson.\n\nThe original description of the species', as it appeared on page 22 of the \"Report on the Albert Coal Mine,\" is as follows:\u2014\n\n\"Pl. I, Fig. 1. This fish is the first one that was discovered by me at the Albert mine.\n\n---\n\nAs the Report on the Albert Coal Mine is not readily accessible to all, the original descriptions of Jackson's other named species (Palaeoniscus Brownii and Palaeoniscus cairnsii) will be quoted at length, in the following pages, where they apply.\n\"Description:\u2014Fish, four diameters of its body long; head, obtuse or blunt, as if obliquely compressed on upper and front part; whole length, 3 3-10 inches; width, in middle of body, 85-100 inch; fins, one dorsal, opposite anal, small triangular, 3-10ths of an inch at base, jointed, drooping, as if the fish was dead before it was enclosed in the mud, (now shale). Anal, small, triangular, a little larger than dorsal; Pectoral, small, compressed into mass of scales of body of the fish; Tail, bifurcated, unequal, very long, and tapering in upper division, which extends to a fine point. The scales run down on upper division of tail, and become gradually smaller to tip; caudal rays come exclusively from under side of upper, and form lower division of tail. Scales of body brilliant, rhomboidal, wavy, serrated on posterior margins, colour light brown. This fish is embalmed and not petrified. No ridge of bone is seen to indicate the vertebral column, hence the bones must have been cartilaginous and compressible. The gill plates are too confusedly compressed to be dissected. I cannot find in any published book any figure of a fossil fish identical with this. It is evidently a Palaeoniscus, and is probably a young individual, as seems to be indicated by its small size, and the delicacy of its scales. We will name it, provisionally, *Palaeoniscus Alberti*, in commemoration of its being the first fossil fish discovered in Albert county, in New Brunswick.\"\n\nOther specimens from the Albert mine, described by Jackson, but not named by him, are shown in his figures 2, 2 bis and 3 of plate II, and belong to this species. His figures 5 and 8 of the same plate represent specimens of *alberti* from the same locality, not mentioned in the text of his report. The original of figure 4, plate II, of which no mention is made in the text, has not been seen by the writer, but it probably also is of this species.\n\nIn the collections from the Albert shales of New Brunswick, belonging to the Geological Survey, this species is the one most abundantly represented. It evidently swarmed in countless numbers in the waters of its time.\n\nA careful study of the type and figured specimens of Jackson's *Palaeoniscus alberti*, and of the type of *P. cairnsi*, Jackson, has compelled the writer to believe that the latter is not specifically distinct from the former. A supposed difference in the ornamentation of the flank scales seems to have been relied on principally as a character denoting specific distinction.\n\nDr. Jackson's description of *Rhadinichthys cairnsi*, to be found on the same page of the 1851 report as that of *R. alberti*, is as follows:\n\n\"Plate I, Fig. 3, represents a perfect fish of the genus *Palaeoniscus* which was found on the 3rd of June last. In its general form and appearance it resembles the *Palaeoniscus Elegans*, of Prof. Sedgewick, (Lond. Geol. Trans., 2d series, Vol. iii, Pl. 9, Fig. 1) and Agassiz, (Recherches sur les Poissons Fossiles, Vol. ii, Tab. 10, Fig. 5.) but it differs from that species in the striation of the scales, the striae of the Hillsboro' species being parallel to the anterior and lower margins of the scales, and the shape of the scales differing essentially from Mr. Sedgewick's species.\n\n\"Description.\u2014Fish, long and slender, 4 1-2 diameters of its body long; length of head, a little less than the largest diameter of the body; the head has the shape of an equilateral spherical triangle; tip of nose, or snout curiously tuberculated and dotted; gill plates cannot be dissected,\nthey are so brittle and confused with the head; fins, pectoral a little behind gill plates, and extend below the fish 3-10ths of an inch,\u2014it is a narrow-pointed fin, well marked with its rays. Dorsal fin far back towards the tail, a little anterior to anal; it is half an inch long and 2-10ths of an inch high, and is well marked with its rays. Anal fin somewhat larger than dorsal, a little posterior to it. Abdominal fin very small, situated a very little in advance of the middle of the body; tail unequally bifurcated or heterocercal; scales run down on it becoming smaller and more and more acutely rhomboidal or lozenge shaped as they recede; caudal rays come exclusively from under side of upper division of tail. Scales obtusely rhomboidal on anterior and middle of body, and are distinctly striated parallel to anterior and lower margins, while they are smooth and very brilliant towards and upon the tail; dorsal scales large and in form of obtuse spherical triangles pointing backwards towards the dorsal fin. This species is not described in any book I have examined, and believing it to be new, I shall take the liberty of naming it Paleoniscus Coirnshi, after the highly intelligent superintendent of the Albert coal mine, William Cairns, to whose active unremitting labours I am indebted for so many specimens of these interesting fossils.\"\n\nRhadinichthys alberti is of small size, rather slender, fusiform, averaging in length about 8\u00b75 cm. Greatest depth of trunk in advance of the pelvic fins, slightly over one-fifth the total length. The head, in length, about equal to the maximum depth of the body. Eye of moderate size, placed far forward. Fins well developed. Dorsal fin beginning a little behind the mid-length of the fish, triangular, about the same size as, and arising somewhat in advance of the anal fin. Caudal fin much prolonged in upper lobe, deeply forked. Pectoral fins large, with a short base. Pelvic pair, if anything, nearer to the anal fin than to the pectorals, of small size. Teeth minute. Suspensorium oblique.\n\nAnterior flank scales, plate III, fig. 5, about as deep as long (exposed surface), ornamented with striations, some of which are parallel to the lower and anterior margins; while others, fewer in number, have an oblique backward and downward direction and are confined to the upper, posterior quarter of the scale. These latter striations are deeper than the others, are comparatively short, and are most conspicuous toward the back margin. The former are fine, fairly regular, and occupy the remaining three-quarters of the scale surface, bending upward anteriorly parallel to the front margin. There are three or four of the coarser stri\u00e6 and about six of the finer ones. The striations indent the posterior margin of the scales causing it to be minutely serrated. In the more posterior flank scales the striations are fewer in number and tend to disappear, the oblique stri\u00e6 being still apparent when the remainder of the scale surface has become smooth. In these scales the serrations behind are reduced in number and are relatively coarser. In the body prolongation of the upper lobe of the tail the scales have the usual elongated diamond shape, with a surface in which a slight indication of a coarser longitudinal striation is still visible.\n\nAbout ten to twelve enlarged ridge scales, (plate III, fig. 6,) occur in advance of the dorsal fin, reaching in a row forward to a point not far removed from the back of the head. They are considerably longer than broad, narrowly rounded in front, somewhat pointed behind, and are coarsely and irregularly striated longitudinally, the striations conforming in a general way\nto the curve of the lateral margin. Enlarged scales also occur behind the dorsal fin and are continued back on the upper lobe of the tail, with a much increased overlap, to its termination. They diminish in size as they pass backward, and are much reduced in breadth, resembling large fulcra. In advance of the anal fin and between it and the caudal, a few enlarged scales, similar in shape and sculpture to those of the dorsal row, are also present. There appear to be three in advance of the anal fin and about the same number behind it. All the fin rays are jointed throughout, except the principal anterior ones of the pectoral pair, which appear to be entire proximally, and to be jointed only in their distal halves. They subdivide distally and have the appearance of being at times slightly striated in the direction of their length. Minute fulcra are present on the margin of the lower caudal lobe and on the anterior margins of the other fins. The head bones are ornamented with longitudinal ridges and tubercles, and transitions between the two. Figure 1 of plate III gives an attempted restoration of *Rhadinichthys alberti*, twice the natural size of the average specimen, based on the type material and the many specimens contained in the Geological Survey collections. Figures 2 and 3 of the same plate are reproductions of photographs of two individuals, collected by Dr. R. W. Ells, in 1907, from which a fair idea of the general proportions of the fish and the position of its fins can be obtained. The size of the restoration does not admit of a proper representation of most of the finer details of structure and ornamentation, such as the surface sculpture of the head-bones, the striation and serration of the scales, the articulation and subdivision of the fin rays, etc., so that these have been wholly or in part omitted. The ornamentation of the scales is given in the more enlarged figures 4, 5, and 6 of plate III. In the specimen reproduced in figure 3, plate III, the position and size of the maxilla, mandible, and eye are well suggested, but in the many specimens examined the bones of the head cannot be satisfactorily made out. In a number of examples the obliquity of the posterior outline of the opercular apparatus is clearly indicated.\n\nThe type specimen of *Rhadinichthys alberti*, No. 1960 of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, the original of Jackson\u2019s figure 1, plate I, is imperfect in many respects. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are but partially preserved, while the other fins, as well as the head, are missing. In most of the scales the finer details of ornamentation are obscure, and the posterior margins are broken. Although the scales are not, as a whole, well preserved, yet, some of them, well forward on the flank, on close examination, show that the same style of striation exists in them as in the type of *R. cairnsi*. The principal character apparently relied on, as a distinguishing one between this species and *R. cairnsi*, was the implied difference in the scale sculpture. Any difference in the ornamentation of the scales in these species, as throughout the Palaeoniscidae as a whole, may be expected to be most accentuated in the flank scales for some little distance back from the head. The scales of *R. alberti* were evidently regarded by Dr. Jackson as being smooth, as in the original description they are referred to as being \u201cbrilliant,\u201d no other reference being made to their ornamentation beyond the observation that the posterior margins are serrated. The scales of the type specimen of *R. cairnsi* are well preserved, with the sculpture particularly definite, plate III, fig. 4. In Jackson\u2019s description they are stated to be \u201cdistinctly striated parallel to anterior and lower margins,\u201d a description that, to be complete, needs some reference to the coarse, oblique striae which are present in the upper back portion of the scale surface. To the writer the striation of the scales appears to be the same in both species, poorly preserved in the type of *R. alberti*, but very clearly shown in the type of\nR. cairnsi, with a like serration of the posterior margin in both. Other characters distinguishing the two species are not observed, and the conclusion has been reached that there is no real distinction between the two. The type of R. cairnsi is rather larger than the average sized specimens of R. alberti. The striation parallel to the lower and front margins of the scales is seen in the majority of the many specimens in the Geological Survey collection of the general size of, and regarded as referable to, R. alberti, as well as in the two specimens shown by Jackson in figures 2 and 3 of plate I. These last were regarded by Jackson as belonging to one and the same species, but were not otherwise specifically determined. They are here referred to R. alberti. Three other specimens, figures 4, 5, and 8, of plate II, not alluded to in the text of Jackson's report, are evidently of this species. The originals of figures 4 and 5 consist of the posterior half of the fish only, consequently the anterior flank scales of these particular specimens have not been seen; they evidently, however, belong to R. alberti, reliance being placed on the characters displayed. The original of figure 8 includes scales some distance in advance of the dorsal and anal fins, in which the characteristic striation of R. alberti is revealed; its reference to this species is, therefore, considered proper.\n\nElonichthys browni (Jackson).\n\nPlates IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, and IX.\n\nPalaeomiscus brownii, Jackson, 1851.

Fossil Fishes, British Museum, part II, p. 501, under doubtful and imperfectly defined species.\n\nThe type of this species, No. 1961, of the collection of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, is from the Albert mines and was described by Dr. Jackson in 1851, in his \"Report on the Albert Mine, etc.,\" and in the year following, in the Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History. It consists of the greater part of the fish, with the left side exposed, in an admirable state of preservation, and gives very minute details of structure. The specimen extends from close behind the head to a point some distance beyond the base of the tail, so as to include about one-third of the body prolongation of the upper lobe of the tail and the greater part of the lower lobe. The dorsal and anal fins are beautifully shown. From the anterior end of the base of the anal fin forward, the specimen is imperfect below, and the pelvic and pectoral fins are missing. The type specimen is well shown in Jackson's plate I, figure 2.\nOver a dozen examples of a large fish from the shales of the Albert mines are now in the possession of this Survey, and are in the writer's opinion referable to this species. In fact, of the specimens of fossil fishes from this locality, all the large ones appear to belong to this species. They range in length from about 18\u00b75 cm. (approximately of the size of the type specimen) to nearly 35\u00b75 cm. or about 14 inches. The specimens depicted by Jackson in plate I, figure 5, and plate II, figure 1, are also believed to belong to this species. The original of Jackson's figure 4, plate I, the type of *Palaeoniscus jacksoni*, Dawson, is not available for study, but, judging from the figure, it is presumably not distinct from *E. browni*. Its length, as stated by Dr. Jackson, was originally 15 inches.\n\nJackson's original description appeared as follows, on page 22 of his report: \"Pl. I, Fig. 2. This beautiful fish was found by Mr. Brown, the captain of the mine, subsequent to my first visit to Hillsboro'. It is one of the largest, or full grown species. It was unfortunately broken in the operation of extracting, but it still is a very valuable specimen. This being the first fossil fish found by the chief miner, I have named it *Palaeoniscus Brownii*.\n\n\"Description.\u2014Fish nearly whole. It is one of the largest species yet found, and its length is three times the greatest width of its body; whole length, 5 3-10th inches; breadth, 1 7-10th inches; head broken off just in front of pectoral fin; extremity of tail broken; abdominal fin missing, it having been broken in getting out the specimen. Dorsal fin, a little behind middle of body, opposite, or rather a little in front of anal.\"\n\nThe original descriptions of the specimens shown in plate I, figure 4, and plate II, figure 1, are as under:\n\n\"Pl. I., Fig. 4. This large and elegant fish was most unfortunately broken in splitting it out from the rock, only the posterior part of it having been saved in a fit condition for delineation. The whole length of the fish was originally fifteen inches. That portion which remains entire is 5 1-2 inches long; it was broken off through the posterior edge of the dorsal fin. It was an old fish, as is evident from the appearance of the scales which are thick, heavy, and have their striations in part obliterated, while the serrations are extremely sharp and deep. The scales are elongated rhomboids, and have many striae upon their surface which run parallel with their upper and lower margins. Caudal scales, acute lozenges. They run down on upper division which is long and covered with scales. Rays of tail come off very distinctly, exclusively from under side of upper division, and the tail is unequal or heterocercal. Until we obtain an entire specimen, perhaps it will be prudent to abstain from giving a specific name. It is a species of the genus *Palaeoniscus*.\n\n\"Pl. II., Fig. 1. This species so nearly resembles the *Palaeoniscus decorus* of Sir Philip M. de Egerton, as on first view to pass for it; but on examining the lines of striae, we are forced to regard it as another species. The four great dorsal scales, anterior to the dorsal fin, exactly resemble in form those represented in Sir Philip M. de Egerton's plate. (See Quarterly Journal Geological Society of London, for 1849.) The scales of one specimen* are striated, parallel with the superior and inferior margins, and are deeply and acutely serrated on their posterior edges.\n\n*Evidently a misprint for our.*\nThe lines of striation are worn away considerably, indicating, perhaps, that it was an old fish. It was, when entire, about eight inches long, and it is two inches in diameter from the anterior edges of the dorsal and anal fins. The lithographic delineation gives a sufficiently full exhibition of the character of this specimen, which appears to be of the same species, or very near the species, last described.\"\n\nThe type, and figured specimens of Jackson, together with the specimens belonging to this Survey, form a series from which it is now possible to form a fairly correct idea of the general shape of the species, and of many details of its structure.\n\nOur knowledge of the head must, for the present, remain deficient, as in all the specimens that part is obscure, and provides the least reliable information, principally on account of the effects of crushing, which are more apparent here than in other parts of the body. Some of the specimens furnish an approximately true outline of the fish, with the exact position of the fins, but without much detail; from others we obtain particulars of structure, and the minutiae of scale ornamentation.\n\nFrom a study of all available material this species seems to possess stable characters in general, but to vary slightly as regards the ornamentation of the scales, a variation which appears to be quite independent of the age or size of the individual. It belongs to the genus *Eloniichthys*.\n\n*Eloniichthys browni* (Jackson) may be described as follows:\n\nA species of moderately large size, reaching a length of 37\u00b75 cm. (about 15 inches). Maximum depth of the trunk, slightly in advance of the pelvic fins, contained about three and three-quarters times in the total length. Length of head, including the opercular apparatus, about one-fifth of the total length. Fins rather large. Pectoral fin powerful, spreading, with a rather restricted base; rays articulated, except the first two or three proximally. Pelvic fins, small in comparison with the other fins, about midway between the pectoral and anal fins, in advance of the mid-length of the trunk. Anal fin, large, triangular, with a broad base, reaching posteriorly close to the tail. Dorsal fin, similar in shape to the anal but not quite so large, the centre of its base nearly above the anterior end of the base of the anal. Caudal fin large, the body prolongation of the upper lobe robust, extended, the lower lobe well developed. Fulcra in all the fins conspicuous. External bones of the head ornamented with definite ridges of varying length, straight or slightly tortuous and having a general longitudinal direction, replaced at times by tubercles. Flank scales, near the head, ornamented with numerous longitudinal stri\u00e6, and a serrated posterior border. Usually, in passing backward on the trunk, these stri\u00e6 gradually disappear, being replaced by a few punctuations, the surface of the scales becoming smoother and the serrations of the posterior border fewer in number, until in the upper lobe of the tail both punctuations and serrations are lost and the scales are quite smooth. It is found, however, that the striations of the scales persist in a variable degree, in different specimens, in the posterior half of the trunk, and in some, even the caudal scales retain a number of the stri\u00e6. Enlarged, longitudinally striated, imbricating dorsal ridge scales extend in a row from near the head to the dorsal fin, and from the latter to the extremity of the tail, on the upper lobe of which they are of modified shape and gradually diminishing size. Between the anal\nfin and the lower lobe of the tail a row of imbricating scales, enlarged and ornamented similarly to those between the dorsal fin and upper lobe of the tail, also occur. Enlarged, longitudinally striated scales are seen in a number of specimens, between the anal and ventral fins, and between the latter and the pectorals, but whether these are disposed in a definite single row or not has not been ascertained. In all the fins the rays are articulated, and their joints, though generally smooth, are sometimes sculptured to a slight extent. This sculpture has been best observed in the dorsal and anal fins of the type specimen. In the more anterior part of the fins, it consists of a feeble oblique striation of the front margin of the joints, while more posteriorly their hind margins develop minute serrations.\n\nIn general proportions *E. browni* is moderately deep, the maximum depth of the trunk being contained about three and three-quarters times in the total length, of which the head occupies about one-fifth. The caudal pedicle is slender, its depth being about two-fifths of the greatest depth of the trunk. In side view, the dorsal outline, moderately flat in advance of the dorsal fin, descends rapidly near the head, which is rather short and obtusely pointed. The depth of the trunk is much diminished between the dorsal and anal fins, the line of the base of these fins being oblique to the longitudinal axis of the fish. The tail is deeply forked and the upper lobe considerably exceeds the lower one in length.\n\nThe mandibular suspensorium is apparently oblique. The teeth, as seen imperfectly in one specimen only, seem to be arranged in two rows, after the manner of the genus, viz., with small teeth in an outer row, and larger ones, at intervals, forming an inner row. In all the specimens the head is unsatisfactorily preserved, and no definite statement can be made regarding the shape and disposition of the bones.\n\nIn the fins, the rays are articulated throughout except the most proximal part of the first two or three rays of the pectoral. The dorsal fin, plate IV, fig. 2, is triangular, with a base nearly equal to the length of the anterior border. The posterior margin is straight or slightly concave and equals the base in length. As exhibited in the type specimen, plate I, fig. 2, and plate IV, fig. 1, the rays, anteriorly and proximally are 0\u00b76 mm. broad, there being five rays in a space of 3 mm. The joints are about 1\u00b75 mm. long, that is, their length is about three times their breadth, plate V, fig. 5. Proximally, the rays along the whole length of the base decrease but little, if at all, in thickness posteriorly. The rays subdivide distally. They bear a longitudinal striation or groove, which begins near the base and is at first superficial. This groove deepens and becomes more decided near the mid-length of the fin, and culminates in a subdivision of the ray not far from the posterior margin of the fin. Distally a second, and apparently also a third subdivision, may take place. The joints retain very much the same length distally, as proximally, with the result that their length relative to their thickness is greatly increased with each successive subdivision, in other words, they become more slender. On the front border of many of the joints in the more anterior part of the fin, three or four slight, short striations are observed, directed upward and backward, obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the rays. These particular markings are not observed in the posterior half of the fin, where another style of ornamentation is developed, viz., a minute serration of the hinder border of the joints, the serrations also pointing upward and backward, plate V, fig. 6. The fulcra along the anterior\nborder form a conspicuous feature of the fin. Individually they are not quite straight, but have a slight sigmoid or double curve, and they taper to an obtuse point above. In the lower part of the fin, where they are most robust, their length is slightly over $1 \\cdot 5$ mm., with a thickness of about $0 \\cdot 3$ mm. at their lower ends; they do not decrease much in size in the fin's distal half.\n\nThe anal fin is larger than the dorsal one, and what has been said regarding the structure of the latter applies equally here. Its outline almost forms an equilateral triangle, with the base slightly less than the anterior height, and with the posterior margin regularly and moderately incurved. In one specimen in particular its proportions are well shown (figure 1, plate VI). In the type specimen, this fin, although admirably preserved with all details of ornamentation intact, does not exhibit the whole length of its base, as, posteriorly, there is a slight overlap of the lower border of the caudal pedicle due to distortion.\n\nThe pectoral fins are not well shown in most of the specimens seen. In one specimen, however, represented in figure 1, plate VIII, the left one of the pair is fairly well preserved, and from it we can judge of its proportions and relative size. In this specimen the fin is spread, naturally and without distortion it would seem, and an idea of power is conveyed by its outline. Its length, measured in a straight line from the base to the anterior distal end, is less than that of the dorsal fin in the same specimen. The anterior or outer border sweeps round in a graceful curve, and in this respect differs from the corresponding part of the dorsal and anal fins, which is more nearly straight. The base is short and is contained about four times in the fin's length. The inner margin is, in length, about equal to the base, but the posterior margin, when the fin is spread, as in the specimen, equals four-fifths the total length of the fin. The rays have about the same thickness as those of the dorsal and anal fins, and are similarly jointed and sculptured, with this difference, that, proximally the first few anterior rays remain unarticulated. The fulcra, continuous along the whole front border, do not differ from those of the fins already described.\n\nThe pelvic or ventral fins are relatively small, have a short base and seem to be long in proportion to their width. Their fulcra are well developed.\n\nThe caudal fin is preserved in a number of specimens in which its shape is clearly shown. It is deeply forked. The long, acuminate upper lobe is formed to the extent of about one-half its width by the body prolongation which reaches to its extreme tip. The lower lobe is shorter and is apparently more rounded in outline at its extremity, not coming to such an acute point behind. The fulcra of the lower lobe agree in size with those of the other fins. The fin rays spring from the whole length of the lower surface of the body prolongation, beginning anteriorly below at a point not far removed from the posterior termination of the base of the anal fin, and ending above at the distal extremity of the body prolongation. They are jointed and sculptured as in the dorsal and anal fins.\n\nThe scales are of moderate size, in the form of rhomboids on the flanks, with the usual peg-and-socket articulation, and with a considerable overlap. On the flank, half way between the dorsal fin and the head, their height, or breadth, is three-fourths of their length, plate V,\nfig. 2. Nearer the head their height is relatively greater. In passing toward the tail their proportionate length gradually increases. Those about midway between the anal and dorsal fins are twice as long as high, and in the lobe of the tail the average proportion of length to height is 3 to 1.\n\nThe flank scales near the head are sculptured by striations, having a general longitudinal direction, and numbering from about sixteen to eighteen or twenty. Under a lens they have a decidedly rugose appearance. These striations cover the whole of the exposed part of the scale, and extend forward in the over-lapped part to near the front margin, along which there is a narrow smooth border. Most of the striations are continuous through the length of the scale to its posterior margin, but a few are shorter and either merge into adjacent stri\u00e6 or are interfered with by stri\u00e6 oblique to their course. In the lower part of the scale the striations are generally parallel to the lower margin and curve up with it anteriorly. Those above assume a more or less oblique direction backward and downward. This difference in the direction of the striation in the upper and lower parts of the scale is accentuated in some of the scales, where, in the upper anterior half, the stri\u00e6 are parallel to the diagonal connecting the upper back with the lower front angle of the scale, while those below the diagonal are parallel to the lower margin. The stri\u00e6 are often more or less curved, resulting in slight variations in the general longitudinal direction. The posterior margin is indented by the stri\u00e6, the result being a conspicuous serration of that part, the number of serrations depending on the number of stri\u00e6 at the back margin. In the type specimen, and in some others in the collection of the Geological Survey, the flank scales, as we pass backward toward the tail, gradually become smoother, the place of the striations, as they disappear, being taken by a diminishing number of punctations, plate V, fig. 3, but it is observed that the striations persist most near the anterior and posterior margins of the scales. As the height of the scale is reduced there is a corresponding reduction in the number of the posterior denticulations. When the tail is reached the scales have become almost smooth and there are few denticulations. In the body prolongation of the tail the scales are quite smooth, with entire margins. In some specimens in the collection, notably in the largest one obtained in the summer of 1908, there is a very general persistence of the striations throughout the length of the flank, even well on to the upper lobe of the tail. In different specimens there are observed various degrees of development of the longitudinal stri\u00e6 of the scales in the more posterior portions of the flank, and although at first it was suspected that more than one species of *Elonichthys* was represented by the larger specimens from the Albert shales so far obtained, it is now believed that they all belong to the single species *E. browni*, a species having a scale ornamentation variable within limits.\n\nFrom about twelve to fifteen enlarged, imbricating, dorsal ridge scales extend from a short distance back of the head to the dorsal fin. They are largest midway between the head and the fin, at the highest point of the back. As, in most of the specimens, these scales are badly crushed, and broken at the edges, it is difficult to obtain a clear outline of them, but the larger anterior ones appear to be ovate, slightly longer than broad, and to attain a breadth, in some of the specimens, of between 8 and 10 mm., not taking into account the transverse curve of the scale. On approaching the dorsal fin they are not so broad, and are more pointed behind. They are ornamented by wavy, frequently inosculating, longitudinal stri\u00e6 somewhat coarser than\nthose of the anterior flank scales. The posterior margin is serrated. The four nearest the fin are well preserved in the specimen shown by Jackson in figure 1 of his second plate; of these one is shown in plate V, figure 4. As in the flank scales, a more posterior position leads to a replacement of the strike by punctations, and an increasing area of smooth surface, in a variable degree in different specimens. The enlarged scales between the dorsal fin and the tail are similar in shape and ornamentation to those immediately preceding the dorsal fin, gradually decreasing in breadth and becoming more pointed behind, as well as more angularly convex transversely as they approach the tail, on the upper lobe of which they are continued in diminishing size to its upper extremity. An emargination of the overlapped anterior surface, present in the ridge scales preceding the dorsal fin, becomes more pronounced in those behind this fin, and especially so in those on the upper lobe of the caudal fin, which are V shaped. In these last the overlapped surface is much increased, and extends back to near the posterior end of the scale as a smooth, narrow, depressed area in which the preceding scale closely fits. There are three or four enlarged imbricating scales in a row between the anal fin and the lower lobe of the tail, and the same number between the former and the pelvic fins. These scales, in ornamentation and general shape, are similar to those of the dorsal ridge near the dorsal fin. In advance of the ventral fins enlarged scales are also present, with sculpture like that of the more anterior dorsal scales, but, as already mentioned, their exact disposition has not been ascertained, as none of the specimens seen provides sufficiently definite information in this respect. The lateral line scales on the flank extend in a row from near the head above the mid-height of the body backward toward the tail midway between the upper and lower surface of the caudal pedicle. Each of these scales is pierced by a small passage whose external opening has the form of a minute crescentic slit round which the surface of the scale is slightly tumid. In most of the specimens these scales are proportionately higher than those of the rows immediately above and below. In none of the specimens examined have the minute openings been traced as far as the tail.\n\n*Elonichthys browni* (Jackson), from the Albert shales, differs from any known species of the genus. Its scale ornamentation resembles in a general way some of the species so admirably described and portrayed by Dr. Ramsay H. Traquair in his monograph on the *Palaeoniscidae*, in Vols. XXXI and LV of the Palaeontographical Society of London; but differences in the general proportions of the body, in the proportions and relative size of the fins, in the exact style of sculpture of the scales and fin rays, as well as in other particulars, mark this Albert shales fish as a distinct species.\n\nThe type specimen of Dawson's *Palaeoniscus jacksoni* (figured by Jackson in figure 1 of his first plate) is not available for study, but, judging from the figure, and from Dr. Jackson's remarks on its scale ornamentation, it appears to the writer probable that it is not distinct from *E. browni*. A specimen from McGill University museum, labelled *P. jacksoni*, Hillsborough, No. 2698, now before me, has the scale sculpture and the ornamentation of the joints of the fin rays such as are seen in Jackson's type (plate I, figure 2) with which it is evidently conspecific. Among the specimens from the Natural History Society of New Brunswick is the original of the one from which the plaster cast mentioned by Sir William Dawson in his \"Acadian Geology\" was taken, which cast formed part of the material on which *P. jacksoni* was based. The specimen consists of the posterior part of the fish, from slightly in advance of the dorsal fin\nbackward to the end of the tail. The anterior basal portion only of the anal fin is preserved, and the position of the dorsal fin is indicated, but the specimen is elongated by distortion, and both fins are more distant from the tail than they otherwise would be. The general contour of the specimen is much the same as that of others in the collections of the Geological Survey similarly distorted, and the characters of the scales are clearly those of *E. browni*, to which species the specimen is referred.\n\n**Elonichthys ellsi**, Sp. nov.\n\nPlate X, figs. 1\u20136.\n\nA species of rather small size. Greatest depth a little less than one-fourth the length. Head, with opercular apparatus, one-fourth the total length. Dorsal fin large, arising very slightly behind the mid-length of the fish, and but little in advance of the anal fin, which is about the size of the dorsal. Both of these fins are triangular, with a base about equal to the length of the anterior border. Fulera are apparently present on all the fins. They are seen plainly on the dorsal and anal fins. Of the ventral and pectoral fins, a few rays only are preserved, which serve as an index to the fins' position. Ventral fins rather closer to the anal than to the pectoral fins. The fin rays are articulated, except the principal ones of the pectoral fins, which are entire, at least, proximally; they are finely striated in the direction of their length, plate X, fig. 6. The tail is deeply forked. Scales of moderate size; about as deep as broad on the flank anteriorly, where they are ornamented with nine or ten conspicuous, narrow ridges, directed backward and deeply serrating the posterior border. Posterior flank scales less highly ornate, and with few, but well marked serrations on the posterior margin. Scales of the caudal body prolongation nearly smooth. Enlarged scales extend along the dorsal ridge in a row, in advance of the dorsal fin, to the head, and behind the same fin backward to the termination of the upper lobe of the tail. Similarly enlarged scales occur between the anal fin and the lower lobe of the tail, with a few, probably three or four, in front of the anal fin. Head-bones marked by irregular, short ridges, and tubercles. Suspensorium apparently oblique.\n\nThe ridges of enamel on the anterior flank scales, plate X, fig. 2, constitute the most conspicuous feature of the scale ornamentation of this species. These ridges, nine or ten in number, are mainly developed on the posterior half of the scale, and have a general direction backward and slightly downward, more rarely pointing horizontally backward in the upper portion of the scale, or even obliquely upward near the upper margin. When closely examined, the ridges are seen to be depressed at regular intervals, and thus have somewhat the appearance of rows of connected tubercules. In the anterior half of the scale they are represented only by 5 or 6 ill-defined ridges, having the same oblique direction. A few fine stri\u00e6 occur near and parallel to the lower margin. The conspicuous serration of the posterior margin is due to the projecting ends of the enamel ridges. In the posterior flank scales, plate X, fig. 3, there are only three or four serrations in the back margin; the finer striations parallel to the lower margin persist, but in the upper part of the scale surface two or three oblique striations alone remain. The diamond shaped scales of the upper caudal lobe are generally marked by a longitudinal depression in their otherwise plane service.\nThe enlarged ridge scales are rugosely and irregularly striated longitudinally. Those behind the dorsal fin are the best preserved in the specimen, and are seen to be toothed behind, plate X, fig. 4. They have an elongated oval outline, and undergo a modification in shape on the upper margin of the tail similar to that observed in the species of *Elonichthys* and *Rhadinichthys* already described. Conspicuous, horizontal striations or linear depressions occur in these modified scales of the caudal ridge, plate X, fig. 5.\n\nThe most distinctive character of the species is the style of ornamentation of the anterior flank scales, which is different from that of any other of the Albert shales fishes, and, so far as the writer is aware, from that of any species of the Palaeoniscidae.\n\nThe species is named after Dr. R. W. Ells, to whom we are indebted for the one and only specimen known. This specimen constitutes the type of the species.\n\nFigure 1, plate XI, gives a fairly good representation of the type specimen twice the natural size.\n\n**Elonichthys elegantulus**, Eastman.\n\n*Elonichthys elegantulus*, Eastman, 1908. Devonian Fishes of Iowa, Iowa Geol. Surv., vol. XVIII, p. 274.\n\nOf this species Dr. Eastman, in the above report, writes as follows:\n\n\u201cA study of an extensive suite of material from the lower Carboniferous of Albert county, New Brunswick, including the originals of Dr. C. T. Jackson\u2019s figures and descriptions, shows that a minute form, apparently closely allied to the Scottish *E. striatus*, is present in this horizon and locality, where it accompanies *E. browni* and the several species of Rhadinichthys already noticed in the preceding pages. The new form, for which the title *E. elegantulus* is not inappropriate, may be readily distinguished by its small size, slender and graceful proportions, and decidedly prominent, even coarse details of scale ornament. The scales are traversed longitudinally by a number of closely crowded raised ridges, smooth, continuous, glistening, and the whole presenting an appearance not distantly recalling Ptycholepis, from a much later horizon. In addition, the lateral line is very conspicuous. The head and fin structures are not clearly revealed in any individual that has thus far come to light, but the general resemblance to the little fish made known by Traquair from Eskdale and East Lothian necessitates its reference to the same vicinity.\u201d\n\nThis, the smallest, and, with *R. alberti*, the most abundantly preserved of the fishes at the Albert mines, is readily recognized by its rugose scale markings. Its small size, in conjunction with its generally imperfect state of preservation, leads one to suspect that it may be the young of one of the species already known from this locality, possibly of *R. alberti*. Of the many scores of specimens in our collections nearly all lack proper definition of outline, and the head is, as a rule, very imperfectly preserved. Its principal characters, however, may be stated to be as follows: In general outline resembling *R. alberti*, but much smaller. Length averaging about 46 mm., or about half the length of *R. alberti*; considerably shorter than *Canobius modulus*\nand not so stout as that species. The proportion of depth to length about as 1 to $3\\frac{1}{4}$. Dorsal fin opposite or arising slightly in advance of the anal fin. Enlarged, longitudinally striated scales occur in a row on the back throughout its length on to the tail, and ventrally, behind and in advance of the anal fin. The head bones are longitudinally and irregularly striated. The anterior flank scales have generally two or three conspicuously, slightly oblique, longitudinal ridges in the upper portion of their exposed surface, with about two less conspicuous ones beneath them, having more the appearance of striations than ridges. These latter are parallel to the lower scale margin and show a disposition to curve upward in front parallel to the anterior margin. Posterior margin with four or five decided serrations. The posterior flank scales retain the coarse ornamentation, with a reduction in the number of ridges and serrations. In these a few fine striations can be detected parallel to the lower margin. The lateral line is conspicuous and appears to the unaided eye as a raised line traversing the length of the flank at mid-height.\n\nThe generic position of this small form appears to the writer to be problematical.\n\n**Canobius modulus** (Dawson).\n\nPlate XI, figs. 1\u20137.\n\n*Palaeoniscus (Rhadinichthys) modulus*, Dawson, 1877.

Fossil Fishes, British Museum, Part II, p. 466.\n\n*Rhadinichthys modulus*, Eastman, 1908. Devonian Fishes of Iowa, Iowa Geol. Survey, vol. XVIII, p. 262, fig. 39.\n\nThis species was first described by Sir William Dawson in 1878 (Canadian Naturalist), from specimens obtained from Beliveau, N.B., and Horton, N.S. Three specimens from the Peter Redpath museum, Montreal, have been examined by me. These are, the type collected by Dr. Frank Adams at Beliveau, plate XI, fig. 2, with a less perfectly preserved specimen on the same piece of shale, and a third specimen, plate XI, fig. 3, from Horton, from which the figure accompanying Dawson's description was evidently principally prepared.\n\nThis fish is short and robust, the mandibular suspensorium is apparently nearly vertical, the head is blunt in front, and a row of enlarged ridge scales passes backward from the occiput to the dorsal fin, and occurs again in advance of the caudal fin. Similarly enlarged scales are present in a single row along the belly. These characters suggest its being referable to Traquair's genus *Canobius* rather than to *Rhadinichthys*, to which genus it was assigned when first described.\nThe three above-mentioned specimens supply the following information regarding the structural characteristics of the species:\n\nThe fish is small, robust, in general shape fusiform, reaching a length of 59 mm. with a depth in advance of the dorsal fin of 15 mm. The length of the head, including the opercular apparatus, is a little less than one-fourth of the total length. The snout is rounded and projects beyond the lower jaw. The orbit is large and placed far forward. The bones of the head are ornamented with well defined, short vermicular ridges, and tubercles, the former being generally in the direction of the length of the bone. The mandibular suspensorium is nearly vertical, and thus differs from that of *Rhadinichthys*, which is oblique. The dorsal and ventral fins are triangular and of fair size, the former slightly larger than the latter. In the ventral fin the base is about equal to the anterior and posterior margin. In the dorsal fin the base is proportionately larger and exceeds the posterior height. The dermal rays are delicate and seem to bifurcate distally; they are articulated, with the exception of the principal ones of the pectoral fins, which apparently are not articulated, at least proximally. Fulera occur on all the fins. The anal fin is opposite the dorsal, and the ventral pair is slightly closer to the anal than to the pectorals. The caudal fin is heterocercal and deeply forked, the body prolongation in the upper lobe tapering gradually. The scales are rather coarsely sculptured. The exposed surface of those on the flank, anteriorly, plate XI, fig. 4, is slightly higher than broad, but a little farther back the height and breadth are about equal. Their sculpture consists of two or three delicate but distinct well-defined ridges in the lower half of the surface, parallel to the lower margin, with three to five short, prominent ridges in the upper half of the scale; these latter are directed obliquely backward and downward in a somewhat divergent manner, from a slightly raised but ill-defined area confined to the upper, anterior portion of the scale. These short ridges do not, as a rule, reach the posterior margin, and often stop far short of it. The posterior edges of the flank scales are coarsely toothed, three or four being the usual number of the denticulations. In passing backward the surface ridges of the scales are reduced in number, as are also the denticulations of the posterior margins, plate XI, fig. 6, until posteriorly, in the small diamond-shaped scales of the caudal body prolongation, all trace of sculpture is lost and the surface of each scale is smooth. Enlarged, imbricating scales, plate XI, fig. 7, extend along the median line of the back, in a single row, from the head to the commencement of the dorsal fin, and from behind this fin to the caudal one, on which they are continued as large fulcra-like modifications, decreasing in size posteriorly. Their sculpture consists of well-marked longitudinal ridges, conforming, in a general way, to the curvature of the lateral margins. On the ventral surface a row of similarly enlarged and ornamented scales occurs between the ventral and anal fins, and between the latter and the base of the caudal, where it gives place to small fulcra on the lower anterior margin of the tail. Similarly enlarged scales appear to be present in advance of the ventral fins as far forward as the pectoral pair, but they are imperfectly seen and nothing definite can be said regarding them. The enlarged dorsal scales are ovoid in outline, broadly rounded in front, and slightly narrower behind. They decrease in size toward the head, the largest ones occurring in advance of the dorsal fin. The ventral ridge scales nearest to the base of the tail are particularly conspicuous. Of the flank scales the largest are those of the lateral line. Toward the back and belly the flank scales decrease in size, those of three or four rows on either side of the median dorsal row being decidedly smaller, plate XI, fig. 5, with a more sloping posterior border,\nand with only prominent downwardly oblique ridges composing the sculpture; the scales on either side of the median ventral line are similar to these small ones in size and sculpture.\n\n*Canobius modulus* has about the same length as *C. ramsayi*, Traquair, but is not so deep. The scales are differently sculptured, and in this respect the species is distinct from all other described ones of the genus. The specimen from Horton, N.S., is slightly smaller than the type specimen from Beliveau, N.B.\n\n**Measurements.**\n\n| Description                                                                 | MM   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|\n| Length of type specimen, plate XI, fig. 2                                    | 59   |\n| Depth in advance of dorsal fin                                              | 15   |\n| Length of head, including opercular apparatus                                | 13   |\n| Flank scales, exposed surface, vertically, four in a space of                | 4\u00b75  |\n| Flank scales, exposed surface, longitudinally, four in a space of            | 3\u00b775 |\n| Length of specimen from Horton, plate XI, fig. 3                             | 55   |\n| Depth midway between pectoral and anal fins                                  | 14   |\n| Depth in front of dorsal fin                                                | 12\u00b75 |\n| Dorsal ridge scales, in advance of dorsal fin, three in a space of           | 5\u00b75  |\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\n\n(1). 1851.
