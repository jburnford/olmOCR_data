We regret that at the present time we cannot make any exception to this rule.\n\nYou will no doubt be aware of the circular letter sent to all residential school principals and Indian superintendents concerned, regarding equipment which the Department would and would not purchase for these schools.

Neary, M.B.E.,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont., Canada.\n\nRe: Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nIn the following paragraphs, we hope to paint a word picture of the present circumstances at the Residential School, and to recall the situation as it was when we left on December 15th, 1943.\n\nThe situation at the present time is far from encouraging. We have had the poorest year yet as far as the farm is concerned. We are obliged to buy potatoes, carrots and other vegetables except turnips and beets. We have the least number of children in residence at any time since the school opened; fifty-three boys and seventy-five girls, a total of one hundred and twenty-eight. With payment on a per capita basis, we should have a total of one hundred and fifty in order to meet expenses. The spirit of cooperation among the various members of the staff while improving is certainly not what it was in the years preceding 1944. The amount of supplies from mops and brooms to food and clothing is not what it used to be. At the moment, we have about eight hundred dollars in the current bank account, which will just about pay the salaries of the farmer, assistant farmer, carpenter, engineer and night fireman for November and December. The Sisters of Charity nor the Principal can possibly get any salary till after the first of the year.\nIn the meantime, things that are absolutely necessary must be bought and these with already outstanding accounts cannot be met. It is going to be a lean Christmas.\n\nNow let us take a look at the school situation on January 17th, 1944, one month after we left. The balance in the Royal Bank on January 1st, 1944, was $2564.28, and $10,000.00 in Dom. Gov. Bonds. On January 17th, 1944, the per capita grant for the previous quarter was received amounting to $6,641.28, this making a total cash credit of $20,225.56. There were few, if any, unpaid accounts, and if there were, they were for small amounts. By July 5th, 1946, this amount along with the per capita allowance during that time was spent. When we came back on September 1st, 1946 we find about eleven hundred dollars in the bank, and outstanding accounts were in the vicinity of six thousand dollars.\n\nOn going over the accounts, we find the following:\n\n- June 26, 1945, Bread slicing or cutting machine, $210.50.\n- July 16, 1945, Brantford roofing for barn repairs, $349.07\n- August 16, 1945, I. Matheson & Co. Boiler for laundry, $590.00\n- Sept. 22, 1945, I. Matheson & Co. Boiler for dairy, $275.00,\n- Nov. 13, 1945, Can. Fairbank Morse, pumps, $1173.50\n- Jan. 10, 1946, James Donahue, roofing, $3,864.00,\n- Jan. 11, 1946, Fairbanks Morse, $649.98,\n- July 16, 1946, James Donahue, roofing, $3,749.00,\n- June 28, 1946, DeLaval Company, milking machine, $135.60 with $109.00 every six months with interest at 6% for the next 18 months. Total $462.60.\nUnder normal circumstances and the cooperation which existed between the principal of the school and members of the Department at Ottawa, prior to 1944, all of these items would have been taken as major repairs and replacements, and would have been paid for by the Department.\n\nThe ten thousand dollars which we had saved was intended for certain definite expenditures when the war was over. We find now that on,\n\nJan. 2/46, five thousand dollar bond was sold for $6198.83,\nMar. 23/46, one thousand dollar bond was sold for $1051.66,\nJuly 5/46, the remaining four thousand were sold for $4437.13.\n\nWithin seven months all the bonds were sold, to meet the expenses incurred. From there on, very little was spent for upkeep or repairs. There was a letter from the Department advising the sale of three thousand of the bonds, but by that time, all the bonds had been sold.\n\nNo doubt much of this expenditure was incurred without the approval of the Department; but most of it would have been necessary within a year or so. The time limit or guarantee of the roofing on the school was for fifteen years, and that time had elapsed. Possibly three or four hundred dollars in repairs would have extended the life of it for a few years. The same would apply to the pumps, and boilers. Within the past month, the Department has supplied the school with a potato peeler but the bread slicing machine was something even more useful.\nIn the matter of salaries, the farmer and carpenter-engineer have had their salaries increased from $90.00 to $120.00 per month; the assistant farmer from $80.00 to $100.00 per month. The Sisters of Charity are getting the same salary of $25.00 per month which they received back in 1920. When we think that young women from displaced persons camps in Germany, when they come to this country and work as domestics, are given at least $25.00 a month together with decent living quarters, the matter of the salaries paid to the Sisters does not seem fair. We do not mean to infer for one moment that this is directly the fault of the Department, but they way things are now we cannot bring their salaries up to what they should be. The salary of the principal is $125.00 per month.\n\nWhat we would like to know is, is there any way in which these particular expenditures could be reconsidered and the school reimbursed for the moneys spent on major repairs and major replacements. Under present circumstances, we do not see how we can possibly go on.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter serious consideration, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRt. Rev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal, Residential School.\n\nEnclosed please find invoices covering the particular expenditures.\nMicmac,\nHants County, N.S.\nJanuary 19, 1949.\n\nCol. F. F.

She is an old mare and can just about carry her own weight; she has a bad case of heaves.\n\nIt comes to this; either buy a new horse or a mower which can be attached to the tractor for the haying season. We think the better thing to do would be to purchase the mower. One would cost just as much as the other.\n\nThe mower we have in mind is a McCormick-Deering No. 21, new mower, with five foot cutter bar, and power take-off to fit the present McCormick Deering Tractor. This machine landed here would cost two hundred twenty-one dollars ($221.00). The local agent is Mr. A. J. Sheehan.\n\nWe have not a cut of this machine but a catalogue showing it will be sent to the Department in care of Mr. Bernard Neary showing all details. The catalogue should come from the Agent in Ottawa or from the plant in Hamilton.\n\nIf the Department will purchase this machine for us, we would like to be sure and have it on hand for the first week in July. By the way things look now the hay will be ready to cut at that time.\n\nThere are many such machines in this locality and they have proven very satisfactory.\n\nPlease let us know as soon as you can what are the views of the Department concerning the purchase of this machine.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRev.

A room originally intended for a classroom is being used as storage and for the pottery. This room which is identical to one of the classrooms would be, after a general clean-up, very suitable. I would suggest that the principal submit estimates for the preparation of this room.\n\nThere is no workshop and no space available for one.

Please let us know as soon as possible what it will cost to clean this room so that it will be suitable for classroom purposes.\n\nIf additional desks are required, you should forward a requisition. As you know, we now supply single chair desks, and these are made in three sizes, large, medium and small.\n\nIf it is possible to erect a workshop at a reasonable cost, we are hopeful of being able to secure the necessary funds. It would, therefore, be appreciated if you would make some enquiries and advise us as soon as possible the total expenditure that you consider would be necessary to provide a workshop. When replying, you should state the size of the building which you consider is necessary.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\n| DATE | SERVICE                                      | AMOUNT |\n|------|----------------------------------------------|--------|\n|      | Telephone service for Educational Buildings during the month of May as per attached statements | $3.80  |\n|      | Principal's Residence                        | $1.95  |\n|      | Teachers                                     | $1.85  |\n|      | Total                                        | $6.60  |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

The only one of the two suitable for a small water supply has been reconditioned at the factory for installation on the Tobique Reserve in New Brunswick. It is understood a third chlorinator was salvaged by Indian Affairs at the same time from the Airport, and it is suggested that Mr. Rice be requested to locate this third unit if available for possible use at the Residential School, and let us have a description with factory numbers in case it is decided the water should be chlorinated for safety.\n\nR.A.

When this voucher is submitted to the Education Division a copy of the same should be forwarded direct to the Welfare Division for purposes of record.\n\nIt is presumed that the cement you have on hand was that purchased from the Canada Cement Company in Montreal on Purchase Order No. 42853. If so, this fact should be stated on your voucher covering the transfer. It will be noted that the price charged was $3.29 per barrel (4 bags). The Welfare Division took advantage of the 10\u00a2 per barrel discount offered by the vendors for payment of the account within 20 days from date of shipment and this discount should be passed on to the Education Division in computing the cost of the cement transfer.\n\nH.

Edgecombe\nSupervising Engineer\nIn reference to the above and your letter of the 14th instant, the area was visited on Friday, the 16th, when in conjunction with Father Mackey and Mr. Rice, Superintendent of the Indian Reserve, conditions were gone into.\n\nWater for the school, farm buildings, and residences is obtained from a lake located about one-quarter mile west of the school, and from which it is pumped to the buildings.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by farm lands and is said to be spring fed. A heavy algae growth margins the shore, the depth of water shallow to some 12 to 16 feet at the lower end. Cattle are pastured and watered there, swimming takes place, ice out in winter, etc., showing that the lake is accessible to the public at all times. A culvert from road ditch leads the water directly to the lake which, however, can be diverted to other side of road draining away from the lake.\n\nThe intake is some fifty feet into the lake at a depth of ten feet and supplied with screens. The pump house is located three hundred yards from it, near the stables, dairy, barns, etc., and if connections not water tight might become source of pollution.\n\nFather Mackey stated some months ago that analysis of water showed M.F.M. of 3.7 and latterly 7.7, and is also unsatisfactory because of certain alkalies.\n\nDeep drilling for water in this has not proved satisfactory, as salt water is encountered. Shallow wells, this being a dry year, have mostly dried up.\n\nThe distance to source of available water is about four miles to the reserve or in other direction to springs.\n\nOn account of expense and other difficulties, these supplies are not recommended till further examination, but it is suggested that copper sulphate be used twice a year to free lake from algae, and that a chlo-\nAs the lake lies almost wholly within private property, it would be impossible to prohibit grazing and watering of cattle or to exclude the public.\n\nAnalysis of water samples will be followed shortly, as also photos of area.\n\nG.H.

Also suggested is the use of copper sulphate twice a year to free the lake from algae.\n\nThe estimated cost of supplying and installing a suitable hypochlorinator for this system is $500.00. If the chlorinator mentioned in the last paragraph of our memorandum of September 15th is available and suitable for this purpose, the cost will, of course, be considerably less. The cost of repairing and replacement of parts for the hypochlorinator salvaged for the Tobique water supply system was approximately $155.00 including freight, which may be considered as an estimate of cost for repair of a similar salvaged hypochlorinator for the Shubenacadie installation. With an allowance for installation the total estimated cost, using a salvaged unit if available and suitable, would be approximately $250.00.\n\nFurther action on this matter will be taken on your advice.\n\nA copy of the report on the sanitary survey at Shubenacadie Residential School is enclosed for the information of Indian Affairs.\n\nChief,\nEngineering & Construction Division\n\nR.

Rice, Superintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency,\nMICMAC, Hants County, N. S.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nRe:- Boiler Tubes.\n\nI beg to inform you that one tube in one of the two Kewanee Boilers is leaking. This is the first leak in these tubes since boilers were installed in 1928. We had a Mr. Cliff Annand from Truro look them over on Saturday and his opinion is that probably the other tubes are weakening. These tubes are extra heavy material and we suppose that they can only be purchased from Toronto. We hope to be able to block off this tube and continue for a time.\n\nWill it be necessary to have a purchasing order for a complete set of grate tubes from their branch in Toronto. The firing is done on these grate tubes, Boiler No. 903, Canadian Branch is Dominion Kewanee Boiler Limited, Toronto(2W), Ontario.\n\nKindly advice as soon as possible. The temperature this morning - 12\u00b0 below.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMsgr. J. P.

Rice,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMicmac, Hants Co., N.S.\n\nRe: Manual Training Workshop -\nShubenacadie Residential School.\nYour File 51/6-1-265\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant enclosing a letter received from the Rt. Rev. J.F. Mackey, Principal of the Shubenacadie Residential School, you should arrange for the immediate return of any amount unexpended from the accountable advance of $2,500.00 which was forwarded to you. I regret that present regulations do not permit us authorizing payment of repairs at the main residential school from funds provided for the erection of the manual training building.\n\nWith regard to the third paragraph of Msgr. Mackey's letter in which he refers to the $1,500.00 which we stated in our letter of August 5th would be available, you were requested to make enquiries and ascertain what labour you could obtain and at what price. We do not appear to have received any reply from you giving the information just mentioned. It is, therefore, presumed that the work has not yet commenced.\n\nIt appears that $200.00 will be required to put the classroom in good condition. It is presumed that most of this expenditure will be for labour, and you may authorize the Principal to proceed with this work at once. If the $1,300.00 which will be left out of the amount of $1,500.00 which we previously stated would be available, is not sufficient to complete the plastering, and if you can have the plastering finished before the end of the current fiscal year, namely March 31st, 1950, you should let us know what additional amount over and above the $1,300.00 will be required.\nYou should, of course, let us know immediately in what manner you propose to do the plastering. If it is to be day labour, you should state the name and address of the person whom you intend to employ and the rate per day or per hour. If by contract, it will be necessary for you to forward a firm tender so that we can submit it to the Minister's office.\n\nThe present fiscal year is drawing to a close, and it is expected that we will receive a reply from you by return mail. It would be appreciated if you could discuss this matter with Monsignor Mackey and forward this information in the near future.\n\nBernard F.

The tubes are seamless, cold drawn steel tubing, quite different from the ordinary boiler. We are following your instructions with the exception that the work will be done by Mr. Cliff Annand of Truro rather than by a firm from Halifax.\n\nThe distance from Halifax is double that of Truro and Halifax firms are quite accustomed to higher charges. We can assure you that a good job will be done at a reasonable cost.\n\nSince these boilers have been in use for the last twenty years, don't you think it would be wise to have a set ready for the second boiler? Mr. Annand assures me that he would make up this extra set and have it on hand should the tubes in the second boiler go. They will not likely last much longer.\n\nHoping that this will meet with your approval,\n\nI am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. P. Mackey,\nMgr. J. P. Mackey.\nFebruary 2nd, 1950.\n\nRt. Rev. Msgr. J.P.

Mr. Doug Mills submitted the price of $1.50 per hour for painting or he would take the job of painting the Children's refectory and classrooms and other rooms on the first floor for the sum of $1200.00. We figure that $300.00 would do all the plastering in the children's refectory and the first floor.\n\nIf these rates are approved by you we would like to start immediately at the new classroom and proceed as far as possible with $500.00 for plastering. Then, if we are permitted to allow Mr. Mills to go along with his contract of $1200.00, we hope to have the work finished by the end of the fiscal year. It seems to us that these rates are in line with union rates for plastering and painting in this Province.

Rice, Esq;\nSuperintendent;\nShubenacadie Indian Agency;\nMicmac, N.S.\n\nRe: Chlorinator Installed in Pump House,\nShubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nIn compliance with your request that I would assist with the installation of this Chlorinator, I along with Mr. Parker of the Residential School Staff started to make the installation on February 15th, 1950. We finished setting up this unit on the 16th of February and began to take tests on the 17th.\n\nThe first test taken showed a very high reading, in fact higher than 0.8. As the settings for feed of solution and speed were as suggested in the letter received from the chief of the engineering and construction division we decided to set the eccentric feed back to the first point on the scale. We continued to take tests at about two hour intervals all during the 17th but never again were able to get any reading at all. As the pumps were working practically continuously we thought that due to the fact so much water was being used in the buildings we were not getting any test for that reason. After the first jar of solution was used up we again made up a solution using 8 ozs HTH per 15 gallons. We again set the eccentric feed at 3.0 on the scale division. Even with this increased dosage we were unable to get any chlorine residual test with the test kit. Tests which I assisted in were made on February 17th, 20th, 25th and March 7th. Since then I have learned from Mr. Parker that if the water sample is left for a period of 24 hours the sample will show on the tester and is within the required residual of from 0.1 to 0.2 ppm. For our own information it would be appreciated\nif the engineering and construction division could give us some further information that would give us an idea how we may arrive at a test by allowing the water sample to set for ten minutes as suggested in their letter.\n\nUnder operating conditions at the school where the daily water consumption while I was there exceeded twenty thousand gallons per day a jar of solution just lasts from two to two and a half days.\n\nI might say that the Chlor-C-Feeder appeared to be operating very satisfactory.\n\nGeorge F.

However, since a sample of water tested after 24 hours showed a desirable residual, and since free chlorine decreases with time, it would appear that a too strong a dosage is being used. For a further trial it is therefore suggested that the length of the pumping stroke be reduced and tests for chlorine residual be made.\n\nThe amount of chlorine residual is the basis for determining the proper dosage and the practice is to allow approximately ten minutes for reaction on the impurities in the water.\n\nIt is expected that with familiarization with the testing unit and study of the instructions, that Mr. Johnson and Mr. Parker, of the school, will be able to satisfactorily operate the equipment. However, we are attaching a draft letter for your signature to Mr. Menzies, Chief, Public Health Engineering Division, Department of National Health and Welfare, requesting that when one of his engineers is in the vicinity that he visit the school and make any suggestions considered necessary.\n\nChief.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nMarch 27th, 1950\n\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Indian Residential School.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nVOTE 516 ALLOTMENT 10-691 ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, Hants County, N.S.\n\nPurpose for which required: Painting interiors of Residential School.\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 50 gals. | Semi-gloss inside white paint. |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

However, in future we will expect that care is taken in preparing requisitions and that proper quantities are requested.\n\nThe requisition for 50 gallons inside white paint is being forwarded to the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nThe contents of Mr. Johnson's letter of March 10th which you forwarded under cover of your letter of the same date were submitted to the Department of Resources and Development.

E. Tait\nDistrict Engineer\nTREATMENT OF WATER SUPPLY\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nSHUBENACADIE, N.S.\n\nOn September 19, 1949, a report submitted by Mr. G. H. Edgcombe recommended chlorination of the water supply used by the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie, N.S. Following receipt of this report, the Department of Resources and Development installed a hypochlorinator and initiated treatment of the supply.\n\nUnder date March 23rd, 1960, Mr. R. A. Gibson, Director, Department of Resources and Development, requested Mr. J. H. Menzies to have an engineer from this office examine the installation and establish a solution dosage which will give a satisfactory chlorine residual.\n\nOn April 3rd, 5th & 17th, visits to the Indian Residential School were made. Following is data concerning the treatment and pumping equipment and details of adjustments made in operation of chlorinator.\n\nPumping Equipment\n\nService Pump - Goulds, single stroke pump, having a capacity of 5000 g.p.h.\nDriven by a Wagner 5 H.P. electric motor - 1750 R.P.M.\n\nStandby Pump - Fairbanks Morse, duplex pump, having a capacity of 2500 g.p.h.\nDriven by a Westinghouse 3 H.P. electric motor, 1725 R.P.M.\n\nThis pump is also equipped with a Fairbanks Morse, 1-cylinder gasoline engine to be used during power outages.\n\nThese pump through a common main to two 1000 Gal. pressure tanks, connected in parallel. The distribution system is fed simultaneously from the two tanks. Pumping is intermittent, depending upon water consumption or pressure in the tanks - cut in pressure 28 lbs./sq. in.; cut out pressure 45 lbs./sq. in.\n\nChlorination\n\nChlorinator - Chloro-Feeder, Series 402, manufactured by Proportioniers Inc., Providence, R.I. Driven by a Leland Electric, \u00bd H.P. motor, 1725 R.P.M.\nA delivery rate range can be obtained by any or all of the following:\n\n1. Variation in strength of hypochlorite solution.\n2. Variation in length of piston stroke.\n3. Variation in rate of piston action. Three different pulley ratios are provided to increase or decrease the speed as desired.\n\nSolution - High Test Hypochlorite (H.T.H.), granular quality, tests 70% available chlorine.\n\nOperation of Chlorinator\n\nApril 3rd - Standby pump operating.\n\nStrength of Solution - 0.15% available chlorine.\nLength of Stroke - 0.125 inches.\nSlow speed ratio - 13 strokes/min.\nFeed of available chlorine - 0.63 p.p.m.\nChlorine residual after 20 min. - 0 p.p.m.\n\nIt was recommended that the strength of H.T.H. solution should be doubled. Other operating factors to remain unchanged.\n\nApril 4th -- 4:00 P.M.\n\nStrength of solution - 0.30%\nFeed of available chlorine - 1.26 p.p.m.\n\nApril 5th - Chlorine residual after 20 min. - 0 p.p.m.\nIncreased the stroke rate to 46 strokes/min.\nFeed of available chlorine - 4.4 p.p.m.\n\nApril 8th -- Chlorine residual after 20 min. (checked by operator) - 0.80 p.p.m.\nReduced the stroke rate to 26 strokes/min.\nFeed of available chlorine - 2.52 p.p.m.\n\nApril 13th & 15th - Chlorine residual after 20 min. (checked by operator) - 0.20 p.p.m.\n\nApril 17th - Chlorine residual after 20 min. - 0.25 p.p.m. (checked by writer)\n\nRemarks\n\nThe operation of the hypochlorinator was thoroughly discussed with Mr. L. Parker, the School Engineer. He is now familiar with the use of this equipment and with the standards required.\n\nIt was recommended that a chlorine residual check be run at least once a day.\n\nR.

I have contacted quite a number of painters but most of them are busy at their spring painting. I finally got in touch with the following: J. Rod Brown, Sr.; Donald Brown; Lawrence Brown; Joseph Brown; and Rod Brown, Jr. All these men belong to New Glasgow, N. S. and are recommended as first class painters.\n\nMr. Rod Brown, Sr. is in charge and the rest are his sons. He was up to look the job over and has agreed to accept same at $1.00 per hour for all the painters. He can have two or three of these men start work whenever we are ready and has agreed to have work finished at earliest date possible.\n\nI would recommend that he would be given this job. I might state that I contacted the painters at Shubenacadie and they are not interested in the job at all as they have more work than they can possibly handle at the present time.\n\nH. C.

In this connection, I would point out that we forwarded the Reverend Principal an accountable advance of $1,500.00 to pay the wages of the painters. It is our understanding that he would pay them and that you would then submit Credit Vouchers.\n\nIn submitting a Credit Voucher it is necessary that the Return of Labour Form should be signed by each workman, acknowledging receipt of the amount shown on the form.\n\nIf these Vouchers are intended as Credit Vouchers, it will be necessary to have each workman sign them, acknowledging payment made to him, and the Vouchers should be clearly marked \"Credit Voucher\".\n\nBernard F.

You will remember our conversation at Shubenacadie and the Minister would like you to prepare your report on the farms which we were discussing. The acreage, improvements including fencing, and the price should all be mentioned. I should like to have the report at an early date.\n\nWith kind regards, I am,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nD. B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nAs an old resident of this district, I was much pleased to hear the report that an Institution for the better education and training of Indians was to be located here.\n\nYour recent brief visit could not give you the best idea of the district and I regret that I did not have the opportunity of showing you some of the real farms and beauties of the district.\n\nThe best agricultural land lies along the Shubenacadie river, the high marshes along the river being unsurpassed in any part of this country, suitable for any sort of crop and cultivation, and yielding continually an annual hay crop of from 2 to 3 tons per acre without any cultivation, and have to my personal knowledge been doing so for upwards of fifty years.\n\nShubenacadie is the best agricultural district in the Province of N.S.\n\nA glance at map will show you that it is located exactly in the centre of the Province.\n\nIt has most excellent connections by Highway, Rail, Stages, Telegraph and Telephone with all parts.\n\nIt is located on the C.N.Ry., and the main highway through the Province.\n\nIt is one of the largest mail distributing points.\n\nThe Ry traffic at this station is greater than any station between Halifax and Moncton with the exception of Truro and Antigonish.\n\nThe Indian Reserve of 1600 acres I think one of the largest in the Province, and excellent agricultural land is located within 5 miles of this station.\n\nShubenacadie has never been favoured one cents worth by either the Federal or Local Governments.\n\nWe have the County Exhibition Grounds but a few of our citizens put it up ourselves.\n\nI have no desire to butt in or presume to advise you but I know the Province pretty well, and have no hesitation in saying that this is a most desirable location for your institution.\n\nThirty-five or forty years ago my father was Indian Agent here, and Shubenacadie was always rather regarded as headquarters of the Indians, and it would as a matter of history and sentiment seem to be quite proper that the institution should be located here.\n\nI realize fully that it would mean very much to this district if this Institution be located here and feel that\nI would be deficient in my duty as a public spirited citizen if I neglected to put the matter fairly before you.\n\nI have already written Mr. Ilsley, our representative on the matter and I know it will mean much to Mr. Ilsley if it be located here.\n\nAs you are aware we only have two representatives from N.S., The Hon. Minister of Defence and Mr. Ilsley, and I have not the slightest doubt that Mr. Ralston would confirm every word I have said to you as to the advantages of this location.\n\nFrom what I have been able to learn from the Indian Act here, while I feel he might not tell me all he knows, I assume you require a good large farm in a good location where it would show up well to the public, located on the main highway, with unfailing water supply for such an institution, and within a short distance from the Ry Depot, Post Office, Telegraph Office.\n\nI know such a location would do much to popularize the movement, and tend to the success of the institution.\n\nI have already written Mr. Boyd Supt for N.S., along this line and giving him names of five farm owners with farms within 1 mile of the depot and Post office here, and I take it that these would all be inspected by competent impartial men of your Dept and the Best taken.\n\nUnfortunately or fortunately I am one of these owners, and while I protest my first thought is to get the Institution located at Shubenacadie, and at the best location in Shubenacadie and I feel that I may be rather handicapped in urging Shubenacadie as the location because of the fact that I am a seller, and it might be thought my urgency was self interest.\n\nI will therefore take a broader ground and say that I would be willing to place my farm and its location in competition with any location in Nova Scotia.\n\nI have one of the finest farms in N.S., On the main highway, with a good elevation, overlooking the highway, the C.N. Ry and the Shubenacadie River all of these three running parallel past the front of my farm.\n\nIt has an unfailing water supply, and could easily be made one of the show places of the Province.\n\nOn its front it has 32 acres of the finest marsh on the River as referred to above.\n\nIt is a large farm, some 400 acres. The frontage adjoining highway being cultivated lands, and the rear wilderness.\n\nIt is two weeks earlier than any farm I know of.\n\nI will sell the front or cultivated part and keep the wilderness part, or will sell part of the front retaining the buildings, will sell it with or without the marsh.\n\nIn fact would do most anything to get this Institution located at Shubenacadie, and will not feel a bit sore if your Dept after fair inspection prefer some other farm to mine.\n\nGive Shubenacadie a chance, because it has hitherto been neglected.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Charles Stewart Returns\nFrom Maritimes Trip\n\nOttawa, June 8.\u2014The site for the new Indian boarding school in Nova Scotia has not yet been selected; a further investigation is made, declared Hon. Charles Stewart, Minister of Indian Affairs, who has just returned from a trip to the Maritimes. A number of likely locations for the schools were inspected by Mr. Stewart in the course of his tour.\n\nThe work of moving the Indians from outside the limits of Sydney, N.S., to the reserve there under new reserves there was proceeding very satisfactorily, stated Mr. Stewart. He had been told in the course of the summer all the Indians would be removed to the new reserve, comfortably housed, with school accommodations provided on the reserve.\nShubenacadie, N. S., June 6th., 1927.\n\nA. J. Boyd, Esq.,\nSuperintendent Indian Affairs N. S.,\nCannes, C. B.\n\nDear Mr. Boyd:\n\nI was pleased to learn that through your effort there is a likelihood of an institution for Indians being established here, and regret that I did not at the time know of your visit.\n\nI do not wish to butt in anywhere, but I presume that the first thing in your mind is a suitable location, at a reasonable price, for the popularity of the movement will depend much on the location.\n\nI need not say to you that Shubenacadie village situate on the C. N. Ry. and on the main highway from Halifax to Truro, exactly in the centre of the Province, the best farming community in the Province, with excellent connection by Rail, Main highway, Stages, Telegraph and Telephone with all parts must be a desirable location, and the Indian Reserve of some 1800 acres is only five miles distant.\n\nAs a lifelong resident of the place, and for many years past Appraiser for the Canada Permanent Corporation I have perhaps a better knowledge of the farms here, and their values than others could have, AND I have no axe to grind.\n\nI do know however if you can secure a suitable location and build this institution near our Town, and close to Ry Depot, Post Office, Tel and Tel offices Churches etc that it would mean much to the appearance and popularity of the Institution, and to the future of this Town.\n\nI can well believe that a location on the main highway with a good elevation, ample water supply and opportunity for sewerage and with a good view would be the ideal, and several such can be obtained here, within \u00bd mile of the Ry. Depot and Post Office.\n\nWhile I repeat, That I have no axe to grind, and my first thought is the Best interests of the institution and this Town and community, I beg to say that I have one of the finest farms in the Province, within sight of the Town, less than \u00bd mile from Ry Depot, on the main highway, at a good elevation overlooking the Shubenacadie River and in full view from the Railway, most excellent situation, splendid soil, about two weeks earlier than most farms, ample water supply for an institution and sewerage easily available, 32\nacres of the renowned Shubenacadie River marsh, the most prolific and easily cultivated of farm lands and yielding a continual annual crop of hay without cultivation; small orchard, a splendid flat for an institutional athletic grounds, a large barn capable of housing 50 head of cattle and storing 150 tons of hay and located where in my judgement it would not interfere with your other buildings.\n\nI only bought farm last year. It had been rather neglected, but cut 120 Tons Hay and some grain crop but I expect in two years to be making it produce 200 tons hay besides other crops.\n\nThe whole farm contains around 400 acres, but I would sell the front or cultivated portion say 150 to 200 acres and retain the rear and wood lands for myself.\n\nNow all this does not sound as though I have no axe to grind; But the fact remains that I am not anxious to sell it.\n\nBesides there are a number of other places near the town, which can be bought and one or two of them at low prices.\n\nS. J. Etter, George Gay, Fred Etter, Joseph Flemming, all have good locations and are worth while looking over, to get the best for the money.\n\nMy farm could easily be made one of the show places of the country, the view of and from the farm cannot be excelled.\n\nThe marsh alone is valued $200.00 per acre or $6400.00 but if you would not want the marsh I will keep it, and sell the upland portion, or any part of that.\n\nWhile as I have said I am not anxious to sell, I am anxious that you get a property that will suit you entirely and within \u00bd mile of our town, as I know that would mean a great deal to the future of this community.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) Robert Gass.\nRiver Bourgeois, N. S.,\nJune 11th, 1927.\n\nDear Doctor Scott,\n\nI enclose herewith for your information a letter which explains itself. Although the gentleman who wrote it, Robert Cass, Esq., of Shubenacadie, N. S., protests that he has \"no axe to grind\", yet I think that the property, which he owns and describes, should not be overlooked in selecting the best site for the proposed residential school for Indian children.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., Litt. D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nP. S. I am forwarding original of the enclosure to Hon.

The Honourable Mr. Stewart also received a letter from Mr. Gass. Would you kindly report on his farm when you are reporting on others.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nD.B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nJuly 11, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Lawlor:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Russell Perrier, Superintendent of Indian Education, and Mr. R. Gurney Off, Department Architect, will arrive in Shubenacadie on Tuesday morning the 19th instant, at 10:15 o'clock. They have been instructed to look over the properties that are mentioned in your letters of the 17th and 22nd ultimo with a view to selecting a building site and purchasing a farm. Please arrange to meet them and to give whatever help you can. It might be well to notify the owners of suitable properties.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nD.B. Lawlor, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nShubenacadie,\nN.S.\nShubenacadie N.S. July 14th 1927\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDow Supt Genl Of Indian Affairs.\n\nRe my former letters and the proposed purchase of a farm here by your Dept., I have been advised that your Engineers will shortly visit this place to make selection.\n\nWhile you have a rough sketch of several offers I made through local Indian Agent, in making such sketch I was rather at a loss not knowing exactly what you required.\n\nHowever I wish to remind you that I will allow you to select any portion of my farm you may consider most desirable for your purpose, with or without buildings, and will sell any portion you may select, without enhancing prices, and really at perhaps a little less than value.\n\nI not only wish to sell the farm but as an old resident and citizen who has always worked for the best interest of the community, I would like to see you get the best location possible for your institution.\n\nI knew I have one of the best farms in the country. THE BEST SOIL, sandy loam free from stones easily cultivate and very productive. Best location, fronting on the Main Provincial Highway which advantage none other has, within a short distance of Post Office, Ry Station Telegraph Office Churches Schools District Exhibition and athletic grounds. AMPLE and Never failing water supply and most convenient and inexpensive sewerage opportunity.\n\nGood farm buildings or plenty farm and excellent building sites without buildings, which no other obtainable has.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nRobert Faso.\n\nIf desired you could obtain a railway siding just across highway opposite first farm.\nShubenacadie, N.S.,\nJuly 22, 1927.\n\nWe agree to sell this fall our farm, composed approximately of:\n\n1. \u2014 17 acres marsh land,\n2. \u2014 65 acres upland on which the bldgs are situate\n3. \u2014 50 acres wood lot.\n\nbut not including this years crop & all chattels, personal effects for the sum of ($7000) Seven thousand dollars.\n\nWitnesses:\nD.B. Fowler\nGeorge Gay\nMinnie Gay\nShubenacadie N.S.\nJuly 22/27\n\nWe hereby agree to sell our house and lot situated on the Gay Property, Maitland Road, Shubenacadie, to the Department of Indian Affairs, for the sum of four thousand ($4000) dollars, possession to be given them May 1st, 1928.\n\nSigned:\nBertha E. Etter\nAllan S. Etter\nOn Tuesday, the 19th instant, we arrived at Shubenacadie, N.S., to examine properties there for the proposed Indian residential school. J. L. Ilsley, LL.B., of Kentville, M.P. for Hants-Kings, met us there and assisted until a final selection was made. At the outset, we had a preliminary look at the various sites that had been brought to your attention by letter, and, without much hesitation, we soon confined our interest to the Etter and Gay farms, which were carefully examined. Certain local persons with some influence were desirous that the Davis property be included in the final examination but Mr. Ilsley and ourselves could not agree that it was suitable enough to be worthy of comparison with the other two.\n\nIt was considered advisable to proceed to Halifax for the 20th and 21st, for the purpose of meeting the church authorities and to look into building materials and sources of supply. The final selection of a site was postponed until Friday, the 22nd. On that date the Etter and Gay farms were examined with considerable care. While the first named property appeared to possess more possibilities as a productive farm\u2014a much wider choice of acreage being available for purchase\u2014from every other angle the Gay property was more suitable.\n\nThe Gay property is situate one-half mile from the station at Shubenacadie\u2014immediately on the outskirts of the village. The site is reached by a good road leading directly from the village\u2014a distinct advantage over the other properties, in that it is not necessary to cross the railroad when travelling to and from Shubenacadie. When it is pointed out that this railroad is the main line of the C.N.R., over which there is heavy traffic, the importance of this to the staff and children will be understood. The farm consists of approximately 65 acres of cultivated upland, 50 acres of woodland\u201410 of which have already been cleared sufficiently for pasture, and 17 acres of marshland, which produces hay perennially without attention. The properties surrounding it appear to be clean and well cultivated. We consider this Gay farm, which consists of 130 acres, more or less, large enough for the needs of the proposed institution for some time to come. The land appears to be clean and productive and is in one block. It should be mentioned that a fresh water lake, suitable for bathing, boating and fishing, just touches the northern boundary of the Gay farm.\n\nOn this property is an ideal building site. It commands a view of the countryside in all directions and the building will be seen from the railroad and from all of the\nfive roads running in and out of Shubenacadie. The site selected also provides ample opportunity for excellent drainage and water supply, the Shubenacadie river being less than 100 yards from the spot for the building. Electric current and telephone connection are available.\n\nWe wish to point out that it was impossible to locate a building site on the Etter property which was at all close to the railroad or main highway, and the drainage facilities were not at all comparable with those of the Gay property. This also applies with more force to the Dewis property, but, in addition, the Dewis property's only possible site for the building was immediately over disfiguring gravel pits and generally rough ground. It was represented to us that a siding which was close to the Dewis property would be a big advantage. However, this feature was not worthy of serious thought as all materials would have to be unloaded from the cars into a vehicle and hauled up a difficult grade to the building. The Gay property, without railroad to cross and only a few hundred yards farther from a railroad station, had the distinct advantage of being near an active office and business community. We were warned by certain interested parties that the road leading to the Gay property, which happens to be the main road to Maitland, was flooded at certain seasons of the year. We made several enquiries from independent sources in this connection and we learned that the road was flooded for an hour or two a day in the spring of certain years only, but that it was not impassable even when flooded.\n\nMr. S. J. Etter wanted $12,500 for his farm, which consists of 270 acres. A lot of the value of this property is tied up in the buildings, the most important of which would have to be removed in the event of an Indian residential school being erected there. Mr. George Gay, in his written offer to Mr. Indian Agent Lawlor, asked $9,000 for his 130 acres, but we were able to secure from him an option on the property at $7,000, provided he be allowed to harvest this year's crop. He promised to do the fall ploughing and otherwise prepare the fields for next year's farming operations.\n\nWe wish to recommend that the farm of George Gay be surveyed at an early date, with a view to determining not only the exact size of the property but also the best building site. If everything is found as has been represented to us and the title is satisfactory, we believe it advisable to arrange the purchase. In our opinion it is easily the best property near Shubenacadie for an Indian residential school. When title is being searched, it should be ascertained what privileges the owners have in connection with the lake that touches the property and if there is a right of way around its southern extremity.\n\nSome time ago, approximately one-eighth of an acre of this farm was sold for the site of a residence. Three\nor four years ago, the purchaser, Mr. Allan S. Etter, erected a residence, which would make a very suitable home for the farm instructor and other able members of the staff of the proposed school. This residence and lot, which is situate on the entrance road to the property, can be purchased for $4,000, which sum is less than would be required to erect a suitable farmer's residence. We strongly recommend that this property, also, be purchased.\n\nApproved,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell A.

S. To hand today and note that it is essential that the survey should be completed as soon as possible.\n\nIn reply would say that the delay in completing this survey has been almost entirely due to the exceptionally wet weather for the entire late summer and fall, which has constantly interfered with my arrangements and caused not only loss of time but has in consequence made it necessary for me to divide as best I could the fine weather among several surveys, all of which should, and under ordinary conditions would, have been completed at least a month since.\n\nThis survey has been finished, with the exception of one day's field work rechecking some of the levels, and correcting one of the rear boundaries of the lot which is a section of the \"base\" or rear line of an old Grant of which the property in question is a part, and the proper establishment of which has proved both difficult and tedious to an extent altogether out of proportion to its length as forming one of the Gay boundaries.\n\nI am preparing two plans, one of the whole property, and a second on a larger scale showing the immediate site of the existing buildings, river, boundary between intervale and upland, and road frontages, on which\nthe five foot contour lines are also shown.\n\nThese plans will require about three days for completion, so that given a favorable day for the field work required during the present week, I should be able to have the plans ready for mailing by the 17th of the present month, at latest.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

S., which includes the road, River frontage opposite the buildings, the existing buildings including those on the lot sold to Allen Etter, the site of the proposed new buildings and drainage to the river.\n\nOn this plan I also show five foot Contour lines around the three sides of the comparatively level area which is the highest point and supposedly the site of the new buildings.\n\nThe Contour lines have not been carried around the rear of this last mentioned height as the ground there is rough and more or less broken and slopes more rapidly toward the small Pond shown northwardly of the buildings between which and the intervale there is a low and uncleared marsh or swamp.\n\nThe small scale plan of the entire property, with description according to the boundaries existing on the ground and located by my survey, will go forward by tomorrow's mail or by that of the day following, depending upon how soon I am able to get it from the blue printing concern.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I believe it advisable to postpone adding to the farm which we are now about to purchase until after the school is turned over to the church authorities to manage. The Department will then be guided by whatever the Reverend Principal requests. The marsh land on the Gay property and the wood pasture may be quite sufficient for the school live stock for the time being.\n\nI may say that Mr. McKenzie's survey is now to hand and, as everything appears to be satisfactory, I am about to arrange with the Department of Justice to have their agent search title and prepare the necessary papers.

Gay Property\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI am forwarding you by today's mail three blue line prints of Plan of Survey of the property situate at Shubenacadie, N.S. owned by George Gay which has been purchased, or is under consideration of Purchase by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI also forward with the before mentioned prints a description of the property according to the boundaries existing and now generally recognized as established, as the same have been located by my recent survey.\n\nThe several, but in general unimportant, differences between the boundaries of the property as found or established on the ground, and as described in former conveyances have been gone into fully in the Report which accompanies the Plan and new description.\n\nI very much regret the delay that has occurred in the completion of this survey and plan, but an unprecedentedly wet late summer and fall and the necessity for giving partial attention to other unfinished work that was also, and for the same reason, long overdue, added to the altogether disproportionate amount of time which was taken up in attempting to adjust the small but annoying differences between adjoining owners, and to finally establish boundaries that would not only be accepted by those owners, but could if necessary be defended and maintained in the event of\nany action being brought at any future time before the Courts, and has resulted in the work only being now finally completed.\n\nThis matter of difficulties and adjustments has been gone into fully in the Report referred to, and I will here refer only briefly to the small area which the line B-C on the Plan cuts off from Mr. Gay's fenced but uncultivated clearing.\n\nMy reasons for finally establishing that line in the position in which I have placed it are given in detail in the report referred to, and I will only speak of it here in so far as to say that I am satisfied that it has been placed where any Court, having before it full evidence such as is contained in the old Deeds and local information, would uphold it as placed.\n\nThe small area (844 feet in length by 32 feet wide at one end and 21.8 feet at the other) which the present description does not include can probably be held by Mr. Gay by his own possession and that of his predecessors in title, but as that is a matter of some uncertainty and as the area and importance of the land involved are both practically negligible I would suggest that if it is thought desirable to include that lot in the conveyance, it should go in under a separate Quit Claim Deed as Mr. Gay is hardly in a position to safely include it in the Warranty.\n\nThe field notes, bill, and diary, will go forward in the course of a few days.\n\nThe large scale plan covering the buildings and surrounding area for a sufficient distance to contain information as to contours, location of roads, river, buildings now on the ground, etc. required by the Architect has already gone forward.\n\nShould anything further be required I will be glad to furnish it.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nReport in Connection with Survey of\nLands situate at Shubenacadie, Hants County,\nNova Scotia and owned by George Gay.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with my recent survey of above referred to property I beg to submit the following.\n\nUpon receipt of instructions from your Department to proceed with the survey of the above mentioned farm property I, as instructed, saw Mr. D. B. Lawlor, Resident Indian Agent at Shubenacadie and had him procure for me the description of the property as the same appears in the Deed from Ezekiel Pines to George Gay which is dated July 18, 1918.\n\nAs upon looking over the front or cultivated portion of the lands I found it to be for the most part fenced and occupied, and as I was informed that the boundaries were well established and marked, I did not at that time consider it necessary to procure from the Registry of Deeds at Windsor the older conveyances in order to check the various descriptions through which the title passes from the original Grantee, Hamilton, to the present owner.\n\nI have a fair general knowledge of the titles and what may be spoken of as the \"state\" of property boundaries in that locality, and I already knew that the lands in question are a portion of a grant of 1900 acres granted by the Crown to Colonel Frederick Hamilton and James and Gustavus Ducaret June 8, 1763, Book 4 page 202 Crown Lands Office Records.\na considerable portion of which was purchased by one Snide, an early settler in the District and an ancestor of the man of the same name who owns the Farm adjoining and north east of the Gay farm. Snide later set off by Deed or Will to certain of his Heirs the two portions of the original purchase, one of which is now owned by Gay and the other, adjoining Gay, by Allison McDonald.\n\nThat the description contained in Gay's Deed has been copied from a much older, probably the first, conveyance may be inferred from the reference to the Mill, Sluice, and roads.\n\nThe Mill has not been in existence within the memory of anyone now living but is said to have stood at approximately the point where the small Bridge is shown on the plan. This Brook was formerly known as \"Saw Mill Brook\" and some old timbers are still to be seen at low tide partially buried in the mud which appear to have been part of a building. The position of the Sluice is, of course, not known.\n\nI have taken as the place of beginning the point at which ordinary high tide is intersected by a line which is approximately at right angles to the shore and Old Road at the point of termination of the fence on the eastern margin of the present Public Road leading from Shubenacadie to Maitland. The distance from the point of beginning as I have so fixed it to the center of the eastern or downstream rail of the small Bridge is 390 feet; that called for in the description from the Sluice to the same point is 419.8' or 6.36 chains.\n\nI think the difference in distance may be disregarded as the starting point is reasonably well fixed by the junction of the Old and the Present roads and may be regarded as correctly located.\n\nFrom the place of beginning the description calls for a course following the margin of the Indian Road 31.50 chains, to the Maitland Road and on that road an additional 7.00 chains to the point at which the line running to the rear of the lot is supposed to commence, or a total of 2541 feet; my measurement for the same distance is 2501 feet, but the difference may be and probably is due in part to my point of commencement being at ordinary high tide mark instead of at low tide, which would account for a part of it, and in part to the uncertainty as to the line upon which the first measurement was made as the \"margin of the road.\" The road has been widened and to some extent straightened within recent years, and the River Bank has also altered more or less.\n\nI found the distance from the center of the Indian Road to the point where the fence between Gay and McDonald intersects the Maitland road to be only 451.7 feet or 6.84 chains from the center, as against the 7.00 chains called for, from the north eastern margin of the Indian road.\nIt was not until this point had been reached that I learned that this line was claimed by McDonald, the abutting owner, to be wrongly placed and upon his property.\n\nMr. McDonald informed me that his Deed was not in his possession, but arranged that I was able to get it, pending which I continued the survey around the River and north east sides and across the Base.\n\nThe lines on the north east side are marked by fences or posts, that between the Wallace Gay and A. Grant lot and George Gay by the latter, the remains of an old fence, that between Gay and the Snide property by a post and wire fence which as will be apparent from the Plan, is in reasonably close agreement with the description contained in the Deed, and which while not perfectly straight throughout its entire length is so nearly so as to justify my having given only two bearings on it, one from the margin of the marsh to the Maitland road and a slightly different one from the road to the rear line.\n\nOn the rear line, which is supposed to and should coincide with the Base, or north west line of the Hamilton Grant, I again met with difficulty.\n\nThe line here was neither well marked nor otherwise satisfactory and was approximately ten degrees off the bearing.\n\nThe rear, or base, line of the Hamilton Grant, of which this line is a short section is described as 206.00 chains in length and is abutted on its outer or north western side by numerous smaller lots granted at a great many different periods. The Hamilton Grant has been split up into a number of lots such as those with which we are concerned, the widths of which on the base line are in general about ten chains.\n\nAs a natural consequence of these conditions the original Hamilton line has probably been lost for many years and the line now on the ground is the natural result of many disconnected surveys at various times of short sections each covering only the distance upon which some one property was bounded by that line, and as a result the Hamilton base at the present time appears to be instead of the straight line called for, a series of short lines, differing in bearing from one to three or four degrees.\n\nFor this and the further reason that this line, despite its irregularities, is for the most part recognized, fenced, occupied to, and in many places cultivated to, and neither the original corners of the grant nor any other one point upon it can be taken as more positively than another fixing the original\nI was informed that that portion of the Gay farm situate on the northwest side of the Road, was surveyed in or about 1897 by my Father, the late James McKenzie, and on looking up his Field Notes which are in my possession I found that he had started on the road at a point corresponding to that shown and marked \"B\" on my Plan and ran back the distance that I have taken, Viz: 3485 feet, and that he also ran the Base line from the last named point north eastwardly to a point at which he crosses the fence on the rear line of the Snide Property which was then and is now on the margin of the former clearing supposed to be on or up to the Base line.\n\nI would say here that I am inclined to attach considerable importance to my Father's location of the lines in question, as apart from the fact that he was extremely careful in such matters he was then a man of upwards of seventy-five years of age, and had a lifetime intimate acquaintance and familiarity with the titles and lot boundaries in that district.\n\nAccording to my information the line set up by my Father was undisputed until about 1911 or 1912 at which time the Farm now owned by Mr. Gay was owned by one Cox who employed a surveyor named Archibald to resurvey the property.\n\nThe fence at the road shown on my Plan opposite and near the point \"B\", and marked \"Fence S.50\u00b0 27' E., 844 ft.\" is said to be on the line set up Mr. Archibald, and the dotted line in rough prolongation of the fence (on which I found some line marks or Blazes corresponding in age to about the date of the Archibald survey) terminates at a Birch tree marked apparently for a corner and shown on the Plan near the point\"C\". This Birch tree, I am informed by Mr. McDonald, was the corner established by Mr. Archibald, who at the same time continued his survey across the rear and near the point \"D\" on the Plan, set a squared wooden post to mark the corner on the Snide lot. That post is still standing. See Plan.\n\nThe bearing of this lastmentioned line is now N.38\u00b025'E. and were it not for the corners having been established I would incline to the opinion that it was a trial line.\n\nThe base line of the Hamilton lot was originally N.38\u00b0 E. and I would expect to find, and do find on the more reliable lines in that grant, nine degrees variation, which would make the bearing of that base line at this date N.47\u00b0E., or differing by approximately nine degrees from the bearing taken by Mr. Archibald.\n\nThere is of course the possibility that the matter of the magnetic change was overlooked and the line set up on the original bearing.\nThe wire fence shown on the plan near the Point \"C\" was erected by Guy McKay whose land abuts on the Hamilton Grant as shown and it is said to have been put up by Mr. McKay on the supposition that the line as set up by Mr. Archibald had been properly located.\n\nThe fence on the rear of the Snide lands, shown running north eastwardly from the point \"D\", has also been supposed to be on the line but is in general irregular and appears from the evidence of the old clearing on the Snide Property to have been \"swung\" in near the Gay lot to meet the Archibald corner. The intermediate piece on the rear of the Gay property is unfenced.\n\nI am also informed that immediately the Archibald line from \"B\" to \"C\" had been set up the, at that time, owner of the Gay Farm, Cox, cut the wood on the strip between that and the older line.\n\nThis appears to be, to at least some extent, true, but I succeeded finding a number of line marks corresponding in age to the date of the McKenzie survey, viz: 1897 (See noted on Plan) and after obtaining Mr. McDonald's Deed I had him point out as closely as he was able to do, the position of the McKenzie corner, some 30 feet at least north eastward of the corner I have set up, which last is some 25 feet north eastwardly of the Birch known as Mr. Archibald's corner.\n\nAfter I had made a \"needle\" survey of practically the entire length of the Hamilton Base, and had looked up everything I was able to locate in either my own files which extend back to about 1900 and in my Father's notes of former surveys that could have any possible bearing on the case, particularly with regard to occupation, came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to take the time and incur the expense incidental to going to Windsor in order to search the Records and obtain copies of the older descriptions as the difficulty appeared to me to be one that could and should be settled from the information at hand and for the most part dependent upon possession, or at least occupation, etc.\n\nThe two doubtful lines, viz: \"B-C\" and \"C-D\" have been established as shown on the plan as follows:\n\nThe most definite point mentioned in the description and the one least likely to have altered its position is the point on the Maitland Road distant 7.00 chains north eastwardly from the Old Indian Road. This is the point \"B\" on the Plan and appears to agree with that from which Jas. McKenzie started in 1897 at which time the stake and stones called for were probably still in existence. The road has been widened within the past four or five years which probably explains why they are not now to be found.\n\nIn selecting this point I give the doubt as to the width\nthe Indian Road in so far as possible to the Gay property, taking the margin of the Indian Road as that of the \"travelled way\" between ditches, twenty-three feet or at eleven and one-half feet from the center of the travelled way. I consider that at the time the description originated, that may and probably was, the margin from which the measurement was taken.\n\nI assume that the direction of the line called for from the point \"B\" to \"C\" and described in the Deed as N.53\u00b0W. is intended to be parallel with the end lines of the original Hamilton Grant and with other division lines; if so, that line should be north 50\u00b0 West at this date (to the best of our ability to decide so rather doubtful a question.)\n\nI also assume that the bearing was observed at the point \"B\" and I therefore have determined the course by carefully observing a bearing of north 50 degrees west at that point.\n\nThe bearing shown on my plan and given in the new description for this line is north 49 degrees 55 minutes west and is the bearing as deduced from the meridian observed at the point of commencement of the survey, \"A\" on the plan. The difference of five minutes being that between the two observations. The deduced bearing from the first meridian is given on the plan and in the description in order that it may correspond with other bearings shown which are deduced from the meridian observed at \"A\".\n\nIn other words N.49\u00b0 55'W. is the deduced bearing of the line in question, and N.50\u00b0W. the needle reading observed at the point \"B\".\n\nThis line passes through two or three old blazes supposed to be those made by James McKenzie at the rear of the clearing and some distance farther, before entering the cut out area, more blazes are found from four to ten feet to the north east.\n\nThe position of these marks indicate that the McKenzie line bore more northwardly and confirms Mr. McDonald's statement as to the approximate position of the corner.\n\nMy line passes 21.8 feet north east of the angle in the fence at \"B\" and 32 feet north eastwardly of the angle at the back of the clearing, 844.4 feet from the fence on the road margin, thus cutting a strip of the dimensions given off the enclosed pasture occupied by Mr. Gay.\n\nSome marks of a line believed to be that made by Archibald are found approximately in prolongation of the fence and the line is quite well marked near the Birch tree marked for a corner at \"C\".\nThe Base Line across the Gay Lot was established as follows:\n\nI was able to find a few old line marks probably the line set up by Jas. McKenzie, the bearing of which appeared to be S.47\u00b0W. by the needle. I ran a trial line on that bearing in both directions and found that near the intersection with \"B-C\" I was some feet to the right (N.W.) of another line tree which I had not previously found.\n\nI then extended the trial line (by compass using the needle only) in the reverse direction N.47\u00b0E. and found that it crossed the Snide line at \"D\" 13 feet from the angle in the fence and 29 feet from the post set by Archibald for the corner and marked on its North east face \"1911\" and on the South east face \"T.C.\" (Thos. Cox)\n\nAs the bearing as given by the needle was that showing the variation I had expected, I continued the trial line across the Snide lot about half a mile to and along a portion of the line where the fence has been well established for many years and the line has been and is cultivated to.\n\nI found that while the fences were not straight and my trial line crossed first the Snide Base to a point some 12 to 15 feet north west of it at one point, it later crossed back and was undoubtedly bearing too far to the east by about one degree.\n\nI also found the needle to be inconstant and in some places to read N.48\u00b0E.\n\nUpon connecting the trial line with my Transit Survey I found the deduced bearing of the latter to be N.48\u00b0 5' east, and the different needle to correspond closely to that bearing except at and near my first Compass Station where there appears to be some local attraction.\n\nSome part of the error is therefore instrumental, faulty needle. The transit needle checks up with several of my other instruments and may therefore be considered correct.\n\nMaking the correction required the line starts from the point of intersection with the fence on the Snide line (\"D\" on plan) at 11 feet from the angle in the fence and 27 feet from the Archibald Post; thence running south 47 degrees west (deduced bearing) it follows the old blazes, and at 660 feet, or 10.00 chains, intersects the line \"B-C\" at 3485 feet from the wire fence on, or approximately on, the road margin at \"B\".\nThe shortage in distance on the Base, viz: 25 links, or 16.5 feet, is less than that were the James McKenzie corner accepted, and it is not improbable that it is due to encroachment from the north eastern side.\n\nTo sum up the situation I would say that I have entirely disregarded the Archibald Survey and also find myself unable to accept the McKenzie line on the course marked \"B-C\" on plan, although I do accept the latter survey on the Base line.\n\nThe reasons, or line of argument, will be sufficiently clear from the foregoing, but may be further explained as follows:\n\nAs to the rejection of the McKenzie and Archibald lines.\n\n1st-The Archibald line \"B-C\". There is nothing in any of the former conveyances of which I am aware, or have seen to support or justify Mr. Archibald's location of this boundary. I am, I believe reliably informed that Mr. Archibald was employed by Mr. Cox the owner of the property to be surveyed, and that no notice was given the abutting owner, McDonald. The surveyor was unaware of the existence of an older line, made no investigation on the ground, and so did not learn of its existence, asked for none of the descriptions contained in the Deeds of abutting owners or other information, and started at the road from a point said by his employer, Mr. Cox, to be a corner.\n\nThe abutting owner, McDonald, has I believe always protested that the line had been wrongly placed. He is a man past middle age and has lived on the farm he now occupies his entire life time, as did his father. He has always regarded the McKenzie line as correctly retracing the older line, having been so informed by his father. He however entered no action in the courts against Cox, who immediately after the Archibald line had been set up, cut the wood on the disputed strip. There is, however, ample evidence that he has always protested that the line made by Mr. Archibald had been wrongly placed.\n\n2nd-The Archibald line on the rear or Base \"C-D\" on plan. This may be dismissed without further comment than to say that I am of the opinion that Mr. Archibald being totally unfamiliar with the district and without a more definite bearing for that line than \"northeasterly\" as in the deed, thought that the line upon which his corners were placed was the Base line. If so, he was clearly mistaken and, as already stated, were it not that his corners are still standing I would have no doubt that his line was intended for a trial line.\n\n3rd-The McKenzie line approximately \"B-C\" on Plan. So far as I am able to form an opinion from the line marks still to be found, and such local information as I have been able to gather, the so-called, McKenzie line started on the road at my own starting point \"B\", then marked, admitted and acknowledged, and pointed out as the corner by the owners of the adjoining lands.\n\nWere the other corner near \"C\" still standing or in\nexistence I would accept it and establish a direct line between the two corners, on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence to prove beyond doubt that the McKenzie line was wrongly placed, and had both corners been kept up I would consider that that line had also to support its usage and recognition for a number of years and that there was a reasonable assumption that it had been established with the consent or under the direction of both the interested parties and might not unreasonably be considered as a conventional line.\n\nThe setting up of the Archibald line and subsequent cutting of the disputed strip by Cox, and Mr. McDonald's failure to take any action other than verbal protest, I think places the matter differently and in the position where it becomes necessary to establish the line called for in the Deed, and this I think I have done.\n\nThe small area enclosed by Mr. Gay's fence which my line cuts off from his clearing he may have had in occupation sufficiently long to have title to by possession.\n\nI should not, however, think it safe for him to include that parcel in a Warranty Deed.\n\n4th - The McKenzie line on the Base or Rear. I accept this line as it is on what I consider the proper bearing, and continued north eastwardly will follow as closely as can be expected, although crossing and recrossing the existing fences, on the rear of the Hamilton Grant as now marked on the ground.\n\nThe acreage is as given in the description viz: 146.6 acres exclusive of that portion of the Maitland road included in the description but assuming the road width to be as marked by the fences. It is not improbable that a greater width should have been given.\n\nThe old road, now only in use as far as the Gay and Snide farms, has not been deducted from the acreage as its width is also in doubt. The Etter lot containing one fifth of one acre is also included in the acreage given.\n\nThe reservation has been so worded as to take care of any part of both roads that has been included in the description.\n\nThe buildings have not been shown on the last (the property) plan as I understand they are to be removed and they are shown with other detail on the Contour plan.\n\nI also thought that it would be convenient to have Blue line prints rather than blue prints, in case of its being necessary to add memo reference to new Buildings, etc.\nThe survey has been greatly interrupted and delayed by wet weather and to some extent also by the difficulty in the location of the rear and south western boundaries.\n\nI attach hereto a copy of the description contained in the Grant from the Crown to Hamilton and others; there is no plan attached to the Grant.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.W. McKenzie\n\nRWMcK:DK\nOttawa, 22nd December 1927\n\nSir,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant with report of the survey of the George Gay farm and also accompanying description. Your description is being amended in two particulars. The distance N.49\u00b055' W is being changed from 3486.4 to 3485 feet and your distance S.49\u00b030' E is being changed from 3350 ft to 3355 ft, both to agree with the blueprint submitted.\n\nThere appears to be no doubt that you have a plan made on tracing linen and that plan is required by this Department for permanent record. If you desire a copy for yourself, a blueprint will be made and returned to you upon request. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR.W. MacKenzie Esq., C.E.,\nSurveyor Crown Lands,\n12 & 13 Queen Building,\nHalifax, N.S.\nR. W. McKenzie, C.E.\nSurveyor Crown Lands\n12 and 13 Queen Bldg.,\nHalifax, N.S., Canada\nDec. 9, 1927.\n\nTo Duncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Supt. General,\nDepartment Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nReport in Connection with Survey of\nLands situate at Shubenacadie, Hants County,\nNova Scotia and owned by George Gay.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with my recent survey of above referred to property I beg to submit the following.\n\nUpon receipt of instructions from your Department to proceed with the survey of the above mentioned Farm property I, as instructed, saw Mr. D.B. Lawlor, Resident Indian Agent at Shubenacadie and had him procure for me the description of the property as the same appears in the Deed from Ezekiel Pineo to George Gay which is dated July 18, 1918.\n\nAs upon looking over the front or cultivated portion of the lands I found it to be for the most part fenced and occupied, and as I was informed that the boundaries were well established and marked, I did not at that time consider it necessary to procure from the Registry of Deeds at Windsor the older conveyances in order to check the various descriptions through which the title passes from the original Grantee, Hamilton, to the present owner.\n\nI have a fair general knowledge of the titles and what may be spoken of as the \"state\" of property boundaries in that locality, and I already know that the lands in question are a portion of a grant of 1900 acres granted by the Crown to Colonel Frederick Hamilton and James and Gustavus Ducaret June 8, 1765, Book 4 page 202 Crown Lands Office Records.\na considerable portion of which was purchased by one Snide, an early settler in the District and an ancestor of the man of the same name who owns the Farm adjoining and north east of the Gay farm. Snide later set off by Deed or Will to certain of his Heirs the two portions of the original purchase, one of which is now owned by Gay and the other, adjoining Gay, by Allison McDonald.\n\nThat the description contained in Gay's Deed has been copied from a much older, probably the first, conveyance may be inferred from the reference to the Mill, Sluice, and roads.\n\nThe Mill has not been in existence within the memory of anyone now living but is said to have stood at approximately the point where the small Bridge is shown on the plan. This Brook was formerly known as \"Saw Mill Brook\" and some old timbers are still to be seen at low tide partially buried in the mud which appear to have been part of a building. The position of the Sluice is, of course, not known.\n\nI have taken as the place of beginning the point at which ordinary high tide is intersected by a line which is approximately at right angles to the shore and Old Road at the point of termination of the fence on the eastern margin of the present Public Road leading from Shubenacadie to Maitland. The distance from the point of beginning as I have so fixed it to the center of the eastern or downstream rail of the small Bridge is 390 feet; that called for in the description from the Sluice to the same point is 419.8' or 6.36 chains.\n\nI think the difference in distance may be disregarded as the starting point is reasonably well fixed by the junction of the Old and the Present roads and may be regarded as correctly located.\n\nFrom the place of beginning the description calls for a course following the margin of the Indian Road 31.50 chains, to the Maitland Road and on that road an additional 7.00 chains to the point at which the line running to the rear of the lot is supposed to commence, or a total of 2841 feet; my measurement for the same distance is 2601 feet, but the difference may be and probably is due in part to my point of commencement being at ordinary high tide mark instead of at low tide which would account for a part of it, and in part to the uncertainty as to the line upon which the first measurement was made as the \"margin of the road.\" The road has been widened and to some extent straightened within recent years, and the River Bank has also altered more or less.\n\nI found the distance from the center of the Indian Road to the point where the fence between Gay and McDonald intersects the Maitland road to be only 451.7 feet or 6.84 chains from the center, as against the 7.00 chains called for, from the north eastern margin of the Indian road.\nIt was not until this point had been reached that I learned that this line was claimed by McDonald, the abutting owner, to be wrongly placed and upon his property.\n\nMr. McDonald informed me that his Deed was not in his possession, but arranged that I was able to get it, pending which I continued the survey around the River and north east sides and across the Base.\n\nThe lines on the north east side are marked by fences or posts, that between the Wallace Gay and A. Grant lot and George Gay by the latter, the remains of an old fence, that between Gay and the Snide property by a post and wire fence which as will be apparent from the Plan, is in reasonably close agreement with the description contained in the Deed, and which while not perfectly straight throughout its entire length is so nearly so as to justify my having given only two bearings on it, one from the margin of the marsh to the Maitland road and a slightly different one from the road to the rear line.\n\nOn the rear line, which is supposed to and should coincide with the Base, or north west line of the Hamilton Grant, I again met with difficulty.\n\nThe line here was neither well marked nor otherwise satisfactory and was approximately ten degrees off the bearing.\n\nThe rear, or base, line of the Hamilton Grant, of which this line is a short section is described as 208.00 chains in length and is abutted on its outer or north western side by numerous smaller lots granted at a great many different periods. The Hamilton Grant has been split up into a number of lots such as those with which we are concerned, the widths of which on the base line are in general about ten chains.\n\nAs a natural consequence of these conditions the original Hamilton line has probably been lost for many years and the line now on the ground is the natural result of many disconnected surveys, various times of short sections each covering only the distance upon which some one property was bounded by that line, and as a result the Hamilton base at the present time appears to be instead of the straight line called for, a series of short lines, differing in bearing from one to three or four degrees.\n\nFor this and the further reason that this line, despite its irregularities, is for the most part recognized, fenced, occupied to, and in many places cultivated to, and neither the original corners of the grant nor any other one point upon it can be taken as more positively than another fixing the original\nlocation, I did not locate the corners and calculate a bearing that would describe a straight line between these corners, as I would have done had the circumstances been a little different.\n\nI was informed that that portion of the Gay farm situate on the northwest side of the Road, was surveyed in or about 1897 by my Father, the late James McKenzie, and on looking up his Field Notes which are in my possession I found that he had started on the road at a point corresponding to that shown and marked \"B\" on my Plan and ran back the distance that I have taken, Vis: 3465 feet, and that he also ran the Base line from the last named point north eastwardly to a point at which he crosses the fence on the rear line of the Snide Property which was then and is now on the margin of the former clearing supposed to be on or up to the Base line.\n\nI would say here that I am inclined to attach considerable importance to my Father's location of the lines in question, as apart from the fact that he was extremely careful in such matters he was then a man of upwards of seventy-five years of age, and had a lifetime's intimate acquaintance and familiarity with the titles and lot boundaries in that district.\n\nAccording to my information the line set up by my Father was undisputed until about 1911 or 1912 at which time the Farm now owned by Mr. Gay was owned by one Cox who employed a surveyor named Archibald to resurvey the property.\n\nThe fence at the road shown on my Plan opposite near the point \"B\", and marked \"Fence S.50\u00b0 27' E., 644 ft.\" is said to be on the line set up Mr. Archibald, and that dotted line in length prolongation of the fence (on which I found some line marks or Blazes corresponding in age to about the date of the Archibald survey) terminates at a Birch tree marked apparently for a corner and shown on the Plan near the point \"C\". This Birch tree, I am informed by Mr. McDonald, was the corner established by Mr. Archibald, who at the same time continued his survey across the rear and near the point \"D\" on the Plan, set a squared wooden post to mark the corner on the Snide lot. That post is still standing. See Plan.\n\nThe bearing of this lastmentioned line is now N.38\u00b0 25' E. and were it not for the corners having been established I would incline to the opinion that it was a trial line.\n\nThe base line of the Hamilton lot was originally N.38\u00b0 E. and I would expect to find, and do find on the more reliable lines in that grant, nine degrees variation which would make the bearing of that base line at this date, N. 47\u00b0 E., or differing by approximately nine degrees from the bearing taken by Mr. Archibald.\n\nThere is of course the possibility that the matter of the magnetic change was overlooked and the line set up on the original bearing.\nThe wire fence shown on the plan near the point \"C\" was erected by Guy McKay whose land abuts on the Hamilton Grant as shown and it is said to have been put up by Mr. McKay on the supposition that the line as set up by Mr. Archibald had been properly located.\n\nThe fence on the rear of the Snide lands, shown running north eastwardly from the point \"D\", has also been supposed to be on the line but is in general irregular and appears from the evidence of the old clearing on the Snide Property to have been \"swung\" in near the Gay lot to meet the Archibald corner. The intermediate piece on the rear of the Gay property is unfenced.\n\nI am also informed that immediately the Archibald line from \"B\" to \"C\" had been set up the, at that time, owner of the Gay Farm, Cox, cut the wood on the strip between that and the older line.\n\nThis appears to be, to at least some extent, true, but I succeeded finding a number of line marks corresponding in age to the date of the McKenzie survey, viz: 1897 (See noted on Plan) and after obtaining Mr. McDonald's Deed I had him point out as closely as he was able to do, the position of the McKenzie corner, some 30 feet at least north eastward of the corner I have set up which last is some 25 feet north eastwardly of the Birch known as Mr. Archibald's corner.\n\nAfter I had made a \"needle\" survey of practically the entire length of the Hamilton Base, and had looked up everything I was able to locate in either my own files which extend back to about 1900 and in my Father's notes of former surveys that could have any possible bearing on the case, particularly with regard to occupation, came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary to take the time and incur the expense incidental to going to Windsor in order to search the Records and obtain copies of the older descriptions as the difficulty appeared to me to be one that could and should be settled from the information at hand and for the most part dependent upon possession, or at least occupation, etc.\n\nThe two doubtful lines, viz: \"B-C\" and \"C-D\" have been established as shown on the plan as follows:\n\nThe most definite point mentioned in the description and the one least likely to have altered its position in the point on the Hailand Road distant 7.00 chains north eastwardly from the Old Indian Road. This is the point \"B\" on the Plan and appears to agree with that from which Jas. McKenzie started in 1897 at which time the stake and stones called for were probably still in existence. The road has been widened within the past four or five years which probably explains why they are not now to be found.\n\nIn selecting this point I give the doubt as to the width\nof the Indian Road in so far as possible to the Gay property, taking the margin of the Indian Road as that of the \"travelled way\" or between ditches, twenty-three feet or at eleven and one-half feet from the center of the travelled way. I consider that at the time the description originated, that may and probably was, the margin from which the measurement was taken.\n\nI assume that the direction of the line called for from the point \"B\" to \"C\" and described in the Deed as N. 53\u00b0 W. is intended to be parallel with the end lines of the original Hamilton Grant and with other division lines; if so, that line should be north 50\u00b0 West at this date (to the best of our ability to decide so rather doubtful a question.)\n\nI also assume that the bearing was observed at the point \"B\" and I therefore have determined the course by carefully observing a bearing of north 50 degrees west at that point.\n\nThe bearing shown on my plan and given in the new description for this line is north 49\u00b0 48' 55\" minutes west and is the bearing as deduced from the meridian observed at the point of commencement of the survey, \"A\" on the plan. The difference of five minutes being that between the two observations. The deduced bearing from the first meridian is given on the plan and in the description in order that it may correspond with other bearings shown which are deduced from the meridian observed at \"A\".\n\nIn other words N. 49\u00b0 55' W. is the deduced bearing of the line in question, and N. 50\u00b0 W. the needle reading observed at the point \"B\".\n\nThis line passes through two or three old blazes supposed to be those made by James McKenzie at the rear of the clearing and some distance farther, before entering the cut out area, more blazes are found from four to ten feet to the north east.\n\nThe position of these marks indicate that the McKenzie line bore more northwardly and confirms Mr. McDonald's statement as to the approximate position of the corner.\n\nMy line passes 21.8 feet north east of the angle in the fence at \"B\" and 32 feet north eastwardly of the angle at the back of the clearing, 844.4 feet from the fence on the road margin, thus cutting a strip of the dimensions given off the enclosed pasture occupied by Mr. Gay.\n\nSome marks of a line believed to be that made by Archibald are found approximately in prolongation of the fence and the line is quite marked near the Birch tree marked for a corner at \"C\".\nThe Base Line across the Gay Lot was established as follows:\n\nI was able to find a few old line marks probably the line set up by Jas. McKenzie, the bearing of which appeared to be S. 47\u00b0 W. by the needle. I ran a trial line on that bearing in both directions and found that near the intersection with \"B-C\" I was some feet to the right (N. W.) of another line tree which I had not previously found.\n\nI then extended the trial line (by compass using the needle only) in the reverse direction N. 47\u00b0 E. and found that it crossed the Snide line at \"D\" 13 feet from the angle in the fence and 29 feet from the post set by Archibald for the corner and marked on its North east face \"1911\" and on the South east face \"T. C.\" (Thos. Cox)\n\nAs the bearing as given by the needle was that showing the variation I had expected, I continued the trial line across the Snide Lot about half a mile to and along a portion of the line where the fence has been well established for many years and the line has been and is cultivated to.\n\nI found that while the fences were not straight and my trial line crossed first the Snide Base to a point some 12 to 15 feet north west of it at one point, it later crossed back and was undoubtedly bearing too far to the east by about one degree.\n\nI also found the needle to be inconstant and in some places to read N. 48\u00b0 E.\n\nUpon connecting the trial line with my Transit Survey I found the deduced bearing of the latter to be N. 48\u00b0 5' east, and the different needle to correspond closely to that bearing except at and near my first Compass Station where there appears to be some local attraction.\n\nSome part of the error is therefore instrumental, faulty needle. The transit needle checks up with several of my other instruments and may therefore be considered correct.\n\nMaking the correction required the line starts from the point of intersection with the fence on the Snide line (\"D\") on plan at 11 feet from the angle in the fence and 27 feet from the Archibald Post; thence running south 47 degrees west (deduced bearing) it follows the old blazes, and at 660 feet, or 10.00 chains, intersects the line \"B-C\" at 3485 feet from the wire fence on, or approximately on, the road margin at \"B\".\nThe shortage in distance on the Base, Viz: 25 links, or 16.5 feet, is less than that were the James McKenzie corner accepted, and it is not improbable that it is due to encroachment from the north eastern side.\n\nTo sum up the situation I would say that I have entirely disregarded the Archibald Survey and also find myself unable to accept the McKenzie line on the course marked \"B-C\" on plan, although I do accept the latter survey on the Base line.\n\nThe reasons, or line of argument, will be sufficiently clear from the foregoing, but may be further explained as follows:\n\nAs to the rejection of the McKenzie and Archibald lines,\n\n1st- The Archibald line \"B-C\". There is nothing in any of the former conveyances of which I am aware, or have seen to support or justify Mr. Archibald's location of this boundary. I am, I believe reliably, informed that Mr. Archibald was employed by Mr. Cox the owner of the property to be surveyed, and that no notice was given the abutting owner, McDonald. The surveyor was unaware of the existence of an older line, made no investigation on the ground, and so did not learn of its existence, asked for none of the descriptions contained in the Deeds of abutting owners or other information, and started at the road from a point said by his employer, Mr. Cox, to be a corner.\n\nThe abutting owner, McDonald, has I believe always protested that the line had been wrongly placed. He is a man past middle age and has lived on the farm he now occupies his entire life time, as did his father. He has always regarded the McKenzie line as correctly retracing the older line, having been so informed by his father. He, however, entered no action in the courts against Cox, who immediately after the Archibald line had been set up, cut the wood on the disputed strip. There is, however, ample evidence that he has always protested that the line made by Mr. Archibald had been wrongly placed.\n\n2nd- The Archibald line on the rear or Base \"C-D\" on plan. This may be dismissed without further comment than to say that I am of the opinion that Mr. Archibald being totally unfamiliar with the district and without a more definite bearing for that line than \"northeasterly\" as in the deed, thought that the line upon which his corners were placed was the Base line. If so, he was clearly mistaken and, as already stated, were it not that his corners are still standing I would have no doubt that his line was intended for a trial line.\n\n3rd- The McKenzie line approximately \"B-C\" on Plan. So far as I am able to form an opinion from the line marks still to be found, and such local information as I have been able to gather, the so-called, McKenzie line started on the road at my own starting point \"B\", then marked, admitted and acknowledged, and pointed out as the corner by the owners of the adjoining lands.\n\nWere the other corner near \"C\" still standing or in\nexistence I would accept it and establish a direct line between the two corners, on the ground that there is not sufficient evidence to prove beyond doubt that the McKenzie line was wrongly placed, and had both corners been kept up I would consider that that line had also to support its usage and recognition for a number of years and that there was a reasonable assumption that it had been established with the consent or under the direction of both the interested parties, and might not unreasonably be considered as a conventional line.\n\nThe setting up of the Archibald line and subsequent cutting of the disputed strip by Cox, and Mr. Macdonald's failure to take any action other than verbal protest, I think places the matter differently and in the position where it becomes necessary to establish the line called for in the Deed, and this I think I have done.\n\nThe small area enclosed by Mr. Gay's fence which my line cuts off from his clearing he may have had in occupation sufficiently long to have title by possession.\n\nI should not, however, think it safe for him to include that parcel in a Warranty Deed.\n\n4th - The McKenzie line on the Base or Rear. I accept this line as it is on what I consider the proper bearing, and continued north eastwardly, will follow as closely as can be expected, although crossing and recrossing the existing fences, on the rear of the Hamilton Grant as now marked on the ground.\n\nThe acreage is as given in the description viz. 146.6 acres exclusive of that portion of the Maitland road included in the description but assuming the road width to be as marked by the fences. It is not improbable that a greater width should have been given.\n\nThe old road, now only in use as far as the Gay and Snide farms, has not been deducted from the acreage as its width is also in doubt.

S.\n\nI am forwarding you by today's mail three blue line prints of Plan of Survey of the property situate at Shubenacadie, N. S. owned by George Gay which has been purchased, or is under consideration of purchase, by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nI also forward with the before mentioned prints a description of the property according to the boundaries existing and now generally recognized as established, as the same have been located by my recent survey.\n\nThe several, but in general unimportant, differences between the boundaries of the property as found or established on the ground, and as described in former conveyances have been gone into fully in the Report which accompanies the Plan and new description.\n\nI very much regret the delay that has occurred in the compilation of this survey and plan, but an unprecedentedly long last summer and fall and the necessity for giving partial attention to other unfinished work that was also, and for the same reason, long overdue, added to the altogether disproportionate amount of time which was taken up in attempting to adjust the small but annoying differences between adjoining owners, and to finally establish boundaries that would not only be accepted by those owners, but could if necessary be defended and maintained in the event of\nany action being brought at any future time before the Courts, and has resulted in the work only being now finally completed.\n\nThis matter of difficulties and adjustments has been gone into fully in the Report referred to, and I will here refer only briefly to the small area which the line B-C on the Plan cuts off from Mr. Gay's fenced but uncultivated clearing.\n\nMy reasons for finally establishing that line in the position in which I have placed it are given in detail in the report referred to, and I will only speak of it here in so far as to say that I am satisfied that it has been placed where any Court, having before it full evidence such as is contained in the old Deeds and local information, would uphold it as placed.\n\nThe small area (844 feet in length by 32 feet wide at one end and 21.8 feet at the other) which the present description does not include can probably be held by Mr. Gay by his own possession and that of his predecessors in title, but as that is a matter of some uncertainty and as the area and importance of the land involved are both practically negligible I would suggest that if it is thought desirable to include that lot in the conveyance, it should go in under a separate Quit Claim Deed as Mr. Gay is hardly in a position to safely include it in the Warranty.\n\nThe field notes, bill, and diary, will go forward in the course of a few days.\n\nThe large scale plan covering the buildings and surrounding area for a sufficient distance to contain information as to contours, location of roads, river, buildings now on the ground, etc. required by the Architect has already gone forward.\n\nShould anything further be required I will be glad to furnish it.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) R. W. McKenzie.\nJanuary 9, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis Department proposes to purchase the farm of George Gay and a lot and house of Allan Etter, situate near Shubenacadie, N. S., as described in enclosures here-with. These properties are for the purpose of an Indian residential school which we are about to establish. I am enclosing (A) a copy of interim letter of R. W. McKenzie, C. E., Surveyor of Crown Lands, of Halifax, (B) his description of the Gay property which includes by way of an exception a description of the Etter lot, (C) a copy of Mr. McKenzie's letter relative to his description, and (D) Mr. McKenzie's plan showing the properties in question.\n\nI should be grateful if you would have your agent at Windsor investigate the titles to these two properties and, if found satisfactory, to prepare conveyances to \"His Majesty as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\" The consideration in the case of the George Gay farm is $7,000 and for the Etter lot with residence, $4,000. It will not be necessary to prepare a bill of sale in either case, as we are not acquiring any chattels.\n\nI understand that Mr. McKenzie is one of the best informed surveyors in Nova Scotia, and he has made such a careful and detailed report, that I believe it advisable to forward the enclosures mentioned for the attention of your agent. May I refer to enclosure marked \"A\", on the second page of which will be found a suggestion of Mr. McKenzie's that a narrow strip of the Gay property be included in the conveyance under a separate quit claim deed. Please have your agent comment on our right to dispose of sewage in the Shubenacadie river at this point. He should also ascertain what bathing and other rights we would have in the small body of water known as Snide Lake, which touches the Gay farm on the north.\n\nWhereas funds are available this fiscal year, I should be grateful if you would ask your agent to use despatch in the matter. I am taking steps to secure an Order in Council authorizing the purchases.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

General,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe Survey Geo. Gay Property in connection with Indian College, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am forwarding as per request contained in letter of December 22, 1927 signed A. F. McKenzie, tracing of Plan of property boundaries, also that of the Plan of building site showing existing buildings, natural and other features and five foot contour lines.\n\nYou, of course, have Blue line prints of both these Plans.\n\nIt will not be necessary to furnish me with Blue prints to replace the tracings on my files as I have the Vandykes and a print of each.\n\nI have also on March 3rd, mailed to Mr. Wm. G. Dunlop, Barrister, of Windsor, N. S., (at his request) a blue line print of the Property. This was to be placed on Record in the Office of the Registrar of Deeds with the Deed.\n\nI note the changes made referred to in your letter of December 22, last, as having been made in the two courses of the description where the described distances did not agree with the Plan and would say in explanation of the discrepancy, that owing to some difficulty in fixing the rear line and consequent alteration in its position affecting the length of the two boundaries in question, the original description was altered. As my copy has been found to contain the same error it is clear that the corrected description was destroyed by mistake.\nI will forward Diary covering the period over which the work extended, also account with receipted bills for same as soon as roads are in condition to go to Shubenacadie, as while practically all bills incurred have been paid I have not as yet taken the receipts in duplicate as required by your Department.\n\nIt is also my intention to see that the corners set are properly in place and have not been accidently or otherwise removed or disturbed.\n\nShould you require the services of a Surveyor in further laying out the building site or grounds I would be very glad to undertake the work and could arrange to attend to anything required at short notice.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

McLean, Esq.,\nActing Secty. and Deputy.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI enclose herewith account for survey in 1927\nof the Geo. Gay Farm at Shubenacadie, Hants County, N.S.\nrecently purchased for the Indian College.\n\nTo this I have added survey of the pipe line\nfor proposed Water Supply made in November of 1928.\n\nThe unusual delay in submitting the 1927 account\nhas been due to the fact that I had some idea that there might\nbe objection to the rear line, and if so, that further work\nwould be required in the nature of a complete survey of at\nleast one of the more recent grants adjoining to the northwest,\nand so delayed making out the account for a time, after which\nit was overlooked.\n\nThere was later on the additional reason that at\nleast one of the men who had assisted me was for a time away\nand it was therefore a matter of some difficulty to obtain\nhis signature to the pay voucher.\n\nYou will note in the enclosed account that no\ntime has been charged to bad weather, notwithstanding that the\nseason was unusually wet. This is due to the fact that on such\noccasions as I found myself unable to carry on field work I\nspent the remaining portion of the day in the office.\n\nThis also accounts for the rather disproportionate\namount of time charged to plotting and office work.\n\nI enclose herewith vouchers for all expenditures.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I had arranged with a man last fall to come this spring and give us his advice about it. When he did not turn up I made inquiries and found out that he had died during the winter. Since that time I have tried to get another man. Through Mr. P. V. Doyle, who no doubt you remember, I have a letter from a Mr. Clark, of Annapolis Royal.\n\nI am enclosing the letter and would like very much to know what you think about it. My knowledge of such things, like many other things is very limited.\n\nAs for the School we are doing the best we can and I think the children are quite happy and contented. We have had of course every possible assistance from the Department.\n\nTrusting that you are enjoying good health,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may engage Mr. E. R. Clarke, whose letter I am returning, to visit the school when he is in Halifax and you may count on approximately $100 expenditure for shrubs, trees, etc. This will make it unnecessary to pay him a fee. Of course, the Department relies on you not to arrange shipment of any shrubs or trees until it is timely to have them planted.\n\nWhen Mr. Clarke has visited the school, you should forward to the Department a rough sketch, showing what you propose to do.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nCopy of Order\u2014NOT AN INVOICE\n\nBy arrangements through the medium of correspondence I had the pleasure of calling upon Rev. Fr. Mackay at the Indian Residential Schools at Shubenacadie, N.S., arriving there on the afternoon of July 11th, and staying about 24 hours at the schools.\n\nIt had been arranged by Father Mackay through the medium of correspondence with the Department of Indian Affairs that he should have liberty to spend in the neighbourhood of $100.00 for the betterment of these grounds in the spring of 1931.\n\nI immediately perceived that owing to the immensity of these grounds and the very large building that we have to decorate, the amount of $100.00 would be wholly inadequate for even an initial planting. I presented this idea to Father Mackay for his consideration, and he suggested that I be as economical as is possible, and submit an estimate for the consideration of the Department of Indian Affairs, and I have been just as economical in this present estimate as conditions would permit.\n\nIn the first place we have a very large building, 158 feet long from east to west, and it sits on the top of quite an abrupt little hill in the midst of a wide expanse of ground, which is, literally, totally bare of trees.\n\nI saw at once that we would have to confine our decorations to that area immediately adjoining and in front of our building, and fortunately this building faces the south and lends itself excellently well to the use of evergreens for decorative purposes; and indeed in my opinion as a Landscape architect, this is the very proper decoration for this style of building.\n\nThese evergreens will be planted in close proximity to the walls of the building, and this is the proper place forward to folio 2.\nRev. J. P. MacKay,\nMan Residential Schools,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nfor these evergreens under any condition, but it has the fortune to result that we are not obliged to go out in the large area for the purpose of decoration, and we will be able,\u2014not this year entirely,\u2014to obtain really beautiful results by the use of evergreens, and in the following estimate it must be remembered that this planting is an initial planting only, and will require additions from time to time before we have a fully complete job.\n\nAs I said before, this building stands on top of quite an abrupt little hill, and we have no considerable flat or sloping area immediately in front of the building. It falls off into quite an abrupt descent at a distance of something like 65 feet from the building, so we are rather cramped for room for an adequate lawn.\n\nI found when I arrived that a small lawn had been laid off extending the full length of the building, 158 feet, but this lawn was altogether too narrow to correspond with the extent of the building, and I have suggested that this lawn area in front of the building be increased to a width of 31 feet, which will necessitate the moving of the drive farther from the building, and I have placed it near the brow of the hill as conditions will permit. With these dimensions we will have ample room for turning at either end of the lawn, and the added width of the lawn will be a great benefit, but even at that we are still too narrow, and I propose to widen the apparent width of this lawn by the use of a barberry hedge on the southern edge of the lawn, and also for a very modest distance around each end.\n\nI am installing this hedge for several perfectly good reasons: First, this line of hedge is architecturally correct for the betterment of the property; secondly, it will reduce the expense of upkeep greatly as it has the effect of framing in our grounds and does not render it obligatory that we shall keep the boundaries outside of our drive always in a lawn condition; and for another reason, it affords a fully adequate protection to the lawn itself from any winds coming from the southward, and it must be kept constantly in mind that one could scarcely select a more wind-swept position, excepting where it is protected by the building itself.\n\nAlso as time goes on our lawn will give us a suitable place for the planting of flowering shrubs at either end of the lawn, and should it transpire that we have labor to permit of it we will sometime or another install a bed of perennials immediately in the shelter of this hedge, but the lawn itself, speaking of it as a whole, should be kept green and not cut up with any plantings.\n\nforward to folio 3.\nRev. J. P. MacKay,\nIndian Residential Schools,\nAmos, N. S.\n\nWe have a drive next to the building of a width of 18 feet. Our new lawn will have a width of 31 feet, and immediately outside of the lawn I have laid out a new drive to the width of 12 feet, which is sufficient.\n\nNow, this new lawn will extend the full length of the building, a distance of 158 feet, and the ends of this lawn should be constructed in the following manner: Measure in from either end of the lawn a distance of 154 feet, and at this point strike a line across the lawn at right angles to this point, and also at right angles to the edges of the lawn, which are parallel. Three positions should be staked: the centre of the lawn, and the two points at right angles to this on either side of the lawn. Go to the centre of the lawn and from this point sweep a half circle. I demonstrated this to the overseer of the farm and he understands the method of construction perfectly well.\n\nOur hedge will start from the point at right angles to the point in the centre of the lawn on the inside, and from this point will be carried around the end of the lawn and along its southern border. Since this is developed on both ends of the lawn we have an equivalent of a full circle 31 feet in diameter, which figures slightly less than 100 feet in length, but for the purpose of construction we will consider the circle to equal 100 feet. Now, the full length of the lawn is 158 feet, but we have to take 31 feet from this distance, which leaves 127 feet, plus 100 feet as the length of the hedge, and our requirements would be 341 hedge plants, since this hedge is set in double rows with the rows 10 inches apart and the plants in the rows 18 inches apart on centres staggered so that when viewed from the side they appear to be 8 inches apart, but since I wish to bolster up the ends of these lines on the inner side of the lawn for a distance of 3 or 4 feet on each end by making a three line planting instead of making a two line planting, I will say that our requirements for this hedge will be:\n\nHedge Plants, No. 1 quality, 18 to 24 inches, @ $225.00 per 1,000.\n\nThe method of installing this hedge is as expressed in the above paragraph, but in preparation for its installation a trench should be dug sometime this fall, and this trench should be about 23 inches wide, and about 10 inches deep, and the earth should be completely excavated from this trench and a layer of manure put in the bottom which when well trodden down will be at least 4 inches deep, and then the earth replaced on top of this manure and allowed to remain in this condition until spring.\n\nThe reason why the manure is put into the earth in the fall of the year is that manure has the tendency to ferment, and in fermenting, if it was placed immediately before planting it would have a tendency to rot the roots of the plants, so it is always well to place the manure in the trench well in advance of the time of planting.\n\nforward to folio 4.\nI learned from Father Mackay that he has been using salt or marsh mud from the river for the purpose of filling, and I am of the opinion that this will be injurious to the growth of shrubs, so instead of replacing this salt mud back on top of the manure I suggest if it is at all possible that we get good top soil from some other part of the farm and place this good soil on top of the manure, and use the earth excavated for filling in different places where it is certainly demanded, as in building up the outer edge of the road, etc.\n\nPerhaps this is as good a time as any to discuss the probable effect of salt mud. It is perfectly all right for a farm crop, and I believe it is not deleterious to the cultivation of lawn, although I certainly would not recommend it if it were not already in position, but I think that in the future the use of salt mud where we are going to plant trees or shrubs or anything of that nature, should be omitted, as we have an abundance of top soil at one place and another on this huge farm, and I cannot see the wisdom of taking chances, and the one or two places where I have had experience with this soil in my many years as a landscape architect has always been very unsatisfactory, and in some cases it has resulted in the death of our plantings, so I think I am well advised in recommending that we do not use salt mud in any place where it will come in contact with the roots of shrubs or trees.\n\nIt just came to my mind that a little bit of advice might be wholesome, and that is, that in planting the hedge while the distance between plants is to be 16 inches on centres in the rows, I have always found that there is a tendency to slightly over-space the plants, and to that end I advise cutting a stick 15\u00bd inches long to be used as a measure in planting the first row, always remembering that the distances given are on centres; that is, from the centre of one plant to the centre of the next plant. My experience teaches me that we come out about right if we use a stick 15\u00bd inches long, and it is only necessary to measure the spaces in the first row, which means that you will plant one row at a time, and after you have finished planting the first row you can set the plants in the second row at mid intervals by the eye.\n\nAs I have mentioned in one of the preceding paragraphs, our building is of brick and totally bare of decoration, but it so happens that the building is wonderfully well constructed for the use of evergreens, as it has indentations in the line of the building on both sides of the central entrance porch 37 feet long on each side, and with a width at the wing walls of the building of 11 feet 6 inches, and this area has been laid down into lawn, a very proper proceeding, and for the purpose of description these areas will be referred to as the east court, and the west court. As I have said before, it lends itself excellently well to the use of evergreens, and with vines to cover the walls.\n\nforward to folio 5.\nRev. J. P. Mackay,\nIndian Residential Schools,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nThe first thing that I will submit is the use of evergreens and their positions, and since the decoration of one court is exactly identical with the decoration in the other court it will only be necessary to describe the decoration for one court, with the note that it is identical with that on the other side.\n\nOur first planting here would be 1 Koster's Blue Spruce, position, 6 feet out from the wall of the wing, and 8 feet out from the wall of the main building.\n\nThe second item will be: 1 Thuja Occidentalis Lutea George Peabody (Golden-leaved white cedar), position, 4 feet out from the wall of the main building, at right angles to a point 4 feet west of east edge of first window, which means the window nearest the wing edge (I am positioning these trees in the east court, that is, the rear east of the central entrance).\n\nThird, 1 Thuja Wareana (Warren's white cedar), 4 feet out from the main wall and at right angles to the mid distance between the second and third windows.\n\nFourth, 1 Taxus cuspidata Brevifolia (Japanese Dwarf Yew), 3 feet out from main wall, and at right angles to a point at mid distance between the third and fourth windows.\n\nFifth, 1 Thuja Pyramidalis Compacta (compact growing pyramidal white cedar), at niche or corner formed by the conjunction of main wall with wall of porch, 2 feet 6 inches out from either or both walls.\n\nSixth, 1 Pinus Montana (Dwarf growing pine, no central stem, rarely exceeds a height of 4 feet, but often has a spread of 4 to 6 feet), 3 feet 6 inches out from east wall of entrance porch, and distant 3 feet 6 inches from the outer brick edge of entrance porch.\n\nThis indicates the need of 6 evergreens for the decoration of one court, and since the decoration is repeated in the other court, our total requirements will be:\n\nEvergreens:\n- 2 Koster's Blue Spruce, (Picea Pungens Glauca Kosteri), 4 feet, @ $15.00 per tree.\n- 2 Thuja Occ. Lutea George Peabody, 4 foot grade at a conceded price of $5.50 per tree.\n- 2 Thuja Wareana, 4 foot grade, at a conceded price of $5.50 each.\n- 2 Taxus cuspidata Brevifolia, 24 to 30 inch spread, @ $5.50 each.\n- 2 Thuja Pyr. Compacta, 4 feet @ $5.00 each.\n- 2 Pinus Montana, 24 to 30 inch spread, @ $6.00 per tree.\n\nComment: I have used the very best grade and size of evergreens for the reason that we have such a large building that the smaller sizes seem to me to be out of place, and I wish to forward to folio 6.\nRev. J. P. Mackay,\nIndian Residential Schools,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nMay here that not that I have a source of supply for these evergreens in Holland, where they are produced in great quantities I could not engage to supply at even double these figures if I were restricted to Canadian grown stock, but as far as that goes, trees of the size that I would like to place here are not available in Canada at all so I am obliged to import, or put up with trees about half these sizes, and at an increase in price of almost double what I am charging you here, even for these smaller trees.\n\nIt may seem an exorbitant price to pay $16.00 for the Koster's Blue Spruce, but it seems to me that something of an enlivening nature such as is produced by the beautiful foliage of this tree is demanded here, and as far as the price is concerned, if these trees were procurable in this size in Canada, a four foot tree instead of costing you $16.00 as I am pricing them in this estimate would have cost from $35.00 to $40.00 per tree, and I earnestly beg that the use of these trees shall receive favorable consideration. We need them for this position.\n\nThe other trees will at once be perceived to be very low in price, while to one who has a knowledge of conditions the price of the Koster's Spruce will seem very economical indeed.\n\nI have a blueprint, \"The basement plan\", which will enable me to position these places and they will be so positioned and the blueprint returned to Father Mackay.\n\nAs I have had occasion to remark I do not believe I could recommend the planting of any of these trees or shrubs in marsh mud soil. I think my best word of advice would be that wherever these planting positions occur the earth should be taken out and replaced with good top soil.\n\nNow, these cedars which I am recommending are the same family as grows in a natural state in northern New Brunswick and Maine, and they are perfectly hardy, but they are very susceptible to soil conditions. They will not grow in an acid soil, therefore in order that we shall make sure that the soil is alkaline or sweet it is always advisable to treat cedars with lime, and for that matter, spruces also. This lime should be air-slaked, and to this end I recommend that you get a barrel of lump lime and dump it some place in your garden where the crustic effects of the lime will do no damage, and cover the heap with earth and allow it to remain here for three or four days, when it will become completely air-slaked, and after the trees are planted, or at the time of constructing the holes for that matter, use about a half peck to a peck to each position, and keep this idea in mind and if you discover any falling off in color of the cedars treat them to a dose of air-slaked lime. Spruces are not nearly so susceptible to\n\nforward to folio 7.\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nIndian Residential Schools,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nsoil conditions as the cedars, but using the lime has\nthe tendency to brighten up the color of the foliage, and it\nwould not be out of the way to use lime around the spruces,\nalthough it is not imperative.\n\nNow, I do not know, but it is my opinion that marsh\nmud on the lawn will not interfere with the growth of grass\nseed, as I know that for ages it has been used on the farms\nfor the purpose of top dressing, so I would not go so far as\nto say that it was necessary to remodel our lawn, but after\nwe have added to the width of the lawn it should be levelled\noff and sown to grass seed, and if we can get our lawn widened\nbefore the middle of September I suggest that we sow our grass\nseed this fall, and my experiences teaches me that the best\ngrass seed we can use for lawn purposes is the common brown\ntop or red top such as is used for hay purposes in our country.\nThis is a native grass, while the so called lawn grass seeds\nusually come from a much warmer climate than ours, and they\nhave the tendency to winter kill, while if you use the brown\ntop or red top it is perfectly hardy and if kept mowed it makes\na most beautiful award, and it has the further advantage of\nbeing very cheap.\n\nThe next item for our consideration is the use of a vine\nwhich will naturally grow up over these brick walls of our\nbuilding without support, and the best vine for this purpose is\nAmpelopsis Tricuspidata, sometimes called Ampelopsis Veitchii\nor Boston Ivy. I have carefully looked over the building, and\nI believe the only suitable place to plant these vines is on\nthe south face of our building, with one on the end of the east\nwing and one on the end of the west wing. The positions will\nbe 14 inches out from the wall in carefully prepared positions.\nSince it usually transpires that the earth next to the walls\nof a building is that which is taken out of the excavation, and\nis totally devoid of fertility until exposed to the frost for\nseveral years, consequently the positions where we are going\nto plant these vines should be excavated and the present earth\ntaken away and replaced with good top soil, making a hole 12\nto 15 inches deep and at least 3 feet in diameter.\n\nOne vine would be planted at the south-east corner of\nthe building, about four feet from the corner on the east side;\none at the south-west corner 4 feet from corner on the south\nside; one at the south-west corner of the east wing facing\nthe south; one against the west wall of east wing; one against\nthe main wall of building, between the first and second windows\nin the east court; one between the third and fourth windows\nin the east court. These positions are marked on plan.\n\nThis carries our plantings to the central porch, and\nthese plantings should be repeated in the same positions west\nof the central porch, with one on the west wall of the west\nwing, 4 feet from the corner. This indicates the need of:\n\nforward to folio 8.\nRev. J. P. MacKay,\nIn a Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nVines.\n15 Ampelopsis Tricuspidata, best grade, 2 year or more @ $6.35 per 10.\n\nIf I have omitted to say so, it should be kept in mind that all measurements are on centres. That is, if we start at a given point and measure to a certain planting position the measurement is supposed to be made to the centre of the tree or shrub planted.\n\nAs I said in my introductory remarks the building is situated in the midst of a vast area totally devoid of trees, and at some future time when we have more money at our command, there will be a splendid position for the planting of some tall growing deciduous trees, but at this time I do not feel free to recommend the planting of these trees, but there is one item of planting which should not be neglected, and that is a line of shade trees bordering our drive, and carried around in front of the building to the west end, or a little beyond the west end of the building.\n\nWe should start at the south end or at the entrance, and then on the west side of the road commencing 25 feet from the nearest spruce at this position, and about six feet from the centre of the ditch which exists here will be our starting point, and the position for planting the first tree.\n\nFollowing the trend of the drive for a distance of 300 feet, and at this point a measurement should be made to the wall of the main building, and continue the line at the same distance from the wall of the main building for a further distance of 80 feet, making a distance of 380 feet to order with shade trees, and since the proper distance for placing these trees is at 30 foot intervals on centres, our requirements here would be:\n\nDeciduous Trees, since 13 trees only give us 12 intervals.\n13 Ulmus Americana, 2 to 2\u00bd inches in caliper, 13 feet and up @ $27.50 per 10.\n\nI have decided that the best tree to use for this purpose is Elm (Ulmus Americana). I came to this conclusion for two reasons. Our building is very tall and sits on the top of a hill, and we need tall trees to correspond with the height of the building, and also will give us their height, and are very graceful and particularly well adapted to the bordering of a driveway. Also I was lead to this decision by the fact that from observation I find that elms are native to this locality, and grow extremely well. You will find them dotted all over the landscape here and I believe they are indigenous,\u2014apparently so, anyway,\u2014at least they grow with extreme vigor and seem to be perfectly well adapted to the locality, and I believe they are our wisest present selection.\n\nforward to folio 6.\nRev. J. P. MacKay,\nIndian Residential Schools,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\n\nI also notice birches and poplars in the landscape, but there do not seem to be very many maples. Perhaps later on we might experiment with the use of maples, and get some variety, but at the present time I am going to confine myself to bordering the drive on the west side. We may need a tree or two on the east side of this drive, but it is fairly well taken care of by the natural growth at the present moment.\n\nI notice that where the road leads up to the building, up the face of a rather steep hill, that the ditches have shown a disposition to erode, and I think we can overcome this if we will shape our road, mounding it slightly up in the centre, and shape our ditches into an agreeable curve bordering the drive, and then cobble the bottom of these ditches with small rocks, such as can be had in great quantity right at our hand.\n\nThe way to do this will be to establish the curve, and then embed these rocks level with the surface of the bottom of the ditch. This will prevent erosion, and will be a very fine decoration in itself as it will make our road very trim and neat and avoid weeds such as presently exist.\n\nCAPITULATION OF ESTIMATE FOR SHUBENACADIE INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\n| Folio | Name | Price |\n|-------|------|-------|\n| 3     | 350 Berberis Thunbergii, (Hedge Plants), @ $225.00 per 1,00 | $78.75 |\n| 5     | 2 Evergreens, @ $16.00 each........ | 32.00 |\n| 5     | 6 Evergreens, @ $5.00 each........ | 30.00 |\n| 5     | 4 Evergreens, @ $6.00 each........ | 24.00 |\n| 8     | 12 Vines, (Arplopodia Triangularis), @ $6.25 per 10.... | 7.50 |\n| 8     | 13 Deciduous Trees, (Ulmus Americana), @ $7.50 per 10... | 35.75 |\n\nTotal of estimate. $211.00\n\nIt will be seen from the above capitulation that we have greatly exceeded the amount which the Department placed at Father MacKay's command for next year, but I believe a careful reading of this estimate will show you that this expense is fully warranted, and I hope the Department will feel free to confirm this estimate as written, for I have not recommended a single item but what I believe is really needed for the spring of 1931.\n\nERC/MTH\nIndian residential School\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nAugust 25th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWould like very much to have the enclosed brought to the attention of Dr. Scott.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may arrange with Mr. Clarke for the improvement he recommends, at an estimated cost of $211., as the Department wishes the School to have an attractive setting. Of course, it is understood that the work will be done when it is timely to have the shrubs and trees planted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nFor Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nDear Sir:\n\nDuring the winter we have been clearing land, and today Mr. Arthur Robinson came here to accuse us of cutting on his property. If that is so, it certainly was unintentional, as we are of the opinion that we were within the proper lines.\n\nJust where the matter will end I am not prepared to say, but the question of exact property limits will have to be decided. I understand that the deed of this School property is at Ottawa, and in order to give us something to go on, I wish you would send me a copy of that section of the deed dealing with that piece of property bounded on the North by Snide Bros., south by Allison McDonald on East by the Maitland Road, and on the West by Arthur Robinson.\n\nI suppose the proper thing to do is to have a surveyor come and run the lines. I have not had any experience along property disputes, any advise would be appreciated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 3rd April 1935\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 18th ultimo, I am enclosing a blueprint which shows indicated in red the lands purchased by the Department from Geo. Gay and Alan S. Etter. This print also shows in orange a narrow strip 844 feet in length which George Gay had enclosed with a fence, south of the line B C on the plan. The Department purchased all right, title or interest which George Gay had in this parcel.\n\nIt does not appear to the Department that there should be any necessity of surveying the boundary lines of this property, as the property was surveyed in 1927 and iron bars were planted to mark the North West and South West corners, and the survey notes show that the line C D to K is a well marked line with blazed trees. It is thought you should have sufficient information on this plan to enable you to determine the proper limits of the school property.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F. MacKenzie)\nSecretary\n\nRev. J.P. MacKay,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd inst. with regard to the property limits here. After going over the lot in question and making inquiries of those who were present at the time of the survey, it seems impossible to come to any agreement. The real trouble is that there has never been any iron bars at the points D and C. The only iron bar mark is at point B. The present dispute is at point D, but as is shown at point C, there is bound to be trouble there.\n\nWill be in Halifax next week and hope to get some definite information from McKenzie who surveyed the property.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6056, file 265-9, part 1)\nOttawa, 24th April 1933\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 14th instant, I have to advise you that it is improbable that the iron bars were not placed at points D and C, as Mr. H.W. MacKenzie's plan of survey shows these bars to have been planted there by him in 1927. It is more probable that someone has removed these bars. It is noted that you expect to see Mr. MacKenzie next week in Halifax, but it is doubtful if he can give you more definite information than that shown on the plan which was sent you. He might, however, give you information regarding the position and nature of the iron bars at points D and C, which would enable you to locate them if they have not been removed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.F.

Macker,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nI beg to submit the following report on my visit to the Shubenacadie Indian School:\n\nAll good - in splendid shape and well cared for.

Recently when I took the Francis children to the\nSchool I called Dr. Leveque and he informed me that he had sent for\nthis Indian several times but he had not come in.\n\nThis Indian lives at Dunsieen, Kings Co. about twenty five\nmiles from Sussex the only way one can get there is to drive with a horse\nand sleigh at a considerable cost to the Department and I did not think\nthe expenditure was necessary. I have instructed this Indian and so has\nDr. Leveque that all he has to do is bring the child to the Doctor and\nif she is free from disease the Doctor will put her on the train in\ncharge of the Conductor. Father Mackey will see she is met at the train\nand conducted to the School.\n\nTrusting this explains the matter of delay satisfactorily,\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA/Indian Agent.\n\nIndian Affairs.

J. Kinley, M. P., has forwarded a communication which he received from Reverend Canon E. B. Spurr, Liverpool, N. S., detailing the circumstances in connection with the case of two illegitimate children, whose father he states to be an Indian, with the request that this Department provide for their care and maintenance.\n\nFor your information, I enclose a copy of Canon Spurr's letter. I would request that you take immediate steps to investigate this case and furnish a report to the Department. You should state the name of the Indian, the reserve to which he belongs and also the names and ages of the children referred to. From the facts stated by Canon Spurr, it is very doubtful if the children could be considered as wards of this Department. In any event, it is presumed they are too young to be admitted to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. It may be difficult to prove parentage, and the Department doubts if it should be responsible for the care and maintenance of the children. You should give as full information as possible and state, also, whether you consider they are Indians and wards of the Department. I would advise that you consult Canon Spurr and forward the information requested at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nDr. B. W.

On his release he left for some unknown place and I understand he does not intend to return to Whyoocomagh Reserve.\n\nYour letter authorized the sending of his child to the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie but on my visit to Whyoocomagh yesterday, I found that Mrs. Stephens came and took the child with her for some unknown place, likewise saying that she would not return. She also took with her the younger child I had placed with Hugh Googoo.\n\nI am enclosing herewith Vouchers in favour of Hugh Googoo for the care of the child as thereon stated, also ones for E.M.

Please communicate with the Principal, Rev. J. P. Mackey. Any expense incurred in sending these children to the Shubenacadie School will be paid upon receipt of a properly certified account, in triplicate.\n\nRegarding the other children, the Department is not prepared to approve their admission to the institution mentioned in your letter. It is considered that the younger children could be placed with other Indians and, in this event, we would be willing to allow an amount of from eight to ten dollars a month each for their care and maintenance. It is understood, of course, that any family who takes these children and is paid in cash for them at the rate stated above will require less relief if it should happen that you place them with families who are on relief.\n\nAs soon as you have made the arrangements, you should let me know the names of the children of these two families whom you have sent to the Shubenacadie School, also the names and ages of the members of these families whom you have placed with other Indians and the names of the Indians with whom they have been placed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

All children on vacation are due back here on August 17th. School classes will begin on August 24th. There is considerable work to be done between the time the children arrive back and classes begin. Again, there has been difficulty with the return of this girl in the past. Practically all former Agents agreed that with one or two exceptions, the conditions prevailing at the Cambridge Reserve, did not do the children any good. Further, as Regina will be about sixteen years of age by the close of the next school term, she will be eligible for dismissal. I would like to agree with you but I honestly think that the girl is better off here. We will leave it to the Department at Ottawa. I will write to them about it and you may if you wish.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. Will send money to John Smith for the return of John, Jr.\nKentville, N.S.\nAugust 3rd, 1936.\n\nThe Shubenacadie School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed you will find $1.50 for a single ticket for Miss Regina Copage, passage home for the summer holiday from the school, and she will return to the school in the fall. Mr. John Copage, her father, has approached me regarding having his daughter spend the holidays with him.\n\nAt present Mr. Copage is at Lawrencetown, Annapolis Co., and he wished to have his daughter's ticket bought to Lawrencetown, and he will meet her there when the train comes on Saturday morning, or mid-day, as the case may be.\n\nThis letter is the advice I am sending you for you to please see that Miss Copage leaves for Lawrencetown, Saturday morning, August 8th.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(signed) Clarence Spinney\nIndian Agent\nKentville, N.S.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nNo. 51 - 0 - 10\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter from Agent Clarence Spinney, of Kentville, concerning vacation for Regina Compge; also enclosed is copy of my reply.\n\nWill you please let us have a decision?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP.S.

The Parents are very irresponsible and don't take proper care of them. I wrote to Father Macauley and he said he would have place for them. In the case of Abraham Scott, Eight years of Age, his Father is dead, and the Mother signed the Application. She is warned again by the Department Officer in sending these children to Shubenacadie it will be necessary to get some clothing for them before they go, and they are not fit to go without some. To get them there, and will have to send someone with them.\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept Indian Affairs\nAttawapiskat\n\nW. J.

She has improved somewhat during the past few weeks, with rest and medicine. In my opinion this child should not be returned to the school at Shubenacadie. Rest for this child is absolutely necessary, and she be free from study so in my opinion it is better for the child to lose a year's schooling than force her to do something which might permanently injure her health.\n\nThe child would receive full and proper care if she stayed at the home of her father. The house is clean and well kept and the father is a good cook. As the child has no mother it would be necessary for the older girl (Agatha) to remain at home also so as to help housework and take care of the younger girl (Ellen).\n\nYours truly,\n\nL.B.

Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of application and certificate of health for the admission of Freeman Knockwood to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The admission of this boy is approved, and you may arrange to send him to the school. If the parents are in a position to do so they should take him to the school. If not, you may purchase a railway ticket for him, and you should then forward an account, in triplicate, to the department in favour of yourself.\n\nIn your letter of the 23rd instant you enquire regarding transportation allowance of children and parents on their way to the residential school. The Department does not provide transportation for Indian parents who wish to visit the Shubenacadie School. When children are first sent to the school, the Agent communicates with the Department and forwards an application form for their admission, and he is then authorized to incur the expenses that are necessary in the transportation of such children. When children are allowed out on holidays, Rev. J. P. Mackey, Principal of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, makes the necessary financial arrangements for their return transportation. If you have any enquiries for transportation from pupils who should return to the Shubenacadie School, you should communicate with Father Mackey.\n\nIf you consider that certain children require clothes when being sent to the Shubenacadie School, you should so advise the Department, and give an estimate of the cost of the clothing required. If we approve the expenditure, you will be authorized to make the purchase, but no clothing should be secured without our permission. It is not necessary to provide any large amount of clothing going to the residential school, as pupils are completely outfitted on reaching there.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

As you were previously informed, these children will be medically examined on their arrival at the Shubenacadie School and if either of them is unable to attend classes she will not be obliged to do so. Under the above circumstances, the Department considers that the two girls should be returned to the Shubenacadie School, and I have, therefore, to direct you to arrange with the nearest detachment of the R.C.M.P. to proceed to the father's home, obtain the girls and take them to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I have talked the matter over with the Agent, Mr. Robb and have sent word by her brother that she was expected back for school on Monday. From what the Agent tells me, her parents also wish her to return to school. The youngster apparently thinks that she can do as she alone pleases. I strongly recommend that you send word to the Agent or to me to see that this girl is returned to school. The Agent tells me that there are two other children in that home, 8 and ten years old who have never been to school.\n\nNo. 0119 ... Georgina Scully from P.E.I. She is the only one from P.E.I. who did not return. Her younger brother came back. I have written the Agent but to date have had no word.

The mother is no\ngood; the grandmother bought up these\nchildren. The day after the children were\ndue back, the mother took the two of them\nfrom the grandmother's home. There was even\nat that time no question about their coming\nback to school. But the mother, when she\ncame to the village, instead of bringing the\nchildren to the school, bought a ticket for\nSt. John and took the children with her.

If the Department approves of sending them it will be necessary to send an escort along with them, and also to get some decent clothing to take them there as the parents say they have no clothes decent to send them.

The admission of these two children is approved, provided there is accommodation for them at the school. Please write Rev. J. P. Mackey and ascertain if he is willing to accept them. If so, you may take them to the school and forward an account, in triplicate, covering the expenses incurred. It is expected, of course, that you will keep the expenditure as low as possible.\n\nIn the event of their being sent to the school, you may purchase the clothing that is absolutely necessary.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

So I write you in confidence concerning my expenses. Father MacKay informs me that it will take 3 days for the return journey as train connections are so poor.\n\nTherefore will you be good enough to instruct me as to whether I am entitled to out of pocket expenses as I am running my own threshing outfit and am right in the middle of the busy season. Last week I had to visit Middleton and engaged a man to run my thrasher now I have to again engage him for three days; his four days pay will amount almost to as much as I receive for the month. I have to pay him 40\u00a2 an hour.\n\nP. Y. O\nmy contention is that I should be made an allowance for anything of this nature which is really extraordinary. Ordinary visits I can usually arrange when things are not so pressing at home. I hope you will advise me in this matter, as I am most anxious to do my duty but feel that there should be some recognition in a case like the present.\n\nPerhaps there is an allowance made, but I being young to the work am not aware of it.\n\nI think I should be allowed $4-5s. or a day out of pocket expenses.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nEdward C. Harris\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, September 17, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the first instant, the Department is prepared to approve the admission of Pierre and Thomas Arsenault to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, provided the Principal is willing to accept them. It is noted that Rev. P. Placide has written to Father Mackey and, in the event of Father Mackey accepting the boys, you should have them medically examined and, if they are pronounced physically fit, you may send them to the school. Payment of their transportation expenses will be made on receipt from you of a properly certified account, in triplicate. It is not considered necessary to have anyone accompany them as they can be placed in charge of the train officials and you could notify Father Mackey, by wire, regarding the exact date and time of their arrival in Shubenacadie.\n\nIn the event of their going to the school, you may purchase the clothing absolutely necessary for them to make the trip.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

If, however, you take the children to the school, the Department is prepared to pay the transportation expenses of the children by train to Shubenacadie, also your own return expenses to that point.\n\nIf you are unable to accompany these children yourself, you should arrange with the nearest detachment of the R.

You should have Pero, with your assistance, prepare new accounts, in triplicate, stating where the meals were supplied and the date in each case. It is not sufficient to state \"Exactly same as above\". All details, with dates, should be given. I have made some notes in pencil on the accounts.\n\nWith reference to the carfare from Morell to Charlottetown, if Pero used his automobile, only mileage can be allowed him, at 7\u00bd between those points. The places from which fares were paid should be stated.\n\nAs this matter has been dragging for some time, I would request that you get in touch with Pero and have new accounts for each year prepared, in triplicate, with the information asked for given in the case of each item of his expenses. When this is received, Pero will be reimbursed for his expenses.\n\nIn future, when an Indian or any other person takes children to and from the Shubenacadie Residential School, they should obtain receipts for all expenses.\n\nYours truly,\n\nN.

Stilwell that the Department was going to have sent to this school and I received word to bring him along into any time. I tried the car which was the most convenient way as he could not be sent by train alone. If the Department does not intend to pay this amount, please let me know what you allow and I will have to except it at any loss.\n\nYours truly,\nFrank Jackson\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, October 19, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your recent letter, with reference to the expenditure you incurred in placing Peter M. Stephens in the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. The three copies of the account were returned to you but I am under the impression that the voucher requested that cheque be issued in your favour. Did you use your own car? If so, you should show the mileage from your home to the Shubenacadie School and you may return the voucher giving this information on all three copies.\n\nIf you hired a car, the voucher should be issued in favour of the person from whom you hired it or you should attach to the voucher a receipt from this person acknowledging payment. When this voucher is returned, the question of payment will receive further consideration.\n\nIn future, you should keep in mind that, in taking children to the Shubenacadie School, the Department expects you to send them by railroad, which is cheaper than hiring a car.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I wrote to Mrs. Stephens now at North Sydney and instructed her under threat of sending an R.C.M.P. for them.\n\nTonight this letter came from \"Bob\" Butts. I do not believe a word of its contents but fearing they may with their falsehoods start new trouble through a lawyer such as R.H. Butts I am sending you the letter to get your opinion on it. Please advise at your convenience.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nSigned A.C. MacNeil\nCopy of Catherine Sack's statement\n\nI have been going to Indian school for past five years. I am fifteen years past March, 1936. Before my holidays this year I was employed in kitchen for eleven weeks. I first went in kitchen for 11 weeks, January 7, 1936. We had to start work at 5.30 in kitchen and were kept working till 6.30 P.M. Then we go to recreation room till 8 P.M. In the eleven weeks I was employed in kitchen I spent a total of two weeks in school. Sister Mary Armel has beaten me many times over the head and pulled my hair and struck me on the back of neck with a ruler and at times grabbed ahold of me and beat me on the back with her fists.\n\nI have also been ordered to stand on the outside of the windows with a rope around my waist to clean windows on the fourth floor with a little girl holding the rope. When I told the Sister I was afraid to go on the window she scolded me and made me clean the window and threatened to beat me if I did not do it. This is being done to other children. After we get a beating we are asked what we get the beating for and if we tell them we do not know we get another beating. The Sisters always tell us not to tell our parents about getting a beating.\nSydney Mines, C.B.\nOctober 1st, 1936.\n\nReverend A. G. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\n\nDear Father MacNeil,\n\nMike Paul and Thomas Stevens were to see me this evening. They are two young Indian men, one of whom, Thomas Stevens, has been in the Shubenacadie school. They showed me your letter of September 7th.\n\nThe young fellow, Thomas, tells me a very hard story of the treatment young Indian children receive there. It would appear that his own experience has been so hard that he dreads very much the idea of going back there, and naturally, falls it hard to see his younger brother and sister taken there, where they will receive similar hard treatment. He tells me that they receive very little education, but lots of hard work, and what he considers a lot of unnecessary hard punishment.\n\nIn the letter that they showed me, you speak of the R.C.M.P. taking them back if necessary. They also tell me that they have now permission to go to St. Joseph's School, in North Sydney, where they will be under the supervision of the good Sisters of Charity.\n\nIt is somewhat of a pity to see these children taken so far from home, largely on account of the conduct of their father. On account of the way this boy feels in the matter, I doubt very much if it would improve his condition to send him there by force and against his will. I hope, however, that you will make full inquiries of his mother, who will present you with this letter, that you will consider all the conditions, and I am sure that you will do your best for this little family.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SIGNED) R.H. Butts\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOctober 5, 1936.\n\nDear Father MacNeil,\n\nI received your letter with the enclosed letter from R.H. Butts concerning the Stevens.\n\nBack in June the school teacher from Iona brought a young boy here, and I met him at the train. I did not have much time to talk to Mr. McDonald, as he was going on to Halifax. However, I remember one thing he said and that was not to allow the Stevens children home for vacation. He was supposed to call on his way back, but was delayed in Halifax, and it was too late to call here when he passed through.\n\nI took a vacation this past summer, the first in ten years and while I was away Mrs. Stevens arrived with a letter from you. I remember Sister Mary Charles telling me about the letter but I do not remember ever seeing it. Anyway the woman left with the children and they were gone before I arrived back. It was understood that the children would return. When they did not return, I included their names along with three others who had no reason for not returning. So the letter you have had from the Department is the result of my report to them. In the meantime all the others on vacation with the exception of five had returned and two of these five had good reasons for returning; they had been operated on for appendicitis during vacation. I do not know the reason why Mr. McDonald had said that the Stevens children should not go home, but I would judge that he knew the home conditions and that he was expressing your views.\n\nHowever, the situation now is this. We have the biggest attendance we have ever had, eighty one boys and eighty one girls. We had to refuse the Agent at Antigonish who had two to send, and the same for the Agent at Maria Reserve in Quebec, so what to do about the Stevens, I don't know. To let them get away with their lies doesn't seem the right thing to do - to keep them from spreading falsehoods about those who try to do something for them, seems hopeless. And why white people fall for such stories, is hard to explain. For myself I never hope to catch up with the Indian and his lies, and in\nfact, I am not going to try.\n\nI think the best thing to do is write to the Department and since we have a full school, request a few more beds and insist upon them coming back. I am getting a bit tired of playing square with the Indian and in turn have him cut my throat.\n\nNow for the letter of R.H. Butts. It is quite plain that Mr. Butts knows very little about the school. To begin with the regulation covering seventy-seven Indian Schools across Canada calls for one half day in class room and the other half for work - for boys, farm or carpenter work, and for girls, cooking, sewing and washing. Here we have not enough work of that kind with the result that each child spends far more time in the classroom than the regulations call for. As for Tom Stevens, a big body with the mind of a ten year old child, the school register shows that he missed no days at school. He had practically no schooling before coming here. By that I do not mean that he did not register at school, but that the teacher could make very little progress with him. The younger brother does better. As for the work the majority of the boys of his size would rather be out at some work than in the class room, for the greater part of their work is made play. To play a game of baseball was work for Tom; he would rather sit in the sun and pester a bumble bee or a fly, by pulling off one wing and one leg at a time. To make an Indian work is the unpardonable sin among them. So much for work.....\n\nNow for his hard treatment; that is ridiculous. I can't recall ever having given any punishment to him, and as far as the Sisters are concerned, I don't think they would punish a boy of his size. By the way, they have permission to go to the good Sisters of Charity of North Sydney. Evidently Mr. Butts does not know that we have ten Sisters of Charity on the staff here, and at least four of them are from C.B., and have had years of experience in teaching. I don't want Mr. Butts to think that we attempt to make out that we are perfect, but a man of his experience should take with reservations the statements of a boy of the mental capacity of Tom Stevens.Rev. Father Butts of Lourdes, and Father McKenzie spent a night and part of a day here recently, and if Mr. Butts does not wish to take my word for it, I would be glad if he would make inquiries from his brother, or should he be passing through, let him call over and view the place for himself. I can't understand why a man of his position could be duped by an Indian. In the meantime, if I were you I would let things rest and see how often and how long they go to school at North Sydney. Mrs. Stevens told me in a letter that she was going out to work. Who will care for the youngsters, I don't know. When we get around to it, we will write to the Department and see what they have to say.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.,\nOctober 12, 1936.\n\nThe Secretary\nDep't. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed please find copy of letter of R.H. Butts, lawyer, of North Sydney, concerning the Stevens children. The two boys and a girl did not report back after vacation.\n\nAlso enclosed is copy of Rev. A.C. MacNeil's letter to me and my reply to him. Rev. A.C. MacNeil is the Agent at Glendale, Inverness Co., C.B.\n\nAlso enclosed is copy of statement of Catherine Sack, Shubenacadie Reserve, made to the Corporal Murray, R.C.M.P., and Mr. John Robb, Agent for Shubenacadie.\n\nI do not think it necessary to take this statement item by item and refute each one. The statement contains one lie after another. The Sister Mary Armel referred to, while opening a window from the top last February, slipped and broke her knee cap, and with the exception of a few weeks has been a patient at the Halifax Infirmary since that time. We went to the bother of making inquiries and her statement is that there is absolutely no truth in what Catherine Sack says. It does seem a little peculiar that this girl would return from vacation for three previous occasions without registering any complaint whatever. However, as far as we are concerned here, I would like to see her returned to school but I would not want her longer than twenty-four hours. So if she does return we are taking it for granted that we can dismiss her after twenty-four hours.\n\nI don't know whether you have this sort of thing to contend with in other residential schools, but I hope not.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have written to Mrs. Stephens today informing her of the contents of your letter to the effect that the children must attend school at North Sydney regularly and without any cost to the Government.\n\nRegarding the part of your letter in which you stated that you would depend on me to have the children return, by force if necessary, if they did not attend school etc., I wish to state that while I am quite willing to carry out your instructions, North Sydney is over 90 miles from here while the Indian Agent at Sydney is only about 12 miles from there, and any expenses in this connection would be far greater in my case, especially at this time of the year when travelling takes a longer time in country districts. However, I leave this to your own decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nAgent.\nOttawa, November 7, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo, in which you advise that Mrs. Joe Stephens and her children are now residing at North Sydney. Under these circumstances, you may take no further action regarding these children.\n\nIt is quite possible that Mrs. Stephens will return to the reserve in a few months and, if so, you can then make arrangements for placing the children in the Shubenacadie School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Her age is nine years, both parents are dead.\n\nDoctor Collins advises that her condition is such that she is ready to leave the Hospital. Saint Vincent's will not take the child again.

At the present time, the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School has its full quota of pupils.

The mother is in the York County Jail awaiting trial on the charge of adultery. Harry and Teddy were the two boys caught stealing from a C. P. R. box car for which I personally went security to the amount of $50.00.\n\nMrs. Matilda Lappier who is looking after the children has not any control whatsoever over them. I have discussed this matter with Reverend Father Gillis of Devon, N. B., and his idea coincides with mine, that the home is the proper place for these children, providing room is available at the school, and that they are free from disease. May I proceed with arrangement for their transfer there?\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nCopy sent to Father Mackey.\n\nOttawa, November 23, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to placing the three Brooks children in the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nAs far as we are aware, this school has its full quota of pupils, but you might write to the Principal, Rev. J. P. Mackey, and ascertain if he is willing to accept the children. If so, and provided they are in good health, you may arrange for sending them to the school.\n\nIt should be distinctly understood that these children should not be sent to Shubenacadie unless Father Mackey advises you that he will take them.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

Even allowing for the average Indian exaggeration, it is possible that her home conditions might be such that it might be better for her to remain another year.\"\n\nPlease let me have a definite recommendation from you stating whether or not you consider these two children should be sent home this year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, P.Q.\nSir:-\n\nRe Circular March 30th.F.159-37\n\nIn regard to vacation for pupils of this agency who are at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential school, I would ask you if those who have parents living, can go to their homes for vacation. They all have heard that the children from N.S.& P.E.I. Island are going home for the summer vacation, and of course those from this agency wish to do the same. I would think it only fair in most cases but I would not approve of those having no parents going to the reserves for vacation.\n\nKindly advise me as soon as possible if vacations can be granted. They all will go back at the end of vacation.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs, Branch\nDept., of Mines and Resources\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 15th, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 12th instant, with reference to allowing certain children from New Brunswick who are attending the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School to return home for the summer holidays.\n\nAs the amount available for travelling expenses is extremely limited, it has not been our practice to allow home for holidays pupils whose homes are a considerable distance from the residential school they are attending. However, you might write to Rev. J. P. Mackey, Principal, Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N. S., with regard to any children from your agency who, you consider, might go home for holidays and, at the same time, let him have an estimate of the cost of the return tickets.

In the late P.M. of this date a telephone call was received from Clarence SPINNEY, Indian agent at Kentville, to the effect that an Indian boy had been picked up at Hantsport. He stated that he was informed that the boy was very sick and hardly able to walk, and he requested our assistance in bringing the boy to Kentville. Patrol was made to Hantsport accompanied by SPINNEY, and PAUL was picked up and brought back to Kentville, where he was handed over to SPINNEY.\n\nSub-Division 29-5-37\n\n2. On this date Indian Agent SPINNEY requested the assistance of this Detachment in locating PAUL, who had run away from the Gasbridge Reserve where he had been left by SPINNEY.

In the P.M. of the same date patrol was made to the Cambridge Reserve, accompanied by SPINNEY, as it was thought that the boy might have returned to the reserve, or that some of the Indians might have some idea of his whereabouts, but no information could be obtained.\n\n1-6-37\n\n4. On this date Circular Memo #37-H-40 under the above heading, with description of PAUL, was received at this Detachment. Further investigation was made, and information was received that the boy might be working in the vicinity of Grafton, Kings Co. In the P.M. of this date patrol was made to Grafton, and Paul was located working on a farm in this district. This patrol was made by Private car, as police car was in garage for repairs. PAUL was conveyed to Kentville and placed in the custody of the gaoler at the County gaol. Insp.Michelson was immediately notified as per instructions contained in Circular Memo #37-H-40, and instructions were received to take PAUL to Windsor and hand him over to L/Cpl.Cheesman, who was to take him from there to Shubenacadie.

Under these circumstances, these two children should remain at Shubenacadie for another year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P.

Evans\nSuperintendent\nIndian Affairs\nGovernment House\nOttawa\n\nSirs,\n\nI am writing to you to tell you that we would like to have our children home for vacation. They never come home since they left home six years ago. Since I've seen them so I like to have them at once.\n\nI've told the Indian Agent about it last year and he said that the Dept. won't do it. Of course, we don't want the Dept. to pay the expense all we want them to do is let us know could they come home and we will pay the expense. The children wrote to us and they said that they were lonesome and want to come home this coming\nP.S.\n\nThe children will start to come home on the 1st July. So try and have the word down here by last of June.\n\n---\n\nVacation so do your best to help me, so they will be no trouble and one of my boys are sixteen and the others are 15 and 14 so that shows that they have the right to come home and at the present my wife likes to seem them home at once. She's a kind of one that worries about children so please do your best to help us in this way.\n\nAnd then we will send them a fare to come home on.\n\nGood Bye and\n\nGood Luck\n\nWishing to hear from you soon.\n\nGeo.

Paul referring to his children leaving school for vacation. In reply I beg to inform you as to the home conditions of this family, and would say that they are good. In regard to whether he would be in a position to pay the expense incurred in sending his children home and returning them to school, I think he would.\n\nIn cases where the Indians can supply the funds for transportation of their children to their homes for vacation, I believe it would be a good plan to let them do it, and if the Department will pay transportation one way, let the way back; as they will make great efforts to get the money to bring them home but once they are home the parents are likely to say that the Department can pay their way back again, and wont try to get the money to return them.\n\nI am returning Peter Paul's letter.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept., of Mines and resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are reports that the child's white mother wants to have her child, but the Indian people do not agree that she should go to her, as the mother is of a shady reputation.

The children are Francis, Margaret and Rodrick McLeod children of George McLeod, dead. They live with their mother who is a white woman. The Mother is not keeping them as she should and she is not behaving herself, so much so that the children are in danger of going wild. White men visit the place and they drink there. This information was given me by the local RCMP Constable. The place needs to be cleaned up. The first thing is to get the children away. I am interested in the children and I ask you to see that something is done with them.\n\nI would like to see the three of them at the Indian School Shubenacadie. I have been speaking to Mr R B Henley about them. He is I believe your agent and he along with the RCMP Constable here, agree that the home is the proper place for the children. Then the RCMP will see that the place is cleaned up as to visitors and liquor.\n\nSecondly I would like to know what evidence you have that Mary Ann Paul (Bradley) married a Bradely?\n\nSincerely hoping that you will give this matter your attention.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Campbell, M.D.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSeptember 3, 1937.\n\nDear Mr. McCutcheon,\n\nI am very sorry that you have to be bothered with the boy, Louis Thomas. For your information I am sending copy of the father's letter and my answer to him. You can judge for yourself how much of a threat that letter contains. As for the boy being beaten, that is the usual line of the Indian.\n\nI am writing to the Department and will also send them copies of all letters. It isn't that we need the boy at all, as there are many applications which we cannot accept. It is the old story over again. The Indian does not want to do what he is told or follow regulations, but must have his own way. Personally it is a matter of indifference to me whether the boy comes back or not, but I think it should be impressed upon the Indian that he cannot have his own way in matters concerning which the Department has set regulations.\n\nNo doubt the Department will write to you concerning further developments. This Frank Thomas could have gone to see you just as well as he went to the Doctor, but would not do it.\n\nWith many thanks for your assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Louis has been at school (Indian) at Shubenacadie, and his father doesn't want him to go back, but the Sup't. Father Mackey has written threatening to inform Ottawa and have the R.C.M.P. take him back, and leave him with no vacation home until he is sixteen. Is this a bluff? Thomas has a home in Rollingdam right across the road from a rural school which Louis can attend. Although Mrs. Thomas does not live with her husband, there is a daughter fifteen who keeps house. Louis says he gets beatings at Shubenacadie and does not want to go back. I think he would be O.K. at home. Thomas hasn't had any help from the Department for some years and is self supporting.\n\nSincerely\n\n(SIGNED) H.S. Everett\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nAugust 31st, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Thomas:\n\nI was sorry to hear that you were not going to send Louis back to school. For the past years you kept your word to me, and I sent Louis home or kept him here, just as you wanted.\n\nOn account of Louis having entered school from the Halifax Agency, your moving away, and family troubles, I did not consult any Indian Agent about Louis' vacation. In the case of any other child, the Agent had to write and request vacation, and the Indian Agent was then responsible for sending the child or children back. I did not send Louis to the school, and I cannot dismiss him from the school. So without making this letter too long my advice to you is to send Louis back to school, then apply to the nearest Indian agent. If the Agent is satisfied that Louis will go to the school up there then he will recommend him for dismissal. Then I will get word from the Department at Ottawa and send him back to you. You may think that this is a lot of trouble to take, but it is the only way.\n\nIf that is not done then I will be compelled to bring the matter to the attention of the Department at Ottawa, and if they do what they have done in other cases, it will mean that the R.C.M.P. will take Louis back to the school and he will remain until sixteen years of age and have no further vacations.\n\nUp until now you have kept your word to me and I think I have treated you fairly, so if Louis is not back here with in a week, you will have no one but yourself to blame for any trouble that may follow.\n\nHoping that you will do the right thing,\n\nYours very truly,\nCOPY OF LETTER FROM FRANK THOMAS\n\nRollingdon, N.B.\nAugust 23rd, 1937.\n\nDear Father Mackey,\n\nI am letting you know that Louie is quite well and has gained in weight since he came home. But sorry to say that Louis will not be going back to Shubenacadie school any more. I can send him to school here; it is only about two minutes walk from our house and he can go to school and be good company for his sister Clara at nights. Has Mathew and I have a chance to work in the woods all this winter and by keeping Louie home it will save me the trouble of hiring someone to stay with Clara. We have a nice little home and there is nothing to hinder me from keeping my family together from now on which they haven't had for some time. They think a lot of one another and there will not be any need of separating them any more. When I can give him the same schooling here as he can get at Shubenacadie and it will also save you a lot of trouble and there is no use of me writing to the Indian agent at Fredericton as he never answers my letters anyway. But if you think that should write to the department and explain to them I will do so but I wish to hear from you first so please write.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Frank Thomas (SIGNED)\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nSeptember 8, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:- No. 51 - 0 - 10\n\nEnclosed please find copy of a series of letters concerning Louis Thomas, No. 53 who has not returned from vacation.\n\nIf you are not anxious that this boy should be returned to the school here, I hope that you will insist that the father of the boy report to Mr. MacCutchon, the Agent, and make his request to him for dismissal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your letter file 51-0-10, regarding children whose \"Application for Admission\" forms were returned to me, I wish to report on each one individually as follows:\n\nSTEPHEN LABOBE; 14 years of age. Parents very poor. Lives about 1\u00bd miles from Day School. Parents seem unable to influence him to attend School here.\n\nABRAM PETERS; 9 years of age. Parents extremely poor in this case, and are of an unsettled nature. Practically no permanent home.\n\nLAURA JACOBS; 6 Years. Parents both deceased. Lives with Mrs. Thaddie Knockwood who is a distant relative. Lives about 1\u00bd miles from Day School.\n\nJOSEPHINE THOMAS; 11 Years of age. Living with Mrs. Madeline Francis who is her aunt, and who is very poor and unable to manage this girl.\n\nALBERT FRANCIS; 8 Years of age. Refuses to attend School owing to a grievance between his parents and the Day School teacher, which has been in existence a long time. John Francis father of this boy is very anxious for him to receive a good education.\nDAVID KNOCKWOOD: 14 years of age. This a grown up boy, and the father not living at home, he is rather uncontrollable at home and it is difficult to get him to attend the Day School. The mother is anxious to have him receive a couple more years in the Residential School where he can be disciplined.\n\nJOSEPH LEWIS: 14 years of age. This a bright boy, and parents do not pull together, the father contending that he should remain at home and work, while the mother wishes him to attend school. The boy himself is very very disappointed that he cannot attend school 100 per cent. I feel that his admission to the Residential School would be the only solution.\n\nRAYMOND LEWIS: 6 years of age. Just a young bit of a boy and parents live about 1\u00bd miles from school. Cannot possibly attend school in winter time.\n\nWILLIAM COPAGE: 6 years of age. Lives on Scotchfort Reserve where there is no Indian Day School. Refused admission to the local Provincial School. May say this boy has a brother and sister now attending the Residential School.\n\nTrusting this report will be favorable enough to warrant the admission of these children to Residential School, should there be sufficient accommodation for them.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nAGENT.\nOttawa, September 16, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am returning herewith your voucher No. 381, together with account of Amos Albert for the transportation of six Indian children from Burnt Church to Newcastle, to the amount of $6.00.

I have let her remain at home until I hear from you as to whether she can remain home or not.\n\n\"In regard to the above case I would think it reasonable to let this girl remain with her father, as he has a good comfortable home but no one to take care of it as his wife is dead.

But these children must go to the new school if it's forced to do it. Sunday last Mr. Brown spoke to me about the matter. Ben Knockwood was a boy living with him 13 yrs. He was in school. They claim the boy is too deaf to hear. They claim the boy is not wanted at home when the statement was made he is not wanted at home but they brought him up. Father Ben Knockwood says if this boy wants to go to school he will move to Dunn Reserve where there is a school what can't do in a case like this.

A few days after his father went to Bayfield taking Charlie with him and he has not returned yet. From an interview I had with Andrew Francis (his father) I feel that he is determined to keep Charlie home. I know that he made a trip to Sydney to see Ben Christmas, Chief of the Reserve there. Did Mr. Christmas write to you?\n\nI understand that this boy is in his sixteenth year and would be leaving the school this year. I still hold the deposit for his return fare. Please let me know if you wish to have me look him up, or if you decide to give his place to some other Indian child on your waiting list.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(SIGNED) J.H.

Mr. Joe stated that now as his mother is very old and there is no other woman in the house, it is very hard for them to look after them properly.\n\nThe father, William Henney, who is a roamer and although he belongs to Malagawatch and owns a little shack there, wishes to take the children with him and have the shack repaired at the Department's cost. Without a woman in his house I cannot see how he can care for the children, even if he would settle home and give up his continual travelling. As he is opposed to having the children placed elsewhere, I beg to ask if I can place them in proper homes, even if the father opposed this? He did not care for them since many years and I have very little faith in his future actions in this respect. Can the boy be sent to the Residential school at Shubenacadie without the father's consent but with the consent of the guardian? There is no space available for girls, at that school, at present, but I can get proper homes for them if I may do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nOttawa, Ontario,\nOctober 26, 1937.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have received your letter of the 18th instant, re the Hernie family, of the Malagawatch Reserve. I note that Mrs. Maggie Joe is unable to look after them any longer. I would be pleased if you would have the two girls placed with some reliable person on the Reserve at the same rate of remuneration as we have been paying in the past. It will be possible to place the boy in the Residential School at Shubenacadie without his father's consent, the father not having shown very much interest in him in the past. You will be further advised as to what will be done with this boy by the Branch which deals with school matters. From school returns in the Department, I note that there is Noel Hernie, 15 years of age, and Charlie Hernie, 14 years of age. Kindly inform us which one is the one referred to.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nRev. A.C. MacNeil,\nIndian Agent,\nGlendale, N.S.\nOttawa, October 28, 1937.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return the account which you recently submitted in connection with the transportation of children from the Shubenacadie School.\n\nIn checking this account, it was found that the total should be $136.35. It was also found that a number of the amounts mentioned on the account do not check with the receipts attached.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would review this account and forward a corrected one.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\n\nRev.

I am now returning you the account with corrected receipt, which I trust will be satisfactory.\n\nWith regard to the amount of $6.00 for this trip I would say that it is very reasonable, as all taxi drivers would ask $10.00 for a trip of that distance.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is apparently the reason he has written direct to the Dept.\n\nI may say that regarding the daughter attending the Residential School at Shubenacadie, I really was not approached in the matter, and the papers were completed at the School.\n\nI return herewith letter from Gallant, as requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nN.

The application form was approved by yourself.\n\nPlease let me know if Stephen Gallant is Eileen's father. If so, the Department will make immediate arrangements for her discharge from the Shubenacadie School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nN. A.

There has been a bad cold around and we have had our share, but in the case of this girl it has taken a serious turn. Previous examination and x-ray have shown that her lungs are not strong, and when she first came here, we had to send her to the hospital for a bad type of venereal disease. We will try and keep you informed so that you can let her parents know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I.\nFebruary 11th, 1938\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your letter 51-0-10 of January 25th regarding Eileen Gallant for whom Stephen Gallant, is seeking for her, her discharge from the Indian Day School at Shubenacadie, N. S. It is quite true, as far as I can learn, that Stephen Gallant is her father. However I enclose herewith a letter received today from Rev. J. P. Mackey which speaks for itself.\n\nI will await your further remarks in this case.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAgent.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 14, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn view of the information contained in Reverend Father Mackey's letter to you of the 6th instant I think you will agree that no further action can be taken at the present time regarding Eileen Gallant.\n\nIt would appear that even though she recovers from her present illness it may be some time before she can be sent home from the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nN. A. McDougall, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSummerside, P.E.I.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 14, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nA request was recently received from Stephen Gallant for the discharge of his daughter Eileen from the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. Indian Agent McDougall has forwarded to us your letter to him of the 6th instant in which it appears that this girl is rather seriously ill at the present time. Under these circumstances no action can be taken with reference to sending her home and when she recovers from her present illness it will possibly be necessary to keep her for some time until her health is fully improved. You might keep me informed regarding her condition in order that a decision can be made regarding the time when she should be returned to her father.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S., Feb. 4, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of January 11th informed us that you had no applications for these two, and one girl from the Antigonish agency. On receipt of your letter we wrote both agents and the agent from Antigonish stated that his application for Alice Young was sent to you on September 15, 1937. Mr. MacDougall, agent for P.E.I., replied to our letter by sending two application forms, asking that the children be examined here and the papers as far as possible filled in. These things were done and the papers were returned to him. Whether they reached you or not, we do not know.\n\nFor myself I cannot understand why they should send children to the school, before they obtain your approval of the application.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. F.P. Mackey.\nExtract from Dr. Richard's letter of February 10, 1935.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform the Department I have received only few days ago news concerning Maurice Brown, your letter No. 51-0-10 of January 7th, for the reason this boy is not living on the Eel River Reserve, and apparently is not Indian. I am submitting correspondence on this matter and Department can decide and advise me what to do for this boy.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n(Sgd.) Dr. Art Richard.\nIndian Agent.\n\nWith regard to the above the following is an extract from Dr. Disbrow's letter of January 21, 1935:\n\nDear Doctor Richard:\n\nI interviewed the boy named Maurice Brown. Unless there are influences to the contrary as respects admittance to Shubenacadie the above named boy is apparently unwilling to submit to an examination. He has been asked by me to call at my office. He is at present living off the Eel River Reserve at the home of \"Mike\" Cannel. This man is married to one of the LaBillois family.\n\nYours very truly,\n(Sgd.) J. R. Disbrow.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 18, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to that portion of your letter of the 10th instant which refers to Maurice Brown it is noted that you state that this boy is not an Indian. Under these circumstances he is not eligible for admission to the Shubenacadie Residential School and therefore no further action should be taken regarding him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. A. Richard,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nFebruary 16, 1937.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nNo. 51 - 0 - 10\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant in regard to the discharge of Eileen Gallant. This child has always had a weak constitution, and about two weeks ago, she caught the \"flu\" which quickly developed into pneumonia. The T.B. test by the Public Health Doctor was given a few days before that. At the time we did not have any \"flu\" cases. However, Eileen Gallant has quite recovered and we suppose that within a month, she will be back to normal health again. A letter from her mother some time ago gave the impression that the girl is no longer considered a ward of the Department.\n\nWhen the Doctor says that she is back to normal again, we will let you know.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, we do not wish to send them to Shubenacadie if you consider that you will have sufficient pupils from New Brunswick and Nova Scotia to fill the school.\n\nPlease let me hear from you in this regard and a decision will then be made regarding the Restigouche children.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nOttawa,\nJune 10, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant regarding 6 children of the Restigouche Reserve who, you consider, should receive institutional care.\n\nI am writing to the Principal and on receipt of his reply you will be further advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. Richard, Esq., M.D.,\nIndian Agent,\nRestigouche, Que.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 27th., referring to the admission of Louis Barnaby to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential school. In reply I beg to state that the reason for asking that he be sent to the residential school, is that the parents of this child do not live together and his mother neglects him entirely, and it does not seem that anything can be done to remedy this situation. I have tried every means at my command to have these people live peaceable and look after their children but it simply cannot be done. This boy's mother is away nearly all the time, and his father is no good to look after him and he does not attend the school half of the time. I would recommend that this a bonafide case for the residential school. I might state that there is no accommodation at the Shubenacadie school until after July 1st.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

No doubt, you can arrange with the Principal regarding the date on which this boy should be sent to Shubenacadie.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nCharles Hudson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nRichibucto, N.

The reason that I ask this, is that her mother is in much need of assistance in their home. This girl is only 14 years of age and has attended the Shubenacadie school for 6 years, but under the circumstances I have to recommend that if possible she be allowed to go home.\n\nThe circumstances are like this, Martha's eldest sister who helps her mother, is now married and her husband has quite a good home but she won't leave home until Martha goes home, and this is the cause of many quarrels between this young couple. Mrs. Simon, Martha's mother, has 7 other children, one only 1 month old, so it appears as if it were necessary that this girl is needed to help her mother.\n\nI should have written you before about this case as I promised these people to do so, but I overlooked the matter until today.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nJune 29, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Indian Agent Hudson in which he recommends that owing to home conditions Martha Simon be discharged from the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School at the end of June.\n\nIn view of the Agent's recommendation I would appreciate if you would arrange to send this girl to her home.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

No. 51 - 0 - 10\n\nDear Mr. Spinney:\n\nYour letter to the Department concerning the return of registered pupils, and the coming of seven new ones, has been referred to me.\n\nAs for the children returning from vacation, it was understood that the parents pay the return fare. Most Agents have made it a point to have the return fare from the parents before they would recommend that the children go home for vacation. If you have done this then there should be no difficulty about the ones returning from vacation. If you are not in that position and the parents will not produce the fare, then you pay their way here and we will return the amount to you.\n\nConcerning the new ones, the Department has in the past paid their fare, so you pay it, and send your accounts in triplicate to the Department. As for clothing, get as little as possible for them, and send the account in with the ordinary accounts for food, etc.\n\nThe single fare for most of these children -- I believe the majority are under twelve years of age -- should not exceed fifty-five or sixty cents. For those over twelve, it will be just double. I don't think you could bring them by car for less than that. Needless to say that if the parents of those who are home for vacation, do not pay the return fare, these same children will not go home for vacation next year.\n\nHoping that you will be able to arrange things satisfactorily,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In the past, there have always been some new ones who came along with those returning from vacation. During the summer we had a number of applications from the Maritime Agents, but keeping P.E.I. in mind, we held four places for two boys and two girls. When the children from P.E.I. returned, there came with them Stephen Labobe, 15 years of age. The mother told us that you said it would be all right to bring him along. The other new ones who came are:\n\nMary Clara Thomas, child of John Thomas, Rocky Point\nMargaret Scully, sister of Peter Scully, Morrell\nShuman Joseph Peters, son of Dan Peters, Rocky Point\nIrene Mitchell, half sister of Frances Toney, Scotch Port.\n\nWe do not know whether or not you have made out the application forms for these children. If not, will you please endeavor to do so before the end of the month, in order that our quarterly return sheets will show all children as approved and accepted by the Department.\n\nBertha Labobe did not return and they tell us that she is needed at home. Will you please confirm this? We have some to come who are delayed on account of whooping cough, but when they come, we will have all accommodations taken.\n\nHoping to hear from you soon,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

With reference to the above, I have been requested by Jillian MacLeod wife of Charles MacLeod, and Indian living on the Reserve at Sheet Harbour, to have her small son Russell placed in the Indian School at Shubenacadie N.S.\n\n2. This Woman has parted from her Husband and refuses to live with him, and is now maintaining herself by doing house work in this Village, owing to Charles MacLeod having a very bad criminal record, it is not desired to leave this Boy in his charge, as it is thought that the environment in which this Boy would be compelled to live in, would be very bad for his future welfare. Being as he is considered to be a bright fellow it is thought that with the proper training such as he would receive in the residential school at Shubenacadie, that he would make a useful citizen, this Boy in question as far as can be learned is Six years of age.\n\n3. Attached hereto is a recommendation from the Rev., Thos Johnston Parish Priest in this district who has taken a very keen interest in this Boy's welfare and who desires very much the removal of this Boy from the custody of his Father.\n\n4.

Thos. A. Johnston, St. Peter's Church, Sheet Harbour, N.S., with reference to a boy named Russell McLeod. The boy is 6 years of age and it appears that the father and mother have recently separated. The father has a bad criminal record and it is not considered advisable to leave the boy in his charge. The mother is now maintaining herself by doing housework.\n\nRev. Father Johnston is particularly anxious to have the boy placed in the Shubenacadie School. If you can possibly accept him I should appreciate your so advising Rev. Father Johnston. If you cannot take him please let me know and possibly you might be able to suggest where we could place him.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J. P.

At 9:00 A.M. this date, Father J.F. Mackey, Principal of the Indian School, telephoned this Detachment, stating that DENNY had disappeared again and requested that the member of this Detachment assist in locating him. It was thought DENNY had gone towards South Maitland, Hants Co., N.S. An immediate patrol was made to Admiral Rock and district and although DENNY had been observed by one or two persons around 9:30 A.M., he could not be located. Truro Detachment was notified by telephone to watch northbound trains, particularly the D.A.R.Y and given a verbal description of the boy.\n\n8-10-38\n\n3. This date, accompanied by Father Mackey, a patrol was made to Princeport, Col. Co., via the Indian School car where it was learned that DENNY had succeeded in obtaining a ride on the 6:40 P.M. D.A.R.Y passenger train, bound for Truro. The previous evening, the patrol continued to Truro. Cst. Morgan, who checked incoming trains on the evening of the 7-10-38 stated he had not seen DENNY. It is believed DENNY jumped from the train before its arrival at the Depot. Chief Fraser, Truro Town Police, was notified and also given a description of subject. The patrol continued to New Glasgow and the N.C.O. 1/6 that detachment informed of DENNY's escape. Father Chisson, Indian Agent, was contacted and a patrol made to the Pictou Reserve to see if DENNY could be found. Father Chisson however learned that DENNY prior to being apprehended, had informed two other Indian boys at the reserve, that if caught he intended heading for the State of Maine, U.S.A., to pick potatoes - the next time he escaped! (sheriff Detachment was notified by telephone and a verbal description of subject given.\n\n12-10-38\n\n4.

A cash advance of $1.15 was made to Francis Paul and he was instructed to use this money to purchase himself and his brother and sister a lunch when he had to change trains at Moncton, N.B.\n\nThe Children were placed aboard the Halifax train and the tickets were handed to the conductor who agreed to look after the tickets and the children and see that they were safely transferred at Moncton, N.B. for Shubenacadie, N.B.\n\nSince the expenses for tickets and cash advance were paid for out of the writer's pocket, receipt for three tickets ($3.60) attached.

It would make us possible far better than it has been at Miss Smith's. We are very glad you brought copies of the letters today. How is the family?\nOttawa,\nDecember 21, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Helen Nibby. It is rather difficult to understand the letter but I think she is referring to her children who are in the Shubenacadie residential school and who she apparently desires should be sent home for the Christmas holidays.\n\nFor many reasons which will no doubt suggest themselves to you the Department does not allow holidays at Christmas and I might say further that no valid reason has yet been given to us why holidays should be allowed at that period of the year.\n\nThere is no question that the children attending the Shubenacadie residential school receive every possible care and attention and in addition at Christmas time there are always special festivities which the children enjoy. For your information I enclose a copy of circular letter of March 30, 1937, governing holidays for children attending residential schools.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC.

Morris at his last visit at the agency; the parents have been interviewed, and Mr. Morris asked me to take the necessary steps to obtain their admission.\n\nThose pupils are sent to Shubenacadie School for the following reasons:\n\n1. Albert Condo's children.... There are 11 young children in the family, residing in a very small house. The father is T.B. treated at Quebec sanatorium, but comes home for three weeks or so from time to time. He is contagious for the rest of the family. An other child of that family, Aldric Condo, 16 years of age, has been declared T.B. lately and is at present at the Rimouski sanatorium since last week. In order to avoid more contagion of the whole family and more especially amongst the young children, I think the only way is to send the five other children to Shubenacadie School.\n\n2. John Martin's child..... Mrs. Martin the mother has a very serious heart trouble and paralysed of one arm. Under doctor's recommendation, she can not do anything in the house. Mrs. Martin has explained her case to Mr. Morris himself at his last visit.\n\nThe four children who were attending Shubenacadie School last year will leave Monday next, September 1st, with the six new ones unless ordered to the contrary...... Rev. Father Brown has been notified accordingly.\n\nE. Arsenault, Agent.\nCharlottetown, P.E.I., August 26th, 1947.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch  \nDepartment Of Mines & Resources  \nOTTAWA.\n\nEnclosed find five applications for admission to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\nThe three Bernard children have been at the St. Vincent's Orphanage Charlottetown since last fall, the father of these children died about two years ago, and the mother is unable to look after them properly, there seems to be no place for them except the Residential School.\n\nKathleen Paul has been at the Orphanage for the last six years, her board and care has been paid for by the Indian Affairs Branch, the Mother Superior felt it was time she was sent to the Indian School, the mother of this child has been in the Hospital for the Insane for the past two years, and we cannot find out where the father is at present.\n\nPatrick Sylvan Paul son of Peter and Annie Paul cannot go to school at Rocky Point as there is no school there, therefore they would like to send him to the Indian school at Shubenacadie.\n\nJ.

I brought the matter to Mr. Morrison's attention but he refused to sign the document as he does not wish to have the boy go to school on account of the assistance he gives him, leading him about. However, when the family are transferred to Eskasoni, the father can be attended to and will not require the services of his son in this respect, in fact it will be to the benefit of all concerned as, without the boy, the father cannot travel, without any necessary purpose, as much as he has been doing.\n\nI would be pleased to have you authority to take the above referred to action as soon as possible.\n\nF.B.

Further to above and memo re same from O.C., Halifax Sub-Division dated 19-7-48.\n\n2. This matter was again taken up with Mr. Rice, the Indian Agent (reference to para. 1 of above-noted memo) and he stated that in view of the fact that he was also the Superintendent of the Indian School, that he could order the removal of the boy from the home of his father, if he thought that the conditions were unsuitable for the boy. Mr. Rice also agreed to accompany the patrol to Antrim in order to remove the boy.\n\n3. 22-7-48. This date, Cst. Ecker and the writer, accompanied by Mr. Rice, patrolled to Antrim to the home of Charlie McLeod (Indian), where Russell McLeod was located. Charlie McLeod was very hostile towards Mr. Rice and his intentions of removing the boy to the Indian School, however, Mr. Rice ordered that the boy be taken, and he was placed in the police car, and transported to the Indian School at Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\n4. After getting into the police car, and leaving the farm of his father, Russell McLeod expressed his gratefulness of the fact that the patrol had arrived to take him, as his father had been threatening to beat him that day, and hadn't been treating him very well. Upon arrival at the Indian School, his former home, he seemed very pleased and satisfied with the arrangements made for him, and was glad of his prospects of a decent life.\n\n5. In view of the fact that the father of the boy was hostile about the boy's removal from his farm, it is possible that he might appear at the Indian School, and might influence the boy to leave. In considering this, Mr. Rice, the Indian Agent, stated that he did not want Charlie McLeod to put in an appearance at the Indian School at any time, and should he appear, he wanted the police notified and have him removed with a consideration of prosecutions.\n\n6. As previously mentioned, the position of the boy at the school will be as an employee, under the supervision of Mr. White, the caretaker, who is most capable.\n\n7.

Neary,\nSup't of Indian Education.\n\nEnclosed you will find two Applications for Admission forms for Barbara Atwin and Alvin Francis Atwin.\n\nThey are brother and sister who have lost their mother and father. They were making their home with their grandmother, Mrs. Mary Atwin. This woman appeared to be fond of the children but her sons, married men, stated that it was too much for her to look after the children as she was too old. I then decided to send them to Shubenacadie and had Dr. Wright fill in the forms on September 4th.\n\nMrs. Atwin wished to keep the children and suggested that she go to Kingsclear with them. I agreed to this but last Saturday, September 16th while I was away Mrs. Atwin brought the children to my house and left them. She was going to mine to pick potatoes, and she told me I could do with the children as I wished. I got in touch with Father Macleod and he informed me that he had room for these children; therefore, I am taking them to the school.\n\nIt will be noted that the signature of the father is missing as the father and mother are both dead and the grandmother who cared for them is in Maine and I do not know when she will return.\n\nI trust that my action in this case meets with your approval and that these forms may be passed without a signature of parent or guardian.\n\nEdward J.

This family was living on the St. Mary's Reserve, but I moved them in the early summer to the Kingsclear Reserve. Mrs. Sacobie became ill and was sent to the St. Emile Tb Hospital. At that time, her sister, Mrs. Joseph Waterbury, who was married to a white man and lived at Dipper Harbour, Sunbury County, N.B. took the five children to care for them during the mother's illness. Mrs. Waterbury became poorly herself and had to give the children up. The oldest ones were taken to the Shubenacadie Residential School. The younger ones have been placed in another home at the Kingsclear Reserve.\n\nNo examination was made of these children before taking them to the school, as they were some distance from Fredericton, N.B. I got in touch with Dr. Wright, however, and he assured me that both children were healthy and fit to be taken to the school.\n\nThese children were placed in the Shubenacadie Residential School on November 8, 1948.\n\nI trust this action meets with your approval.\n\nEdward J.

Condo ------- \" \" \" \"\n#0314 Elizabeth Vioaire -- Refuses to Return.\n\nRegarding the two Girls #0313 & 0313 I spoke with their Mother some time ago and she promised to send them back to school at Shubenacadie, a few days later she sent me word that she was not going to, but would send them to the day school on the Reserve. I went to the school today and asked Sister Mary of the Holy Eucharist, Principal, about them and she advises that so far they have not been attending. I will therefore see Mrs. Condo tomorrow and find out her reasons for not doing so.\n\n#0289 Hullman Isaac (Mother dead, Father in Maine) is staying with his sister, Mrs. Albert Martin. I may be able to get him to return, but as he is more or less on his own, and very little interest is taken in him by Mrs. Martin, I will more or less have to do all the convincing myself.\n\n#0314 Elizabeth Vioaire, refuses to return and is not attending the day school on the Reserve. I am also trying to get her to return.\n\nI also have a couple of boys, Edward and John Condo, whose\nFather has deserted, leaving them in care of their step-mother who is totally incapable to look after or manage them; both these boys say they are willing to go to Shubenacadie school.\n\nIn all of the above mentioned cases, there still remains the question of clothing and transportation; none of them have the means of either procuring the necessary clothing, or paying their transportation to Shubenacadie.\n\nWould you therefore please advise me just what further steps might be taken in regards to getting these children sent to school in the very near future.\n\nI might also add that I am taking the matter up with the Department to have our local constable also appointed as truant officer, then I could get a daily report on absenteeism of children of school age as well as have the truant officer visit the homes after obtaining his list from the school. When Mr. Gendron installed me in office on October 16th, last, he advised me that I was also truant officer, but I find that with the work in hand, I certainly have no time to spend travelling around the Reserve trying to find out the reason why some children are not attending school.\n\nYour advice would be greatly appreciated regarding the above matter.\n\n[Signature]\n(C.R.

Evidently the mother is not much interested in their education and you should make immediate arrangements for their return to Shubenacadie.\n\nWhat has been said regarding the above two girls applies also to No. 289, Hullman Isaac and No. 0314, Elizabeth Vioaire.\n\nIf Edward and John Condo are in good health they may also be sent to Shubenacadie. I enclose the usual application forms and certificates of health which you should have completed and returned to this office.\n\nThe Department is prepared to pay their transportation expenses to Shubenacadie and if the parents or guardian are unable to supply clothing you may purchase a small amount for each one of them. It is only necessary to purchase sufficient clothing to have them look respectable while enroute to the school as they will secure new clothing when they reach Shubenacadie.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Education Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n## TRAVELLING EXPENSES\n\n(For instructions, see reverse side)\n\n**DEPARTMENT OF Mines and Resources**\n\n**CLAIMANT**: E.J.

She will be sixteen years of age next April, and we consider that it would be for the welfare of the School, if she were removed from here without any undue delay.\n\nWe don't suppose that you would be acquainted with her background. We understand that her mother is dead, and her father has married again. The Superintendent here has seen her in one of her tantrums, and did she belong to this Province, he agreed that the place for her would be the Monastery of the Good Shepherd. She has been in the School here, since October 20, 1945. If her home conditions are such that she should not go there, then the only place for her is a School of Correction, or Monastery of the Good Shepherd.\n\nWill you please let us know as soon as possible whether to send her home, or will you take charge and have her placed in some Institution?\n\nWe are sending a copy of this letter to Superintendent Rice, and a copy to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Their ages are 5 and 5\u00bd. Would it be possible to have these two children admitted to the Shubenacadie Residential School?\n\n[Signature]\nSuperintendent of Welfare.\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines & Resources\nOttawa,\n\nAttn: Mr. Melan:\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReference your letter dated December 17th, please be advised that John and Edward Condo, also Hullman Isaac, were sent to Shubenacadie Residential School on Thursday morning, December 23rd. I had wired Rev. J.P. Mackey and asked him if it would be acceptable to him to have them sent on that day and he advised me immediately to send them.\n\nHullman Isaac attended Shubenacadie last year and as stated in your letter to me dated Nov. 30th, that it applied to this boy, I sent him with the other two. I took it upon myself to let these boys travel alone after having obtained their tickets, given them enough money to buy sandwiches etc., and advised them that it was for their benefit that all this was being done. I expect word within the next day or two from Rt. Rev. J.P. Mackey, Principal, telling me of their arrival.\n\nI have four or five others whom I would like to send but as I cannot get any cooperation from the parents I would ask your kind advice in the matter, there are at least three in the family of Mrs. Albert Condo, who should be going to school but are not. I spoke to the mother about them and she told me she would send them to the Day School on the Reserve, this she has not done. This woman is in receipt of a war pension which gives her $169.00 per month, made up as follows, $75.00 for herself, $18.00 for the first child, $15.00 for the second, and $14.00 for the third and subsequent children.\n\nSeeing that this woman won't cooperate with me, is it not possible to have them stop payment of this pension, (Child's share) for those of school age who are not attending, in this way she will be brought to realize that it is costing her a lot of money and will then see to it that they either go to Shubenacadie or attend the Day School on the Reserve. I have advised the Department that it would be better to have this pension administered through this office for various other reasons.\nI also have Elizabeth Vienre and Harry Isaac whose parents will not do anything about sending them to school, can these children be sent to school even though the parents will not cooperate? I realize that it is not much use trying to force them to go as it would only mean that they would cause us more trouble and expense than it would be worth; they would probably run away or do something else equally as foolish.\n\nThe situation is at present that these children are on the road all hours of the night, and if something is not done they will eventually all be in trouble, particularly the girls.\n\nYour advice and recommendations would be greatly appreciated. At the beginning of the new term I am going to refuse relief completely to those families who have children of school age who are not attending, unless they have a very good reason. Would this be advisable, and would I have the support of the Department if I done this?\n\nAwaiting your reply and recommendations.\n\nI remain, sir;\n\nYours truly\n\n[Signature]\n\n(C.R.

They are part of a family of seven and the family are in straitened circumstances.\n\nThe father is a steady worker, not too bright. The mother has spent several periods in the N.S. asylum and is not at all a fit person to handle children in the adolescence stage.\n\nThese children are undernourished and somewhat neglected. Skin diseases spread through the family from lack of care. Like a number of Indian parents these people think a boy or girl after ten or twelve should have the dealing of events as they pertain to them. I think this oldest boy should have some control and supervision, as we have caught him several times in truancy and misbehaviour.

Two of these children were abandoned by the mother in the S.M.T bus station, Saint John, N.B. They were taken from there to the Children's Aid shelter in St. John, N.B., where I picked them up and took them to the Shubenacadie Residential School. Therefore, I did not look up the father to have the application forms signed. The other two children had been making their home with their grandmother on the Woodstock Indian reserve, as the mother ran away with another man a few years ago and the father, who is every place, is a complete drunkard.

This child was six years old on the 27th of June of this year. Arrangements are being made for his admission to the Shubenacadie School at the earliest opportunity.\n\nArthur Francis was three years old on the 18th of March, 1949. His father is crippled and his mother has recently been discharged from hospital where she had undergone prolonged treatment for advanced tuberculosis. There are four other children in the family, and their present house is inadequate. Their financial circumstances are such that the parents are unable to contribute to the support of this boy, and no other family here is willing to accept him.\n\nTwo of the older children will be attending the Shubenacadie School this fall. I would recommend that the child Arthur remain in the orphanage until that time, when he can return to the care of his mother. Were he to return now, the added burden might easily result in the mother suffering a relapse, when the full responsibility for this large family would devolve on the Branch.\n\nI shall advise you immediately the boy Stephen Simon Peters is admitted to the Shubenacadie School.\n\n[Signature]\nH.

I.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am returning the requested forms in connection with Stephen Peters.\n\nWe are never eager to keep children for a lengthy period but this is one case where I think a change would be undesirable. Stephen finds it very difficult to make adjustments to new places and different people. His Mother's very sudden death evidently was a severe shock to him and now that he seems so happy and contented with his little playmates after so many months of maladjustment it seems a shame to transplant him again. To place him in a permanent home it would be worth the effort but simply to go to another Boarding school it doesn't seem worth while.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\"Sister Mary Henry Cam\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nRe: Stephen Simon Peters\n\nOn July 2, 1949 Mr. J. H. Gordon, who was acting Superintendent wrote you requesting that the above be admitted to Residential School at Shubenacadie.\n\nOn July 11, 1949 your Department approved the admission, providing the medical examiner stated he was physically fit.\n\nI am enclosing application for admission together with a copy of letter as received from Sister Superior, St. Vincent's Orphanage, Charlottetown, P. E. I. where the child is being presently maintained.\n\nI have spoken to the Sister Superior and Dr. J. MacMillan who carried out the examination and would recommend that under the circumstances this child be allowed to remain at the Orphanage where he is apparently happy and contented.\n\nThe cost of maintaining this child at the orphanage is approximately $23.00 a month.\n\nG.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMFT/H M\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Citizenship & Immigration, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed you will find an \"Application for Admission\" for an Indian girl, Patricia Mary Sacobie, of the Saint Mary's Indian Reserve to be placed in the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nThis girl was in the Shubenacadie Residential School in 1948, while her mother was a patient in the TB Hospital (St. Basile, N.B.) On the mother's arrival home, she wished the children with her and decided to keep them home and send them to school. She died, however, on September 4, 1949, and her brother, Edward, took the family to live with him.\n\nHe went to Maine to pick potatoes shortly after that and took the children with him. Therefore, they missed school the greater part of September and October.

School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.,\n\nDear Father Mackey:\n\nI have your September Quarterly Return for the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nOn checking this return it is noted that an Admission Form for the following pupils have not been received by the Department. Technically, the Department is not obliged to pay the grant for a pupil until his admission to the school has been approved. However, to avoid delay in paying the grant, the grant will be paid for this quarter but it would be appreciated if you would consult the Superintendent concerned and have these admissions cleared up:\n\nHubert Gould\nMiranda MacDonald\nJohn Lewis\nFrances Gilbert Francis\nCharles Louis Bernard\nPhyllis Jean Bernard\nAlbert Jos.

The father deserted the family approximately two years ago and they are on total relief. Four other children of this family attend the school regularly and are being readmitted this year.\n\n(2) George Francis. This boy is the son of Frank Francis, Band No. 74, Eskasoni Band. He is of low IQ and the father does not appear to have too much control. This child is a definite liability in our day school. I believe that a few years in the Residential School, where discipline is maintained at all times, might do this boy some good.\n\n(3) Eugene Daniel Paul. This boy is the son of John N. Paul, Band No. 220. He has all the ear marks of a prospective juvenile delinquent. His father, who works away from home considerably, seems unable to exact any discipline from him. He is a definite liability in the day school. I believe that a few years in the Residential School under discipline at all times might work to advantage in his case. However, I will not be surprised if he will end up in a Reformatory. I believe most of his trouble is a lack of discipline on the part of his parents.\n\n(Continued)\nI trust approval will be granted to have these children admitted.\n\nAfter conferring with Monsignor Mackey and learning that sufficient room was available I presumed permission to place in the school the following three children whose applications arrived too late to allow for authorization to be received before opening date:\n\n(1) Emma Johnson, daughter of Ben N. Johnson, and\n(2) Diana and Lena Toney, children of Benjamin Toney, of Whycocomagh.\n\nProper application forms will be completed immediately.

This youth is only five years of age but his parents are separated and are living somewhere in the New England States, having abandoned their large family. Five older brothers and sisters are already in the Residential School which will lessen to a degree the responsibility on the School staff for his care. Living with relatives who do not want him is an unsatisfactory atmosphere in which to bring up this child and I feel he will be much better physically and temperamentally re-united with his older brothers and sisters.\n\n(3) Albert Julian.

This youth is only five and one-half years and is one of a family of six children. Three of his older brothers and sisters will be re-entering the Residential School this fall and consequently the burden on the school staff of caring for a child of this age will not be too excessive. The family live in a two room tar paper shack and during the summer months the children are forced to sleep in the wood shed.

Father Mackey and I have discussed the economic possibilities of this type of work and I think he has now agreed that much could be done with the Indian children if he had the facilities. Present drains on finances are severe and I can easily understand restricted budgets. However, with comparatively small expenditures articles in clay sold on the main highway like the one running through Shubenacadie would soon produce results. Furthermore this is the only place in the province where we could get characteristic Indian designs from the Indians themselves and Sister Paul is trying to develop these.\n\nFather Mackey will discuss the possibility of a kiln with Mr. Shaw of L. E. Shaw Company, and I think co-operation from that source is assured. The Provincial Department of Industry and Public Information through its minister is interested in developing this work throughout the province. Publicity and perhaps some subsidy can be secured for impoverished localities, but other than for the publicity it may not be possible to secure aid for the Indian School.\n\nI am writing you this letter so you will be informed about the possibilities in Shubenacadie and the attempt we would like to see made to aid the Indian children in acquiring a skill based on a natural resource plentiful in the province. My impression is that skill in pottery making would be a valuable addition with economic possibilities to the commercially known one which the Indians possess, the making of baskets. Our hope is that in the near future we shall be able to command some of the local market for clay products which is at the present time being satisfied from outside our provincial limits.\n\nAnything you can do to help us in this matter through\nMr. P. P...........(2)\n\nproviding the Indian School with the necessary equipment which is not expensive would be much appreciated.\n\nI may have occasion to be in Ottawa within a short time and if I do I shall try to make an appointment to see you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. K. Ford.\nInspector, Local Technical Schools & Mechanic Science Departments.\n\nEKF:C\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am extremely interested in the contents of your letter of the 8th instant and this Branch is quite willing to give Father Mackey and Sister Paul as much assistance as our finances will permit.\n\nI note that the necessary equipment will not be expensive and I am writing to Father Mackey today to ascertain the exact expenditure involved.\n\nWe appreciate the interest that you are taking in this project and whenever you are in Ottawa I would be glad to have you call on me.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E.K. Ford,\nInspector, Local Technical Schools &\nMechanic Science Departments,\nNova Scotia Technical College,\nHalifax, N.S.\nOttawa,\nMarch 13, 1941.\n\nDear Father Mackey:\n\nI have a letter from Mr. E.K. Ford, Inspector of Technical Schools, Halifax, N.S., in connection with your pottery project.\n\nI feel that it is very desirable to encourage this work and you will note that it is our intention to assist you financially in the purchase of the necessary equipment which Mr. Ford states is not expensive. Please let me know exactly what expenditure is involved and just how far the work has gone.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. J.F. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \nSuperintendent of Training  \nDepartment of Mines & Resources  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOTTAWA, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nIt is too bad so much delay has occurred in getting to Father Mackey of the Shubenacadie Indian School the specifications and costs of a ceramic kiln and further too bad I missed you when you were here. The past few days I have had in the office and some definite information is now available.\n\nWe have the drawings, descriptions, and cost estimates of a kiln that can be built for $200. The price given me was $150 but I arbitrarily added $50. Single firings can be completed at about $2.00. From the specifications we have I am satisfied that the work can be done with local labour.\n\nWhen the matter was first discussed I believed we could construct a small kiln suitable for school or small production purposes at a cost of $200 or $250 which would burn wood or coal. Subsequent careful investigation showed that the cost of underground flues, smoke stack, ironing for bracing and other factors would run the cost to several hundred dollars. Furthermore the successful use of such kilns, I learned, requires much skill and even experienced men have considerable losses on any new kiln. For such reasons the small outside wood-fired kiln was given up even though it at first looked promising in view of our estimated future needs in various localities in the province.\n\nThe specifications we have provide for an electrically heated kiln, inside measurements, 18 inches approximately by two feet; lined with light refractory (heat resistant) brick; outside shell, steel plate, standing on ordinary hollow building tile for ventilation beneath; no stacks or flues necessary; and operated off either 110 or 220 volt circuit with no transformer necessary. Such a kiln can be set up in a building anywhere, is very easy to operate because the element of judgment as to heating is largely eliminated. The switches are thrown in and the kiln brought to heat checked by cones. The light refractory brick use a .06 cone, I judge about 1800\u00b0F. The price on this job should not exceed $200 including the electric heating coils. One has been in use in New Brunswick for some time and the owner maintains he\nMr. P.P.......(2)\n\ncan set them up for $100. I am a little skeptical of this estimate. Single firing prices are given at $1.50 where electricity costs 2\u00bd cents per k.w.h. I think it is more in Shubenacadie so I allowed $2.00 which is probably below the operating costs of either wood or oil due to economy of burning.\n\nAs you know the Technical Education Branch has taken the first step in our appropriate field - that of training workers. The training project has grown from a class of 15 at Mahone Bay in 1937 to three classes enrolling 50 at Antigonish this summer and we had to turn one class away. We are getting results with children and adult groups in several places in the province. Definitely the market is here, - we have indisputable evidence of that. The next step is satisfactory, low cost baking equipment. The Provincial Department of Industry is interested and will help.\n\nIf your Department can co-operate by going ahead at the Indian School I shall be only too glad to work with Father Mackey in his attempts to solve the problems incidental to equipment. I feel sure we can get technical advice on electrical problems from the Technical College staff. The summer months of July and August are the period to do this. At this time also I could spend the needed time to co-ordinate the efforts of those in a position to bring the project through.\n\nI am taking the liberty of sending Father Mackey a copy of this letter for his information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE. K. Ford,\nInspector of Evening Technical Schools & Mechanic Science Departments.\n\nEKF:C\nDear Mr. Ford:\n\nI was extremely interested in your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the specifications and cost of a ceramic kiln to be used at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. I had a short visit at Shubenacadie during Easter week and certainly consider that this work should be encouraged. I note from your letter that you consider the total cost of installing the kiln, including the electric heating coils, will not exceed $200.00. This Branch is prepared to provide this amount and payment will be made on receipt of the usual voucher signed by the Principal of the Shubenacadie School, Rev. Father Mackey. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to him.\n\nWe appreciate the splendid co-operation which you are giving us in this regard and I trust that the future work will be productive of good results.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. E.K.

Mr. Shaw, President and Owner of the N.S. Clay Works promised to give us all the help he could. We interviewed Mr. Shaw about it at least on two occasions, and we did not seem to be getting anywhere. Finally, Mr. Ford, knowing that this work was done in St. John and near St. John, decided that in order to get a real line on things, the best thing to do was to go to St. John. He went in his car, and took Mr. McLeod, our carpenter-engineer with him. Our expenses in the trip was the hotel bill for Mr. McLeod.\n\nAs a result of this trip Mr. McLeod obtained information as to where the high test brick could be obtained, and the construction of the kiln itself. But instead of being fired by coal or wood, the heating would be done by electricity. Mr. McLeod has since constructed a kiln, so Mr. Ford says, much better than any they saw on the trip to St. John.\n\nAs for high test brick and asbestos slabs, a firm, Prescott & Company, of Montreal, was recommended. We made up the specifications and asked them to supply the material. First they wanted to know if they could send the material C.O.D. Our reply was that the Department of Indian Affairs would pay for it, or if they were not satisfied with that, let us know the amount due and we would send the money before they made the shipment. Finally when they did ship it they wanted to know if they could send a sight draft to the Department. We sent them a check immediately.\nimmediately for One Hundred and Twenty-six Dollars and Eighty-eight cents.\n\nWe needed steel plate for the outside, and of course, we could not buy it new, so we hunted around and located an old tender of an engine and got our plates there. We also bought second hand fire brick. There was difficulty getting new fire brick, and the cost had gone up considerably.\n\nWell, we had enough material to start the construction of the kiln. So ahead Mr. Macleod went. Next we were held up for the electrical wire and terminals. Mr. Ford, along with Professor Nicol, electrical engineer, spent a good part of last Friday, January 2nd, here, looking over the kiln, and working out the details for the heating. Again we find ourselves up against a brick wall trying to purchase the ribbon wire, etc. However, a telephone call since Mr. Ford went back to Halifax, informs us that Mr. Saxton, the Principal of the N.S.Tech. College, will order the wire etc., for the College, and turn it over to us. They have priority which allows them to do this. So, that is as far as we are now, we hope by the end of the month to have the kiln in operation. The cost so far for all, amounts to $189.47.\n\nAs for the pottery itself, we must have at least two hundred pieces ready to be fired. For that we have four classes a week, including boys and girls. The teacher, Sister Paul of the Cross, completed her three years of summer school at the week, and now holds a first class certificate. We might also add that her father has supplied her with money to purchase many odds and ends needed in the work.\n\nWe don't think we have forgotten anything, and hope this will be satisfactory.\n\nBy the way, we have paid for everything so far, also travelling expenses for vacations, and Sixty Dollars for teeth, but with increases everywhere, we are finished with that sort of things from now on.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Miss Moodie, however, is of the opinion that there is a man in New Brunswick who would be prepared to make one of these wheels for you. I have asked Miss Moodie to communicate with you and to supply you with all the information she has at her disposal in respect to this man. It is my hope that this letter from Miss Moodie will reach you in the course of a few days. In the meantime, may I thank you very heartily for your letter and for the information contained therein. It is my earnest hope that the pottery project will prove successful and profitable in every sense.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nReverend J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMay 17, 1943.\n\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWe are very glad that you are pleased with the samples of pottery, which Mr. Rice so kindly brought to Ottawa.\n\nThe start was made about three years ago, when the Provincial Department of Education, established a summer school, in order to develop teachers for pottery. The Sisters of Charity were invited to send representatives to this summer school, and Sister Paul of the Cross, of the staff here, was one of the chosen ones.\n\nUnder the impetus given by Mr. Ford, of the N.S. Technical College, we began some work, and also began exploratory work about a kiln. At that time we thought that a kiln could be built in which coal and wood would be used as fuel. We spent a lot of time on it, but got nowhere. By this time, Sister Paul of the Cross had completed two courses, at summer school. In the meantime, we had collected a number of pieces of pottery, and still, had no way of firing or baking them. Mr. Ford then wrote to the Department of Indian Affairs, and we obtained the sum of Two Hundred Dollars towards the building of a kiln. All thought of wood or coal as fuel was abandoned, and it was decided to go ahead with an electric kiln. They have electric kilns in New Brunswick, so Mr. McLeod, our carpenter-engineer, was sent there to look them over. With further assistance from the N.S. Technical College, we got the blue prints, and Mr. McLeod went ahead, and built the kiln, which, from all accounts, was quite an improvement on what he had seen in New Brunswick. We were held up for a long time before we succeeded in getting any heating wire. Finally, we did get it - the first of this year. We were given details by an electrical engineer from the Technical College, and to an amateur, it looked quite complicated. However, anyone who knew anything about electricity was contacted, even to passengers in the smoking compartment on trains, concerning volts, kilowatts, amps, load, and many other things. Finally, we interested a man by the name of Smith, from Stewiacke, the next village, and while holding no degrees from any college, has a very definite talent for things electrical.\nWe rigged the kiln according to the specifications of the electrical engineer, and it was not satisfactory, and so Smith told us what he would do. We contacted the electrical engineer, and he gave us all sorts of warnings, what would happen, if we used heavy wiring, and increased the amperage. It was no good as it was, and we spent plenty of money on it, so we spent another fifty dollars, for wire, fuse boxes, etc., and decided that soon we would know whether we had something or nothing. We have had ten or eleven firings, and everything has gone very satisfactorily. Now they want us to do bookings for other sections.\n\nWe have had a visit from representatives of the N.S. Dept. of Industry, and the supervisor for handicraft seemed more than surprised to learn that the clay for our work is found on the side of a ditch about a hundred yards from the school.\n\nOur problem now is to find a glaze that will take well on both the red and white clay. Miss Black, the supervisor of handicrafts for the province is going to take a ten pound sample to a Danish family in New Brunswick, who have been making pottery for generations, and also making their own glazes. The peculiar thing about it is that they import their clay from Musquodoboit, in Nova Scotia.\n\nWhen Mr. Doucet was here, we were hoping that we might obtain a potters wheel. The one we have was put together by Mr. McLeod, from a defunct potato peeler, cover from the top of a stove, part of a sewing machine, and the motor from a discarded household washing machine. Of course it has only the one speed, and does not run exactly true. In our last requisition for school supplies, we asked for one, and while most of the supplies arrived, we have not heard anything about the potters wheel.\n\nIt is our intention to produce for sale, and if the time ever comes again, to cater to the tourist trade. The kiln is 21\" wide, 24\" deep, and 27\" high, rather larger than we expected to build. We have had as many as sixty-two pieces fired at one time, and as low as fifty-two, depending of course, on the size.\n\nAt the present time, we have four classes, 1 for boys, and three for girls, and some are exceptionally good at it. By the time the younger ones are old enough to be discharged, they should be quite proficient in it. It is our intention to concentrate as much as possible on Indian designs. We hope to get some valuable information along that line from the Fort Anne Museum at Annapolis Royal. On the other hand, Mr. Ford told us the other day that if we would make for him one hundred bean crocks, he would sell them between here and Halifax.\nWe have no separate meter for the kiln, but since no other power is used when it is going, and also that our power charges have been quite uniform for years, we figure that a firing up to 1800 degrees, costs between three and four dollars. We have been offered all the clay we want from a former brick yard plant, and from Mr. Lawlor, a former Indian Agent. We feel quite sure that we can get a first class fire clay that will bake out white. Clay from anywhere near here is quite satisfactory.\n\nAt the present time, we have already fired and ready for glazing about three hundred pieces. We shall go ahead and try different clays, and in that way, have as much variety as possible. As soon as we are ready, Lawlor's store has offered to make a window display for us. We expect to have about a hundred pieces on display there by the end of this week.\n\nWe hope to purchase a stamp, about the size of a five cent piece, and have an Indian head in the center, and M I C H A C around the edge, and use that to indicate the Indian origin.\n\nThey have pottery as one of the subjects at Mt. St. Bernard, affiliated with St. Francis Xavier University at Antigonish. There they have an oil burner kiln, but from what we have heard, it is not too satisfactory, and requires a lot of attention.\n\nWe have used to a limited extent some of the diagrams on the cards you sent. If you think it would be worth while, we would be glad to send to the Department a number of pieces for sale, say from fifty to seventy-five.\n\nWe would be grateful if Miss Moodie would send us samples of glaze, especially red color.\n\nHope we have not overtaxed your patience with this lengthy epistle.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is wonderful, however, to have such good clay available, and to have found out already how to handle a kiln. Have you considered producing more primitive unglazed articles? There is ready sale for such goods, although they have to be very carefully packed, and they are used for things not required to hold liquids. They would not be suitable for pitchers, for instance, but I have seen candle holders, match holders, ash trays, etc., simply baked, and sold in the natural color\u2014I believe potters call these baked, unglazed articles, \"biscuits\".\n\nAs for design\u2014the less ornamentation there is, the better the article seems to sell, except that at present there is a vogue for \"slip-painting\" before baking. The potter makes a thin paste of clay, which is colored by artificial means if necessary, and \"slip-paints\" a simple design which may be just irregular lines or daubs. If the article is light in color, they use dark-colored clay. If it is dark in color, they use light-colored clay, and the variations are endless. The simpler the design the better.\n\nKjeld and Erica Deichman, of Moss Glen, N.B., are about the best potters in Canada. Besides having wonderful artistic sense, they are very practical\u2014and these may be the people Miss Black, the N.S. Supervisor, referred to. If you could get Mr. and Mrs. Deichman to spend a week or two at your school, I believe any expenditure involved would be well worth while. They are not mercenary, and are sincerely interested in promoting the production of good pottery. Mr. Deichman makes their own potter's wheels\u2014he used an old car axle, sewing machine treadle, etc. (something as you did), but he is sufficiently experienced to\nto have been able to get his wheels to run true, and he governs the speed by foot-pedal. He makes the larger articles\u2014vases, jars, bowls, etc., on the wheel, and his wife is particularly skilled in modelling by hand-method, charming little animal figures\u2014colts, lambs (and sometimes humans). She uses an old gramophone to provide her with a wheel. These two have experimented and found wonderful glazes, and here again, I can recommend no better source of information than Mr. Deichman.\n\nIf you could produce even one or two small articles in quantity, I would love to include them in our catalogue and price-list of handicraft merchandise\u2014but our orders come to us requiring quantities of from one to 12 gross of a line. The only times I can sell small lots of goods are when we put on exhibitions, and these are out for the duration. We could certainly use ash trays, small bowls to hold matches, candle holders, etc., in the unglazed \"biscuit\"\u2014but we would need to have samples of two or three very plain, simple designs of each, and then decide on one of each, and definitely try to produce in quantity. It would be a wonderful thing to have a pottery centre in the village, where your graduates could earn their living after leaving school. Certainly there is great opportunity for the sale of pottery, but it will require great care in figuring the prices per dozen articles to be paid to the workers, and the prices to be charged the wholesalers. With our basketry sales we have our list price\u2014and the selling agency is given a discount of 30 per cent to cover costs of selling and collecting accounts. In addition, we add from 5 to 20 per cent to cover transportation costs from reserves, packing, cartons, etc.,\u2014so the wholesale price has to be considerably higher than the price paid to the workers.\n\nI have always hoped to get back to Shubenacadie since my one short visit there when the school was barely completed. Now that I know of this pottery achievement I am twice as anxious! I do hope you will find it possible to engage the Deichmans for at least a short period, and that they will be able to iron out some of the difficulties you have encountered.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev.

The children do the shaping over a heavy chair. Dig it up and bring it to the firing oven. The oven is a very room where it is said to rid stoneware from being and the same heat which makes the pottery hard and fired to the required degree of hardness. This is accomplished by the use of firewood, wood and lime. The electric kiln is used to shape the clay, removes the moisture and fires the pieces. The electric kiln is simply one of the many improvements made in the school.\n\nThe pottery project, begun in 1925, was started by Miss E. B.

General schooling is provided up to and including the eighth grade.\nDear Reverend Sister:\n\nWhen Mr. Arneil returned from Shubenacadie he had with him the correspondence regarding the Amaco Electric Potter's Wheel, which is available from the Denver Fire Clay Company. There appears to be a little difficulty in securing the necessary priority, and as I was leaving for Toronto about the time Mr. Arneil returned to Ottawa, I suggested that I might be able to locate a wheel in that city.\n\nThere is one available which is being held for us pending receipt of your approval. It is not operated by electricity but by a foot pedal, and I used one exactly like it in the pottery room of the Women's Art Association of Canada. The only criticism I would make is that the pedal is for the left foot only, and I prefer the kind with a pedal straight across the frame so that either foot can be used. I think this could easily be changed, as the pedal can be lengthened in the manual training class. The height of this wheel from the floor to the top of the turntable is about four feet. The box in which the wheel sits is approximately two and a half feet square and the wheel is very easy to operate. The price of this wheel is $76.50 F.O.B., Toronto, and if you do not think it will be suitable I think I will order it for another Reserve where clay is available for pottery purposes.\n\nI have been very anxious to visit Shubenacadie again -- my only visit was at the time the school was being opened and of course there were no interesting projects such as yours started at that time. I have\n\nReverend Sister Paul of the Cross,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nI have......\nsuggested a number of times that I should be permitted to go to Nova Scotia, but we have been so short-handed since the outbreak of war that we are all just paddling along breathlessly trying to keep our heads above water.\n\nI think you should be proud of the progress you have made in connection with the production of pottery and feel that your pupils will eventually be the nucleus of a pottery industry on the Reserve. Before such an industry is established I hope to be given the opportunity of visiting Shubenacadie in order that I may take advantage of your experience and your suggestions in following up the work being done in your school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nIn Charge,\nHandicraft Section.\nIndian Residential School\nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia\n\nJan. 30th 1945.\n\nMiss Kathleen Moodie\nDear Miss Moodie,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Jan. 15th I appreciate your interest in the purchasing of a pottery wheel for the school.

Through local sales of these articles the Sister in charge of the pottery group informed Inspector Arnell that they have sufficient funds to purchase an electric potter's wheel, but in order to secure the one they desire they have been informed by the Denver Fire Clay Company that \"a priority of AA-3 or better\" is required. Apparently the Sister did not know how to go about securing any priority and when Inspector Arnell visited Shubenacadie she requested our assistance.\n\nI enclose the letter from the Denver Fire Clay Company, together with cuttings from some catalogue which Sister Paul of the Cross gave to Inspector Arnell. The wheel which they decided upon is the Amaco Electric Potter's Wheel No.2 -- $198.00 plus tax which I believe brings the cost to approximately $250.00. This does not take into consideration the fact that payment should be made in American funds.\n\nI will appreciate it very much if you could arrange to secure the wheel in question -- to be shipped to:\n\nThe Principal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.,\nCanada.\n\nThe account could be paid through this office and collected from the school.\n\nI feel that the work done under the direction of Sister Paul of the Cross is very creditable and I am anxious to do everything possible to assist her in promoting this work. I might mention that I communicated with the Sister and suggested a foot power wheel which could be secured at a lower cost. She has replied, however, that they prefer the electric wheel as the foot power wheels are too high to be used by smaller children.\n\nSister Paul of the Cross has requested that the letter from The Denver Fire Clay Company and the catalogue cuttings attached should be returned to her.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nActing Director\nDear Father Brown:\n\nWhen Inspector Arneil visited Shubenacadie he was very much impressed by the progress which had been made in the production of pottery under the direction of Reverend Sister Paul of the Cross. At that time the Reverend Sister gave to Inspector Arneil some correspondence from The Denver Fire Clay Company, together with a catalogue cutting showing the type of electric wheel which the Sister had been trying to secure. It was understood that if at all possible we were to secure a Government priority and place an order for an Amaco Electric Potter's Wheel, Number 2, Floor Model, (list price $198.00).\n\nWe have been able to have this order placed and the total estimated cost, which includes exchange on the purchase of American funds, war tax, excise, etc., is $317.00.\n\nWe have been advised by the Chief Purchasing Agent that the wheel will probably be shipped to the Port of Entry nearest Shubenacadie (possibly Truro), and that it will be necessary for someone to go from Shubenacadie in order to clear the wheel through the Customs. The wheel will be released from the Customs after you have paid the account for duty and excise, which will amount to approximately $60.00.\n\nAs the order has been placed through the Department of Mines and Resources, payment for the wheel itself must be made by cheque from this department. As we are nearing the end of the fiscal year our funds for the purchase of equipment have been exhausted, and it is necessary, therefore, to ask you to mail to me your cheque for $250.00, payable to Receiver General of Canada, and including on the face of the cheque the identifying word \"Shubenacadie\". It is possible that after the account is paid in American funds there will be some small balance which of course will be returned to you.\n\nI have no doubt that you are conversant with the arrangements between Inspector Arneil and Reverend Sister Paul of the Cross, and I may say we are pleased to have been able to be of assistance in this matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nReverend Father Brown,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie,\nNova Scotia.\n\nSubject: Order 1097\nDFC Register No. 18180\n\nAttention: Sister Paul of the Cross.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe appreciate and thank you for the above order which we have just received. Our formal acknowledgement is enclosed showing our understanding of it and, if not correct in every way, please advise us.\n\nShipment will be made as promptly as possible. If it is unduly delayed, we will inform you later in detail.\n\nIn accordance with your letter of March 20th, we plan to furnish a DFC type B Potter's Wheel instead of the Amaco model specified on this purchase order.

As there is some doubt regarding the exact cost of this machine, it will not be necessary for you to forward your cheque immediately. However, as soon as the machine reaches you, the firm will no doubt send you their account, and at that time you should forward the account to this office, together with a school cheque covering the cost of the machine. We will deposit this cheque and issue a government cheque to the firm.

I have, no doubt, that these children have covered the work required and qualified for the silver brooch. However, I am enclosing special cards which you will kindly complete and return to this office at your earliest convenience. This matter, then will be dealt with fully and I hope that we will be able to award these to the pupils recommended.\n\nEnclosed also find a circular re the awarding of brooches.\n\nI wish to bring to your attention the second paragraph of your letter which asks for four scarlet brooches. I presume that you mean the third year proficiency badge for these subjects.

Vincent,\nDepartmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nWe wish to thank you for your Request for Quotation of May 17th.\n\nWe have thoroughly checked the sample over and find it to be 1/2 x .030 Chromel A ribbon. Ordinarily we do not recommend the use of Chromel A material above 2000 degrees. However, in pottery kilns, where the temperature climb is fairly slow, you may be able to have satisfactory life at a slightly higher temperature, but 2200 degrees is too high in the writer's opinion. However, if you have this material operating satisfactorily at present, there is no reason why you should not continue to use same.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nWALKER METAL PRODUCTS LIMITED,\n\n(Sgd) P.E. Banwell\nEngineer.\n\nPEBanwell/dm\nMemorandum\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nRe: Heating wire for kiln used for Pottery at the Shubenacadie School.\n\nPlease find herewith copies of a letter received from Walker Metal Products Limited, Walkerville, Ontario.

B. F. Neary, Esq.,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Ont., Canada.\n\nIn view of the fact that a Manual Training Instructor has been hired to teach at the Indian Day School, Micmac, N. S. and at the Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N. S., the matter of housing accommodation has been discussed with Mr. Doucet of your office.\n\nThere does not appear to be any vacancy in the village of Shubenacadie or in the immediate area which Mr. Brown and his family could rent during the current academic year.\n\nIt would appear if Mr. Brown was to obtain a dwelling on the Indian reserve, Micmac, N. S. that his usefulness to this agency will be greatly increased.\n\nMr. Doucet has suggested the possibility of a residence for this teacher being built on the Indian reserve. It would appear that due to the housing situation in this locality, that this might be the only solution.\n\nMay we have your comments, please.\n\nH. C. RICE, Superintendent,\nShubenacadie Indian Agency.\nWe have no funds \u2014 house would cost at least $8,000.\nJune 7th, 1949.\n\nMr. H.C. Rice\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nMicmac, Hants Co., N.S.\n\nWe have your letter of May 30th with reference to a residence for the manual training inspector at the Shubenacadie Schools.\n\nThe Department desires you to continue your efforts to rent a building in the Village of Shubenacadie or in the immediate vicinity that might be suitable. If you can obtain such, you should wire us immediately.\n\nNo funds were provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a residence for him.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nIndian Residential School  \nShubenacadie, Nova Scotia  \nMay 31, 1949.\n\nDept. of Mines and Resources  \nIndian Affairs Branch  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nATTENTION OF MR. PHILAN\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 27, and the memorandum from Walker Metal Products Ltd., of Walkerville, Ontario, I wish to inform you that at no time does the kiln go over 1800 degrees, and we only want to make sure that we have at least two hundred degrees (200) of safety in order to insure long life.\n\nThe last wire 1/2 X .030 Chromel A ribbon lasted well over five years at least, and proved very satisfactory. If this wire or a wire of even higher degree is available it would be most satisfactory to us.\n\nIs the car yet on the production line?\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nRev. J.P.

The junior division have 68 children in the classroom; the intermediate 35 and the senior 55. It will be necessary to operate a fourth classroom. There is space available. A room originally intended for a classroom is being used as storage and for the pottery. This room which is identical to one of the classrooms would be, after a general clean-up, very suitable. I would suggest that the principal submit estimates for the preparation of this room.\n\nThere is no workshop and no space available for one. It will be necessary to build a separate building that would serve as a workshop, (general shop and pottery) and also provide storage space. The principal should obtain estimates for a building that would supply his needs.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nA. J.

It is the room opposite Grade 1, and has been used as a workshop and also a place for making pottery.\n\nTo make a classroom would require plastering around most of the windows, sanding of the floor, and two coats of paint on walls and ceiling. These with other little things would cost from $150.00 to $200.00. In addition there would be black-board 40-50 feet and twenty movable desks\u201410 small and 10 medium.\n\nSince the room with the kiln is next to the garage, we could have the garage as the shop for the pottery class. The garage for the car (if it comes) could be attached to the workshop and manual training.\n\nWe do not know what Mr. Doucet has in mind but we think a building forty by thirty, outside measurement, giving two rooms twenty by thirty would do for manual training and workshop.\n\nWe at the school could do a good part of work. With the help of two carpenters, a building not furnished on the inside should not take longer than forty days to build. If the rooms were found to be too cold then something might be done to remedy the matter in another year.\n\nWe think we have taken everything into consideration and figure that at the most, renovation of classroom, garage and new building should not cost more than $4200.00.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

However, to date, same has not been received and it is most urgent that immediate steps be taken on the construction of this building.\n\nIt is also difficult to submit estimates on the actual cost of the materials required until such time as the plans are at hand. As previously stated, there are some materials which can be obtained through the Shubenacadie Indian Agency but considerable materials will have to be purchased locally and for these, competitive tenders should be called.

I find conditions here at the Residential School much better than on my last visit. You will note that we included some five thousand dollars in the Supplementary Estimates for the erection of a Manual Training shop at the Residential School. I think we will have to go ahead with the building in the near future even though the money may not be available for another month.\n\nWould you please have Mr. Doucet send at once to Monseigneur Mackey, the drawing and the bill of materials for the Manual Training shop he intends to have built here. Most of the lumber can be supplied from the mill on the reserve at $40.00 per M. The Manual Training teacher can help with the erection and the sooner the plans get here, the sooner they can begin to get the building covered in.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nI will get them to\nagreement for the manual training\nbuilding as soon as possible.

Official letter of September 10th authorized purchase of the items shown on the list which you forwarded under cover of your letter of August 24th.\n\nThe account attached to Voucher No. 1638 is for double the amount requested on the list which you sent. We also feel that several of the prices are high. I refer particularly to paint at $1.95 a quart.\n\nWhen replying you should state why you apparently increased the amount. You should also replace the Voucher by two Vouchers, one covering supplies delivered to the manual training room at the Shubenacadie Day School, and the other for supplies for the manual training room at the Shubenacadie Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST\nAttach.\nChief, Education Division\nTo the Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPlease furnish the following Supplies for use of Shubenacadie Indian Residential School No. 265\n\nVote 516 Primary 12 Object 415 Date Required at once\n\nShip to H.C.

I am sure that you realize the responsibility which you and the Department are assuming for the welfare of these children who will be away from their homes, and many of whom will come from homes where they have not had too good care and feeding.\n\nIn the first place you should resolutely refuse to receive any pupil who has tuberculosis in any form whether of the lungs or joints, or scrofula. The lot of such children may not now be happy, and you may think they will improve in the school, but tuberculosis in any form is contagious, and if you take them in you will have reason to regret it. They will give the disease to healthy children.\n\nIn the second place you will have to feed your pupils better than you would think necessary. The healthiest schools are those in which the feeding is best. I suppose you are getting cows. If you can give the children plenty of clean, whole milk you will be going far to keep them healthy. I do not believe in butter making at schools. The pupils ought to have the milk fat and butter too. A diet high in protein - fish, meat, beans, cheese, etc., seems best for Indians. Give them brown bread if possible. Your cows, of course, ought to be free from tuberculosis.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N. S.\nNow, as for sick pupils, you must be always on the watch for contagious diseases. Every pupil must be vaccinated on entrance to school, unless there is clear evidence that he has been vaccinated within a year or two. Nearly all the Indian children in the Maritime Provinces have been recently vaccinated, and should have their certificates. You might find it wise to tell as many as you can to bring them with them. When any pupil has a fever he ought to be in bed, and you should watch for rashes, spotty sore throats, and other indications of contagious disease. Consult the doctor if you have any doubt about the matter. When any pupil develops tuberculosis he must be put away from the others. The Department will try to provide a place for him in Sanatorium, but in any case he cannot be left in the dormitory.\n\nThe Department has a travelling nurse in Nova Scotia, who will call on you from time to time. Nurse MacDonald is a good person, and will help you. A supply of drugs and dressings is now being ordered for you. I have selected them from an official list which you will receive. You may order more as you require them, but I must ask you to read the instructions on the list carefully, and observe how to go about it. You must also keep in mind that tonics and pills can never take the place of good food.\n\nIf I were asked to put down in a list the most important things which would keep your pupils in health, I should place them as follows:- kindness, good feeding, good ventilation, vigilance against contagious diseases and tuberculosis, and last of all and least, medicines.\n\nYou will have a doctor, who will I am sure, confirm all this and advise you in every way. You will receive circulars of instruction on which I have marked certain paragraphs to which your special attention is directed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. B.\nDIRECTOR OF MEDICAL SERVICES.\nOttawa, September 19th., 1929.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have to request you to furnish on repayment and send by freight prepaid the supplies mentioned in the attached list. The supplies are intended for the use of Indians of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School Agency, and should be addressed to Rev. J.P. MacKey, Principal, Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, N.S.\n\nPayment will be made by this Department on receipt of your account in triplicate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nF.H. Paget\nChief Accountant and Purchasing Agent\n\nThe Officer-in-Charge, Medical Stores, Department of Pensions and National Health, Ottawa.\nSep. 23rd / 29\n\nMemo -\nRe Shubenacadie School -\n\nRev. Walter MacKay asked me to mention that he hoped a good \"institutional scale\" would be provided. He said he would like to have the children weighed regularly, & a record kept. I will get samples of school cards used in Nova Scotia from the Health Centre here. Probably they will be willing to let us have all the cards needed.\n\nWalter MacKay said that Sister Philomena is a graduate nurse. He hopes the school will be ready by the end of October.\n\nP.M.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nSeptember 26th, 1929.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nDr. Scott:\n\nWith the opening of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School it seems advisable to secure the name of a firm in the Maritime Provinces, probably in Halifax, from which surgical instruments and hospital sundries may be purchased. Drugs will of course be ordered from the Department of Health in Ottawa, but that Department does not supply the articles referred to, and it is customary to purchase them from wholesale firms in the province in which they are to be used.\n\nE.L.

You will appreciate that the cost of moving a fair number of pupils to Halifax would be considerable, and that the time consumed might also be a consideration.

F. McInnis of Shubenacadie, as physician on the call system for the pupils of the Shubenacadie Indian School.\n\nKindly take the necessary action to advise the Doctor, the Principal and the Indian Agent.\n\nDr. McInnis' remuneration should not exceed $480.00 per annum and for this fee he would be required to perform all minor surgical operations. He should also examine every child in the school every six months.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nMarch 28th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been decided to appoint you as medical attendant to the pupils of the Chibougamau Indian Residential School. Payment will be made for your services on the basis of the Department's schedule of fees. Under this schedule you will be allowed a fee of $2.00 for each pupil brought to you for examination prior to admission. The fee set down for a visit to the school is $5.00, but as you may be asked to see several pupils at each visit, a charge of $1.00 will be allowed for each additional pupil, with a maximum charge of $6.00. The schedule is thought to be quite clear in regard to operations and other procedures.\n\nAt schools of similar size elsewhere, the department does not expect the cost of medical attendance to exceed about $40.00 per month, including minor operations; and it is hoped that you may be able to keep the cost of your service within approximately this limit, but it is not intended that any child should be deprived of necessary medical attention, and it is hoped that this school, which is the first of its kind in the Maritime provinces, may have a high standard of health.\n\nIt is desired that you will make a semi-annual examination of all pupils during the months of September and March, so that you may be able to detect any tendency toward tuberculosis or other cause of\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.F. Collins, M.D.\nChibougamau, N.B.\nfailure in health. For each such examination the Department is prepared to pay a special fee of $50.00, and for this fee expects a complete examination and adequate report.\n\nYou will probably find a number of pupils who require the correction of minor defects such as removal of tonsils and dental attention. The Department, in such cases, wishes to have a report made by the Doctor and Principal, so that special instructions may be given.\n\nIt has been suggested that a special examination of all pupils for the presence of tuberculosis should be made by the Provincial Clinic. No definite arrangements have been made for this, and you will be informed of any action decided upon.\n\nThe Principal of the school is the guardian of the pupils, and is responsible to the Department for their welfare. You should consult his views in the same way as you do those of parents in your private practice.\n\nI shall be pleased to receive your acceptance of this appointment, and the Department will endeavour to explain any matters which have not been made clear.\n\nYours very truly,\nIndian Residential School.\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nMarch 24th, 1930.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the matter of medical supplies the supply of corks for the bottles must have been overlooked.

(RG 10, Volume 6058, File 265-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nYou will note that four have been recommended for a period of San. treatment and one for observation and study; ages being 14, 13, 12, 10 and 7 years.\n\nAt the Nova Scotia Sanatorium they do not take patients under 12 years of age.\n\nI would suggest that an attempt be made to have the younger patients or for that matter, all of them admitted to the Sanatorium at Lourdes-in-Pictou County, for the summer months. The authorities there might be able to make provision, on the rear balcony, to care for those cases until the autumn at least. If Sanatorium treatment cannot be arranged than the only other alternation, as I see it, is to place the patients on \"the cure\" in a section of the Shubenacadie School Building. I am not sufficiently familiar with the plan of the building to state whether or not this might be properly done.\n\nI would be strongly opposed to having them sent to their homes.\n\nTen cases only were X-Rayed and the result surely justified the undertaking.\n\nI would recommend for your serious consideration and for the consideration of the Department of Indian Affairs that all the pupils be X-Rayed for, as you know, the diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis is a difficult matter and justifies the requisition of every possible aid. It is important that open cases of tuberculosis be eliminated, if at all possible, from the new school. We know the Micmac has been well seeded with the bacilli, hence we should endeavour to prevent the conversion of tuberculous infection to tuberculous disease.\n\nIn conclusion permit me to refer to the splendid sanitary environment in which the pupils have been placed. I found them well nourished, spotlessly clean and generally well cared for. It is my opinion that those in charge of the institution have brought knowledge, adaptability and resourcefulness to the work.\n\nP. S. Campbell\n\nP. S. Campbell, M. D.,\nDivisional Medical Health Officer,\nDept. of the Public Health.\nMay 5th, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Stone,\n\nEnclosed is Dr. Campbell's report on his examination of the children at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. This report was received at the school on May 1st and the Principal phoned the sanatorium at Lourdes with a view to having the younger patients admitted there. He was not able to make immediate arrangements owing to the fact that they cannot accommodate additional inmates but they informed him that they would make an endeavour to do so this week. If not successful in this regard, the Principal intends to keep in touch with Dr. Campbell with a view to having his advice regarding what other institution the children could be placed in.\n\nImmediately upon receipt of the report, arrangements were made to give the treatment recommended by Dr. Campbell for those children who were to remain in the school and they were isolated from the other pupils.\nOttawa, May 13th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has read, with interest, Dr. Campbell's report regarding his examination of the children at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. It is considered most important in the interests of the health of the others that sanatorium treatment be secured immediately for the four pupils whom Dr. Campbell recommends should receive same. The Department understands that you have already been in communication with the sanatorium at Lourdes and, if you have not yet succeeded in having these four children placed in that institution, I believe that it might be possible to have them placed in the Halifax Tuberculosis Hospital. I trust that you will find it possible to place these children either in the institution mentioned or, if space is not available there, get in touch at once with Dr. Campbell and enlist his co-operation in having them placed.\n\nWith reference to the two children who are mentally deficient, the Department has been informed that you are making endeavours to secure accommodation for them in a suitable institution. This action is approved and it is hoped that you will be successful in having them properly cared for.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. J. F.

About three in the afternoon Brigid Moloney was cleaning the dough mixer and Annie Pennall was working in the kitchen. In some, at the present time unexplainable way, the two of them were caught in the dough mixer. The power switch was turned off; one of them must have set the machine going, how it stopped I don't know. When I got there certainly the power was not on. After things cool down we might be able to get the true explanation. Each girl will probably lose two fingers of the right hand. Needless to say these girls are not youngsters, and they have been warned many times about tinkering with the machines. Today we will put padlocks on every hand-switch in the School.\n\nOf course we took them to the Victoria General Hospital as soon as we could, and they were attended to immediately.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 28, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 20th instant, reporting the serious accident to two of the girls, pupils of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, who had their hands caught in the dough mixer. This accident is regretted, but it would appear that it was entirely the girls' own fault. It is noted, with satisfaction, that you have arranged to prevent a similar occurrence in future in the use of machinery operated by electricity at the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

Rankin, agent for Victoria County. We find that this child is subject to fits, a series of four fits between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. on Saturday May 17th, inst., three more early Sunday morning. Had the Doctor over on Saturday night and it is his opinion that nothing really effective can be done.\n\nFrom what I can learn from other members of the family the Doctor who examined these children was told about this matter, and yet he passed her along. I don't think that it is your intention to have children so afflicted in this school. When these fits take place in the dormitory there is no need of telling you the effect on the other children.\n\nThe whole family are by far the worst we have in the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F.

No objection was made when you requested her to take a group of children to the school several months ago, as we thought this was unlikely to occur again.\n\nI am writing Miss Murdoch requesting her to give you a separate expense account for this trip, as it should be charged to your Agency, and not to the General Medical Vote for New Brunswick.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nE.L.

If so it would mean that we could have the tonsils, teeth, and the two hernia, which were included in Dr. Campbell's report, attended to during the summer months, and at the same time save making a break in the school term. I feel certain that we will have at least a few cases of tonsils and from general observation the teeth will require considerable attention.\n\nWe have ninety-five in the school now and when we reach the century mark I think it would be advisable to have Dr. Campbell spend another day here.\n\nAll Sanatoriums seem to be filled to capacity, but we are hoping to find a place for the five soon.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, June 6th, 1930.\n\nSir,-\n\nWith reference to that portion of official letter of March 26th, last, in which you were informed that the Department desired a semi-annual examination of all pupils in the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, I beg to say that I am in receipt of a letter from the Principal, Rev. J. B. MacKey, in which he points out the advisability of having the first of these examinations about the end of the current month in order that any pupils requiring treatment may receive same during the summer holidays. The Department considers that such action is advisable and I would, therefore, appreciate your making the examination mentioned in official letter of March 26th about the end of the present month.\n\nIf you find any pupils requiring operations, you should report their names and the operation necessary for the Department's authority for proceeding further.\n\nAs you were informed in the letter mentioned above, a special fee of $50.00 will be allowed for this examination of the pupils in the Shubenacadie School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

McInnis, requesting him to hold the first general medical examination of the pupils of the Shubenacadie School about the end of the present month. If you consider it necessary, you may arrange to have Dr. Campbell spend another day at the school when the pupilage reaches the hundred mark.\n\nI hope to be able to advise you in the near future of the name of the dentist who should be employed.\n\nI note that you are still endeavouring to have the five children mentioned in a preceding letter placed in a sanatorium.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Stultz who, I understand, is a Halifax dentist who visits Shubenacadie every Friday. You may arrange with Dr. Stultz to either do the work in the school or he may take the children to his temporary office in Shubenacadie, whichever is the more convenient. Please explain to him that the Department does not pay the usual office fees in the case of pupils at Indian residential schools. It is expected that very reasonable charges will be secured, as there will no doubt be considerable work necessary from time to time. The Department suggests that only extractions and amalgam fillings be done by Dr. Stultz. Other treatment cannot be authorized. In the case of temporary teeth, extractions only are allowed. The fees suggested for Dr. Stultz' consideration are $1 for amalgam fillings and 50\u00a2 for extractions.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy Secretary.\n\nRev. J. P.

We had 98 children in the School at the time of the examination, and all were examined. You will note that there are 31 for tonsils and 14 for eyes.\n\nThere has been a hint of suggestion that Dr. MacInnis and another Doctor come to the School and do the tonsils, at the fee allowed by the Dept., viz. $20.00. I certainly do not want that. I think I could arrange to have this work done at the Victoria Gen. Hospital with no charge for operation but three dollars for each day there. Tonsils cases are done there on Tuesdays and Fridays. It means that I could take six children in by car on a Monday and six more on Thursday and bring back the ones taken in on Monday, and so on till the job was complete. That should mean about $12 for each child with no fee for operation. Should you decide to act on Dr. MacInnis' report I wish you would let me know before anything is decided and give me an opportunity to see if the above could be carried out.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6058, File 265-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nJuly 3rd, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has received your letter of June 23rd referring to results of examination of the pupils by Doctor MacInnis. With regard to the tonsil work I have to suggest that the matter receive some further consideration. In the first place transportation of the children to and from Halifax will not be without difficulty, and in the second place, you are taking the patients out of the hands of Doctor MacInnis, our local medical officer. You depend upon him for the care of ordinary cases of sickness and accident, and if he is competent to perform the operations himself it appears to the Department that he should be given an opportunity to do so. The first consideration, of course, is that the work should be done by a thoroughly competent man. The removal of tonsils from a large number of children is a fairly grave responsibility. You, as a resident of the district, may be expected to be familiar with the qualifications of Doctor MacInnis, and the Department will be pleased to receive your opinion on this matter and to keep it confidential. In any case the subject should be candidly discussed between you and the Doctor so that there may be no misunderstanding.\n\nWhile the Department has an arrangement with the Victoria General Hospital to care for cases of sickness at the rate of $3.00 per day, including the fees of the Doctor, it is quite possible that the hospital may not be willing to have a large number of tonsil cases admitted under this arrangement. If you decide to advise the Department to have the patients sent to Halifax, it would be best for you to make a visit to the hospital and see what arrangements can be made in case the hospital authorities\n\nRev. J.D. Mackey,\nPrincipal, Indian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\ndecline to accept these pupils under the inclusive arrangement.\n\nIf you think Doctor MacInnis can fulfill the requirements you might ascertain from him what his total fee would be for carrying out the operations. The Department usually obtains a substantial reduction in the case of a large number of operations, and it is suggested that the fee of $20.00 per pupil should include the fees of the Anaesthetist and of a surgical nurse who should be retained during the progress of the work. Not more than 8 cases should be done on any one day.\n\nThe Department also wishes to be assured that the removal of tonsils from so many pupils is strictly required for the improvement of the health of each child concerned, and in this connection would appreciate an additional examination by Doctor MacInnis and the Doctor whom he calls in to assist him.\n\nWith regard to the optical work, it would be appreciated if you would submit the name of the Oculist or Optician whom you wish to employ.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

The rate for them will be the same as for the other Indian children who in the past have been patients there.\n\nWhat I would like to know is whether I will look after these two girls, as far as clothing etc. is concerned or will I inform agent Chalmers of Bear River, and Agent Lawlor of Shubenacadie, and have them attend to them. There is the possibility that after a few months that their condition may warrant them coming back to the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMr. A.F. MacKenzie\nActing Asst.

It is very satisfactory that you have been able to find accommodation for these children, and it will not be necessary for you to take further trouble with them as they are no longer school pupils.\n\nIt may possibly be advisable to restate the Department's views in regard to these tuberculous children. It is the policy of the Department to keep your school tuberculosis free, and in pursuance of that policy the essential feature is to prevent the entrance to the school of tuberculous children, and to remove from the school as soon as possible any who are found to have developed the disease. The disposition of the sick children is not the first consideration. If no other means can be found to care for them, they must be sent back to their reserves even though this course seems hard on them. In such a case they are no worse off than if they had not come to the school.\n\nThe Department is assured that you understand this point of view which has a bearing on the other tuberculous children whose removal you have not yet reported.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

It is evident that he is not to perform the operation, but only give the anaesthetic. I made inquiries at the V.G. Hospital, Halifax, but they cannot take any cases there till after the middle of September. It might be worthwhile to try the hospital at Truro, only twenty-two miles from here. They are not crowded there and the suggestion itself came from Dr. MacInnis.\n\nPlease let know as soon as you can.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie, Esq.\nActing Asst., Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nJuly 25th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of July 21st referring to the operations for removal of tonsils of pupils at your school, I have to advise you that the Department has decided to provide a sum of $300.00 for the payment of the surgeon who will be called in to do the work. Doctor MacInnis may charge a fee of $5.00 for each anaesthetic given, and in addition, the Department will pay for the services of a surgical nurse for a period not exceeding 6 days. It will be possible for you and Doctor MacInnis to co-operate in finding a surgeon at Halifax or Truro who can come to the school for this work. It is recommended that the pupils be divided into three groups of 10, and that the operations on each group be separated for a sufficient time to allow the preceding group to recover beyond the point of danger, which will probably require about two days.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.W.

This will be apparent on reference to Department's letter of July 25th, which provides for the service of a surgical nurse for a period not exceeding six days. Before payment of the account can be considered it will be necessary for you to furnish the Department with the names of all the personnel engaged in the work and a statement of the part each person took in it. It will also be necessary to secure receipts for payments to be made to anyone except Dr. MacInnis. It might be an advantage if you would mention any difficulties you had in arranging this work, and the reasons which have lead to an increase in cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F.

I have at least once in the past refused to sign the vouchers of Dr. McInnis.\n\nAs for the tonsils I talked the matter over with the Doctor and in fact he read the letters of July 3rd and 25th. During the time of the operations figured it out that should he take the fee of $20.00 for each case, he would make more money than he would by that provided in your letter of July 25th. I felt then that there would be trouble but it was too late then to halt matters.\n\nFor my own part, two of the Sisters including the nurse were called to Halifax for their annual retreat of ten days. I saw immediately that with over ninety children in the house, we could not give the necessary attention. Besides that I was nervous about leaving the children with anyone who was not a nurse, especially immediately after they left the operating room. Therefore I engaged two nurses. Dr. J.B. Reid brought a nurse with him for the to assist in the operating room. My sister arrived the same day, and since she is a graduate nurse I put her to work also. So in all we had two Doctors and four nurses, one in with the doctors, two to attend the children immediately before and after\nthe operation. The two nurses I engaged were on duty day and night. My sister relieving for them. These nurses were kept busy from Tuesday morning till the following Sunday when they returned to Halifax. I paid them $25.00 each from the School funds and charged it up to extra labor. The nurse Dr. Reid brought with him was on duty only during the actual time of operating, three days.\n\nNow the way the Doctor worked it out was this: 31 cases at $20.00 gives $620.00 For Dr. Reid $300.00 Nurses at $5.00 a day $65.00 Himself $155.00 Balance $100.00 to be divided between himself and Dr. Reid.\n\nWhen I heard that I made up my mind that I would take the money coming to the two nurses I had engaged and return the fifty dollars to the School fund. Otherwise I felt that there would be so much more to divide and I think I know where the larger share would go. I must say that Dr. Reid seemed quite satisfied to accept what the Dept. had stipulated.\n\nMy suggestion is that is that you pay Dr. McInnis five dollars a case $185.00 Dr. Reid $300.00 The operating room nurse I think should receive $6.00 a day or $18.00 for her share of the work.

S. Campbell of the Dept. of Public Health in the province concluded his examination of all the children in the School yesterday. One Ellen Francis is active T.B. and we will send her home within a few days. This child was examined by this same Doctor two years ago, and he recommended treatment at the san then. Nothing was done and yet the Doctor who examined her before coming here passed her on. There are eleven for X-ray, nine girls and two boys.\n\nThe ones who were doubtful in the examination of last April have showed marked improvement and the Doctor assures me that there is no danger in keeping them here as they are not spreaders.\n\nDr. McInnis completed his vaccinations during this month, so that every child here is vaccinated. Dr. Cunningham will be along today for the eyes.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nOctober 1st, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nThe Department has given detailed consideration to the account of Dr. McInnis for removal of tonsils from thirty-one of your pupils and has decided to proceed in accordance with the instructions issued to you on July 25th.

Inquiry made tells us that an older sister died from the same trouble a year or so ago. On account of the location of the trouble and the serious danger to the other children I feel that she should be removed from the school immediately.\n\nAm enclosing the report from the Dept. of Public Health.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nAugust 26, 1930.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDR. SCOTT,\n\nI should be grateful if you would let me have the name of a dentist who could give the necessary services for the pupils at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, October 9, 1930.\n\nMr. Ferris,\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of August 26, last, should the services of a dentist be required for the pupils of the Shubenacadie Indian residential school, Dr. Karl K. Dimock, of Windsor, may be employed.\n\nActing D. S. C. I. A.\nOttawa, October 10, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to earlier correspondence concerning a dentist for the pupils of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, I have now to authorize you to offer the work to Dr. Karl K. Dimock, of Windsor. Please inform him that there should be two visits to the school per annum and that the teeth of all children should be examined. No fee will be allowed for the examination, but he will be allowed $1.00 per amalgam filling and 25\u00a2 per extraction. No prophylactic or other treatment is authorized, and, in the case of temporary teeth extraction only is desired.\n\nIf Dr. Dimock accepts this proposition, have him come to the school for his first work at his earliest convenience. The Department expects you to provide him with board and room while he is engaged with the pupils.\n\nIf this arrangement is confirmed, other dental services should not be engaged, except, of course, in real emergencies. You could not expect Dr. Dimock to come to the school for a small amount of work; and if you find it convenient to take a pupil or two to his office, the Department will allow $1.50 per filling and 50\u00a2 per extraction. These fees, however, are only in the case of one or two pupils. All necessary work should be done when he is making his semi-annual visit to the school.\n\nI am enclosing an extra copy of this communication, in the event that you wish to leave it with Dr. Dimock for his guidance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

You must be taking me for a fool.\n\nAny Medical Man who has a good General Practice will certainly lose all interest in Government and Indian Work when he is paid such prices. Those are the prices paid any ordinary labourer. Place them before any Medical Man.\n\nOct 6th 1930\nin any part of Canada and get their opinion on it.\n\nAfter finishing with the tonsil cases I paid the surgeon (Mr. Murray Gordon) who assisted us in the operating room $15.00 out of my own pocket and got a receipt for it.\n\nI had to take down my operating table and set it up at the school and then go after it and take it down and bring it home again. I had to make a visit to the school each day we operated which I didn't include in the bill and would amount to $4.00. Also in regard to vaccinations, if I am not paid for a call to the school the Principal in the future must bear them.\nDr. D. F. MacInnis\n\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nConveyed to my office.\n\nIn the future any operative throat cases or any cases where I require an assistant must go to the Hospital as I am not going to give anaesthetics for $5.00, or do operation work at your prices.\n\nPlease add the $5.00 paid Mrs. Gordon to my account, along with the $2.00 for visits.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD.F.M.

The Department has an arrangement with the Victoria General Hospital whereby all services rendered by the hospital, including those of the attending doctor, are included in the rate of $3.00 per day. It is requested that you will return the account to the hospital and draw the attention of the Superintendent to this fact. You may forward his remarks to the Department, and thereafter correspondence will be carried on direct with the hospital.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nRev. J.P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\nOctober 14th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nYou will find enclosed copy of a letter dated October 1st written to Dr. McInnis in reference to his account for the month of August which includes the charges for the tonsil operations done for the school during that month. In reply to this letter Dr. McInnis among other things states that the Department has been very unfair in offering him the fee paid for giving the anaesthetics. He further states that unless he is paid a fee for visiting the school to vaccinate the pupils, in addition to that for the vaccination, it will be necessary for you to parade the pupils to his office. There should not be any hardship either for you or the children in this connection, and there does not seem to be any reason why he should have to come to the school for this purpose. He says that he paid Mrs. Yeadon, a nurse, $15.00 for her services. If you will take a receipt from Dr. McInnis for this payment the Department will send him a cheque in your care. Kindly send this receipt to the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nRev. J.P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nLD\nOctober 14th, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of October 6th referring to payments made to you for professional services rendered to the pupils of the Shubenacadie Residential School in the month of August, I have to advise you that the Department has no intention of re-considering its decision.\n\nWith regard to the fees for anaesthetics given by you, you were paid precisely what the Department offered and what you presumably undertook the work for. The fee of $5.00 for an anaesthetic for tonsil operation is that paid by the Department everywhere in Canada and accepted without complaint. It might well appear that a Doctor is not ill paid in earning $155.00 for three days work, which can by no means be considered of a special nature and which was carried out within a very short distance of his office.\n\nWith regard to the fee for vaccination it is noted that you were paid for a visit to the school on August 12th and for vaccination of twenty-one pupils on the same day. There is no reason why you should have to visit the school for vaccinating pupils and the Principal is being advised of this fact.\n\nWith regard to the payment made to Mrs. Yeadon, I may say that the Department neither instructed nor authorized you to engage any nurse. If you will hand the receipt to the Principal you will be re-imbursted.\n\nI may say further that the Department regards this matter as closed. You will find enclosed a cheque for $215.00, in payment of your accounts for the months of August and September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.F. McInnis, Esq., M.D.,\nShubenacadie, N.S.\n\nA.F.

Child we have in the School, and find that the conditions are very bad. In fact while this child was home during the summer Miss Nurse MacDonald had seen her and the child wanted to come back to the School before her vacation time was up. This being the case I judged from your letter that you would be willing to have her go to the Sanatorium. Ada MacDonald at present at the San. is about ready to come back and therefore I made the arrangements to take Ellen Francis down and bring Ada MacDonald back, making the one trip do.

Therefore, I am drawing your attention to this matter and hope you will make arrangements to allow me One Dollar Fifty Cents ($1.50) per white enamel filling.\n\nIn regard to extractions\nthe Department could not expect a dentist to extract teeth for twenty-five Cents (25\u00a2) and use the humane methods in vogue today. This should be at least Fifty Cents (50\u00a2) per extraction.\n\nIt was my privilege to do considerable work among soldiers and returned men for the government, and I would say that the fees were substantially above those quoted in this letter.

The marked change from generally poor home living conditions, nearly ideal environment of the school, is apparently having effect. It will be interesting to watch this over a period of time and to note the ultimate result.\n\nIn the light of evidence obtainable it would appear that average case of closed tuberculosis will do just as well at the school as at any tuberculosis institution. Of course I do not keep open cases there; all such should be removed to institutions or at least isolated.\n\nI wish again to comment favourably on the efficient manner in which the pupils are being cared for at the school.\n\nP.S.

You will see from Dr. McInnis reports that this girl was examined twice. From observation and appearance it looked very much as if this child were pregnant. Under the circumstances the only thing to do was to have a thorough examination. I took her into Halifax with the Gonorrhea case, intending to bring her back the following day. However I was laid up in the Hospital for three days myself and I brought her back when I came. The report on her case is negative. While I cannot contradict that report, well time will tell.\n\nI had written the Agent, Rev. Father Rankin, and informed them at the Hospital where to send the accounts but they sent them to Agent Lawlor and he passed them over to me.\n\nAlso enclosed you will find the report of Dr. Campbell for the T.B. examination.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nHALIFAX INFIRMARY X-RAY DEPARTMENT\nDrs.

The Department will allow $1.50 for white enamel fillings in the case of anterior teeth and 50\u00a2 for extractions of permanent teeth. The rate for ordinary amalgam fillings will be $1.00 and extractions in the case of temporary teeth, 25\u00a2. These are the fees that are allowed at other Indian residential schools in Canada. It is true that they are substantially less than those for soldiers and returned men; but the Department feels that wholesale rates should be allowed for school children in residence.\n\nIf you accept this proposal, please inform Father Mackey, and you may make your first visit to the school at your earliest convenience. Father Mackey is receiving a copy of this letter to you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nDr. Karl K. Dimock,\nDentist,\nWindsor,\nN.

(RG 10, Volume 6058, file 265-13, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 8, 1930.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of the account which you forwarded from Dr. A. R. Cunningham, Halifax, covering his charges for the examining and testing of eyes and supplying of glasses for 17 pupils of the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. This account is returned herewith, as it is considered the fees charged for examining and testing of eyes are rather high. I may say that the fees paid by the Department in other cases have been approximately $5 for examination and prescription, and from $5 to $8 for each pair of glasses, depending upon the power of the lenses supplied.\n\nIt is thought that the account of Dr. Cunningham should be amended accordingly, and a detailed statement furnished giving the names of the pupils who were supplied with glasses and the fee for the examination and cost of glasses for each pupil.

All that Dr. MacInnis had to do with this case was to sign a couple of papers in order to clear the way for the Sanatorium. He brought the papers over to me and no doubt that is the visit.\n\nAs we had a few with sore throats I thought it would be alright to have the semi-annual examination. The first exam only covered about ninety children. The result of the examination is that there are twenty-two to have their tonsils out. A few of these are urgent.\n\nWould it be advisable to take these MacDonald children to the V.G. Hospital and have them examined to see whether there are any of this syphilis left. It strikes me that their treatment is continuing a very long time?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nNovember 22nd, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant together with account of Dr. D.F. MacInnis.\n\nI note what you say regarding the tonsil operations required, but the Department is not prepared to authorize any save the most urgent of these. Please inform me as to the number of such cases.\n\nRegarding the duration of treatment required by the MacDonald children, you should rely on the judgment of Doctor MacInnes, who will doubtless take samples of their blood from time to time to be tested. No idea can be given of the probable duration of this treatment, but it is necessary that it should be carried to a proper conclusion.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.B.

The report from the School stated that she had gonorrhoea, but the hospital account gives a diagnosis of syphilis. It would be appreciated if the doctor in charge of her case would give this Department a professional report on her present condition, and indicate whether she might safely be returned to school for completion of treatment.\n\nIf she has both diseases she should not be discharged from the Hospital until the gonorrhoea is cured and, in any case, she should not be discharged in an infectious condition. Facilities are available at the School for the treatment of syphilis, if the patient is not a menace to the other pupils.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F.

Hospital I find that they cannot take any more tonsil cases till the first of February.

From the extent of the work you will know the condition of their teeth. It is worth while noting that those children who came from other institutions did not require near the attention as those coming from the Reserves. Some how we missed one boy and there was one girl who had a cured T.B. jaw and the Dentist was afraid to extract on account of the weakened appearance of the jaw bone. Two you will note had an anaesthetic, both were highly nervous disposition and the girl had twelve extracted. We did the only thing we thought possible and had Dr. McInnis over and had the work done.\n\n107 permanent extractions\n768 temporary\n94 fillings\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

These five are the more urgent ones. All five have been laid up for a few days at different times with sore throats.\n\nThe average cost for the others came to about seventeen dollars. If I can arrange to have them done at that rate may I do so. I might say that Dr. McInnis is not opposed to having them go to an hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Murphy,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. Quinn concerning Dr. Cunningham's account, I may say that the Doctor was engaged to test the eyes and supply glasses for seventeen pupils at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. It was requested that inexpensive mountings and lenses should be supplied.\n\nDr. Cunningham rendered an account for $265.00 which seemed high to our officers, and it was returned to the Principal with the request for a much lower rate. The word \"Exorbitant\" was not used in the correspondence.\n\nThe Department is accustomed to secure special prices for these services when a number of pupils are treated. I presume that the work was done in a single day and that the Doctor drove a total of ninety miles. Therefore, I consider $10.00 per pupil, or $170.00, plus $10.00 for expenses will be a fair fee.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Authority was given to have the work done at Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, but the Principal informs the Department that that hospital cannot receive them until after March 1st next. He asks permission to have the work done at another hospital, name not stated, for a sum not exceeding $15.00 each. The hospital he refers to is probably Truro, but objection was taken to the employment of Doctor Reid of that place on a former occasion. The Principal wants to get the work done during the Christmas holidays, but we do not know who is to be employed. Shall we take him at his word and leave the matter open for him to get the work done at the sum stated, which is very reasonable?\n\nE.L.

Now chickenpox is a relatively harmless disease, but one of the worst epidemics of smallpox in recent years gained headway because it was diagnosed as chickenpox, and the people in charge did not support themselves by getting the opinion of another Doctor. Since that time I have been nervous about chickenpox. This is one of the reasons why the Department instructs those in charge of Indians to report epidemics of any kind by telegram within twelve hours. I do not suppose you could have an epidemic of smallpox, as your children are thoroughly vaccinated, but I want to take this opportunity of drawing to your attention the importance of reporting any kind of communicable disease. Circular 93-1 is worthy of careful study by everyone.\n\nI think you are to be congratulated on the good health at your school. It often happens that a new school has a run of bad health for the first year or two but you seem to have escaped. Let us hope that you will continue to be fortunate.\n\nYours truly,\n\nE.L.

To read he must hold the book within three inches of his eyes, and it is impossible for him to copy any work from the black-board. He is industrious enough and wants to get along. He was not here at the time Dr. Cunningham did the eye work. I honestly believe that it would be worth while to do something for this boy.\n\nAfter the experience with Dr. Cunningham I do not feel like making any recommendations. Will you please let me know what you think about it.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, March 16, 1931.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, relative to the case of pupil No. 71, Fred Nash, who requires to have his eyes examined and glasses supplied.\n\nIn reply I have to say that, on the occasion of a member of the staff of the school travelling to Halifax, this boy could be taken to Dr. Cunningham to have his eyes examined and the glasses required supplied him. It is considered that spectacles with flat lenses and an inexpensive frame would be satisfactory. An account covering the fees charged for the examination and for the glasses should be forwarded, in duplicate, properly certified by yourself, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The Halifax Tuberculosis Hospital is filled to capacity, so I have asked Dr. Miller of the Nova Scotia Sanatorium to forward admission papers to Dr. McInnis. A Sanatorium bed should be available in about a week or ten days.\n\nJohn Beishard should also have a term in the Sanatorium.\n\nThe examination cards will be forwarded to you in a few days.\n\nI am sending a copy of report to Dr. McInnis.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nP.

A year ago there was no sign of T.B. Dr. Campbell called the Sanatorium but they could not take her immediately, but gave us some hope that they might take her in ten days or two weeks time. Her father is dead and her mother is working in Halifax and living with a married daughter. Under those circumstances I hope it will be alright to send her to the Sanatorium, and will do so unless I hear the contrary from you.\n\nThe other case of John Bernard in the opinion of Dr. Kelmis will after a time come along alright. After Dr. Campbell's examination of him there were other things came to light which seemed to indicate that his condition was not so bad.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

S. G. I. A.\nMarch 7, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ilsley:\n\nIt is now necessary to appoint a medical officer for the Indian Residential School at Shubenacadie. The Department employs, for the Indian Reserve, Dr. D. F. MacInnis, of Shubenacadie, and it is possible that he would be satisfactory for the School also.\n\nA doctor who is resident within a few miles of the School is required. If a Roman Catholic is available he should be favourably considered, because of the management of the School. The doctor would be on the call system, and, once every six months, he should examine every child in the school. Salary at the rate of $480 per annum would be allowed for his services. This fee would include all minor surgical operations.\n\nIf Father Mackey, the Principal, has any preference, I have not heard of it. You might let me have your recommendation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nJ. L. Ilsley, Esq., M. P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa.\nDr. D. C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI recommend the appointment of Dr. D. F. McInnis as doctor of the Indian Training Institute. He is the only doctor in Shubenacadie and the doctor should not be too far away when anyone falls ill. He is not a Catholic, but there is no Catholic doctor in Hants County, nor so far as I know within a great many miles in Nova Scotia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. L. Asley.\nOttawa, March 21st, 1930.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. Stone,\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nI beg to advise you that it has been decided to engage Dr. D. F. McInnis of Shubenacadie, as physician on the call system for the pupils of the Shubenacadie Indian School.\n\nKindly take the necessary action to advise the Doctor, the principal and the Indian Agent.\n\nDr. McInnis' remuneration should not exceed $480.00 per annum and for this fee he would be required to perform all minor surgical operations. He should also examine every child in the school every six months.\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.S.I.A.\nMarch 21st, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Ilaley,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant and as requested I am giving instructions to have Dr. D.

A.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMinister's Office\n\nNovember 29, 1930.\n\nMr. Williams,\n\nHerewith a telegram from A. de Witt Foster.\n\nWill you please report re the medical service mentioned at the Indian College Shubenacadie; also report re the appointment of Dr. Reid, of Truro, and Dr. McInnes, of Shubenacadie.\n\nF. Clapp,\nfor Private Secretary.\nDecember 1st, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMR. WILLIAMS:\n\nWith reference to the attached telegram, I have to report as follows:\n\nMr. Foster must be misinformed as to surgical work done at the Indian Residential School, Shubenacadie, during the week ending November 22nd. A special report has been secured by telegram from the Reverend Principal, and the only work done during that week was dental service carried out by a Doctor Dimmock, of Windsor.\n\nIn the month of September, Doctor McInnes, the authorized Medical Attendant at the School, held a clinic at which the tonsils of 31 pupils were removed. This was done under instructions issued to the Principal in July. The work was delayed until the pupils re-assembled after the summer vacation. Doctor McInnes required the assistance of a surgeon, and called in Doctor Reid, of Truro. The Department gave him no instructions as to who should be engaged. Doctor Reid is not a regular employee.\n\nDoctor McInnes is employed on the Account System to attend the pupils of the School, and on salary as follows:\n\nFor Elmsdale, Wellington vicinity (Halifax and Hants Counties) $200.00 per annum\nShubenacadie & vicinity (Hants County) $250.00 per annum with allowance of $100.00 for drugs. This appointment was made by the Civil Service Commission in 1919. The other appointments were not made by the Commission.\n\nThe Department is informed that Doctor McInnes is the only Doctor at Shubenacadie, or near enough to give satisfactory attendance to the School. His professional capacity has never been questioned, but he is a difficult man to get along with from a business standpoint, and his position as the only available medical man seems to make him very independent. At different times he has stated that he would not continue to attend the Indians at Elmsdale and Wellington unless he were paid more salary. Any increase over the $200 now paid for this work would bring the position under the Civil Service Commission. There are Doctors at Bedford, at about the same distance from Elmsdale and Wellington as Doctor McInnes is. One of them is an elderly man, but the Department understands that the other, Doctor Granville, might be willing to take over this work at the salary now paid Doctor McInnes.\n\nThe work done at the School in September cost as follows:\n\nDoctor McInnes - for anaesthetics $155.00\nDoctor Reid - for surgical work $300.00\n\n$455.00\n\nIt is stated that there is more work of the same kind to be done, but funds are not available to carry it out. I am not aware whether Doctor Reid would be acceptable now. If not, I might ask you whom the Principal should be instructed to engage in future.\n\nE.L. Stone, M.B.\nDirector of Medical Services\nDecember 2, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,-\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nWith reference to telegram from Mr. A. de Witt Foster, which I herewith return, I beg to inclose a memorandum from the Director of Medical Services regarding medical and surgical work at the Shubenacadie Indian residential school.\n\nIncls.\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\nMinister's Office\n\nDecember 13, 1930.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nWith the return of the attached letter addressed to the Minister by Mr. Felix P. Quinn, M.P., of Halifax, N.S., will you kindly let the Minister have a memorandum dealing with the claim of Dr. A. R. Cunningham, of Halifax, for services rendered to some pupils of the Indian School at Shubenacadie.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, Dec. 17, 1920.\n\nMr. Dr. [signature]\n\nPlease report on attached letter and return it to the office of the Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nDo not file.\n\nThis is a matter for Mr. [signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Murphy,\n\nWith reference to the attached letter from Mr. Quinn concerning Dr. Cunningham's account, I may say that the Doctor was engaged to test the eyes and supply glasses for seventeen pupils at the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School. It was requested that inexpensive mountings and lenses should be supplied.\n\nDr. Cunningham rendered an account for $263.00 which seemed high to our officers, and it was returned to the Principal with the request for a much lower rate. The word \"Exorbitant\" was not used in the correspondence.\n\nThe Department is accustomed to secure special prices for these services when a number of pupils are treated. I presume that the work was done in a single day and that the Doctor drove a total of ninety miles. Therefore, I consider $10.00 per pupil, or $170.00, plus $10.00 for expenses will be a fair fee.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Authority was given to have the work done at the Victoria General Hospital, Halifax, but the Principal informs the Department that that hospital cannot receive them until after March 1st, next, and he is most anxious to have the work done during the Christmas holidays. He asks permission to have the work done at another hospital, name not stated, for a sum not exceeding $15.00 each; the hospital he refers to is probably Truro, but objection was taken to the employment of Doctor Reid of that place on a former occasion. Kindly let me know whether it would be in order to authorize the Principal to have the work done at the sum stated; if not, kindly advise me who may be employed.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. J. P. Mackey,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nShubenacadie, N.

Dr. Cunningham came up and first saw Dr. McInnis then came over to the School and chose a room which he thought would be suitable for eye testing.

He came direct to the School with his equipment and began work about ten, was here for dinner and worked in the afternoon till about five o'clock.\n\nOctober 9th.

BUSKARD,\n\nI wish to refer to my memorandum of the 19th ultimo, concerning the account of Dr. Cunningham, of Halifax. You will remember that Mr. F. J.

S.\n\nI am now enclosing the most recent correspondence in this connection. You will note that the account is not reduced and that he was actually engaged in testing eyes from 10 A.M. to 5 P.M. on September 25th and during the afternoon of October 9th. The earlier trip of September 17th was merely to look over the ground.\n\nThe Department has no interests in this matter except those of economy and of fair dealing. I think that $180 would be a proper fee, but I should like to have the Minister's direction before making any payment.\n\nDuncan C.

A carton and the proper number of small boxes should be given each school at the commencement of the next term. Each child should have a small supply of chalk in a box with his or her name on the outside. A large supply is not necessary.\n\nI shall be glad of your interest and cooperation in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary\n\nW.A.

Should these children not have a rest period in the afternoons and not be subjected to strenuous labor? Esther Phillips has returned from the school. Her family (at Woodstock) are always in great trouble you will remember, so allowances should be made. Her mother complained that Esther had to work hard all the time, did not have any rest period during the day but at play time had to go out and romp instead of resting and that she was punished by having to stand at night for several hours - of course this may all be greatly exaggerated.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd) Mary L.
