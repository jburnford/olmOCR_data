The facts are that before the actual breaking out of the rebellion, Jackson's name had become notorious throughout the country, and his conduct was such as to cause the utmost alarm to the authorities. He had been arrested and imprisoned, but the charges against him were never brought to trial. He died in prison, and his body was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe Whig government has been overthrown, and the Conservative party has come into power. The new government promises to carry out the reforms promised by the Whigs, and to make the country prosperous once more.\n\nRESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT FOR THE TERRITORIES.\n\nThey are having lively times in the North-West Council. The elected and responsible members find themselves hampered by the appointed and irresponsible members who have seats at the table, or perhaps even more so, by the very limited powers of the Council. It must be gratifying to the constituents to find their representatives alive to the interests of the country. The chief object of the members is to bring about a reform of the administration of the territories.\n\nThe Speaker's charge made over into Bulawayo, and then marched back again at the point of the Belgian bayonets, and now Prince Alexander is demanding an indemnity of \u00a35,000,000 from the Servians, who have been engaged in some fighting that has begun there.\n\nHorse and cattle stealing has been carried on extensively in the mining district of the C. P. R., and measures should be taken to bring all thieves to justice, and to prevent similar outrages in future.\n\nThe Indians who came to examine the attraction at Frog Lake and the proposed railway, spring have had their attention called to the fact that the land they occupy is being sold off by the Government, and that they must move away.\n\nWinter has set in earlier than usual, and the snow is deepening. Manitoba, however, according to Mr. Conant, is a place where the snowshoes have to be used to make their way through the woods, due to the fact that the snow is deep enough to cover the ground.\n\nIn Manitoba, the people are now awakened with taxation on account of the complexity of their provincial system, and even in Ontario there is a proposition now being discussed for a simplification of the local laws.\n\nThe former province, as constituted, was appointed some time ago to undertake the working of the municipal law, and suggested radical reforms. The proposal was met with enthusiasm, and the idea of a new form of provincial government in the East, if it were well if the people of the territories were too busy to be bothered with the burdens of a great amount of work, and also that it would be possible, consistent with its practical working.\n\nSome of the Quebec papers are making a horrible noise about the recent discovery of a new species of fish in the St. Lawrence River. They pretend that Jackson was as guilty as Red and his brother-in-law, and that he has been convicted of murder. The evidence of guilt is shown by the Government toward an English-speaking rebel. The facts are that before the actual breaking out of the rebellion, Jackson's name had become notorious throughout the country, and his conduct was such as to cause the utmost alarm to the authorities. He had been arrested and imprisoned, but the charges against him were never brought to trial. He died in prison, and his body was buried in the churchyard of St. Paul's Cathedral.\n\nThe Whig government has been overthrown, and the Conservative party has come into power.

Y. B. boys.\n\n\u2014Rev. T. Lawson of this place, officiated in the Regina Methodist church on Sunday.\n\n\u2014Mr. J. Taylor, and Mrs. Wright left here yesterday morning on a visit to Ontario.\n\n\u2014On Monday last a horse was sold by Mr. Macdonald of the McLean farm.\n\n\u2014A bell weighing 300 lbs arrived yesterday at Regina (August Church). It will be put up immediately.\n\n\u2014The weather has been continued mild up to the present, but indications are that wind will set in within a few days.\n\n\u2014Mr. McBeauchamp & Beanchamp, merchants, have dissolved partnership, the business being continued by Mr. Beanchamp. Mr. Goldsman has gone east.\n\n\u2014All arrangements have been completed for holding the anniversary and Christmas tree entertainments connected with the Methodists Sunday School.\n\n\u2014We had a call this week from Messrs. S. Cuthbert, J. P., and H. N. Murphy, Esq., of Fort Qu'Appelle. They both subscribed for the Progress of the Church.\n\n\u2014Mrs. J. Moloney, Mrs. G. B. Cromer, and Misses M. and D. Murray, of Mr. L. Murray's, came down on a visit to the Old Country. They took their tickets direct for Glasgow.\n\n\u2014A young man named Ernest Robinson was committed by S. Davidson Keg, on Saturday last to stand his trial at Regina for stealing a number of goods belonging from Paul Christian, of this place.\n\n\u2014There was a full congregation at the Methodist missionary service on Saturday evening, and the prayers meeting on Tuesday evening passed off successfully, being addressed by Rev. Messrs. Darwin, of Fort Qu'Appelle; C. W. Miller, of Medicine Hat; and T. Lawson, of this place.\n\n\u2014Some parties east to whom have been sent copies of the Progress, and who are looking out for openings in the Northwest, not seeing the advancement of either a druggist or a tailor, would do well to write here to enquire what are the prospects for engaging in business in those lines. We are in doubt as to what really is wanted.\n\n\u2014The Curling Club met on Wednesday evening and appointed the following committee: President, S. H. Cassell; Vice-President, S. S. Nelson; Secretary-Treasurer, S. D. Davis; W. R. McBeauchamp, Standing Committee.\n\n\u2014It was resolved that no money be paid by the club except on the approval of the Standing Committee and order of the President.\n\n\u2014If the publishers of our paper confer a favor upon us, we may never accidentally printed a few odd papers with some of the pages upside down. They are very beautiful in all respects, from the excellent and handsome but confirmed bachelor who presides in the editorial chair during the absence of the editor. Have the Herald's distress of mind, we will assure it that the general public will be glad to see any kind of papers to which it relates.\n\n\u2014The English Church College and Farm is now in shape. There are about thirty students, both hands and students, who with the staff form quite a colony. Several young men in the Old Country are considering coming out here.\n\n\u2014It was intended to commence a Boy's School this fall, but the present state of affairs prevents it. We have intended to build early in the spring, so that the School may be got off to a good start.\n\n\u2014We understand that arrangements are being made for heating the Queen's Hotel with hot air.\n\n\u2014All Masons in town and vicinity are invited to attend the Queen's Hotel on Tuesday evening next, at eight o'clock, to organize.\n\n\u2014On Sunday last Rev. Mr. Tudor, of Medicine Hat, preached in the First Presbyterian Church, both morning and evening services.\n\n\u2014On account of a heavy amount of snow this week, being taken up with Northwest Council proceedings, a quantity of matter is left over till next week.\n\n\u2014A few days ago Mr. E. L. Odeh sold section 23, the township to Mr. Young, a well-to-do farmer from England, who has just returned from spring with his family to settle here. He will bring with him a number of friends who intend to locate in this vicinity.\n\n\u2014A Lecture on \"Burns and Moore\" will be delivered in the Methodist Church, Qu'Appelle, on Friday evening next, by Rev. Mr. David F. Davis, Ex. Reg. of the Empire.\n\n\u2014As it is a well-known fact that Mr. Davis is the only minister in the province of Dominion Canada, and as this subject is one of the most interesting and important of his many lectures, we urge attendance upon those interested.\n\n\u2014The Globe in 1881, criticizes his lecture's title, saying:\n\n\u2014How is it that the Editor of the Globe prefers to proclaim to the world that Bob Burns is killing the Church of England in the Territories? Now, I believe that every Churchman, must have a very poor opinion of the merits of the Church of England in the Territories, or anywhere else by other Bishop Amsden or any other Bishop. As a Churchman I cannot believe that the Church of England is destined to make any rapid progress in the future for many years to come. The son of the church is going to be killed in the Territories, because of the bad management of the clergy, but he does not say so, going in Troy and here (Moosomin), he says that there is nothing but little panjandrum and even in a barn setting up their little portable churches. From time of the erection of his letters, he says that he has heard some \"big\" grievances, and it is a consolation to find that he has heard them. Now as to the so-called Ritualistic practices of the clergy of the Church of England, I must confess that I fail to understand the objections of any Christians to them. I am only interested in the object of the church as the object of Church going. With this party I hate the object of church going, and I feel proud to be connected with, the object of church going is, when we go to church, we go there to serve our church, we shall offer Him the best that is in our cupboards, and if we have nothing, it surely is not for us to make use of all that can furnish us with food, to give it to others in our own homes. Surely no Christian would ever think of occupying a house where he could not make others offer up their thanksgivings, sing his praises and make their prayers. If the object of the church is to bring the object of Ritualism before us, then I am a ritualist, viz. brought before the Lord of God, the King of kings and Lord of Lords, to make the services and prayers of the church as near as possible of the Lamb of God, seated in Glory upon His Throne in Heaven, surrounded by the Archangels and all the company of Heaven who continually worship and praise Him. I would like to go into the question of putting the Cross in the church, but I have no room to argue the point, we have room enough to argue the point, an old rug has upon a nail, bull as I will only say, however, that the Cross is an object worthy of a compassionate soul in a building in which we come together to worship God.\n\n\u2014Arrangements are being made for the erection of Anglican churches here and at Kabapin.\n\n\u2014There is a strong tendency to elect one to take up the discussion among the electors.\n\n\u2014The municipal council met here on Tuesday. We will endeavor to obtain minutes for the next issue of the Progress.\n\nCorrespondence.\n\n(Our columns are open to all provided the subject matter is of a general interest, and the writer will be held responsible for his words.) Correspondence for the Qu'Appelle Leader will be addressed to the Editor.\n\nSir,\n\nI desire to ask a small space in your columns in which to call attention to a letter appearing in the Regina Leader of last inst. Signed \"A. M.\"\n\nIn his letter he refers to Troy, I think I may well use our local paper for the purpose of answering the question of the subject of his letter. He writes:\n\n\u2014How is it that the Editor of the Regina Leader does not proclaim to the world that Bob Burns is killing the Church of England in the Territories? Now, I believe that every Churchman, must have a very poor opinion of the merits of the Church of England in the Territories, or anywhere else by other Bishop Amsden or any other Bishop.

We will endeavor to obtain minutes for the next issue of the Progress.\n\nTHE MARKETS.\n\nWheat\n\n(Reported by D. H. McMillan & Co.)\n\nNo. 1 hard... $6.50\nNo. 2 hard... $6.47\nNo. 3 hard... $6.47\nNo. 4 hard... $6.47\n\nThere is a strong tendency in the East in the price of wheat. A deficiency will only be made up in the present crop, and it is thought that No. 3 and 4 hard are wanted for manufacturing at the mill.\n\nWe are authorized to say that any quantity of good wheat will find a market here.\n\nFOUND\n\nOn 21st November, near McGee Station, two good yellow cows.
