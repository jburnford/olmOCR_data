Report on the Invertebrata of the Laramie and Cretaceous rocks of the vicinity of the Bow and Belly Rivers and adjacent localities in the North-West Territory.\n\nThe present paper is intended primarily as a palaeontological supplement or appendix to Dr. G. M. Dawson's \"Report on the Region in the Vicinity of the Bow and Belly Rivers,\" published in 1885 in the \"Report of Progress\" of the Survey for 1882-83-84. It is mainly based upon collections made by Dr. Dawson and Messrs. R. G. McConnell, J. B. Tyrrell and T. C. Weston in the years 1881-84, but in order to make it as complete a presentation as possible of the present state of our knowledge of the invertebrate fauna of the Laramie and Cretaceous rocks of the Canadian North-West, it contains also a revision of the species from these formations obtained by Dr. Dawson in 1874 in his capacity of Geologist to H. M. North American Boundary Commission, and identifications of a few Cretaceous fossils collected by Prof. Macoun in 1879.\n\nDr. Dawson's Report, in the volume referred to, contains several short lists of fossils, but these as there stated \"are to be regarded as provisional only,\" and may be considered as superseded by the present paper.\n\nThe species are enumerated or described, as the case may be, in a stratigraphical and descending order corresponding as nearly as possible to the grouping and nomenclature in Dr. Dawson's Report. The only exceptions to this mode of arrangement occur in the case of a few of the specimens from the Laramie basin north of the typical region near the Belly River. In this northern part of the basin it has so far been impossible to correlate the sub-divisions of the Laramie with those of the Belly River and vicinity.\n\nThe writer desires to acknowledge his obligations to Dr. C. A. White, of the Smithsonian Institute, Washington, for a direct comparison of a number of Canadian specimens with the types of several of his own and of Mr. Meek's species in the museum of that institution, and for various and valuable critical suggestions.\n\nJune, 1885.\nA. FROM THE WESTERN LARAMIE.\n\n(1.) From the Porcupine Hill Series.\n\nNo fossils have yet been obtained from the Porcupine Hill Series proper, though it is probable that a systematic search would result in the discovery of fossiliferous beds. In the sandstones and shales of Shaganappie Point, two miles west of Calgary, however, Sir William Dawson collected a few remains of the shells of fresh water mollusca in 1883. The deposits at this place are on the horizon of those of the Porcupine Hill Series of the southern part of the district, though for reasons which will be stated more at length in connection with the St. Mary R. Series, the definition of the sub-divisions of the Laramie has not been attempted on the northern part of the map which accompanies Dr. Dawson's report. The genera or species indicated at this locality appear to be somewhat as follows, so far as they can be ascertained:\u2014Three detached valves of a *Sphaerium* or *Leptesthes*, the largest of which may be conspecific with the *Sphaerium reticardinale* of Meek & Hayden, but the characters of the interior of all three are unknown; fragments of a *Physa*, probably of that form of *P. Copei*, White, which will be described and figured in the present paper as the variety *Canadensis*; casts of the interior of the shell of a *Goniobasis* (?); *Viviparus Leai*, Meek & Hayden; and a single specimen of a shell which is either an unusually large form of a new species of *Valvata* which will be found described a little farther on under the name of *V. filosa*, or a species of *Patula*.\n\n(2.) From the Willow Creek Series.\n\nIn the clays, sandstones and indurated sands of this sub-division of the Western Laramie, fossils appear to be scarce and are usually not well preserved. The only localities at which any were collected are on the Upper Belly River seven miles above the mouth of the Old Man River, and on the Upper Belly River near Slide Out, by Mr. R. G. McConnell in 1881. The species from the locality first mentioned are\u2014an apparently new species of *Unio*; fragments of a small bivalve perhaps referable to the genus *Sphaerium*; crushed examples of a new species of *Patula*, which will be described a little farther on, under the name *P. obtusata*, from much better specimens collected from the \"St. Mary River Series\" on the Old Man River; and a few badly preserved casts of a *Goniobasis*, which is probably only a variety of the *G. tenuicarinata* of Meek and Hayden. On the Upper Belly River near Slide\nOut the only fossils collected are a few casts of a *Unio* which are not sufficiently perfect to be identified. A few fragments of Unios and other fresh water shells were noticed at some other localities, but no specimens were collected.\n\nThe supposed new species of *Unio* from near the mouth of the Old Man River may be described as follows:\n\n**Unio Albertensis. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate I, fig. 1.\n\nShell very inequilateral, strongly compressed at the sides and thickest near the mid-length, so that the outline of the closed valves as seen from above is regularly lanceolate: lateral outline transversely subelliptical: length about twice the maximum height: height almost exactly twice the greatest thickness. Anterior and posterior extremities both rounded at the margin, and of nearly equal breadth: anterior side very short: posterior side considerably elongated, about three times as long as the anterior: ventral margin and superior border almost straight and nearly parallel for the greater part of their length,\u2014the former rounding upwards obliquely and rather abruptly, and the latter sloping downwards in an equally abrupt and obliquely convex curve, at each end. Beaks very small and inconspicuous, placed about half way between the centre and the anterior termination of the valves.\n\nSurface concentrically striated: test rather thin: characters of the interior unknown.\n\nLength, seventy millimetres: maximum height, thirty-six mm.: greatest thickness, eighteen mm.\n\nUpper Belly River, Alberta, N. W. T., seven miles above the mouth of the Old Man River, R. G. McConnell, 1881: one nearly perfect specimen with the test preserved on both valves and entirely free from the matrix.\n\n(3.) **From the St. Mary River Series and Lower Portion of the Laramie Generally.**\n\nIn the southern portion of the district included in the geologically-coloured map of the region in the vicinity of the Bow and Belly Rivers, the Laramie, on lithological grounds, is clearly separable into three subdivisions, as described in Dr. G. M. Dawson's report already referred\nIn the district embraced by the northern part of the map it has been found difficult to carry out a similar lithological subdivision of the formation, and no attempt has been made to indicate such subdivisions on the map. Still further northward, in the district from which the greater number of the fossils collected by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell were obtained, it becomes quite impossible to distinguish the three subdivisions above referred to. The mollusca from this district, however, are for the most part from the lower portion of the Laramie, and consequently from a horizon nearly or quite equivalent to that occupied in the typical region by the St. Mary River Series. In the present paper, under the heading A. of the \"Western Laramie\" and in section 3, the species collected from the St. Mary River Series proper will be separately designated as such. The remainder are from the lower portion of the Laramie in its northern extension, with the exception of six species from the same northern region, which occupy positions so far up in the Laramie that the beds in which they occur may possibly represent the Willow Creek or Porcupine Hill Series. These again will be specially designated, though they are included in the present section for convenience of description. With the exception of these last-mentioned species, the mollusca here described or enumerated in section 3 of subdivision A may be considered as representing the fauna of the lower part of the Laramie of the region.\n\n**LAMELLIBRANCHIATA.**\n\n*Anomia perstrigosa.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 1, fig. 2.\n\nUpper valve (assuming that the shell is an *Anomia*) moderately convex, irregular in outline, and varying from subcircular to obliquely subovate, sometimes slightly arcuate and curved to the left. Beaks marginal, small, but in some specimens rather prominent.\n\nSurface marked by radiating raised lines, a few of which, at distant but irregular intervals, are conspicuously broader and more prominent than the rest. Under an ordinary simple lens, these radiating lines are seen to be subnodulous, in consequence of their passing over the faint concentric lines of growth. Under valve and character of the interior of the upper unknown.\n\nUpper Belly River, twenty-three miles above the mouth of the Waterton, R. G. McConnell, 1881; St. Mary River Series: three specimens.\nThe muscular impressions and hinge dentition of this shell being unknown, it is, of course, not quite certain whether it is an Anomia or not. Dr. C. A. White, who has seen the specimens, thinks it is a Plavunanomia, of the subgenus Monia, Gray.\n\n**Ostrea glabra**, Meek and Hayden.\n\n*Ostrea glabra*, Meek & Hayden. 1857. Proc. Ac. Nat.

W. branch of the north fork of the Old Man River, G. M. Dawson, 1884. This last locality is in a nearly isolated basin in the mountains, and the horizon is not certainly that of the St. Mary River Series.\n\nMost of the specimens from these localities belong to the variety Wyomingensis.\n\nA single valve of an oyster collected by Prof. Macoun from a layer of limestone in the Hand Hills, in Township 28, Range 17, west of the 4th Meridian, may also be referable to this variable species.\n\n**Ostrea subtrigonalis**, Evans and Shumard.\n\n*Ostrea subtrigonalis*, Meek.

Deweyanus* of Meek & Hayden are all varietal forms of one species, and it is upon this hypothesis that the fossils from the above mentioned localities are all referred to *U. Dan.e*. Some of these specimens from the Canadian North-west are fairly typical representatives of the *U. Dan.e*; some again are more like *U. subspatulatus*, while others possess characters apparently intermediate between these two varieties or nominal species.\n\n**Unio senectus**, White.\n\n*Unio senectus*, White. 1877.

See note to same place under *Ostrea glabra*. Red Deer River, near the 8th correction line,\u2014and forks of the Devil's Pine and Three Hills Creeks; J. B. Tyrrell, 1884.\n\nThe specimens from these localities, which are somewhat variable in shape, appear to be nearly intermediate in their characters between *C. occidentalis* and *C. cytheriformis*, and it is doubtful to which of these species they should be referred. According to Meek, the shell of *C. occidentalis* is \"subtrigonal in form, with height and length about equal,\" whereas that of *C. cytheriformis* is said to be \"transversely ovate sub-trigonal, or varying to sub-circular, but always a little longer than high.\" In the Canadian specimens, some of which are very perfect and measure fully one inch and three quarters in their two lateral diameters, the outline is distinctly subtrigonal and the height and length are either equal or else the height slightly exceeds the length. As compared also with the published figures of the two species, the specimens from the Canadian North-West are much more like those of *C. occidentalis* than those of *C. cytheriformis*.\n\n**Corbicula obliqua. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 1, figs. 4, 4a and 4b.\n\nShell compressed convex, the thickness through the closed valves being about one-third less than the maximum height inclusive of the beaks: obliquely sub-ovate, usually a little longer than high and very inequilateral. Anterior side extremely short, its margin either slightly concave or vertically truncated under the beaks above, and rounding abruptly or declining rapidly and convexly into the ventral margin below; posterior side moderately elongated, obtusely pointed at the base, its upper margin forming one continuous, obliquely convex curve which extends from the beaks to the base; ventral margin semi-ovate. Beaks small, anterior and nearly or quite terminal, almost erect, their extreme apices only being curved inwards, forwards and a little downwards.\n\nSurface concentrically striated: characters of the interior unknown.\n\nLength of the most perfect specimen collected, twenty-six millimetres: maximum height of the same, twenty-two mm.: thickness through the closed valves, fifteen mm.\n\nRye-Grass flat, Old Man River, (one perfect specimen, with the test preserved on both valves) and Bow River, eight miles west of Blackfoot Crossing, (a well preserved cast of a left valve), G.

Upper Belly River, twenty-two miles above the mouth of the Waterton, (two left valves), and Little Bow River, opposite the mouth of Snake Valley, (one right valve with the test preserved), R. G. McConnell, 1881. All from the St. Mary R. Series.\n\nThe lateral compression of the valves and their extreme obliquity, coupled with the small size and nearly terminal position of the beaks, seem to afford a ready means of distinguishing this shell from the Corbicula occidentalis of Meek and Hayden.\n\n**Sph. erium recticardinale**, Meek and Hayden.\n\n*Sphaerium recticardinale*, Meek and Hayden. 1860.

Dawson, 1874, H. M. American Boundary Commission: a few single valves from a loose piece of concretionary limestone.* According to Dr. C. A. White, *C. perundata* is only a variety of *C. subtrigonalis*, M. and H.)\n\n**Corbula perangulata.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 1, figs. 5, 5 a and 5 b, and plate 2, fig. 1.\n\nShell compressed laterally, moderately convex, thickest a little in front of the middle and narrowing regularly as well as gradually to the posterior end but very abruptly so to the anterior, so that the outline of the closed valves as seen from above is ovately lanceolate.\n\n*These are the specimens referred to on page 57 C and in a foot note to page 126 C of Dr. Dawson's Report on the Bow and Belly River country published in 1888.*\nAnterior side very short, obliquely and convexly subtruncated at its extremity above and in the middle, but obtusely sub-angular below at its junction with the ventral margin; posterior side elongated and produced into a long and narrow pointed beak, which is either straight or curved slightly upwards and whose upper margin is strongly angulated. Ventral margin semi-ovate, very moderately convex, curving upwards somewhat more rapidly at the anterior than at the posterior end, but very gently at both, the posterior half being often nearly straight or even faintly concave; superior border descending abruptly and obliquely in front of the beaks and confluent with the margin of the anterior end in one unbroken line which descends obliquely from the beak to the base,\u2014descending gradually behind the beaks in either a straight line or with a shallowly concave curve to the upper termination of the posterior side; beaks obliquely flattened on all sides, placed in advance of the middle, that of the right valve curved inwards and downwards, that of the left erect but somewhat incurved and with a slight forward inclination. Posterior area large and very distinctly defined, flattened at a right angle to the valves and in some cases shallowly excavated, broadly lanceolate in outline as viewed from above, and bordered by the strong keel which also forms the upper margin of the beaked posterior extremity of each valve.\n\nSurface marked with a few coarse and rather distant but irregularly disposed lines of growth, with much finer and close set concentric strie between them. Test rather thick; hinge teeth as in Corbula proper, muscular impressions unknown.\n\nDimensions of a full sized and perfect specimen: length, forty millimetres; maximum height, twenty-five millimetres; thickness through the closed valves, nineteen millimetres. The maximum thickness of another specimen of the same length and height is only sixteen millimetres.\n\nIn young individuals the anterior end of the shell is regularly rounded, and the posterior area is not so much flattened down as it is in the young shell. The beaked posterior side is usually pointed at its extremity, but in some specimens there is a distinct truncation at its extreme tip.\n\nRye-Grass flat, Old Man River, G. M. Dawson, 1881 and T. C. Weston, 1883; extremely abundant. Upper Belly River, twenty-three miles above the mouth of the Waterton, and Scabby Butte, seven miles north of the confluence of the Belly and Old Man Rivers; R. G. McConnell, 1881. All from the St. Mary R. Series.\n\nA very distinct species, apparently belonging to the same section of the genus as the Corbula pyriformis of Meek. Specimens of the latter shell from the Bear River Laramie of S. W. Wyoming, kindly for-\nwarded by Mr. C. A. White for comparison, are distinctly pyriform in outline as viewed from above, the closed valves being very ventricose anteriorly,\u2014the beaks of both valves are gibbous and curved strongly inwards, while the posterior area, though tolerably well defined is small and narrow. In *C. perangulata*, on the other hand, the outline as viewed from above is ovately lanceolate, both beaks are obliquely flattened and the posterior area is large and broad. The external aspect of *C. pyriformis*, as Mr. Meek has pointed out, is like that of a *Nevira*, whereas the outside of the present species has more the look of a *Leda*.\n\nDr. Dawson states that the beds characterized by a great abundance of this species, together with *Ostrea glabra var. Wyomingensis* and *Corbicula occidentalis* (or *C. cytheriformis*) occur at the very base of the Laramie, and that these deposits may even be regarded as forming a passage between that formation and the summit of the marine Cretaceous. These beds are most characteristically developed in parts of the south western portion of the district embraced by the geological map before referred to, where they frequently occur in the disturbed strata of the foot-hill region. They have been recognized as far north as a few miles west of Blackfoot Crossing on the Bow River.\n\n**Panopaea simulatrix.** *(N. Sp.)*\n\nPlate 2, figs. 2 and 2a.\n\nShell slightly inequivalve, the umbo of the right valve being a little larger and more tumid than that of the left; valves compressed at the sides, thickest on the anterior umbonal slopes and narrowing very gradually to the posterior end but more rapidly to the anterior; posterior termination gaping; lateral outline elliptic ovate, the length being fully twice the maximum height inclusive of the beaks, and the posterior side a little longer, narrower and more pointed than the anterior. Umbones broad, obtuse and depressed; beaks small, subcentral but placed a little in advance of the middle, that of the right valve curved inwards and downwards with a slight inclination forwards, that of the left valve curved inwards and a little forwards but not downwards; ligament apparently short and external.\n\nSurface concentrically striated; inner layer of the test not nacreous; hinge teeth and muscular impressions unknown.\n\nLength of the most perfect example collected, (the one figured) fifty-two millimetres; greatest height of the same, twenty-five mm.; thickness of the same, sixteen and a half.\n\nThe specimen from which the above description was made and which\nis therefore intended as the type of the species, was collected by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell in 1884 from the south bank of Knee Hills Creek, in Township 29, Range 22, west of the 4th Meridian.\n\nTen imperfect and badly preserved casts of shells which are probably referable to this species, were collected by Dr. G. M. Dawson in 1881, five at Rye-Grass flat on the Old Man River, and five at the mouth of East Arrowwood Creek, on the Bow River; all from the St. Mary River Series. Mr. R. G. McConnell collected a similar cast on the Belly River, twenty-three miles above the mouth of the Waterton, in 1881. Some of the specimens collected by Dr. Dawson and Mr. McConnell, are broader in front and shorter than the type, and in others the beaks are placed much further forwards.\n\nIn referring these shells to the genus Panopea rather than to Anodontia or Uni, the writer has been influenced by the following considerations: first, that the valves gape at the posterior end; secondly, that they are slightly inequivalve, and lastly, that the inner layer of the test is not nacreous. The specific name is suggested by the close resemblance that the most perfect specimen presents to a narrow form of Mya arenaria.\n\n**Panopea curta. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 2, fig. 3.\n\nShell compressed laterally, about one-fourth longer than high, and nearly equilateral; posterior end gaping.

Copei, especially in the character\n\"spire short, less than one-third the entire length,\" and in the fact that\nthe \"diameter of the body volution is almost equal to one half the entire\nlength of the shell. The number of volutions in P. Copei is indeed\nstated to be about four, but Dr. White's figures show that the apex as\nwell as the outer lip of the type of that species are very imperfect.\nIn unbroken Canadian specimens of the shell now under consideration\nthe number of volutions is six or seven, but the three apical whorls are\nexceedingly slender and fragile, and consequently may have been\nbroken off in Dr. White's specimens, as they most frequently are in\nthose from the Bow and Belly River district. Seven of the most per-\nfect specimens from Pincher Creek and one example from Gooseberry\nCa\u00f1on were sent to Dr. White for examination, who reports upon them\nas follows, in a letter to the writer: \"These all seem to belong to\nP. Copei. I think that if they had reached the size of my type speci-\nmens the last whorl would have been proportionately larger than your\nspecimens present.\"\n\nPhysa Copei, var. Canadensis. (Var. Nov.)\n\nPlate 2, figs. 5, 5b and 5a.\n\nShell large, attaining to a length of fully two inches, narrowly sub-\novate or ovately subfusiform in outline: length rather more than twice\nthe maximum breadth: outer whorl, as measured close to the aperture, a little longer than the spire. Volutions six or seven, the first three or four slender and increasing slowly in size, the two next, especially the last but one, increasing rapidly both in length and breadth, each being obliquely and very gently convex; suture well defined but not very deeply impressed: outer whorl moderately convex, about one-third longer than broad, and broadest a little above the middle. Aperture rather more than one half the entire length of the shell, a little more than twice as long as wide, narrowly subovate or semiovate, contracted and acutely angular above, broader and usually more rounded but in some specimens bluntly pointed below: outer lip thin and simple: columella bearing a narrow, prominent and oblique fold near its base, the fold in some specimens being bordered below with a rather deep groove: columellar callus broad and closely adherent, except at its extreme base, where it is slightly separated from the main body of the shell in such a way as to form a minute and narrow kind of umbilical chink or perforation.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, marked only with the faint and somewhat distant lines of growth common to most species of this genus.\n\nLength of a large and nearly perfect specimen, fifty-three millimetres: maximum breadth of the same, twenty-two mm.: length of body whorl, as measured close to the outer lip, thirty mm. In a slightly smaller specimen which shows the characters of the aperture better, the length of the aperture is twenty-five mm. and its maximum width only ten.\n\nPincher Creek, crossing of Mill Creek and Fort MacLeod Trail, very abundant, G.

All from the St. Mary R. Series.\n\nDuring the past four years upwards of two hundred specimens of one or more species of Physa, whose relations to forms already described are extremely puzzling, have been collected by officers of the Survey in the Laramie Formation of the Canadian Northwest. Out of these specimens it is possible to select a few which have a large and long body whorl, and a very short acutely acuminate spire, and these cannot at present be distinguished from the Physa Copes of White.\n\nBy far the larger number, however, whose characters are more minutely described above, have a much longer spire, though it apparently never quite equals the outer whorl in length. Such specimens seem to be very nearly related to the Bulinus disjunctus of White, and have been doubtfully referred to that species in Dr. Dawson's report, though in B. disjunctus the length of the spire is said to be \"a little more than\nhalf that of the whole shell.\" Thirty of the best specimens of this peculiar form, from Pincher Creek and Gooseberry Ca\u00f1on, have been examined by Dr. White, who writes that he \"cannot satisfactorily identify them with *B. disjunctus* nor with any other published species.\"\n\nStill, these comparatively long-spired forms, and those with a short spire which have already been identified with *P. Copei* are connected by so many intermediate gradations that the writer is convinced that they cannot be separated specifically, and that the former can only be regarded as a well-marked but not very constant variety of the latter. The whole of the *Physas* that have so far been collected from the Canadian Laramie appear to the writer to belong to one variable species. If the identification of any of them with *P. Copei* be correct, the whole must be considered as varieties of that species, and if incorrect the whole of the specimens here described and figured may be designated simply as *P. Canadensis*. By whatever name they may be called, their extreme variability suggests the idea that *Bulinus disjunctus* and *B. atacus* of White may also prove to be varietal forms of *P. Copei*.\n\nA unusually narrow form of the variety *Canadensis* occurs at Pincher Creek, in which the whorls are so much flattened laterally that the maximum breadth of the shell is considerably less than half its entire length. Such specimens as these, one of which is represented by figure 5a of Plate 2, approach very nearly in shape to *B. atacus*, and it is worthy of note that at Pincher Creek they occur associated with undoubted examples of *Tiviparus prudentius*, White, as *B. atacus* does in the valley of Crow Creek in Northern Colorado.\n\nJudging by the figure in Pictet's \"Trait\u00e9 de Pal\u00e9ontologie,\" and by that in Zittel's \"Handbuch der Pal\u00e4ontologie,\" *P. Copei, var Canadensis* seems to be rather nearly related to the *Physa nobilis* of Michaud, from the French Lower Eocene, but the original description and figures of that species are unfortunately not accessible to the present writer.\n\nDr. Paul Fischer restricts the use of the name *Bulinus*, Adanson, to a group of shells with very convex whorls and an obtuse apex, and removes that genus from the family Physidae on account of its different odontophore. It is in accordance with this view and in spite of its close resemblance to *B. disjunctus* that the present shell is regarded as a *Physa* rather than a *Bulinus*.\n\n---\n\n* Manuel de Conchyliologie.

(N.

Volutions four, the first and second rounded above, the third and fourth flattened somewhat obliquely; lower side rather more convex than the upper, narrowing obliquely and somewhat convexly to the umbilical margin: umbilicus about one-third of the entire diameter of the base, deep, conical and obtusely subangular at its margin. Aperture trapezoidal, widest at a right angle to the axis of the shell, the columellar side being nearly parallel with the lower half of the outer lip, which latter is thin and simple.\n\nSurface marked with minute and closely arranged striae, which cross the whorls transversely, and which are arched forwards on the upper surface.\n\nMaximum breadth of the only specimen collected, sixteen millimetres: height or depth of the same, as measured from the apex to the umbilical margin, eight mm.\n\nPincher Creek, T.

Volutions four to five, rounded, slender, and rather closely embracing, so that the upper surfaces only of those of the spire are exposed to view except perhaps in the umbilical cavity: suture distinct but not very deep: outer whorl narrowly rounded at the periphery, moderately convex and retreating obliquely to the umbilical margin below: umbilicus about one-third the diameter of the base, deep and with steep sides, but with a rounded margin. Aperture (as seen in the few specimens collected, which may not be adult shells) apparently\nalmost circular but shallowly emarginate on the columellar side by the encroachment of part of the last whorl but one: outer lip thin and simple.\n\nSurface marked with fine transverse striations.\n\nGreatest breadth of the largest specimen collected, thirteen millimetres: height of the same five mm.; width of umbilicus of do., about four mm. and a half.\n\nOld Man River, twelve miles below Fort MacLeod (two large specimens) and two miles above Rye-Grass flat, (five smaller ones) all collected by G. M. Dawson, in 1881, from the St. Mary R. Series. As already remarked on page 2, two specimens of this species were collected by R. G. McConnell in 1881, from the \"Willow Creek Series\" on the Belly River, seven miles above the mouth of the Old Man R.\n\nThere are so many points of resemblance between this species and the next that it is perhaps doubtful whether the shells described above are correctly referred to the genus *Patula*. They may be immature individuals of a new species of *Anchistoma*. In Dr. G. M. Dawson's report on the geology of the Bow and Belly River district, they are indicated under the name *Selenites*, by the present writer, on account of their supposed resemblance to the recent *Selenites concavus*, which is the *Helix concava* of Say.\n\n**Anchistoma parvulum. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 3, figs. 2, 2a & 2b.\n\nShell very small, subdiscoidal, nearly flat above and rather strongly convex below: volutions six, very slender, narrow and coiled on nearly the same plane, increasing very slowly in size and so closely embracing that the upper surfaces only of those of the spire are visible: first, second and third volutions about as much elevated as the outer whorl, the fourth and part of the fifth sunk to a slightly lower level: suture narrow, not very distinct: outer whorl flattened above and subangular at the periphery: umbilicus small but deep, about one-third or a little less than one-third of the entire basal diameter. Aperture exceedingly narrow and contracted, its outer margin, as viewed laterally, produced above into a small and narrowly rounded lobe next to the suture, and obliquely truncated below the middle, with an oblique constriction or narrow groove immediately behind the truncated portion. Characters of the interior of the aperture unknown.\n\nSurface apparently almost smooth, but the surface markings are not well preserved.\nMaximum breadth, four millimetres; height or depth, about two.\n\nOld Man River, two miles above Rye-Grass flat, G. M. Dawson, 1881; St. Mary River Series.\n\nThe only specimen collected is a well preserved cast of the interior, with nearly all the test preserved except that which originally formed the outer margin of the aperture. In the cast this margin appears to be unbroken, but still it is possible that the specimen may not represent a fully adult shell. The species is referred to Klein's genus Anchistoma in the sense in which Stoliczka and Fischer use the word, also on account of its apparent generic affinities with the three species of Anchistoma described by Stoliczka in the \"Cretaceous Gastropoda of Southern India,\" though it may be a small Polygyra. The upper portion of the aperture of the A. Arridloorense of Stoliczka seems to be singularly like that of the present species.\n\n**Thaumastus limneiformis**, Meek and Hayden.\n\nPlate 3, fig. 3.\n\n*Bulinus limneiformis*, Meek and Hayden. 1856.

Series.\n\nThe specimens from the Bow River, which are here regarded as probably representing the most typical form of *G. tenuicarinata*, have convex and scarcely angulated whorls, the later ones of the spire being encircled with three or four rather distant, spiral raised lines, and the outer whorl by six or seven. Under a lens also, the surface of the volutions in this form is seen to be marked by crowded and minute transverse raised lines, at right angles to the spiral ones.\n\nThe shells from the localities indicated above seem to form a well-marked variety of *G. tenuicarinata*, which differs from the Bow River and more typical form in having the whorls always rather distinctly angulated above the middle, in the fact that the spiral raised lines are obsolete except the single raised line or minute keel upon the angle, and in the minute sculpture, which consists of exceedingly fine revolving impressed lines, instead of transverse raised striae.\n\n**Hydrobia.**\n\nA number of minute and slender fossil shells which appear to belong either to this or to some closely allied genus, were collected by G. M. Dawson at the North or Second Branch of the Milk River in 1874 and 1881; on the Old Man River, two miles above Rye-Grass flat, in 1881; and by Mr. T. C. Weston at Pincher Creek, in 1883; from the St. Mary R. Series. They rarely exceed three millimetres in length, and most of them are mere casts of the interior of the shell, though in some specimens the whole or part of the inner layer of the test is preserved. Some of them are considerably elongated and narrow in proportion to their length, and such specimens appear to be rather nearly related to the *Hydrobia recta* of White, though they are not quite so slender. Others again are comparatively shorter and more conical, and these are difficult to separate from the *H. Utahensis* of White and similar forms, but the whole of the specimens are too imperfectly preserved to be satisfactorily determined, and it is doubtful even how many species they represent.\nCampeloma producta, White.\n\nCampeloma (Lioplax ?) producta, White. 1883.

Its sculpture and shape are not unlike those of the Valvata Leopoldi of De Boissy, from the French Eocene, as figured by Pictet (Trait\u00e9 de Pal\u00e9ontologie, atlas. pl. 58, fig. 21), and Chenu (Manuel de Conchyliologie, vol. 1, fig. 2229), but the Canadian species has much the narrower umbilicus of the two.\n\nAmong recent shells V. filosa is very closely allied to the V. striata of Dr. Lewis, which is common in the Province of Quebec, and which in the writer's judgment, is quite distinct from the V. sincera of Say.\n\nValvata bicincta. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 3, figs. 8, 8a and 8b.\n\nShell depressed turbinate or subdiscoidal, spire raised very little above the highest level of the outer whorl in some specimens, its apex\nsunk a little below that level in others: outer whorl bicarinated or encircled by two narrow and minute but prominent thread-like spiral keels, one of which is placed on or about the middle of the upper surface, and the other around the umbilical margin. Volutions three or three and a half, those of the spire exposed only on the upper or posterior surface, the first and earliest part of the second regularly rounded in the middle; suture distinct and deep. Outer volution flattened above, with a downward inclination, on the inner side of the keel, rounded on its outer side and at the periphery: umbilicus deep, conical and about one-third the entire basal diameter. Aperture rounded in some specimens, somewhat rhomboidal in others, possibly from vertical compression, outer lip thin and simple.\n\nSurface marked by minute, densely crowded and flexuous, transverse raised stri\u00e6, in addition to the spiral keels, but the former are too small to be made out without the use of a lens.\n\nMaximum breadth, five millimetres: height not ascertainable with much accuracy, but evidently much less than the breadth.\n\nMouth of the Blind Man River, Township 39, Range 27, west of 4th Principal Meridian, rather abundant and associated with the preceding species. From the same geological horizon as *Limnea tenuicostata*.\n\nIt is possible that *V. bicincta* may prove only a variety of *V. filosa*, but at present no intermediate forms have been collected.\n\nB.

FROM THE \"FOX HILLS\" AND \"FORT PIERRE\" GROUPS OF THE UPPER CRETACEOUS.\n\nThe reasons for not considering the fossils from these two formations separately are thus given in the following memorandum prepared by Dr. Dawson. \"In the district embraced by the geological map of the region in the vicinity of the Bow and Belly Rivers, published in the 'Report of Progress' of the Canadian Survey for 1882-84, it is generally impossible to separate the Fox Hills and Fort Pierre series. In the map referred to, these series are consequently represented by a single colour. In a few places, generally situated in the south-western part of the district, the Fox Hills Group is clearly recognizable in the form of massive beds of sandstones, which on the St. Mary's River were observed to be about eighty feet in thickness. In other parts of the region the dark-bluish or coffee-coloured shales of the typical Fort Pierre Group become interbedded with sandstones, lose their dark colour, and pass imperceptibly upwards into the base of the Laramie. This is well seen in the vicinity of Rye-Grass flat, on the Old Man River. The change from marine to fresh water conditions, in these cases, occurs in this series of transitional beds, and when the fresh water character becomes pronounced, the fossils are found to be characteristically Laramie, to the exclusion of the marine Cretaceous forms of the underlying beds. When the Fox Hills Group is represented by massive sandstones, fossils of any kind are rarely present. Most of the fossils which form the subject of the present report have been collected in the district above defined, but the remarks above made with regard to the unsatisfactory character of the stratigraphical grounds for the separation of the Fox Hills and Fort Pierre Groups are generally equally applicable to the contiguous districts to the east and north, from which a portion of the fossil mollusca were derived.\"\n\nBRACHIOPODA.\n\nLINGULA NITIDA, Meek and Hayden.\n\n*Lingula nitida*, Meek and Hayden. 1861.

The Belly River specimens are narrowly arcuate and more or less mytiloid in outline, while their lateral margins are usually\u2014but not always minutely crenulated.

Posterior margin sloping downwards and backwards in a broadly-convex, oblique curve from the posterior end of the hinge-line to the narrowly rounded base; anterior margin retreating obliquely backwards and downwards under the beaks, with a slightly and doubly sinuous outline in some specimens and a shallowly sigmoid one in others. Hinge-line short and straight; anterior and posterior wings quite obsolete; beaks small, anterior, terminal, curved inwards and forwards; posterior area large, broad, obliquely and sinuously flattened, bounded on each valve by a minute, narrow and moderately prominent plication, which extends from the posterior side of the beaks to the corresponding extremity of the basal margin.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, but marked with a few, faint and distant, rounded concentric undulations. On the posterior area, too, in addition to the minute radiating fold which bounds it, there are two similar but distant radiating folds, which become obsolete towards the hinge near the outer margin of each valve, and between the innermost of these and the boundary of the area there is a short and not very deep radiating groove or narrow sinus, which also becomes obsolete towards the hinge line. Character of the interior of the valves unknown.\n\nLength of the most perfect specimen, nineteen millimetres; height of the same, thirty-one mm.\n\nBow River, below Horse-Shoe Bend, G. M. Dawson, 1881: two well preserved and nearly perfect casts of the interior of the shell. These specimens differ from the typical form of Pteria (Pseudoptera) fibrosa in the much greater lateral compression of the valves, especially in the umbonal region, and in their nearly smooth surface. They can scarcely be considered, however, as indicating anything more than a local and rather well-marked variety of that species, of which it has been thought desirable to prepare an original description and a figure.\nThe distinction between *Pseudoptera*, Meek, and *Meleagrina*, Lamarck, is not very clearly defined, and it is possible and by no means improbable that the present species may be congeneric with the *Meleagrina antiqua* of the Chico group of California and with the *M. amygdaloidea* of the Middle Cretaceous of Skidegate Inlet in the Queen Charlotte Islands.\n\n**Inoceramus altus**, Meek.\n\n*Inoceramus altus*, Meek. 1871.

The few Lucin\u00e6 which have yet been collected from the Fort Pierre Group of the Canadian North-West, however, all clearly belong to a single species, and it is extremely probable that L. subundata is only the young of L. occidentalis, as Mr. Meek has suggested may be the case. In reference to these two nominal species and to the variety ventricosa, Mr. Meek remarks (on page 136 of the volume last cited), \"it may be possible that all three of the types here described are merely varieties or represent different ages of the same species. Indeed, I confess that I am not altogether satisfied with the conclusion that they belong to more than one species; but having already separated them, it is perhaps better to continue this arrangement than to unite the whole under one name doubtfully.\"\n\nTancredia Americana, Meek and Hayden.\n\nHettangia Americana, Meek and Hayden. 1856.

Anterior side very short, its extremity regularly rounded; posterior side rather longer than the anterior, its extremity somewhat obliquely sub-truncated above, and rather narrowly rounded at the base below. Superior border descending very abruptly in front of the beaks, nearly straight and parallel to the ventral margin behind, cardinal margin short, ventral margin nearly straight in the middle and for the greater part of its length; umbones broad, oblique, and obtusely angular behind; beaks placed in advance of the middle (in some specimens very near to the anterior margin) curved inwards and downwards with a slightly forward inclination.\nSurface nearly smooth but marked with very fine and closely arranged concentric striae, also by a few distant lines of growth, which latter are waved and toothed on the posterior area, where they are crossed by obscure, rounded, radiating ribs. These ribs, though obsolete above, are sufficiently well marked below to cause an interlocking of the margins of the valves at the posterior end of the base.\n\nHinge dentition unknown; anterior and posterior muscular scars nearly equal in size, the anterior broadly subovate and higher than broad, the posterior somewhat pointed both above and below; pallial line not clearly indicated.\n\nDimensions of an average individual: length, twenty-three millimetres; maximum height, twenty-one mm. and a-half; thickness through the closed valves, seventeen mm.

Anterior side a little shorter than the posterior, its outer margin subangular at its junction with the superior border above, and retreating obliquely and rapidly both inwards and downwards in a broadly convex curve to the base below; posterior side abruptly contracted, its margin nearly straight above but rounding up very rapidly from the base below, its gaping termination narrow and subtruncated somewhat obliquely above the middle of the valves. Ventral margin broadly and convexly arched, rounding up rapidly at each extremity: superior border descending gradually in front of the beaks, and nearly straight behind; umbones moderately prominent; beaks placed a little in advance of the middle, apparently rather small and incurved, with a slightly forward inclination.\nSurface markings of the test unknown, but the cast of the interior of the valves is marked by faint broad undulations. On a minute fragment of the test which happens to be preserved, there are indications of raised concentric striations.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: Length, seventy-six millimetres (or about three inches); height, inclusive of the beaks, fifty-five mm.; maximum thickness through the closed valves, thirty-five mm.\n\nFour miles south of Battle River, Township 3S. between Ranges 12 and 13, west of 4th Meridian, J.

In two of these casts the apex is nearly central, but in the other two it is placed very near to the anterior end, and these latter approach rather nearly to the A. borealis, Morton (sp.), especially to the specimen figured under that name by Prof. Whitfield on plate 12, fig. 23 of the \"Palaeontology of the Black Hills of Dakota.\" Moreover, in each of the specimens collected by Mr. McConnell, the radiating furrows differ both in number and in their relative position. In one of the casts, too, there is a distinct and rather prominent ridge, which extends from the beaks backward to the posterior end of the base, and this is quite wanting in the other three.\n\nIn reference to Colorado specimens of A. centrale, Dr. C. A. White makes the following remarks, which are quite as applicable to those from Old Wives Creek. \"This species seems to be at least as distinct from any of other published forms as they are from each other, but specific variation in this genus is evidently very great. Indeed, I\nthink one cannot examine the original types of the published species and the collections subsequently made, together with the original descriptions and illustrations given by Mr. Meek in the publications of the United States Geological Survey of the Territories, without entertaining serious doubts whether more than two or three out of the seven published species of this genus from the Cretaceous strata of the United States are well founded.\"\n\n**Lunatia concinna**, Hall & Meek.

The cliffs are composed entirely of drift deposits, and it maintains this character as far up and down as I have been able to examine it. Many fragments of Cretaceous fossils and large masses of fossiliferous iron-stone, are found in the bed of the stream and in the clay banks; and so large a proportion of the drift is formed of the redistributed matter of the Cretaceous clay-shales, that it seems probable that they exist here at no very great depth. *Baculites grandis* is among the fossils, and was not elsewhere observed; there\n\n---\n\n*Rep.

Volutions broadly rounded on the periphery and middle of the sides, but much more narrowly convex on their inner or umbilical sides, increasing rapidly in breadth laterally, but not so rapidly in diameter from the siphonal to the antisiphonal side,\u2014closely involute and so deeply embracing that the whole of the inner ones are concealed, except in the largest individuals, in which a considerable portion of the last volution but one is exposed in the umbilical cavity: umbilicus about one-fourth of the entire diameter, with steep sides and an obliquely rounded and ill-defined margin. Aperture transversely reniform, nearly twice as broad as high and rather deeply emarginated by the encroachment of the preceding volution.\nSurface marked by transverse and nearly straight ribs, which increase in number either by bifurcation or intercalation, especially in half grown and very young shells, so that there are often twice or perhaps three times as many on the centre of the periphery as on the umbilical margin. In specimens which measure about two inches in their greatest diameter and in still smaller ones, there is a row of distantly arranged small nodes on each side near the periphery of the outer volution and a faint tendency towards the same kind of sculpture around the umbilical margin. In the largest specimens, however, these rows of nodes are entirely obsolete.

The septation of both of these forms, indeed, appears to be much alike, and very young shells of *S. subglobosus* have a somewhat similar sculpture to *S. Conradi*, but in large individuals of the former the ribbed surface of the outer volution is entirely free from nodes.\n\n**Placenticeras placentia**, Dekay.

FROM THE BELLY RIVER SERIES.\n\nDr. Dawson's views on the stratigraphical position of the \"Belly River Series\" are fully stated in pages 118-126 C. of the Report of Progress of the Canadian Survey for 1882-83-84. It is there explained that this name has been used to designate a considerable thickness of beds which occupy a position below the shales of the Fort Pierre Group, or at least below an upper portion of these shales. The beds of the \"Belly River Series\" are estuarine throughout, and differ in this respect from those described as occurring below the shales of the Fort Pierre Group in the Missouri region proper. Owing to the differences between the section in the Bow and Belly region and that on the Missouri, the exact stratigraphical position of the \"Belly River Series\" was for a long time considered doubtful, but Dr. Dawson has, on stratigraphical grounds, become convinced that it occupies the horizon assigned to it in his report. It may be added that Mr. R. G. McConnell, who assisted Dr. Dawson in the geological work, fully concurs in this opinion.\n\nIn the course of the explorations two sets of beds were at first distinguished, and these were provisionally recognized as the \"pale\" and \"yellow\" series respectively. These have now been united under the name \"Belly River Series,\" the first named being the upper and the second the lower part of the series. It should be stated, however, that while (according to Dr. Dawson) the evidence is indubitable and precise as to the fact of the position of the pale or upper portion of these shales, that affecting the yellow or lower beds is somewhat less definite. The bearing of all the facts is discussed in the report above cited, and need not be repeated.*\n\nThe molluscan fauna of the pale or upper beds is comparatively scanty, though vertebrate remains, which have not yet been reported on, are somewhat abundant. It is unfortunate that the rather extensive collection of mollusca made from these beds by Mr. T. C. Weston at a locality in Milk River Ridge which proved unusually rich in fossils, and which was specially revisited in 1883 for the purpose of collecting them, was subsequently lost in transit. The yellow and supposed lower beds often contain great quantities of molluscan remains, and a number of species are represented.\n\n* In this connection it seems desirable to state that all the notes on the stratigraphical position and lithological peculiarities of the formations mentioned in the present paper were supplied by Dr. G. M. Dawson. Judging by their respective invertebrate faunas, it would seem impracticable to separate the \"Belly River Series\" from the Laramie and more especially from the \"Judith River Group,\" on purely palaeontological evidence.

Anterior side extremely small, its margin subtruncated almost vertically under the beaks; posterior side much longer and broader, its extremity regularly rounded.

If radiating striae or costa or a cancellate sculpture are essential characters of the latter genus, then it is clear that the present shell cannot be a Crenella. The only North American species to which the C. (?) parvula bears much resemblance is the Muliola granulato-costellata of Roemer,\u2020 from the Texan Cretaceous, but this latter shell, as its specific name implies, has the outer surface of the valves marked with numerous, equal and granulated, radiating lines. Judging by the published figures, the Crenella elegantula of Meek and Hayden,\u2021 from the Fox Hills Group of Deer Creek and the Yellowstone River, is as broad or high anteriorly as it is posteriorly, and its surface is said to be marked with bifurcating radiating striae.\n\n---\n\n* Am.

The hinge line appears to have been thin and edentulous, but it is impossible to ascertain definitely whether the pallial line had a sinus or not.\n\nThe form and surface markings of the exterior of the shell, which is nearly all that the Canadian specimens shew, are as much like those of the so-called Thracia? subtortuosa of Meek* as those of Anodonta propatoris, and it is not at all unlikely that some if not all of the fossils now under consideration should be referred to the former species rather than to the latter.\n\nAll the specimens collected by Dr. Dawson and Mr. McConnell prior to 1883 were at first and for a long time supposed by the writer to be conspecific with T. subtortuosa. This opinion, too, seemed to be confirmed by the circumstance first that their tests showed scarcely any traces of an inner nacreous layer, and secondly by the fact that at Milk River Ridge they were obtained from a series of beds which hold Mactra alta (which occurs with T. subtortuosa at the mouth of the Judith River in Montana), and such other marine types as Pteria\n\n* Rep.

All the specimens of the present shell, too, which Mr. McConnell obtained at the South Saskatchewan in 1883, and which have most of the inner layer of the test preserved, are brilliantly nacreous, and young individuals, from more than one Canadian locality, are remarkably like Dr. White's figures of the young of A. propatoris.\n\nUnio primarius, White.\n\nUnio primarius, White. 1877.

Margins of both extremities evenly rounded in some specimens, but in others the posterior end is bluntly pointed just below the middle. Superior border descending obliquely, convexly and abruptly in front of the beaks, nearly straight and horizontal, but slightly convex behind them; ventral margin also nearly straight except at the immediate extremities,\u2014apparently never concavely arcuate near the centre; sides of the valves also never concave near the midlength below.

In this individual, which is a little distorted and twisted to one side, the valves are partially open, so that the exact thickness through them is difficult to ascertain, but in another specimen which appears to belong to the same species and whose valves are closed, the maximum height is fifty millimetres, and the greatest thickness of both united is about thirty.\n\nThe species attains to a still larger size than this, for a cast of the interior of the valves from another locality measures fully one hundred and thirty-five millimetres in length, by sixty-five in height.\n\nMilk River Ridge, R.

M. Dawson in 1874, six miles west of the first branch of the Milk River, while attached to H. M. North American Boundary Commission; also, in 1881, on the Bow River, ten miles below Grassy Island,\u2014and by Mr. McConnell, in 1883, on the South Saskatchewan, eight miles above the mouth of the Red Deer River.\n\nSo few perfect specimens of this shell have yet been obtained that its specific relations are by no means clear. The specific name suggested for it, which must be regarded as purely provisional, is intended to convey the idea that its characters are of a very ordinary kind and ones that are shared by it in common with many fossil and recent species of *Unio*. It may be only an unusually large variety of *Unio Dance*, but appears to be proportionately broader in the direction of its height than that shell is, its ventral margin is not distinctly arcuate, if at all, and its flanks are never shallowly concave near the midlength\nbelow. The type and only specimen known of the *Unio Albertensis* of the \"Willow Creek Series,\" described on page 3, looks very much like an immature shell, and it is not impossible that *U. consuetus* may ultimately prove to be the adult state of that species. There is also a considerable resemblance between the only perfect specimen known of *U. consuetus* and the *U. Couesi* of Dr. C. A.

South Saskatchewan, one mile below the mouth of the Bow River, T. C. Weston, 1883. Apparently common at each of these localities.\n\nAt Driftwood Bend a number of specimens were collected which appear to be very young or half grown shells of this species. These differ from adult or nearly adult examples in being narrowly fusiform, with an attenuated and extremely slender spire not unlike that of an Acella. One of these, which is figured on plate 10, fig. 4c, and which measures about ten millimetres in length, has as many as seven volutions, the first three of which are exceedingly slender, fragile and apparently non-persistent. The body whorl also of these half grown shells is often concavely but shallowly constricted next to the suture.\n\nThis shell is very doubtfully and only provisionally referred to Meek's genus Rhytophorus. It differs materially from the two described and typical species (the R. priscus of Meek and the R. Meeki of White) in the total absence of the \"small, oblique, short folds around the top of the somewhat shouldered whorls\" which suggested the generic name and which may or may not be an essential character. According to Meek:\n\n\"a slight curve in these little folds or costae indicates the presence of a faint sinus in the lip near the suture, somewhat as in Schizostoma Lea, but much less deeply defined,\" and the type species is said to have \"one rather strong oblique fold\" on the columella below, \"and a much smaller less oblique one about halfway up the aperture.\" In the present species there is a similar slight curve in the lines of growth next to the suture, and a correspondingly oblique fold in the columella below, but the aperture of all the specimens is so much filled up with the matrix that it is at present impossible to ascertain whether there was a second fold or not, without great risk of injury to the specimens. It may be that the present shell is more nearly related to the South American fresh water genus Chilina than it is to Rhytophorus.\n\n---\n\nU. S. Geol.

A. White, to whom the originals of figures 3, 3a and 3b on plate 3 were submitted, was at one time inclined to think that they should possibly be regarded as a variety of the *Goniobasis invenusta* of Meek and Hayden, but if that view be correct, then *G. invenusta*, as suspected by Meek, can scarcely be a true *Goniobasis* and probably not even a fresh water shell. It may be that *T. limn\u00e6iformis*, *G. invenusta* and *Limn\u00e6a compactilis*, Meek, are more closely allied, both generically and specifically, than their names would lead the student to suppose.\n\nThe specimens collected by Dr. Dawson from the Belly River Series on the South Saskatchewan evidently belong to the same species as those from the Western and Souris River Laramie, though those from the first mentioned locality are a little larger and their spires are rather more produced in proportion to the entire length of the shell.\n**Velatella baptista**, White.\n\n*Velatella baptista*, White. 1878.

Apparently not unfrequent at each of these localities.\n\nThe description given above and the figure on plate 10 are both taken from an unusually perfect and well preserved specimen collected by Mr. Weston on the South Saskatchewan. In Mr. Meek's diagnosis of the characters of *G. subtortuosa* the number of volutions is said to be \"about five\" and his measurements and figures of that shell do not correspond at all well with the proportions and contour of the Canadian specimens. Dr. C. A. White, however, who has kindly compared the fossil obtained by Mr. Weston with the specimen described and figured by Meek, informs the writer that the former is \"without doubt the *G. (?) subtortuosa* of Meek and Hayden,\" and adds that Meek's type of that species is \"imperfect and partially crushed,\" and that it would not warrant a definite determination of the number of whorls.\n\nThe only species with which the present shell is at all likely to be confounded is the *Cassiopella turricula* of White, but the latter is stated to have nine or ten volutions, its base is said to be distinctly umbilicated, and the spiral keel which encircles its spire is represented as placed considerably below the middle of each whorl.\n\nIt is difficult to see how *G. subtortuosa* can be separated generically from such living species as the *G. avutocarinata* of Lea and other forms belonging to that section of the genus.\n\n**Hydrobia subcylindracea.

Body-whorl comparatively narrow, subcylindrical above and imperforate at the base: aperture obliquely subovate, somewhat pointed above: outer lip simple and rather thin.\n\nSurface smooth and polished.\nGreatest length, three millimetres and a half: maximum breadth or convexity, a little over one mm.: length (or height) of body-whorl, about one mm.\n\nBelly River, east side of Driftwood Bend, G.

Canada, vol. 2, p. 237.\n\nHighwood River (a tributary of the Bow River), ten miles west of the first fork, R. G. McConnell, 1882: one specimen.\n\nThe following is a copy of the original description of this interesting fossil.\n\n\"The specimen originally consisted of an elongate-oval and flattened concretionary nodule of soft argillite, with a small piece broken off from one end, but enough of the matrix has been removed to show most of the carapace and the upper surface of a few of the abdominal segments. The anterior extremity of the carapace, with the rostrum, is unfortunately not preserved, and the tail, with some of the posterior abdominal segments, was broken off when the nodule was found. The ambulatory feet are preserved, but it was found to be scarcely possible to remove the soft shale from around them without running the risk of spoiling the specimen.\n\nThe carapace, like that of most of the macrura, is elongated and comparatively narrow, with nearly parallel sides, and, when perfect, its length must have been about twice as great as its breadth. A little in advance of the midlength a single, broadly V-shaped, deep and rather wide groove or furrow crosses the carapace transversely. The posterior half of the carapace is depressed and rather distinctly three-keeled in a longitudinal direction, though it is most likely that these appearances are mostly or wholly due to a considerable and abnormal compression from above. Be this as it may, in the specimen collected by Mr. McConnell, a central keel, or narrow but prominent raised ridge, which is about three times as broad posteriorly as it is anteriorly, and which is bounded on each side by a deep and angular furrow, extends from the posterior end of the carapace to the centre of the V-shaped groove which transverses it. This central keel is much more strongly marked than the broad and comparatively obtuse and lateral keels, which latter are placed near the outer margin of each side. The surface of the posterior half of the carapace (and perhaps that of the anterior also) is covered with rather distant, small, isolated conical tubercles, which, under the lens, look as if they might have each borne\na bristle at the summit, and which, occasionally, are surrounded by a minute annulus at the base; and the three keels each have a single series of larger conical tubercles, whose pointed apices are directed forward.\n\nIn front of the transverse and V-shaped furrow the carapace is very badly preserved, and the anterior margin with the rostrum is broken off. The two lateral and tuberculated keels appear to be prolonged to within a short distance of the front margin of the carapace, though they are somewhat less distinct in front of the transverse furrow than they are behind it. On the anterior side of the furrow the central keel is absent, and the median portion of this part of the carapace bears a number of comparatively large and prominent, distinct and conical tubercles, which are somewhat peculiarly arranged. Next to the furrow, and in advance of it, in the median line, there are five tubercles arranged in two convergent rows of two pairs and an odd one, which, if connected by lines, would have much the shape of an isosceles triangle, with its base near to the furrow. Between the space bounded by these five tubercles and each lateral keel, there is a shallowly concave and rather broad depression of the carapace. In front of these five tubercles, again, there are four others and still larger ones (the two anterior ones apparently of considerable size), arranged somewhat in the form of a square, any of whose sides would be greater than the base of the isosceles triangle indicated by the other five.\n\nThe upper surface of each of the abdominal segments bears a tubercle in the centre, on its anterior edge, and another one on the margin of each of the sides. The most prominent characteristic of the species, in fact, is the possession of three widely distant, longitudinal and tuberculated keels, which extend over nearly the whole length of the upper surface of the body.\n\nTo the right of the carapace, in front, there are indications of what appears to have been a large pinching claw, and, if the appearances presented are correctly interpreted, the sides of the fixed ramus of that claw are also coarsely tuberculated.\n\nUntil its exact generic position shall have been settled by the collection of more perfect specimens, it may be convenient to designate the present species as *Hoploparia (?) Canadensis*, though it is by no means certain that it belongs to McCoy's genus of that name.\"\n\nJudging by the invertebrate fossils alone, it would seem probable that the friable and fissile shales at Mill Creek which hold typical example of *Inoceramus problematicus* may represent the \"Niobrara\nGroup\" of the Upper Missouri Section. On similar evidence, also, the rocks at the two localities on the Waterton River which have yielded respectively *Ostrea congesta* and *Volticerasmus evoggyroides*; those at the Highwood River which contain *Inoceramus undabundus* and *Scaphites Warreni*; those on the Northwest branch of the North fork of the Old Man River from which *Inoceramus undabundus*, *Pholadomya papyracea*, *Scaphites Warreni* and *S. vermiformis* were collected; and those at the entrance to the North Kootanie Pass which are characterized by *Volticerasmus evoggyroides*, *Scaphites Warreni* and *S. vermiformis*\u2014would appear to be as nearly as possible the Canadian equivalents of the \"Fort Benton Group.\"\n\nIn conclusion, it may be remarked that (as already partly stated in the foot-note to page 55) the invertebrate fauna of the \"Belly River Series\" seems to be essentially the same as that of the \"Laramie\" of the United States and Canada, unless more than one formation has been confounded under the latter name, and that it is at present scarcely possible to separate the \"Lower Dark Shales\" of Dr. Dawson's Bow and Belly River Report from the \"Fort Pierre and Fox Hills\" Groups, on purely palaeontological grounds.\n\nAugust, 1880.\n2. On some fossils from the Hamilton Formation of Ontario, with a list of the species at present known from that formation and province.\n\nThe calcareous shales and limestones of the Hamilton Formation of the Middle Devonian System in western Ontario have long possessed a special interest to palaeontologists, on account of the variety and excellent state of preservation of the fossils which they contain.\n\nA succinct account of the first recognition of the exact geological horizon of this group of rocks is given by Mr. Alexander Murray on pages 129-182 of the \"Report of Progress of the Geological Survey of Canada for 1853-54-55-56,\" published in 1857, and their distribution in Ontario is described more in detail in the fifteenth chapter of the \"Geology of Canada\" (1863) and in Professor Chapman's \"Outlines of the Geology of Canada\" published in 1876.\n\nAccording to the writer last mentioned, \"the formation in this district is estimated at about 250 feet in thickness. It extends across the counties of Norfolk, Elgin, Kent, Middlesex and Lambton, and also the south part of Huron, but is much obscured throughout this area by overlying clay, sands and other drift and superficial deposits. The best exposures occur in the township of Bosanquet, in the north-west corner of Lambton.\" To this it may be added that extensive and richly fossiliferous outcrops occur on both banks of the Sable River, in the adjacent township of West Williams, county of Middlesex, near Bartlett's Mills, that Widder and Thedford are both in the township of Bosanquet, and that the name of the station on the Grand Trunk Railway which was formerly called Widder has been changed to Thedford, the two villages of that name being only one mile and a half apart.\n\nMost of the fossils that have been recorded from these rocks in Ontario are enumerated or described in two papers by the late Mr. E. Billings, and in two reports by Professor H. Alleyne Nicholson.\n\nIn Mr. Billings paper \"On the Fossil Corals of the Devonian rocks of Canada West,\" published in the Canadian Journal for March 1859, two species, viz.: *Heliophyllum Halli* of Edwards and Haime and *H. tenui-*\nseptatum, Billings, are enumerated as occurring in the Hamilton Formation, the latter being then described for the first time. To these should probably be added the *Cystiphyllum Americanum* of Edwards and Haime, which is one of the commonest fossils of this formation, although by some inadvertence Mr. Billings omitted to state from what particular horizon the specimens he referred to were obtained.\n\nIn another paper by Mr. Billings, \"On the Devonian Fossils of Canada West,\" published in the Canadian Journal for May 1860, nine species of corals, six of which had not previously been described, and fifteen of brachiopoda, two which were here named and characterized for the first time, are enumerated as having been collected in the Hamilton Formation.\n\nProfessor H. A. Nicholson's \"Report upon the Palaeontology of the Province of Ontario,\" published at Toronto in 1874, which is exclusively devoted to the organic remains of the Devonian rocks, contains the most exhaustive and indeed the only list that had appeared up to that date of the fossils of the Corniferous and Hamilton Formations of that province. The number of species from the latter formation enumerated in this list is fifty-six, many of which were described for the first time in this report, but seventeen out of the fifty-six are identical with forms that had previously been recorded by Mr. Billings as occurring in the same formation.\n\nIn his Report upon the Palaeontology of the Province of Ontario, published at Toronto in 1875, Professor Nicholson adds fifteen species to the fauna of the Hamilton Formation of that province, two out of the seventeen there mentioned as belonging to it having been previously recognized or described by Mr. Billings.\n\nDue allowance being made for names that are mentioned by both of these palaeontologists, the total number of species recorded in these four publications from the formation and province in question is eighty-one, and since 1875 about twenty additional species have been described or identified by E. Billings, Drs. Nicholson, Carl Rominger and G. J. Hinde, Prof. H. Montgomery and Messrs. Etheridge and Carpenter, thus bringing the general total, to the close of 1886, up to a little over one hundred.\n\nIn addition to these the Museum of the Geological Survey of Canada contains nearly forty species of fossils, most of which have not previously been recognized as occurring in the Hamilton Formation of Ontario, or at least not in any Canadian publication. With the exception of *Spirifera subdecussata* and *Dalmanites Helena*, they are all from the townships of Bosanquet or West Williams, and a few of them appear to be undescribed. Some of these fossils were collected by Mr. James Richardson in 1859 and by Mr. Johnson Pettit in 1868, but by\nfar the greater number were obtained by the Rev. Hector Currie (formerly of Widder and now resident at Thedford) and by the Rev. J. M. Goodwillie, two zealous and successful collectors of the fossils of these townships since 1876, who generously presented a number of their choicest specimens to the Museum of the Canadian Survey in 1882.\n\nThe object of the present paper is to place upon record the names of these and other fossils new to the published lists, with descriptions and figures of such as appear to be undescribed, and finally to give as complete a list as possible of all the species known up to the present date from the formation in Ontario.\n\nIn the preparation of this paper the writer desires to acknowledge his obligations to Mr. Charles Wachsmuth for the identification of three species of crinoids, as well as for valuable critical suggestions in reference to the crinoids and blastoids generally; to Professor James Hall for the loan of two of the types each of his *Pentremites leda* and *P. Whitei*; and to Professor R. P. Whitfield for the loan of one of the types of *Nucleocrinus lucina*, Hall, now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York city, and for the comparison of Canadian specimens supposed to be referable to *Nucleocrinus elegans*, Conrad, and *Productella truncata*, Hall, with the types of those species in the same institution.\n\n**COELENTERATA.**\n\n**ANTHOZOA.**\n\n*(Tetracoralla, Haeckel: Rugosa, Edwards and Haime.)*\n\n**ACERVULARIA PROFUNDA**, Hall.\n\n*Acervularia profunda*, Hall. 1758.

Hector Currie, two specimens: one collected in 1882 and the other in 1883.\n\nThese two fossils are regarded with some doubt as a local variety of Taxocrinus lobatus, principally upon the authority of Mr. Charles Wachsmuth who has examined and reports as follows upon them in a letter to the writer: \"I have compared the two specimens with Forbesocrinus lobatus and F. nuntius, Hall, which are both Taxocrinus. They differ from both of these species in having neither nodes nor spines upon their bifurcating plates. The nodes, however, might be undeveloped, as is the case sometimes in Taxocrinus Thiemei, and this is the more probable as the specimens agree in other respects with Hall's description of Forbesocrinus nuntius. It is very curious that Hall, in his description of Forbesocrinus nuntius, speaks of the very remarkable resemblance of this species to F. Thiemei and that in Vol. 2 of the Ohio Report, Pl. 12, fig. 2, a specimen which is almost identical with Taxocrinus Thiemei is called Forbesocrinus lobatus, var. tardus and not F. nuntius, var. tardus, as it ought to be. I have compared your specimens also with Taxocrinus Ithavensis, Williams, with which they agree more closely than his figures on Plate 1 would suggest. I have good india rubber casts of his type specimens, and find in none of them the second primary radials so widely separated as in his figure. He describes all plates in a radial direction from the first primary radial up as brachials and arm plates, i.e. as free plates; while in fact\nhis species, like all others of the genus, has not only three or more primary but also several secondary radials, connected laterally by inter-radials, though these latter, which were moveable in the animal, are rarely preserved in the fossil. *Tavocrinus Ithacensis* differs from your specimens in having less bifurcations and in possessing almost straight and not strongly waving sutures.\"\n\n**Homocrinus crassus.

Height of the dorsal cup, from the lower margin of the underbasals to the summit of the first radials, very little greater than its maximum breadth. Underbasals pentagonal, about one half the size of the basals, and broader than high; basals moderately large, about equal in size to the anterior radials, the three anterior ones hexagonal, the two posterior ones heptagonal and truncated above; inferior anal plate equal in size to the underbasals, square and resting obliquely between two basals, the right radial and the superior anal plate. Primary radials pentagonal, nearly flat below, slightly raised in the middle above, and truncated abruptly and somewhat obliquely, in such a manner as to form a shallowly excavated articulating area whose contour is almost circular, but a little broader than high, and which is furnished with a small, ovate, marginal foramen, whose acutely pointed apex opens directly into an obtusely angular notch in the centre of the upper margin of the plate. Right posterior radial a little smaller than the rest. Superior anal plate pentagonal, equal in size to the right posterior radial, but devoid of course of a distinct lateral articulating area. Substance of the plates thick; outer surface apparently smooth.\n\nNear Thedford, Rev. Hector Currie, 1882: a single specimen of the dorsal cup, entirely free from the matrix.\n\nThis species may be easily distinguished from the *H. scoparius* of Hall, from the Lower Helderberg of the State of New York, and from the *H. proboscidialis* of Hall, from the Oriskany Sandstone of the same State, by its much larger size, by its broader, shorter and more bell-shaped dorsal cup, and by the much greater thickness of the plates of which this part of the calyx is composed.\nARTHROACANTHA PUNCTOBRACHIATA, Williams.\n\nPlate 13, figs. 1, and 1a.\n\n*Arthroacantha punctobrachiata*, H.

Ami, 1883.\n\nIn the Museum of the Survey there are five good specimens of this species and there are two also in the Redpath Museum at Montreal. These latter were collected by the Rev. Hector Currie, and were kindly loaned to the present writer for examination and study, by Sir William Dawson. Of these seven specimens five have the whole of the calyx, with portions of the arms, beautifully preserved, but the summit of each is completely filled by a shell of *Platyceras dumosum*, Conrad, var. *rarispinum*, Hall. The perforated tubercles to which the moveable spines were attached, are well shewn in each specimen and it is not unusual to find the spines lying alongside of the tubercles.\n\nIn 1883 Prof. H. S. Williams published a description of a new genus of crinoids for which he proposed the name *Arthroacantha*. This genus was shewn to be most nearly related to *Hevacrinus*, Austin, but to differ therefrom in \"possessing a well defined third primary radial similar in size to the second, and from which the free arms abruptly diverge,\" and from it and \"from all other hitherto undescribed crinoids, in the possession of slender, acicular spines which were free from the plates and were evidently articulated by some means upon elevated pitted tubercles on the surface of the calyx, vault and free arms.\" The type of this genus was stated to be the *A. Ithacensis* (Williams) \"from the base of the Chemung Group at Ithaca, N. Y.,\" and this species was described in minute detail, with full measurements of all the parts known, and illustrated with an octavo plate of eight figures.\n\nOn page 83 of the paper in which the genus *Arthroacantha* was described by Professor Williams the following remarks occur. \"In studying this genus, I have examined several specimens which agree with the typical form in the general character of the plates and the arms in one case, and possess the pitted tubercles on the surface. The most important among these is the original specimen of a figure issued by the New York State Museum with the name *Platycrinus? punctobrachiatus*. The original is in the Museum of Cornell University. The\nname was proposed by Prof. Hall, but, as he informs me, the species was never described. This, with several other undescribed species, was photographed and the plate was privately distributed about 1872, with name attached, but with no descriptions. The arms, the shape of calyx, and the plates that were preserved, correspond in general with *A. Ithacensis*, but the tubercles on the calyx plates are finer, more numerous, and the pitting very indistinct, and the basal plates are relatively larger than in the typical specimens of that species. Hence we are led to believe that the Hamilton species is distinct from the Chemung specimens, and even if it were properly described and published, it is probably safe to regard it as a distinct species. Although the specimen shows no traces of the free spines, the nature of the tubercles leave little doubt of a generic identity with *Arthroacantha Ithacensis*, and the Hamilton form may be called *Arthroacanthus punctobrachiata*. In the Museum of Cornell University are two specimens, each a portion of the basal disc, which appear to be identical with *A. punctobrachiata*. One is marked *Moscow shale*, locality not designated; the other is marked *Hamilton Period, Delphi, N.Y.* and is on a soft dark shale with specimens of *Pholidops*.\n\nOn page 86 of the same paper, in reference to *A. Ithacensis*, we read as follows: \"This species differs from the *Arth. punctobrachiata* of the Hamilton group in the more distinct and less numerous tubercles on the surface of the calyx plates: the smaller size of the tubercles leads to the inference that the spines were smaller in the Hamilton form; the calyx plates were apparently thicker in the Chemung species, and the second and third radial of the specimen *Arth. punctobrachiata* are higher than those of *Arth. Ithacensis*.\"\n\nThe following year, on receipt of a copy of Professor Williams' paper, the present writer came to the conclusion that the specimens now under consideration were referable to *A. punctobrachiata*, Williams, first, because they are from the Hamilton Formation,\u2014secondly, because they agree perfectly with Professor Williams' diagnosis of the characters of the genus,\u2014and thirdly, because they differ from the *A. Ithacensis*, of the Chemung group, as figured by Williams, in having more numerous and less distinct tubercles on the surface of the calyx plates, with shorter and smaller spines articulated to these tubercles. A similar conclusion had previously been arrived at, on perfectly independent grounds, by Mr. Charles Wachmuth, to whom two of the Canadian specimens had been submitted.\n\nIn 1885 Dr. George Jennings Hinde published a paper entitled \"Description of a New Species of Crinoids, with Articulating Spines,\" and to this species he gave the name *Hystricrinus Carpenteri*. The specimens upon which the paper was based were stated to be from the\nMiddle Devonian of Arkona, Ontario, and the locality, as well as the description and figures, leave little room for doubt that Dr. Hinde's specimens are both specifically and generically identical with those whose nomenclature is now being discussed. In this and in a subsequent paper Dr. Hinde claims that Professor Williams' genus *Arthroacantha* cannot be retained, because \"the name *Arthracanthus* was employed by Schmarda in 1854 for a genus of Rotatoria,\" and that the species *Arthroacantha punctobrachiata* must also be rejected, because it was never properly described.\n\nBut to the first of these objections it may be answered that, although from a purist's standpoint, the *o* in *Arthroacantha* may be superfluous, yet the difference in the terminations of the two words in question is quite sufficient to admit of the use of both. Generic terms which differ only in this respect, such as, for example, *Picus*, a woodpecker, and *Pica*, a magpie\u2014*Cyprinus*, a carp, and *Cyprina*, a mollusk\u2014and many such instances could be cited, are in universal use among biologists at the present day, with no inconvenience resulting therefrom. In reply to Dr. Hinde's second contention, viz., that the *A. punctobrachiata* has never been properly described, the whole of the original description of that species has already been quoted, so that the reader, on this point, can form his own opinion. In the writer's judgment, however, the distinctive characters given by Prof. Williams, though largely negative and unaccompanied with any figures, are yet sufficiently explicit to allow of the recognition of the species, and if this be the case, the laws of nomenclature would seem to require that his name should be adopted.\n\n**Dolatocrinus liratus**, Hall.\n\n*Cucabocrinus liratus*, Hall. 1862.

Sp.)\n\nPlate 12, figs. 3, 3 a, 3 b, and 3 c.\n\nCalyx rather small, sub-hemispherical, much broader than high. \"dorsal cup\" broadly and shallowly basin-shaped but deeply concave in the centre exteriorly: dome moderately elevated, rather distinctly pentalobate as viewed from above, the radial areas being slightly raised and the interradial as slightly depressed.\n\nUnited basals small and forming a funnel-shaped concavity for the reception of the column.\n\nFirst primary radials hexagonal, broader than high and broadest above the middle,\u2014almost completely sunk in the basal concavity. Second primary radials quadrangular, much broader than high, rather smaller than the first and unlike them forming part of the lateral wall of the calyx. Third primary radials pentagonal, much broader than high and a little broader than the second. On the upper sloping sides of each third primary radial, there is a similarly shaped but much smaller pair of secondary radials, or radials of the second order. On its two upper sides each secondary radial to the right bears a pair of still smaller tertiary radials while each one on the left bears a single tertiary radial on its inner and upper side. These three tertiary radials are quadrangular or subquadrangular in outline, but their upper margins are obliquely bevelled off and deeply emarginate in the centre, in such a way as to form articulating bases, or portions of bases, of attachment for the arms. In every ray, therefore, there were originally three arms, two on the right side and one on the left, though the arms themselves do not happen to be preserved in the only specimen known to the writer.\n\nInterradials two: the first rather larger than the first primary radials,\nsubovoid and truncated above, or obscurely nine-sided with the upper side much the broadest, resting against the sides of the second and third primary radials, and about equal in height to both of the latter. Second interradials much smaller than the first, about twice as broad as high, hexagonal (or possibly quadrangular) in outline. Above each of the second interradials there are three plates, the central one pentagonal and broader than high, with a minute and apparently hexagonal plate, which is higher than broad, on each side of it. These three plates are in each case placed between the arm bases of two contiguous rays.\n\nDome plates polygonal, varying in shape and size according to their relative position, some of those in the interradial areas being slightly larger than any of those in the radial. Anal aperture nearly but not quite central.\n\nThe sculpture of the outer surface of the plates of the dorsal cup consists of numerous raised ridges which radiate from a large and prominent tubercle in the centre of each plate. In the radial series the first, second and third primary radials are connected by a continuous ridge, which is broader and more prominent than any of the other radiating ridges in these plates, and this bifurcates, in the centre of each third primary radial, into two branches which diverge outwards and upwards through the secondary radials as far as the commencement of the arm bases below. In the interradial series, a ridge which is also broader and more prominent than the other radiating ridges, commences in the middle of the lower margin of each of the first primary interradials and extends upwards as far as the central tubercle. From this point it bifurcates widely outward and upward until the extremity of each of its branches reaches nearly as far as and almost coalesces with that of the corresponding branch in the nearest secondary radial.\n\nThe outer surface of the dome plates is very minutely granulose and ornamented, with but few exceptions, by minute, low, isolated and rounded tubercles, of which there are from one to six in each plate.\n\nMaximum height of the only specimen known, about thirteen and a half millimetres; greatest breadth of the same, nineteen mm. and a half.\n\nNear Thedford, Rev.

Goodwillie, 1882: a single specimen.\n\nThis species appears to be most nearly related to *Dolatocrinus triadactylus* of Barris, from the Hamilton Formation of Alpena, Michigan.* Mr. Wachsmuth, who has kindly compared the type of *D. Canadensis* with authentic examples of *D. triadactylus*, in a letter to the\n\n---\n\n* Described and figured in the \"Proceedings of the Davenport Academy of Natural Sciences\" for 1885.\nwriter states that the latter \"has the same general form and the same arm formula, but the basals are less deep and have around the column, at a level with the lower plane of the calyx, a prominent rim, and its ornamentation consists of numerous ridges arranged in triangles without tubercles, and these outer ones enclose two smaller triangles.\"\n\nColumns of Dolatocrinus.\n\nPlate 12, figs 4, 4a.\n\nPortions of the column of one or more species of Dolatocrinus were collected by Mr. J. Pettit, in 1868, in the shales of the Hamilton Group of the township of Bosanquet.\n\nThese consist of groups of from two to ten or more joints, which are circular in outline and depressed at the sutures, which are sometimes minutely crenulated. In the centre of each of these groups, and superimposed upon two or three joints, there is a prominent but still rather narrow ring, which at equal distances apart bears three laminar expansions, which are flattened at a right angle to the joints on which they are placed, but in a direction parallel to the axis of the column. These laminar expansions are triangular in outline, in the only specimen in which their margin is unbroken, their bases are as broad as the cluster of joints of the column of which they form a part is high, and they project from it to a distance of as far as six millimetres. The central canal is very large and circular in outline.\n\nMegistocrinus rugosus, Lyon and Casseday.\n\nMegistocrinus rugosus, Lyon and Casseday. 1859. Am. Journ. of Sc. and Arts, Vol. xxviii, p. 243.\n\nNear Thedford, Rev. J. M. Goodwillie, 1882: one specimen, which has been identified with this species by Mr. Charles Wachsmuth.\n\nMegistocrinus, Sp. Indt.\n\nPlate 13, figs. 2, 2a, 2b.\n\nA specimen which Mr. Wachsmuth thinks is probably the central dome plate of a large Megistocrinus, was collected by the Rev. Hector\nCurrie, near Thedford, in 1882. At the same locality and date two other and similar specimens were obtained by Mr. Currie, but the original of figures of 2, 2a and 2b on Plate 13 is the only one that the writer has seen.\n\nIts dimensions are: height, fourteen millimetres; maximum breadth, sixteen mm.; breadth at base, eight.\n\nAs viewed in one direction its outline is somewhat hatchet-shaped with a truncated base, while, as viewed in the opposite direction, its outline is wedge-shaped with the sides slightly convex. The centre of the base is rather deeply excavated and surrounded by a single row of concave and somewhat oblique facets. From one point of view the plate broadens rapidly from the base upwards about as far as the middle, and its upper margin is semicircular, while, from another (at nearly a right angle to the first) it narrows rapidly from below upwards and outwards into a thin and sharp edge.\n\nTo the naked eye the surface of the plate seems smooth, but when examined under a lens the base is seen to be minutely granulose and the sides and edge minutely corrugated in a longitudinal direction, though one of the flattened sides seems to be much less distinctly corrugated than the other.\n\n**Spine of dome of Crinoid.** (Genus and species unknown.)\n\nPlate 13, figs. 3, 3a.\n\nThe curious flask-shaped body represented on Plate 13, which is evidently a spine from the dome of some unknown crinoid, was also collected by the Rev. Hector Currie, at Thedford, in 1882, and presented by him to the Museum of the Survey.\n\nIts apex is unfortunately broken off, but the part which is preserved is fourteen millimetres in length or height. The centre of the base is rather deeply excavated and surrounded by a single row or ring of eight oblique facets, some of which are faintly concave. Immediately above the base the spine is swollen into a rather narrow bulb-like expansion, whose maximum breadth is five millimetres, and above this it narrows gradually, the breadth at the broken summit being about two mm.\n\nWhen viewed under a lens the facets which surround the central excavation of the base are seen to be minutely granulose, and the bulbous part of the spine is ornamented with irregular and longitudinally disposed, but somewhat twisted, thin and flat lamellar ridges, which are more or less broken up into low spines whose apices are directed\nupwards. Above the bulb the surface is minutely and longitudinally corrugated, but near the apex it becomes nearly smooth.\n\nA certain general resemblance which this spine bears to the spines on the dome of *Dorycrinus cornigerus* and *D. Gouldii*, especially in the structure of the base, suggests the idea that it may have formed part of the dome of a crinoid belonging to the family *Actinocrinidae*.\n\n**Ollacrinus spinigerus**, Hall.\n\nPlate 13, figs. 4, 4a and 4b.\n\n*Trematocrinus spinigerus*, Hall. 1862.

It also shows well the ambulacral or arm openings, and the extended arm-like water tubes, which are represented exceptionally in this species, from their base up, by two independent appendages: while in all other known species of this genus the tubes in this as in the other interradii, respectively, are suturally connected for some distance, being only divided at their outer ends.\" \u2014 Wachsmuth.\n\nMessrs. Meek and Worthen with some doubt and Mr. S. A. Miller positively state that this species should be placed in Lyon & Casseday's genus *Goniasteroidocrinus*, rather than in *Ollacrinus*, Cumberland.

Fifteenth Rep. N. York State Cab. Nat. Hist., p. 118, pl. 1, figs. 25 and 26.\n\nA perfect but worn specimen of the root and part of the column of a crinoid which is clearly referable to the genus *Ancyrocrinus* and appa-\nrently to the species named above, has long been in the Museum of the Survey, labelled as having been collected in the township of Bosanquet.\n\nIt is thirty-three millimetres in height from base to summit, thirteen mm. in breadth, as measured from the apices of two lateral processes, and four across the summit. The base is shortly and broadly conical or bluntly pointed as viewed laterally, and distinctly quadrangular, with the sides faintly concave, as viewed endways. In the centre of the base there is a minute circular depression or pit, around which at a distance of about two mm. there is a circular impressed line. The four lateral ascending spinose processes upon which the genus was based, are represented by four low conical protuberances, which are slightly flattened laterally and truncated at their apices in a direction nearly parallel to the main axis of the column. At the summit of each of these truncated protuberances there is a longitudinally oval depression, in the centre of which there seems to be a minute and narrowly linear perforation. Immediately above these processes the ascending column is eight mm. broad and about seven-eighths of an inch long, and from this point it narrows gradually upwards to the summit, which, as already stated, is four mm. in diameter. Throughout its entire length the column appears to be circular, but the specimen is very much worn, and its central canal as seen from above, is distinctly four lobed.\n\nBLASTOIDEA.\n\nPentremitidea filosa. (N. Sp.?)\n\nPlate 14, figs. 1, 1 a, 1 b.\n\nPerhaps the same as Pentremites Whitei, Hall, a description of which may be found on page 150 of the Fifteenth Rep. N. York St. Cab. Nat. Hist.\n\nOf medium size, height about one-fourth greater than the maximum breadth, which latter ranges from a little below the middle of the specimen to the base of the radial sinuses: lateral outline subovate but conical at the base and truncated at the summit: transverse section, in the thickest part, pentagonal in outline with nearly straight sides, which latter, however, are very faintly depressed in the centre, and as faintly convex laterally.\n\nAb-oral side inversely and doubly pyramidal, three-sided at and near the base of the body, but gradually becoming five-sided and pentalobate above; its lower portion rather narrowly conical as viewed sideways, its upper moiety broadening more rapidly upward and\noutward. Oral side not quite three times as high as the ab-oral, of nearly equal thickness for about one-third of its height, then narrowing gradually and convexly upwards from about the middle of the calyx to the summit; peristome narrow and concavely excavated.\n\nBasals reaching rather more than half-way to the bases of the radial sinuses, and together forming a rather shallow cup, which is three-sided below, five-sided above and angularly five-lobed at its upper margin, and whose breadth above is nearly twice its height. Basal plates three, two pentagonal and one quadrangular.\n\nThe \"bodies\" or undivided portions of the radials broaden outwards more rapidly than the basals do, and from this circumstance it follows that an obtuse angle is formed at the junction of the basals with the radials, especially in a line with the ambulacra.\n\nRadials occupying about eleven-thirteenth of the entire height of the calyx, lanceolate in outline, with a truncated base, and rather more than twice as high as broad. The apices of each of the two adjacent radials are united so as to form an acute point, which projects a little above the oro-anal surface. Radial sinuses very deeply cleft, and occupying about nine-tenths of the total height of each radial. The sides bordering the sinuses are elevated and formed into sharp edges, which stand out at right angles above the ambulacra in such a way as to form prominent radial lips, which are somewhat effuse and most raised around the bases of the ambulacra.\n\nAmbulacra linear, rather narrow, increasing in breadth regularly but very slowly upwards, so that they are nearly twice as broad at their summits as at their base, which latter are narrowly rounded. The food groove in the centre of each ambulacrum deepens towards the summit, and is almost obsolete at and near the base, while the outer sides of the ambulacra are depressed in such a way as to form a deep groove on each side next to the radial lips. The whole surface of each ambulacrum, although convex towards the centre, is not prominent, but on the contrary sunk a little below the general level of that of the radials.\n\nThe interradial on the anal side is comparatively large, and plainly visible in a side view, especially when examined with a lens: its outline is rhomboidal, but its apex is narrowly and rather deeply emarginate. The other interradials are extremely small, and not visible at all in a side view, as they are sunk in the oro-anal excavation, and form a narrow rim around the spiracles.\n\nThe posterior spiracle is confluent with the anal aperture. The other spiracles (four in number) are rather large, between crescentic and reniform in outline, rounded on their inner margins, and placed close to the central opening. They are situated within the inter-\nradials, and occupy nearly their whole area, leaving only a very narrow rim exposed. They are equal in size, similar in shape, and partly divided in the centre by an incomplete septum. Central opening pentagonal or obscurely five-lobed, but shallowly and concavely emarginate on the anal side.\n\nSummit plates, hydrospires, pinnules and column unknown.\n\nThe surface ornamentation consists of exceedingly fine concentric lines, which follow the general contour of each plate. These lines are always too minute to be seen without the aid of a lens, but are much coarser and more sharply defined in some specimens than in others.\n\nDimensions of one of the most perfect specimens collected: Height, thirteen millimetres; maximum breadth, nine and a half mm.; height of radial, eleven; breadth of radial, five; depth of sinus of radial, nine and a half.\n\nNear Thedford, Rev. Hector Currie, 1876-82: nine specimens, most of which are perfect, undistorted and remarkably well-preserved.\n\nA provisional name has been given to the specimens described above, because it is almost impossible to decide whether they are or are not identical with the *Pentremites Whitei* of Hall, owing to the very peculiar state of preservation of the latter.\n\nProfessor Hall's types of *P. Whitei* (two of which he has kindly lent to the present writer, for comparison) are all stated to be \"crushed\" so that \"their true form cannot be known.\" One of the specimens forwarded by Professor Hall has the pinnules preserved on all sides, so that the whole of the interradials and summit characters, as well as the upper halves of the radials, are completely hidden from view. In the other, most of the pinnules are preserved, especially on one side. This latter is the only specimen which shews any of the interradials, and in it the writer has failed to find more than one, which appears to be the interradial on the anal side. Moreover, the characters of this supposed solitary interradial on the anal side in one, and those of the lower and exposed half of the body in both of the typical examples of *P. Whitei* that the writer has been able to examine, appear to be essentially similar in all respects to those of the corresponding parts in the Canadian specimens.\n\nBut, on the other hand, Professor Hall distinctly states that the interradials of *P. Whitei* are \"comparatively large and lozenge shaped,\" and if this is true of any of its interradials other than the one on the anal side, then *P. Whitei* must be both generically and specifically distinct from the specimens collected by the Rev. H. Currie. Again, in the original description of *P. Whitei*, the pseudambulacral fields (ambulacra) are said to \"extend a little more than half the length of the body,\" and the pseudambulacral areas (or radial sinuses) to occupy\nabout two-thirds the length of the radials, from which it would seem that the radials in Professor Hall's species are not nearly so deeply cleft as they are in the Canadian specimens.\n\nBy whatever name they may eventually be known, the Thedford specimens now under consideration differ from the genus *Pentremites*, as recently restricted by Etheridge & Carpenter in their \"Catalogue of the Blastoida in the British Museum,\" in the fact that only the inter-radial on the anal side is visible in a side view. In this particular, as well as in the fact that the posterior spiracles are confluent with the anus, they resemble *Troostocrinus* as defined in the monograph just cited, but their base is not long and tapering, and upon the whole they seem to agree best with the characters of *Pentremitidea* as expressed in the same volume.\n\n*Nucleocrinus elegans*, Conrad.\n\nPlate 14, fig. 2.

Hector Currie, 1877-82: five specimens.\n\nThese differ slightly from typical specimens from the State of New York, in being not quite so globose in their contour. Judging from diagrams forwarded by Mr. Wachsmuth there would appear to be some minor differences in the shape and number of the summit plates in examples from the two localities, but as the sutures between these plates are nearly always difficult to define, these supposed differences may be more apparent than real. In each of the Canadian specimens the summit plates are preserved, and these, as represented in the figure on plate 14, appear to be seven in number, viz., one rather large and somewhat eccentric central or sub-central plate, which is partly surrounded by four large and two small proximals. In the New York specimens, the lower portion of the central or sub-central plate is divided transversely by a suture in such a manner as to separate from it an eighth and distinct anal plate, which is pentagonal in outline, and of which suture or plate no trace has yet been detected in the Canadian\n\nSeptember, 1887.\nspecimens. In other species of the genus, however, Mr. Wachsmuth states that some of the sutures of the summit plates are as frequently ankylosed as not, and it may be that this is the case with the suture in question in the few Canadian examples of *N. elegans* that have yet been collected. Further, the outer margin in each of the four large proximals in the New York specimens of *N. elegans* is represented by Professor Hall, as well as by Mr. Wachsmuth, as convex in the middle and concave only at the sides, whereas the outer margin in each of the larger proximals of the Canadian specimens is uniformly though rather shallowly concave. Still, these differences, whether real or apparent, can scarcely be regarded as of specific importance, and Professor R. P. Whitfield, who has kindly compared some of the specimens collected by the Rev. H. Currie with Conrad's type of *N. elegans* now in the American Museum of Natural History in New York city, entertains no doubt as to their identity with that species.\n\nSome of the specimens collected by Mr. Currie are more elongated than others, and it was at one time supposed that the most clongated forms might possibly be referable to *N. lucina*, Hall, but in that species, as shown in an authentic specimen forwarded by Professor Whitfield and as stated by Prof. Hall, the sides are deeply and angularly concave whereas those of *N. elegans* are nearly flat.\n\n**Granatocrinus Leda**, Hall (Sp.)\n\nPlate 14, figs. 3, 3a, 3b, 3c, 3d and 3f.\n\n*Pentremites leda*, Hall. 1862.

Hector Currie, 1878: three perfect and beautiful specimens, two of which are entirely free from distortion.\n\nAll three have been directly compared with two of the types of *Pentremites Leda* kindly forwarded by Professor Hall, which latter, however, are crushed nearly flat laterally and do not shew any of the spiracles. The only appreciable difference that the writer has been able to detect between the Canadian and the New York State specimens, is that in the former the whole surface of each of the inter-radials, all of which are visible in a side view, is distinctly but irregularly corrugated when examined with a lens, while in the latter most of the surface is covered by fine lines which follow the contour of each plate, and by only a few and less distinct corrugations which are often\naltogether absent. This difference, even if constant, which it does not appear to be, is probably not even of varietal importance.\n\nThe species is placed in the genus *Granatocrinus*, rather than in *Pentremitidea* as suggested by Etheridge and Carpenter, mainly on the authority of Mr. Wachsmuth, who informs the writer that it \"is intermediate between *Granatocrinus* and *Pentremitidea*, but nearer the former. It has five circular spiracles, that of the posterior side confluent with the anal aperture; all five deltoid pieces are plainly seen in a side view, and the ambulacra extend to almost the full length of the calyx; the basals slightly projecting.\"\n\nProfessor Whitfield thinks that the *Pentremites Maia* of Hall is only a variety of the present species.\n\n**Codaster Canadensis**, Billings.\n\nPlate 14, Figs. 4 and 4a.\n\n*Codaster Canadensis*, Billings, 1869.

Canadensis* appear to have been collected by Mr. Johnson Pettit in 1868 in the township of Bosanquet, and from the same township, three-quarters of a mile from Thedford, the Rev. Hector Currie has since obtained twelve other specimens, two of unusually large size, in 1882-84, three of which he has kindly forwarded to the writer for examination and study.\n\nAlthough the name suggested by Mr. Billings is here provisionally retained, partly because it is the oldest and partly because it was published in one of the Survey reports, it is quite possible that it may have to be abandoned in favour of the later name given to it by Messrs. Etheridge and Carpenter, on the ground that the former was not accompanied by a recognizable definition of its specific characters.\n\nOn page 92 of a paper entitled \"On the Devonian Fossils of Canada West,\" published in the \"Canadian Journal\" (of Toronto) for May, 1860, in reference to the genus *Cyrtodonta*, Mr. Billings himself writes: \"I have been the first to describe correctly and illustrate this genus under a name that is in no respect inappropriate, and I have a right to retain that name against those which are objectionable or not founded on\nan intelligible generic description.\" The clause italicized (the italics are the present writer's) if applicable to a genus ought to be equally so to a species, and if this be the case, the few remarks published about some of the minute structural peculiarities of *C. Canadensis* can scarcely be regarded as an intelligible specific description.\n\nBut, in spite of Mr. Billings' contention, the majority of American paleontologists seem to have rejected his genus *Cyrtodonta* and to have adopted the earlier name *Cypricardites*, Conrad, notwithstanding the extremely vague and unsatisfactory definition of the characters of the latter, and every naturalist knows that many of the species proposed by such writers as Linn\u00e6us and Lamarck in Europe, and Rafinesque and Conrad in America, are universally accepted to-day although no one pretends that they could be identified from the original description. It is also only proper to add that although the shales of the Hamilton Group of Ontario have been diligently examined by many collectors for the last twenty years, it has yet to be shewn that they have yielded more than one species of *Codaster*, and further, that the types of *C. Canadensis* have for many years been preserved in the Museum of the Survey which is and always has been freely accessible to all.\n\n**Eleutherocrinus Cassedayi**, Shumard and Yandell.\n\nPlate 14, figs. 5, 5a and 5b.\n\n*Eleutherocrinus Cassedayi*, Shumard and Yandell. 1856.

I think the anus has never been described in this genus, it having been taken for a mere break in the plate. Your specimen shows that it is located at the right upper edge of the azygos radial, which is somewhat excavated and constitutes the outer wall of the triangular aperture.\"\nMOLLUSCOIDEA.\n\nBRACHIOPODA.\n\nLINGULA LIGEA, Hall.\n\n*Lingula ligea*, Hall. 1860.

Lateral margins nearly straight and but slightly convex in their central portions, but narrowing gently in a convex curve at and towards each extremity; anterior margin regularly rounded; cardinal slopes slightly convex, diverging forward and outward from the beaks at an angle of about one hundred and twelve degrees, and not at all angular or even subangular at their junction with the lateral margins; beaks small and not very prominent.\n\nSurface polished and glossy, but marked with fine, concentric, raised lines of growth, which are crossed by numerous, closely arranged and almost equally minute radiating raised lines, which extend from the beaks to the anterior margin and are most prominent on and near the latter.\n\nDimensions of the specimen figured: maximum length, fifteen millimetres and a half; greatest breadth, eleven mm.; maximum thickness, two and a half.

Goodwillie, 1882: a few specimens which are referred to this species solely on the authority of Prof. R. P. Whitfield.\n\nAs compared with Professor Hall's description and figures of *P. truncata*, however, these specimens seem to differ materially in their far less convex ventral valves, (which resemble *Leptena* or *Chonetes* in this respect rather than *Productus* or *Productella*, whose umbones are not at all prominent, and neither broadly nor distinctly troncated. It is difficult to see how the specimens from Arkona and Thedford are to be distinguished from some forms of the *Strophalosia productoides* of Murchison, especially from such as are represented on plate 19, figures 15, 16 and 19 of Dr. Davidson's monograph of the British Devonian Brachiopoda.\n\nIn 1882 several good examples of *S. productoides* were collected by Dr. R. Bell from rocks apparently of about the age of the Hamilton Formation on the Athabasca River in the first ten miles below the Clearwater, the most perfect of which is represented, for comparison, on Plate XV. This beautiful fossil was compared by Dr. Davidson with authentic English and European examples of *S. productoides* and pronounced somewhat confidently to be identical therewith (as the writer had previously supposed was the case) in the spring of 1883. In the specimens from Arkona and Thedford the umbones are not so prominent and the so-called pseudo-deltidium not so distinctly marked as in those from the Athabasca, but these apparent differences seem largely attributable to the much greater size of the latter and Davidson's figures show that specimens from various localities in England vary quite as much in both of these characters.\nIt is true that in two of the specimens from Arkona, though apparently not in all, the beak of the ventral valve is very faintly truncated, but DeVerneuil represents the beak of the corresponding valve of the shell which he calls *Productus membranaceus* and which Davidson places in the synonymy of *S. productoides*, as distinctly truncated. Prof. Hall states that \"on the authority of M. de Verneuil, the *Strophomena pustulosa* has been referred to the *Productus (Strophalosia) Murchisonianus* of De Konick,\" or, in other words, that De Verneuil thinks *P. truncata*, Hall, is synonymous with the shell which Davidson calls *S. productoides*, and to the writer it seems that de Verneuil's figures of *Productus membranaceus* would do very well for *P. truncata*. On the other hand, Mr. C. D. Walcott considers that the two shells, i.e., *P. truncata* and *S. productoides*, \"present but very few characters in common.\"\n\n**Chonetes carinata**, Conrad.\n\n*Strophomena carinata*, Conrad. 1842.

The central portion of each valve is quite devoid of ribs, but the whole surface is faintly and concentrically striated, and the ribs on the lateral areas are marked with exceedingly minute and closely arranged radiating lines.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: maximum length, thirty-eight millimetres; greatest breadth, forty-five mm.; approximate thickness through the closed valves, eighteen; height of hinge area in the ventral valve, twelve; breadth of pseudo-deltidium of the same, at its base, eleven.\n\nBanks of the Thames River, Moraviantown, Rev.

In this region there are indications of faint spiral grooves with low rounded spiral ridges between them, and these are crossed by prominent, distant and very distinct transverse plications.\n\nMaximum height of the only specimen collected, allowing for the nucleus, two inches and a quarter; maximum breadth, also two inches and a quarter; height of spire, near the aperture, not quite one inch.\n\nTownship of Bosanquet, Mr. J.

On some Fossils from the Triassic Rocks of British Columbia.\n\nIn 1875, numerous well-preserved specimens of a fossil shell which was identified by the writer with the *Monotis subcircularis* of Gabb, a characteristic species of the Upper Trias of California, were collected by Dr. Selwyn on the Peace River, in latitude 56\u00b0 10' and longitude 122\u00b0 10'.\n\nIn 1877, specimens of the same species were obtained by Mr. J. Hunter on the Upper Pine River, in latitude 55\u00b0 30' and longitude 122\u00b0; while an obscure fossil, which was doubtfully referred also to *Monotis subcircularis*, was collected by Dr. G. M. Dawson on the Whipsaw Creek, at the head-waters of the Similkameen River. During the same year, limestones supposed to be of Triassic origin, on account of the occurrence in them of a *Terebratula* like *T. Humboldtensis*, Gabb, and of a few scattered joints of a species of *Pentacrinites* similar to those of the Nevada Trias which Professors Hall and Whitfield doubtfully referred to the *P. asteriscus* of Meek, were observed by Dr. Dawson at McDonald's River on Nicola Lake. These limestones form part of a group of rocks mostly of volcanic origin, for which the name of the \"Nicola Series\" was suggested.\n\nIn 1878, rocks holding fossils which are believed to be Triassic, were discovered by Dr. Dawson at several localities in the central and southern portions of the Queen Charlotte Islands, viz., at Crescent Inlet on Moresby Island, on the south shores of Skidegate and Houston Stewart Channels, on the north coast of Kun-ga Island, and at Section Cove at the north end of Burnaby Island; also on the north-west coast of Vancouver Island, at Browning Creek in Forward Inlet, Quatsino Sound, and in Forward Inlet near Observatory Rock. In the same year Mr. J. W. McKay gave to Dr. Dawson some pieces of shale from Glenora on the Stikine River, which hold imperfect valves of a species of *Halobia*. These specimens are of interest as coming from the most northerly locality in the province, and indeed on the continent of North America, from which Triassic fossils have yet been obtained.\n\nWhile engaged in a special geological exploration of the northern\npart of Vancouver Island and adjacent coasts, in 1885, fossils apparently of Triassic age were collected by Dr. Dawson at Robson Island, and on the east side of Winter Harbour in Forward Inlet, at Alexander Harbour on Galiano Island, in a bay five miles and a half west of Cape Commerell, and on Hernando Island in the Strait of Georgia. Finally, a series of fossils, which are probably also of Triassic age and which are remarkably well-preserved, was obtained by Mr. R. G. McConnell, in 1887, on the Liard River, about twenty-five and thirty miles below Devil's Portage, or, approximately in latitude $59^\\circ 16'$, and longitude $125^\\circ 35'$.\n\nThe stratigraphical relations of the rocks from which the fossils here reported on were obtained, will be found described in the Reports of the Survey for each of the years in which the fossils were collected.\n\nAll the specimens collected at these localities are in the Museum of the Survey, and the collection of the Triassic fossils of British Columbia now contained therein consists of three species of brachiopoda, five of lamellibranchiata, one of gasteropoda and eight of cephalopoda, besides the undeterminable fragments of *Pentacrinites* already referred to. Of these, only four (viz., *Terebratula Humboldtensis*, *Monotis subcircularis*, *Halobia Lommeli* and *Arcestes Gabbi,* ) can be identified with previously described species, the rest being apparently new to science.\n\nThe present paper will consist of a systematic list of the whole of the species at present in the Museum of the Survey from the formation and province indicated in its title, with descriptions and figures of those that are believed to be new. For critical and valuable suggestions in regard to some of the latter, and for the description of a supposed new genus of cephalopoda, the writer is indebted to Professor Alpheus Hyatt.\n\n**BRACHIOPODA.**\n\n*Spiriferina borealis.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 17, fig. 1.\n\nShell transversely subelliptical, broadly rounded in front and obtusely subangular in the middle behind, a little broader than long, and broadest at the midlength: cardinal angles rounded: surface of the valves marked with angular and rather coarse radiating plications.\n\nVentral valve moderately convex, most prominent on each of the outer boundaries of the angular and well-defined mesial sinus, which is\nnarrow on and near the beak, but which widens rapidly towards the front margin, its maximum width being not much less than one-half the greatest breadth of the whole valve. Umbo broad, curved and slightly depressed, but projecting considerably above the general level of the hinge line; beak incurved and slightly decurved; area concavely arcuate, broadly triangular in outline and nearly three times as broad as high; pseudo-deltidium rather narrowly triangular and apparently a little higher than broad. Surface marked with five well-defined, angular, radiating plications on each side of the mesial sinus and with one in the sinus.\n\nDorsal valve also moderately convex, its mesial fold elevated and somewhat narrower than, but in other respects corresponding to, the sinus in the opposite valve. Umbo narrower and very much less elevated than that of the ventral valve, its beak lightly incurved. Surface marked with two well-defined and angular radiating plications on the mesial fold, and with four similar ones on each side. In addition to the radiating folds, the surface of each valve is marked with numerous and for the most part rather closely disposed lines of growth.\n\nCharacters of the interior of the valves unknown.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: maximum length, twenty-nine millimetres; greatest breadth, thirty-three mm. and a half; maximum thickness through the closed valves, twenty-one mm.; greatest breadth of the mesial sinus of the ventral valve, fourteen mm.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, August, 1887: one perfect but somewhat distorted and abnormally developed specimen.\n\nOn the right-hand side the two radiating plications next to the outer boundary of the mesial sinus in the ventral valve and the one next to the fold in the dorsal, bifurcate distinctly at about their midlength, whereas on the left-hand side all the plications are clearly simple and undivided throughout their entire length.\n\n**Terebratula Humboldtensis**, Gabb.\n\n*Terebratula Humboldtensis*, Gabb. 1864.

Sp.)\n\nPlate 17, figs. 2, 2 a, 2 b and 2 c.\n\nShell rather below the medium size, varying in outline from somewhat narrowly ovate to almost circular, but always a little longer than broad, moderately convex, the thickness through the closed valves varying from a little less to slightly more than one-half the maximum length, the broad specimens being proportionately flatter than the narrow ones.\n\nVentral valve longer and more convex than the dorsal, its umbo somewhat elevated but obtuse and distinctly recurved at its apex, which latter is obliquely truncated in such a way that the produced inner margin of the foramen overhangs and partially overlaps the small and sunken deltidium. Foramen complete but apparently lightly channeled and rather spout-like in front, nearly circular in outline but a little longer than wide. Front margin with two low, narrow, rounded folds, which are separated by a shallow and equally narrow mesial sinus, and which gradually become obsolete and disappear before reaching the midlength. On the outer side of each of these folds there is a correspondingly shallow but somewhat broader depression.\n\nDorsal valve very gently convex, its umbonal region obliquely depressed and its beak small and scarcely projecting above the highest level of the hinge margin. Front margin with one central fold and two lateral folds, which are low, rounded and separated by two shallow depressions which do not extend quite as far back as those on the ventral valve do. When examined with a lens, a faintly impressed line, which probably indicates the existence of a raised mesial septum within, may be seen to extend longitudinally from the umbo nearly half way to the front margin, along the centre of the exterior of the valve.\n\nSurface nearly smooth and marked only with a few rather distant lines of growth. Characters of the interior of the valve unknown.\n\nDimensions of one of the largest specimens of the narrow variety: maximum length, nineteen millimetres; greatest breadth, fourteen mm.; maximum thickness, ten mm. In the largest specimen collected of the broad variety, the corresponding measurements are: length, nineteen millimetres; breadth, seventeen mm.; thickness, nine mm.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, also about thirty miles below the same portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887. At the locality first mentioned, a small piece of limestone was obtained, containing five specimens of this species in situ; while at the second\nseven well-preserved casts of the interior of both valves, with a little of the inner layer of the test remaining, were collected. Three of the latter are evidently casts of adult shells in which the double fold on the front margin is fully developed, while the remaining four are as obviously immature.\n\nThis species seems to differ from *T. Humboldtensis* in its distinctly biplicated front margin, which is not at all truncated. Accurate drawings of two of the best specimens collected by Mr. McConnell have been kindly compared by Dr. C. A. White with Professors Hall and Whitfield's types of *T. Humboldtensis* and with Gabb's figures of his type specimens. The double fold at the front in the present species is regarded by Dr. White as a probably good distinguishing character, and he thinks that the drawings sent indicate a proportionately shorter and more robust shell than *T. Humboldtensis*. He adds, also, that the specimens of Hall and Whitfield and the figures of Gabb show that in *T. Humboldtensis* \"there is a very shallow median sulcus, or a mere median flattening of the dorsal valve at the front, with which that part of the ventral valve coincides. This gives the seeming truncation of the front to which they refer.\"\n\nThe indications of a rather long mesial septum in the dorsal valve of *T. Liardensis* are suggestive of the idea that when the characters of the interior of both valves are better known, the shell may have to be referred to the genus *Waldheimia*.\n\n**MOLLUSCA.**\n\n**LAMELLIBRANCHIATA.**\n\n**Monotis subcircularis**, Gabb.\n\nPlate 17, figs. 3 and 3 a.\n\n*Monotis subcircularis*, Gabb. 1864.

Dawson, 1878.\n\nThe specimens, though characteristic and easily recognisable, are for the most part imperfect, except those from the locality first mentioned. Among these latter there are several nearly perfect and well-preserved right valves, two of which are represented on Plate 17, as only the left valve of *M. subcircularis* has been figured by Mr. Gabb.\n\nThe specimens from British Columbia are as often obliquely subovate and longitudinally elongated as subcircular in outline, but the \"rounded upper end of the anterior margin,\" which Mr. Gabb states is the \"most obvious difference between his species and *M. salinaria*,\" appears to be a constant character of the former.\n\nIn his memoir on the Arctic Trias Fauna, Mojsisovics expresses the opinion that *M. subcircularis* belongs to the genus *Pseudomonotis* of Beyrich, and that it is probably identical with *P. ochotica*. The specimens of *M. subcircularis* collected by Dr. Selwyn on the Peace River certainly bear a very close resemblance, both in general form and in sculpture, to some of Mojsisovics' figures of *P. ochotica*, but in these figures both valves and more especially the right valves are represented as provided with a minute and spine-like anterior auricle the existence of which is not satisfactorily shewn in any of the Canadian specimens.\n\n**Monotis ovalis. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 17, fig. 4.\n\nLeft valve (the only one known) compressed, but moderately tumid in the umbonal region. General outline rather broadly subelliptical but slightly inequilateral: height about one-fourth greater than the length: cardinal margin very short.\n\nAnterior side a little shorter than the posterior, its margin much less convex and nearly straight and vertical or slightly sinuous above the middle: posterior margin regularly and broadly rounded: pallial border also regularly but narrowly rounded. Superior border sloping obliquely, convexly and rapidly downward behind the beak, higher and nearly straight for a short distance immediately in front thereof: anterior cardinal angle less broadly rounded off than the posterior:\nbeak small, depressed, incurved and subcentral, but placed a little in advance of the middle.\n\nSurface marked by flat, radiating ribs, which broaden outwards rather rapidly in the central portion of the valve. At and near their outer termination, the central ribs are distinctly broader than the spaces between them. The whole of the ribs are invariably simple and entire, but occasionally, though very rarely, a single and very narrow rib is intercalated between two of the broader costa. Characters of the interior of the valves unknown.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: maximum length, sixteen millimetres; greatest height of the same, twenty-one mm.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887: a perfect and well-preserved left valve.\n\nThis species seems to be well characterized by its broadly elliptical form and flattened radiating ribs. It is apparently most nearly related to the Monotis boreas of Oberg,* from the Trias of Spitzbergen (which Mojsisovics says is a Pseudomonotis) and to the Pseudomonotis scutiformis of Teller\u2020, from the Trias of Eastern Siberia, but both of these species are nearly circular in marginal outline and ornamented with a sculpture quite different from that of M. ovalis.\n\nHalobia (Daonella) Lommeli, Wissman.\n\nHalobia Lomnacti, Wissman.\u20141841.

Lommelli* of European authors.\n\nSmall slabs of limestone, covered with numerous valves of a *Halobia* which may possibly represent an extreme local variety of this species, were collected by Dr. Dawson in 1878 at Section Cove, north end of Barnaby Island, Q.C.I., and in 1885 in a bay five miles west of Cape Commerell, at the north end of Vancouver Island. The specimens from these two last mentioned localities differ from those from Houston Stewart Channel in having much finer radiating ribs, which, however, are flattened and broader than the fine linear grooves between them,\u2014and in the circumstance that the beaks are usually, though not always, placed much farther forward. As already remarked (on page 127), similar specimens were collected by Mr. J. W. McKay at Glenora on the Stikine River.\n\n**HALOBIA OCCIDENTALIS.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 17, figs. 5 and 6.\n\nLeft valve (the only one that has been recognized with any certainty) rather strongly convex, especially in the umbonal region: slightly inequilateral and a little higher than long: marginal outline subovate, somewhat pointed below, broadest a little above the middle, but truncated distinctly and transversely at the hinge line above. Posterior margin broadly rounded: anterior side a little shorter than the posterior, the upper half of its margin nearly straight, vertical, and at length forming a nearly rectangular junction with the cardinal border above: pallial border narrowly rounded or obtusely pointed a little in advance of the midlength. Cardinal border straight, very little shorter than the maximum length of the valve: posterior cardinal angle rounded off, the anterior subangular: beak moderately prominent, appressed and placed a little in front of the middle.\n\nSurface marked by numerous thread-like, radiating raised lines, which are narrower and often very much narrower than the spaces between them, especially on the lower half of the posterior side of the shell. Characters of the interior of both valves unknown.\n\nDimensions of the type specimen: maximum length, twenty-two millimetres; greatest height, twenty-five mm.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887: one perfect and well-preserved cast of the interior of a left valve.\n\nAt the same locality and date two other specimens were collected,\nboth of which are probably referable to the present species. The first of these (fig. 6) is a small piece of rock, upon one of whose surfaces a well-preserved cast of the interior of the basal portion of a left valve and a similar cast of a right valve, with the anterior margin broken off, are exposed to view. In this specimen the right valve is conspicuously flatter than the left, and the height of both is obviously greater than their maximum length. The second, which is most likely only a transversely elongated form of the species, is a nearly perfect but not very well-preserved cast of the interior of the left valve. This differs from the type specimen in being much more distinctly inequilateral, in being a little longer than high, in its more broadly rounded pallial border, and in the circumstance that its anterior cardinal angle is more rounded. Should the whole of these specimens prove to belong to the same species, the original diagnosis of the characters of the latter will, of course, have to be considerably modified, but in the meantime it is thought most prudent to select the most perfect example collected as the type, and to describe it first without reference to any of the others.\n\n**Trigonodus (?) productus. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 17, figs. 7, 7a and 7 b.\n\nShell small and slightly compressed at the sides, the maximum thickness through the closed valves being a little less than their greatest height, very inequilateral, longer than high and narrowly subovate in marginal outline, valves closed all round, not gaping at either extremity. Anterior side short and regularly rounded at its margin; posterior side much longer and narrowing gradually to a point which is more or less obtuse in different specimens, some of which are more elongated and more narrowly pointed behind than others; ventral margin gently convex, most prominent in or a little in advance of the middle, rounding upwards rather abruptly in front and somewhat straighter behind; superior border sloping gradually downward behind the beaks and very rapidly so in front of them; umbones broad and projecting very little, if at all, above the highest level of the cardinal border; beaks small, depressed, curved inward, downward and forward, and placed near the anterior end; escutcheon or ligamental area (?) lanceolate and tolerably well-defined; lunule none.\n\nSurface marked by numerous concentric and impressed lines of growth, most of which are not visible without the use of a lens. Test apparently thin. Characters of the interior of both valves unknown.\n\nDimensions of one of the specimens figured (a right valve): maxi-\nmum length, eight millimetres; greatest height, five mm.; of the other (a left valve)\u2014length, seven millimetres; height, five mm.\n\nLiard River, about thirty miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887: five detached left valves, one right valve and a small but nearly perfect cast of the interior of both valves.\n\nThis little shell is only provisionally and very doubtfully referred to the genus *Trigonodus* of Sandberger, on account of a certain general resemblance which it bears, both in shape and surface markings, to the *T. Sandbergeri* of Alberti, from the Trias of W\u00fcrttemburg.\n\nIn the entire absence of any knowledge of the hinge dentition, muscular impressions or pallial line of the specimens collected by Mr. McConnell, it is not only doubtful to what genus or family but even to what order they should be referred. On first studying them, the writer was struck with their similarity in external characters to the *Nucula elongata* of Oberg, from the Trias of Spitzbergen, and Professor Hyatt, who has since examined two of the most perfect ones, thinks that they bear a similar resemblance to two or three species of *Nucula* from the European Trias, described by Klipstein, M\u00fcnster and Wissman. But, so far as the writer has been able to observe, there are no indications or traces of the peculiar, comb-like, interlocking teeth of *Nucula* in any of the specimens from the Liard River, and there are some reasons for supposing that in the latter the ligament was external. If the present species should prove to be a *Nucula* rather than a *Trigonodus*, then, in accordance with the known relations of the animal to its shell in living representatives of the former genus, the shorter side of the two would be the posterior, and vice versa, and the beaks would point backwards.\n\n**GASTEROPODA.**\n\n*Margarita triassica.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 17, figs. 8 and 8 a.\n\nShell small, globosely turbinate and about as broad as high: whorls four, increasing rapidly in size, the latter ones ventricose but flattened next to the suture above: spire apparently a little shorter than the outer whorl, which latter is depressed in the centre below and rather narrowly umbilicated, the umbilicus being somewhat deep, with a broadly rounded margin and about one-third the diameter of the base: suture distinct and nearly rectangular: aperture nearly circular but\napparently somewhat pointed above and a little sinuous on the columellar side: outer lip thin and simple.\n\nAs viewed in its dorsal aspect the last whorl of the spire is seen to be encircled by three rather distant raised lines or minute spiral ridges, one of which is placed on the shoulder above, one in the middle and one close to the suture below. The outer whorl bears four rather distant spiral, raised lines on its upper half, and below these there are a number of others which are finer and much more closely disposed. When examined with a lens, the whole of this spiral sculpture is seen to be crossed and overlaid by densely crowded and exceedingly minute raised striae. Test extremely thin.\n\nAs the apex is broken off in each of the few specimens collected, it is not practicable to give the exact proportionate dimensions of any.\n\nLiard River, about thirty miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887: four casts of the interior of the shell, in two of which portions of the test are well preserved.\n\nIt is possible that this shell may not be a true *Margarita*, but it seems to be more closely allied to the *M. spiralis* of M\u00fcnster, from the Trias of St. Cassian, as figured by Zittel, than to any other genus known to the writer. Professor Hyatt, who has examined two of the best specimens collected by Mr. McConnell, thinks that they resemble the *Turbo Johannis Austriae* of Klipstein (figured in Stoppani's \"les P\u00e9trifications d'Esino,\" pl. 14, fig. 16), but that \"they are not quite so elevated, their whorls are flatter above and their spiral ridges better marked.\" It is, however, quite evident that they cannot be referred to the genus *Turbo* as now restricted, and it is most likely that their affinities are rather with the Trochidae than the Turbinidae.\n\n**CEPHALOPODA.**\n\n**Nautilus Liardensis.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 18, figs. 1 and 1 a.\n\nShell broad, subglobose, but deeply though rather narrowly umbilicated: maximum breadth of the aperture about equal to the entire length, as measured from the centre of the outer lip to a corresponding point on the periphery of the opposite side. Volutions very closely embracing, the inner ones almost completely covered, the outer one increasing rapidly in size, but expanding much more rapidly in a lateral than in a dorso-ventral direction: periphery somewhat\nflattened, but probably abnormally so; sides and umbilical margin both rounded, the latter not at all angular; aperture a little more than twice as broad as high, transversely subreniform, or transversely and broadly elliptical but shallowly emarginate in the centre of the base by the encroachment of the preceding volution.\n\nSepta somewhat closely approximated, their average distance apart on the periphery, where their margins are nearly straight, being about six millimetres. Position of the siphuncle unknown.\n\nSurface apparently almost smooth, and marked only by transverse stri\u00e6 of growth.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: maximum length, fifty-seven millimetres; maximum breadth at the aperture, where the shell is broadest, fifty-eight mm.; height of aperture in the centre, twenty-seven mm.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887: a slightly distorted cast of the interior of the shell, with small portions of the test preserved, but with the greater portion of the chamber of habitation broken off. The number of septa whose margins are visible in this specimen is twenty-one, and the portion of the body chamber that remains is about three-quarters of an inch in length.\n\nThis shell appears to bear such a close resemblance to the *Nautilus Sibyll\u00e6* of Mojsisovics,* from the Trias of Spitzbergen, in almost every respect, that it may possibly prove to be only a local variety of that species. Still, in the figures of *N. Sibyll\u00e6* the umbilical margin is represented as rather distinctly angular, whereas that of *N. Liardensis* is very regularly rounded.\n\n**Popanoceras McConnelli. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 18, figs. 2, 2 a, b, and 3, 3 a.\n\n**Typical Form.** (Figs. 2 and 2 a, b.) Shell globosely sublenticular, but always a little depressed in the umbilical region: greatest thickness or breadth varying in different specimens from a little more to a little less than half of the maximum diameter: umbilicus well defined and rather deep, with steep sides, but very narrow and rather less than one-eighth of the maximum diameter, in adult specimens. At a very early stage of growth, however, the umbilicus is much wider proportionately. Thus,\n\n---\n\n* Arktische Triasaufam (Mem. l'Ac. Imp. des Sciences de St. P\u00e9tersbourg, Ser. VII, Vol. 33, No. 6), p. 100, pl. 16, fig. 2.\nin a specimen whose maximum diameter is fourteen millimetres, the umbilicus is about six mm. in width and the inner volutions are partly exposed. In adult specimens the outer volution is so closely embracing that the whole of the inner whorls are covered. Sides of the outer volution narrowing rapidly and convexly from the umbilical margin to the periphery, which latter is somewhat obtusely but very distinctly angulated. Aperture very narrow in a dorso-ventral direction, angular above, widening rapidly and convexly to the base, which is deeply and broadly emarginated by the encroachment of the preceding volution. If measured in the centre, where the emargination is deepest, the height of the aperture is not more than one-half of its maximum length, but if measured outside of the emargination its height is a little greater than its breadth.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, marked only by rather distant but somewhat irregularly disposed and very indistinct spiral striations, which are crossed by almost equally indistinct and very slightly elevated transverse plications. The faint revolving striae are most strongly marked on the outer half of the sides and become obsolete near the umbilical margin, while the low, transverse plications or wrinkles are usually, though not always, nearly straight and widen outwards towards the periphery, over which they do not pass.\n\nSutural line consisting of six simple saddles on each side of the siphonal saddle, and of six simple lobes on each side of the siphonal lobe. The apex of the very small siphonal saddle has a minute notch in the centre, but all the other saddles are quite entire at their margins. The siphonal saddle is less than half the height of the first and second lateral saddles, which are larger than the rest and about equal in size to each other and to the corresponding lobes, while the third, fourth, fifth and sixth lateral saddles are all very small and much shorter than the first or second. All the lobes are minutely incised at their margins. The siphonal lobe, which is rather deeply emarginated in the centre by the small siphonal saddle, is broader but not quite so high as the first lateral lobe, which latter is a little higher than the second. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth lateral lobes are all very small and much shorter than the second.\n\nThe septa are closely approximated, and as the sutural lines of only two or three contiguous septa are visible in specimens in which a not inconsiderable portion of the outer lip is broken off, it seems clear that when perfect the chamber of habitation must have been large and that it must have occupied fully the whole of the outer volution.\n\nDimensions of the largest undistorted specimen collected: maximum diameter, fifty-one millimetres; greatest breadth or thickness, twenty-seven mm. and a half; width of umbilicus, six mm. In a\n\nDecember, 1888.\nlarger but slightly distorted specimen, the maximum diameter is not quite seventy mm.\n\n*Variety lenticulare.* (Figs. 3 and 3 a.) Shell sublenticular, but always a little depressed in the umbilical region: greatest breadth or thickness equal to one-third of the maximum diameter: umbilicus very narrow and indistinctly defined, in some specimens almost closed: periphery acutely angulated: aperture much narrower laterally than in the typical form.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, marked only with fine radiating stri\u00e6, which are doubly flexuous on each of the sides and produced into a series of obtuse, beak-like projections which arch forwards on the periphery.\n\nSutural line apparently similar to that of the typical form.\n\nDimensions of the largest specimen of this variety known to the writer: maximum diameter, sixty millimetres; greatest breadth of the same, twenty mm.\n\nIt is only proper to add that the typical and convex form and the flattened variety *lenticulare* are connected by numerous intermediate gradations both in form and sculpture.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, also about thirty miles below the same portage, R. G. McCounell, 1887. At the first mentioned locality five specimens were collected, of various sizes, most of which belong to the typical and convex form of the species. At the second locality indicated, seventeen specimens were collected of all sizes, varying from eight to about sixty millimetres in their greatest diameter. Eight of these have a maximum diameter of more than an inch and a half, and of these four belong to the typical form and four to the variety *lenticulare*.\n\nThe genus *Popanoceras* was first proposed and its characters defined by Professor Hyatt, in 1884, in the twenty-second volume of the Proceedings of the Boston Natural History Society, on page 337. The types of the genus are there stated to be the *Goniatites Kingianus*, *G. Koninckianus* and *G. Soboleskyanus* of Murchison, De Verneuil and Keyserling, from the Dyas (or Permian formation) of Russia. In 1886, on pages 67-72 and plates 14 and 15 of his \"Arktische Triasfau- nen,\" Mojsisovics described and figured four named* and two unnamed additional species from the Upper Trias of Spitzbergen. The present species, which the writer has much pleasure in associating with the name of its discoverer, may be readily distinguished from the whole of these previously characterized forms by its much larger size and more especially by its more or less convexly sublenticular form and very distinctly angulated periphery.\n\n*P.

I.\n\nThe foregoing name is suggested provisionally for a remarkably sculptured shell, of which two rather large fragments, which Professor Hyatt thinks are \"probably specimens of *Acrochordiceras*,\" were collected by Dr. Dawson in 1878 at Houston Stewart Channel, Q.C.I.\n\nThe larger of these two fragments is a piece of the outer volution about twenty-seven millimetres high in its dorso-ventral diameter, about thirty-five mm. in length from the posterior to the anterior termination and twelve mm. in thickness near the periphery.\n\nThe outer volution seems to have been strongly compressed at the sides, the umbilicus appears to have been narrow and in both specimens the periphery or abdominal region is distinctly flattened. At and near the posterior termination of each of these fragments, the ribs or pilae are frequently bifurcating and in one instance bidichotomous, but in their anterior halves the ribs are broken up into numerous, short and simple, transversely elongated tubercles.\n\nThese specimens, Professor Hyatt writes, \"are interesting in so far as they exhibit a style of sculpturing which is different from that of any Triassic form I have ever seen either upon a specimen or figured. They both at an earlier stage evidently had divided pilae, but these at the stage of growth represented in both these fragments have begun to be resolved into numerous, short and elongated, interrupted folds. The style of this makes the larger of the two fragments a close copy\nof some Scaphites of the Cretaceous. Even the large and extremely aged specimens of Acrochordiceras figured by Mojsisovics retain the entire trachyceran pila, and in part the tubercles or at least indications of them. It is very evident that in this species a marked change takes place either upon the transient living chambers of the adults or upon the latter part of the last whorls in extreme age. It is evident, also, that the changes proceeded from the umbilical shoulders outward, and that the continuous pila probably entirely disappeared within a short space. I did not succeed in cleaning the abdomen satisfactorily and therefore cannot say positively that the pila or ribs cross it as in Acrochordiceras. The species is certainly new, so far as I can judge.\"\n\n**Trachyceras Canadense. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 18, figs. 4 and 4a.\n\nShell compressed at the sides and a little the thickest around the umbilical margin; periphery or abdominal region broad and flattened, but rounded at its junction with the sides and encircled in the centre by a deep, narrow groove or abdominal channel. Volutions rather strongly involute, the umbilicus occupying about one-fourth of the entire diameter; maximum breadth of the outer whorl a little less than its dorso-ventral diameter as measured from the umbilical margin to the outer boundary of the abdominal channel; umbilical margin distinct and subangular; inner wall of the umbilicus steep.\n\nSurface of the outer volution marked by transverse ribs which are ornamented by rows of closely arranged tubercles. On the inner half of each side the ribs are nearly straight or but slightly flexuous, but on the outer half they curve concavely forwards in such a way as to form a series of obtusely pointed or narrowly rounded linguiform processes on the periphery, in the centre of which, however, they are invariably cut through by the narrow abdominal channel. Many of the ribs bifurcate from a tubercle placed on the umbilical margin, and these bifurcating ribs, which extend outward to the abdominal channel, usually alternate with one or two simple ribs of similar length. On the outer half of each side, one or both of the branches of these bifurcating ribs occasionally divides again, and in other cases a short rib, which itself bifurcates near or upon the abdominal region, is intercalated between the two branches. In one instance, also, a short, bifurcating rib alternates with a similar but much longer one. On each side of the peripheral or abdominal groove the longer ribs, whether simple or bifurcating, bear transversely elongated tubercles,\none of which is placed on the umbilical margin, six next to it, one at the junction of the side with the periphery, and one, which appears to be divided into two points, next to the abdominal groove.\n\nThe sutural line consists of three lateral saddles on each side of the siphonal saddle, and of two principal lateral lobes, besides a third and minute lobe, which is partly sunk in the umbilical cavity, on each side of the siphonal lobe. The margins of all the saddles are rounded and entire, but those of the lobes appear to be minutely incised. The siphonal saddle is much smaller than any of the rest; the first and second lateral saddles are nearly equal in size and a little larger than the third. The siphonal lobe, whose summit is shallowly emarginate in the centre by the small siphonal saddle, is a little larger than the first lateral lobe, and it again is slightly larger than the second lateral.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: greatest diameter, fifty millimetres; maximum breadth or thickness, twenty mm.; greatest breadth of umbilicus, thirteen mm.\n\nLiard River, about twenty-five miles below Devil's Portage, R. G. McConnell, 1887: one tolerably well preserved and nearly perfect cast of the interior of the shell.\n\nAccording to Professor Hyatt, this specimen belongs to the group of the *Trachycerata margaritosa* of Mojsisovics. \"It is closely allied to *Trachyceras Aon*, Mojs. (Ceph. der Med. Triaspr., p. 133, pl. 21, figs. 1-38), but differs therefrom in the number of rows of closely arranged tubercles, in its broad abdomen and the division of the spines of the abdomen into two points. It is like *P. ludinum*, Mojs. (Ib., pl. 14, fig. 2), but has more rows of tubercles, and these smaller; also like *T. Judicarium*, Mojs. (Ib., pl. 14, fig. 3), but is more involute. It is also like *T. longobardicum* (Ib., pl. 19, fig. 4), but is different in the sutures and has smaller ribs and tubercles.\"\n\nIn the writer's judgment the specimen now under consideration appears to be still more closely related to the Nevada fossil which has been referred to *T. Judicarium* in the fourth volume of the United States Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, on the authority of Professor Hyatt, who, however, now doubts the correctness of this identification, as will be seen from the following extract from a letter of his to the present writer, dated March 20th, 1888:\u2014\"At the time that I wrote the note for Meek in Geol. Expl. 40th Parallel, vol. iv, p. 118, I was disposed to give greater latitude to specific characters than I am now. I should not, I think, now consider the shell there described as *T. Judicarium*. If Meek's figures are at all correct, the nodes and pile (ribs) are distinct, as are also the involution and channel. Your specimen, if I remember rightly, differed from Meek's in having very much finer pil\u00e6 (ribs), many rows of closely set tubercles,\nand the tubercles on the abdomen had two points so closely set as to look like parts of one big tubercle, or as if they had originated from some such division of a large tubercle.\"\n\n**Arniotites, Hyatt. (Gen. nov.)**\n\n(=Balatonites arietiformes, Mojsisovics.)\n\nShell discoidal, whorls moderately numerous, strongly compressed at the sides, everywhere in close contact, but very slightly embracing, so that the umbilicus is wide and open and almost the whole of the inner volutions is exposed to view; periphery simply carinated, \"keel single, smooth, with slight linear channels on either side, or none, according to the species;\" surface of the outer whorls simply costate. \"The pil\u00e6 (ribs) arise from folds and are smooth, perfectly developed, straight on the sides, bending forward at the genicule, which are sometimes noticeably prominent. The sutural line has not been seen, but, judging by analogy, the lobes were probably dentate and the saddles smooth.\"\n\nIn reference to this genus Prof. Hyatt writes as follows: \"The careful examination of the specimens collected by Dr. Dawson convinced me of what I had long suspected, that the genus Balatonites of Mojsisovics contains three distinct genera. This eminent authority had, in fact, himself clearly seen and distinguished three groups, but did not consider them to be of generic rank. The shells of Balatonites arietiformes, Mojsis. (Ceph. der Mediterr. Triaspr.) have complete pil\u00e6 without tubercules, and entire keels in the young, and the latter are only very slightly, if at all, ridged in adults. I propose for this group the name of Arniotites, in allusion to the close resemblance of the shells to the Arnioceras of the Liass, a fact first noticed by Mojsisovics.\n\nThe type of Mojsisovic's genus is Balatonites Balatonicus (V. 1, kurse Uebers d. Amm.\u2014Gattun. d. Mediterr. u. juvav. Trias; Verh. d. k. k. Reichsan., 1870, No. 7, p. 139). This belongs to the second group, the Balatonites gemmati. These shells have heavily tuberculated pil\u00e6, a line of tubercles replaces the keel and they resemble Trachyceras in general aspect. The sutures are similar to those of Arniotites, the lobes being dentated and the saddles smooth.\n\nMojsisovics' third group, the Balatonites acuti, is the most distinct of the three. The shells have sutures with smooth lobes and saddles, true keels are not present, but the abdomens are exceedingly acute in some species. In the few species known, the whorls are much compressed and the mode of growth discoidal\u2014the whole presenting a\nvery unusual combination of characteristics. I propose for this group the name Dorikranites (from \u0399\u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2, spear-headed), the type being Dorikranites Bogdoanus (=Balatonites Bogdoanus, Mojsis., Ceph. der Triaspr., p. 87, pl. 80, figs. 1-4), and the following were described by Mojsisovics under the name of Balatonites, Dorikranites rossicum and D. acutum.\n\nThe young of Arniotites has a thin keel, and this, together with the form of the whorls and pilae, shows that the more discoidal and stouter shells of Celtites are larval or radical forms as compared with Arniotites, and are probably the near allies of this series. In Arniotites the earliest whorls are often smooth, compressed, and are probably rounded as well as keel-less on the abdomen.* The shell during this stage must have closely resembled the adult of Dinarites Mohamedanus, Mojsisovics (Mediterr. Triaspr., p. 7, pl. 40), and more remotely Ceratites Sturi (ibid, p. 44, pl. 39), both of these being forms belonging to the direct line or stock of Ammonoid radicals which terminated in the Lias with Psiloceras planorbis. Among Balatonitidae, Arniotites, with its smooth young, evidently bore precisely similar relations to those stock radicals of the Trias that Arnioceras, among the Arietidae, bore to the stock radical, Psiloceras, in the Lias. Arniotites Vancouverensis, Whiteaves, does not approximate closely to any species described by Mojsisovics. The pilae are straighter, the forward bend is hardly perceptible, the whorls are narrower, and the young smooth for a more prolonged period of the growth. These characters have all been exaggerated by compression, but this cannot account for the whole of the observable differences. This species is, of course, the type of the genus, and the small specimen from Crescent Inlet shews the characters best. The following species are described and figured by Mojsisovics in his great work (Ceph. der Mediterr. Triaspr.) under the name Balatonites; Arniotites euryomphalus, A. arietiformis, A. prezzanus, A. stradanus and A. Meneghini.\n\n* \"It is quite common for species of Ammonoids to be rounded and keel-less on the abdomen, during the smooth stage, until the shell is of considerable size, and they are invariably so during the earlier part of the smooth stage. The slight crenulations of the keel, described by Mojsisovics in Balatonites arietiformes, are probably not constant in all the species and I have not considered them as of generic importance.\"\nARNIOTITES VANCOUVERENSIS.\n\nPlate 19, fig. 2.\n\n*Celtites (?) Vancouverensis*, Whiteaves.\u20141887. Dawson, Rep. Geol. Exam. N. pt. Vanc. Isld. and adj. coasts, in Ann. Rep. Geol. Surv. Can. for 1886, p. 110 B.\n\nShell small, discoidal, whorls about four in number, compressed and very gently convex at the sides, slender, increasing slowly in size and very slightly embracing, so that the whole of the sides of the inner ones is exposed to view: umbilicus wide and shallow: outer volution distinctly keeled at the periphery, the keel apparently single, entire and with a faint linear channel on each side. Surface of the first and second volution, and the inner half of the third volution apparently smooth, that of the outer half of the third and of the whole of the fourth distinctly ribbed; the ribs being simple, transverse, generally straight, broadening outward and interrupted on the keeled periphery of the outer volution.\n\nSutural line unknown.\n\nIn a supplement to Dr. Dawson's report, which was written more than a year before the present paper was printed, the name *Celtites (?) Vancouverensis* was suggested provisionally for a number of specimens collected from the Triassic rocks at three localities in the Queen Charlotte Islands, at five or near the north or north-west coast of Vancouver Island, and at Hernandez Island, in the Strait of Georgia. With the exception of a few crushed fragments, the specimens from each of these localities are mere natural moulds or impressions in shale of the exterior of one side (or of a portion of one side) only of each shell, in which not a vestige of any part of the sutural line could be detected.\n\nSince the original diagnosis of *C. Vancouverensis* was written, some of the most perfect specimens from most of these localities have been examined by Professor Hyatt, who is inclined to think that nearly all of them are not referable to *Celtites*, but to a new genus which is here described under the name *Arniottites*, that they may possibly be separable into two or perhaps three species, and that it is not quite certain even that they all belong to the same genus. He suggests, also, that the small specimen represented on plate 19, figure 2, be regarded as the type of the genus *Arniottites* and of the species *A. Vancouverensis*, and it is in accordance with this suggestion that the description of both has been prepared for the present paper. Professor Hyatt thinks that the most salient characters of the species as now restricted are \"the smooth character of the young shell as shown in the umbilicus, the\nsimple keel bordered on each side by a faint linear channel, and the abruptly terminating ribs on the outer volutions.\"\n\nThe type of *Arniotites Vancouverensis* as here defined was collected by Dr. Dawson in 1878, at Crescent Inlet, Moresby Island, Q. C. I., and six imperfect specimens, which are believed by the present writer to be referable to the same species, were obtained by Dr. Dawson in the same year at Forward Inlet, on the north-west coast of Vancouver Island, near Observatory Rock.\n\n**Arniotites. (Species uncertain.)**\n\nPlate 19, fig. 3.\n\n*Celtites (?) Vancouverensis*, Whiteaves. (Pars.) 1887. Op. cit., p. 110 B.\n\nSix natural moulds of the exterior of one side of each shell of a species of *Arniotites* and two small and crushed fragments of casts of the interior of the test were collected by Dr. Dawson in 1885, at Robson Island, in Forward Inlet. These were supposed by the present writer to represent merely an advanced stage of growth of the preceding species. Professor Hyatt, however, who has examined the most perfect specimen from this locality, the one figured on plate 19, is of the opinion that its \"whorls are proportionately broader, in an abdomino-dorsal direction, than those of *A. Vancouverensis*, that the pilae of the former are more numerous and not so coarse and fold-like, and that they begin to be developed earlier, the young being smooth for a much shorter time than those of *A. Vancouverensis*.\" To the writer the pilae of the typical *A. Vancouverensis* seem finer and closer together than those of the specimens from Robson Island.\n\n**Arniotites or Celtites. (Species uncertain.)**\n\nPlate 19, fig. 4.\n\nThe large specimen from Forward Inlet, figured on plate 19, Professor Hyatt thinks may be \"either an *Arniotites* or a *Celtites*. The numerous, narrow-sided, compressed whorls, entire keel, crowded pilae (ribs) and discoidal form are very similar, possibly identical, with those of *Celtites Epolenensis*, Mojsisovics, figured from smaller specimens in Mediter. Triaspr., pl. 29, 38. The last part of the last whorl in the specimen collected by Dr. Dawson is curiously distorted by\npressure, and the side assumes an aspect like *Arniotites*, not possessed by the earlier stages, which are not distorted. As noted by Mojsisovics, *Arniotites* and *Cellites* are undoubtedly very closely allied in some of their species, but the typical forms seem to be generically separable.\"\n\n**Badiotites Carlottensis. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 19, fig. 5.\n\nShell small, strongly compressed at the side, periphery sharp but not distinctly keeled; whorls increasing rapidly in breadth in the dorso-ventral direction. Surface of the outer volution marked by crowded, regularly disposed and nearly equidistant, minute and falcate rib-like folds, which curve concavely forwards on each of the sides and which are apparently not interrupted on the periphery. Sutural line unknown.\n\nSouth side of Houston Stewart Channel, Queen Charlotte Islands, nearly opposite Rose Harbour, G. M. Dawson, 1878: one small and very much distorted specimen, the maximum diameter of which is twelve millimetres or about half an inch.\n\nThe type and only specimen collected is so much distorted by obliquely lateral pressure that its outer volution looks much more strongly embracing than it probably was in its normal condition, and its umbilicus is made to assume an abnormally narrow appearance.\n\nFor the elucidation of the generic relations of this shell the writer is indebted to Professor Hyatt, who writes as follows in regard to it: \"It is much larger than the only other known species of this genus, the *Badiotites Eryx* of Mojsisovics (Ceph. der Mediterr. Triaspr., p. 31). After considerable trouble and some rather hazardous work, I succeeded in splitting off a part of the otherwise indeterminable shell, cleaned a part of the whorl, and traced the well-known pile of *Badiotites* running continuously across the abdomen of the much compressed and acute whorl. The extreme flatness, of course, may be in a measure accounted for by pressure, but the agreement in aspect of the whorls and the continuity of the pile leave hardly any room for doubting that it is a form of *Badiotites*. It is much larger than *B. Eryx*, and probably new.\"\nAulacoceras Carlottense, Whiteaves.\n\nPlate 19, fig. 6.\n\n*Aulacoceras Carlottense*, Whiteaves.\u20141887. Dawson, Rep. Geol. Exam. N. part Vanc. I., &c.; in Ann. Rep. Geol. Surv. Can. for 1886, p. 109 B.\n\nGuard elongated, in the more perfect though smaller of the only two specimens collected, which may therefore be regarded as the type of the species, narrowly conical and increasing very slowly in thickness from the acutely pointed posterior end, whose apex is slightly eccentric; in the larger but less perfect example comparatively thick, somewhat fusiform and bluntly pointed posteriorly, with the apex distinctly eccentric. Alveolus and phragmocone unknown. Outer surface marked by close-set, rounded, longitudinal ribs, which are separated from each other by narrow but deep linear furrows.\n\nIn 1878 six badly preserved specimens of the guards of one or more species of Belemnites were collected by Dr. G. M. Dawson at Houston Stewart Channel, in the Queen Charlotte Islands. Of these, the two described above are both longitudinally ribbed on the outside and apparently belong to the genus *Aulacoceras* of Hauer. The smaller of the two is a natural longitudinal section of the guard, about two inches in length and not quite half an inch broad at the thickest end, while the larger, which is only a badly preserved natural mould or impression of one side of a large specimen of the guard with part of the test preserved at the posterior end, but which shows clearly one of the lateral grooves as well as several of the longitudinal ribs that are said to be characteristic of the genus, is nearly five inches in length and fully an inch and a half broad in the thickest part. Of the other four specimens two are mere fragments which cannot be determined either generically or specifically, one being a very slender guard about two inches and a half long and not quite a quarter of an inch broad at the thicker end, whose surface markings are not preserved, while the other is a piece of the posterior or pointed end of the guard of a small individual, about an inch and a quarter long and a quarter of an inch broad at the thicker end, whose surface appears to be perfectly smooth.\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO CANADIAN PAL\u00c6ONTOLOGY.\n\nVOLUME I.\n\nBY J.

G. McConnell, 1888. Extremely abundant at most of these localities.\n\nThe specimens from each of these localities are undoubtedly conspecific with the *Aucella Piochii* of Gabb from the Shasta Group of California, and with the fossils from the Cretaceous rocks of Alaska which Dr. C. A. White regards as a variety of the *A. concentrica* of Fischer. In the *Lethaea Rossica*, however, Eichwald has expressed the opinion that *A. concentrica* is not specifically distinct from the *A. Mosquensis* of von Buch, and the writer has long been convinced that *A. Piochii* also is only an inconstant varietal form of *A. Mosquensis*. The names *A. concentrica* and *A. Piochii* have been given with the view of distinguishing comparatively broad specimens whose valves are almost equally convex, from the typical *A. Mosquensis*, which is narrowly elongated and whose right valve is flatter than the left, but a study of some three or four hundred *Aucellae* from various localities in British Columbia has led to the conclusion that the most dissimilar examples are connected by every kind of intermediate gradation. A careful comparison of Dr. White's illustrations of the Alaskan fossils which he refers to *A. concentrica* with Eichwald's figures of specimens of *A. Mosquensis* from Alaska and the Aleutian Islands, will be sufficient to show how difficult if not impracticable it is to discriminate between these nominal species.\n\nBy some writers the *Aucella*-bearing deposits of Russia have been regarded as of Jurassic age, and by others as of Cretaceous. D'Orbigny refers them to his \"\u00e9tage Oxfordien,\" Trautschold and Rudolph Ludwig to the Tithonic system of Oppel, and Eichwald to the Upper Neocomian. Ever since 1875, the year in which *Aucellae* were first discovered in British Columbia, the present writer has been convinced that the rocks in which they are the prevalent fossil, in that province as well as in California, are of Cretaceous age. In the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1882, the opinion was expressed that these rocks are probably of the horizon of the Upper Neocomian. At the time that this paper was written, not more than eight species in a sufficiently perfect state for identification or description had been found associated with the *Aucellae* in British Columbia, and of these, only two (viz., *Ancyloceras Remondi* and *Syncylonema Meekiana*), besides the *Aucella*, were recognized as occurring also in the \"Lower Shales and Sandstones, or Subdivision C\" of the Cretaceous rocks of the\nQueen Charlotte Islands.* The more recent collections made by Dr. Dawson from the Aucella-bearing rocks of British Columbia, and reported on in the present paper, shew that ten fairly recognizable species are associated with the Aucell\u00e6 in that province, and that of these, two, (viz., *Astarte Carlottensis* and *Yoldia arata*), besides the two already mentioned, or, counting the *Aucella*, five out of the entire eleven are common to these deposits and to Subdivision C of the Cretaceous rocks of the Queen Charlotte Islands. Moreover, the fragment of an Ammonitoid shell to which the name *Olcostephanus Quatsinoensis* was given, in the paper to which reference has been made, proves to be a portion of a small Scaphite, closely allied to the *S. \u00e6qualis* of Sowerby, from the English Upper Greensand, and the *Photadomya Vancouverensis* described and figured in the same paper is possibly only a form of the *Pleuromya Carlottensis* from the Queen Charlotte Islands, in a peculiar and unusual state of preservation. The present writer has long entertained the opinion that the \"Lower Shales\" (C) of the Queen Charlotte Islands Cretaceous are the homotaxial but by no means necessarily the contemporaneous equivalents of the Gault of England and Europe, and it now seems most probable that the rocks in British Columbia in which Aucell\u00e6 are the prevalent fossils, are of the same age as the deposits first mentioned rather than a little older.\n\nWhen the acute inflection of the anterior margin of the right valve immediately under the beak, is not apparent, as is often the case, it is very easy to mistake an *Aucella* for a small species of *Inoceramus*, and if, as Eichwald suggests and as the figures and descriptions would seem to imply, the *Inoceramus Coquandianus* of d'Orbigny, which is described and figured in the \"Pal\u00e9ontologie Fran\u00e7aise\" and the \"Pal\u00e9ontologie Suisse,\" be identical with one of the varietal forms of *Aucella Mosquensis*, then in Europe also Aucell\u00e6 would rank among the characteristic fossils of the Gault.\n\n---\n\n* In this connection it may be well to quote the scheme of classification of the Cretaceous rocks of these islands which was published by Dr. Dawson in 1880 and based upon stratigraphical and lithological grounds, though, as has been elsewhere stated, it does not seem practicable to separate subdivisions C, D, and E on purely palaeontological considerations.\n\nSubdivisions of the Cretaceous Formation in the Queen Charlotte Islands, in descending order.\n\n| Division                  | Thickness |\n|---------------------------|-----------|\n| A.

The inner margin of the valves below and at the sides is simple in some specimens and distinctly crenulated in others.\n\nIn a large specimen with nearly circular outline the maximum length and height are both thirty millimetres; in a transversely elongated specimen, the length is twenty-six mm., and the height twenty.\n\nEast side of Alliford Bay, Moresby Island, Q.C.I.; four large and beautifully preserved specimens with the test preserved, and a few fragments: south side of Alliford Bay; abundant in the condition of small but perfect casts: east end of Maud Island, in Skidegate Channel, Q.C.I., five small samples with the test preserved: all collected by G. M. Dawson in 1878.\n\nThe three or four imperfect and badly preserved casts from the felsites of the Iltasyouco River, B.C., which were provisionally identified with the *A. ventricosa* of Meek on page 155 of the Report of Pro-\ngress of the Geological Survey of Canada for 1876-77, most probably belong to the present species.\n\nSome imperfect valves of an *Astarte* collected by Dr. Dawson in 1885, on the east side of Winter Harbour, Forward Inlet, Vancouver Island, can also be scarcely distinguished from *A. Carlottensis*.\n\nThis species belongs to a typical and persistent section of the genus *Astarte*, which has ranged from the Liassic period up to the present time with very little variation in form or surface markings, and which is consequently very difficult to separate into well defined species. It agrees so well with the description and figures of *A. Packardi*, White, that it was at one time somewhat confidently identified with that species, but as Dr. White, who has examined some of the most perfect specimens from the Queen Charlotte Islands, thinks that it is most probably distinct therefrom, it seems necessary to distinguish it by a new specific name.\n\n**Opis Vancouverensis**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Opis Vancouverensis*, Whiteaves. 1879.

II, for 1886, page 113 b.\n\nShell strongly compressed at the sides, periphery rather sharply angulated but not distinctly keeled; outer whorl very closely embracing, umbilicus rather narrow, a little less than one fourth of the greatest\ndiameter, aperture narrowly sagittate, its base deeply emarginate by the encroachment of the preceding volution.\n\nSurface of the sides of the outer whorl marked by broad and rather distant, radiating, bifurcating and doubly flexuous raised plications, which commence at the umbilical margin, curve at first gently forward, then as gently backward, and are finally bent very abruptly forward next to the periphery, upon which they form narrow, elongated and acute tongue-like processes. In addition to these plications the surface is marked by fine, simple and comparatively close set, radiating, raised lines, which are also doubly flexuous on each side. These raised lines are most strongly marked on the outer half of the sides, and are as well defined on the summits of the plications as in the smaller spaces between them. Septation unknown.\n\nK-uk River, coast of British Columbia, G. M. Dawson, 1885: one tolerably well preserved but somewhat imperfect cast of the interior of the shell, whose greatest diameter is a little less than five inches.\n\nThis species seems to be most nearly related to the *Ammonites bicurvatus* of Michelin, from the Gault of France, as figured by d'Orbigny on Plate 64, figs. 3 and 4 (but not figs. 1 and 2 of the same plate, which, according to Pictet, represent *A. Cleon*, d'Orb.) of the Atlas to the first volume of the Pal\u00e9ontologie Fran\u00e7aise, Terrains Cr\u00e9tac\u00e9s. It seems, however, to differ from *A. bicurvatus*, which Zittel places in Meek's genus *Placenticeras*, not only in its much greater size, but also in the presence of numerous, closely arranged and doubly flexuous raised lines, in addition to the doubly flexuous radiating plications or rib-like folds which are common to both.\n\n**Placenticeras Perezianum.**\n\n*Ammonites Perezianus*, Whiteaves. 1876.

McConnell, 1887: two specimens, which though a little larger, seem to be precisely similar in all other respects to the type of *A. Perezianus* from the Queen Charlotte Islands. In one of the specimens from the Liard River nearly the whole of the sutural line is well preserved, but the exact shape of the siphonal saddle cannot be ascertained, though it was evidently very small. The first, second, third and fourth lateral saddles, which diminish gradually in size towards the umbilicus, are variously but unequally branched and incised, and are succeeded in the umbilical region by four or five small unbranched saddles with incised margins. The siphonal lobe is moderately large and is divided at the summit into two equal parts by\nthe small siphonal saddle. The first lateral lobe is much larger than any of the rest and is rather deeply and unequally divided a little on one side of the centre by a small offset of the first lateral saddle. All the lobes are incised at their margins, but the siphonal and first lateral lobes are the only ones that are branched.\n\nIn 1876, the writer, who had not then seen a copy of Dr. Neumayr's paper on the Ammonites of the Chalk Formation,* expressed the opinion that the type of the present species belongs to the group of the Clypeiformes and that it might prove to be an Oppelia allied to the O. Waageni of Zittel.\n\nA subsequent study of other specimens from the Queen Charlotte Islands, in 1884, induced the writer to refer the species to Haploceras, on account of its supposed affinities with the Ammonites Cleon of d'Orbigny and A. bicurvatus of Michelin, both of which were placed by Dr. Neumayr in that genus. But, in his Manuel de Conchyliologie, published at intervals between 1880 and 1887, Dr. Paul Fischer states that the genus Haploceras, which he regards as a synonym of Lissoceras, Bayle, corresponds to the group Ligati, and places the whole of the Clypeiformes in Meek's genus Sphenodiscus.\n\nIn the second volume of the \"Handbuch der Palaeontologie\" (1881-85), Zittel re-defines and slightly extends the characters of Meek's genus Placenticeras so as to make it embrace the whole of the Clypeiformes and among the representative species cites the Ammonites bicurvatus of the \"Terrains Cretac\u00e9s,\" which, Pictet says, includes A. Cleon. He (Zittel) restricts the use of the generic term Haploceras so as to make it include a few Jurassic and two Neocomian species, and constitutes a new genus, which he calls Desmoceras, for the reception of the Ligati.\n\nThe present species, no doubt, bears a very close resemblance to Desmoceras Beudanti in the general shape of its shell, and in its sutural line, but differs therefrom in the total absence of the distant, periodic arrests of growth which are generally held to be characteristic of the Ligati. Hence it would seem that the former species can no longer be satisfactorily referred to Haploceras, or even to Desmoceras, but that it belongs to an aberrant section of the Clypeiformes, in which the periphery or abdominal region is more or less narrowly rounded rather than thin and sharp.\n\nBy Dr. Fischer the Clypeiformes, as a whole, are included in Sphenodiscus and by Zittel in Placenticeras. But, if the specimens of the present species collected by Messrs. Richardson and McConnell\n\n*Uber Kreideammonitidae. Aus dem LXXI Bande der Sitzb. der K. Akad. der Wissensch., 1 Abth. Mai-Heft, Jahrg. 1875.\nbe carefully compared with Meek's original diagnosis of these two genera, it will be found that they differ materially from *Sphenodiscus* in having their outer lateral lobes and saddles distinctly branched, as well as in the much greater obtuseness of their periphery, and from *Placenticeras* proper, in the circumstance that their narrowly rounded periphery is neither truncated nor \"provided with a row of compressed alternating nodes around each margin.\" Still, under all the circumstances of the case, the course that seems open to the fewest objections is to follow Zittel and to refer the species, for the present at least, to *Placenticeras*.\n\n**Placenticeras (Perezianum? var.) Liardense.**\n\nPlate 20, figs. 1 and 2.\n\nLiard River, near Old Fort Halkett, R. G. McConnell, 1887: four other specimens of an Ammonite, which may possibly represent a local variety of *P. Perezianum*. They were found in flattened lenticular masses which have been split open in such a way as to expose one side only of each shell, and two out of the four are mere fragments. The characters of the periphery cannot be ascertained in either, the sides are crushed nearly flat and the sutural line is not visible, but the surface markings and the size and shape of the umbilicus are clearly shown in all.\n\nSo far as it can be made out, the general contour of each of these four specimens appears to have been essentially the same as that of the type of the species, but their sculpture is of a much more decided character, and consists of well defined, slightly flexuous, rounded and transverse, rib-like folds, which widen rapidly outward towards the periphery and are entirely devoid of tubercles. At an early stage of growth these folds are simple, and alternately long and short, but in the larger specimens, most of the longer folds bifurcate near the middle of the sides, and a shorter fold, which becomes obsolete before reaching the umbilical margin, is usually intercalated between each pair of the longer ones.\n\n**Scaphites Quatsinoensis.**\n\nPlate 21, fig. 2.\n\n*Olcostephanus Quatsinoensis*, Whiteaves. 1882.

Dawson, 1885: two well preserved and nearly perfect but not quite adult specimens and a few fragments.\n\nThese show clearly that the species is not an *Olcostephanus* of the type of *O. bidichotomus*, as was at first supposed, but a finely-ribbed small Scaphite, very nearly related to the *Scaphites aequalis* of Sowerby. Its ribs too are not invariably bidichotomous, for in some of the specimens collected in 1885 they trifurcate, while in others, in closely contiguous portions of the same specimen, they are bidichotomous, trifurcate, or simple with shorter ones intercalated between, though they are apparently never tuberculated nor nodose.\n\nThe type of *O. Quatsinoensis* is a well preserved but very imperfect and immature specimen collected by Dr. Dawson in 1878 at Browning Creek, Forward Inlet, where it is associated with an abundance of *Aucella Mosquensis*, var. *concentrica*.\n\nB. FROM THE NORTH WEST TERRITORY.\n\n(1.) From Rink Rapids, on the Lewes River, a tributary of the Yukon, in latitude 60\u00b0 20' and longitude 136\u00b0 30'; collected by Dr. G. M.

Anterior side short and rounded: posterior side longer and somewhat obliquely subtruncated at its extremity: ventral margin longitudinally semiovate, rounding upward rapidly in front and straighter behind: superior border sloping downward very gently behind the beaks and descending abruptly and concavely in front of them: beaks broad, prominent, appressed, placed in advance of the mid-length, and curved obliquely forward: posterior umbonal slopes sometimes distinctly angulated, but, as this character is seen in only one specimen, it may be the result of distortion.\n\nSurface marked by concentric lines of growth. Hinge dentition and muscular impressions unknown, though the pallial line appears to have been entire.\n\nDimensions of one of the most perfect specimens collected: maximum length, thirteen millimetres; greatest height, twelve mm.\n\nOne somewhat crushed left valve, with the whole of the test preserved, two perfect and well preserved casts of the interior of the same valve and three similar casts of the right valve.\n\nThis species is rather variable in shape, and seems to be most nearly allied to the Cyprina Marcousana of de Loriol, from the Middle Neocomian of Switzerland.\n\nCEPHALOPODA.\n\nSchloenbachia borealis.

Volutions about five in number, increasing rather rapidly in size, but more rapidly in a dorso-ventral than in a lateral direction, not very closely embracing, nearly the whole of the sides of the inner ones being exposed: umbilicus, as measured from suture to suture, occupying about one-third of the entire diameter, and nearly equal in width to the height of the aperture just outside of its emargination. Aperture narrowly subelliptical, higher than broad, pointed above and very shallowly emarginated below by the slight encroachment of the preceding volution.\n\nOn the outer volution, each of the sides is ornamented by doubly flexuous, transverse and rib-like raised plications, which are interrupted by or do not pass over the prominent keel on the periphery, and which are entirely devoid of tubercles. Most of these plications extend completely across the sides, and some of them bifurcate or even trifurcate at about their mid-length, but near the keel a short fold is occasionally intercalated between two of the longer plications.\n\nThe characters of the sutural line are not satisfactorily exhibited in any of the specimens collected. In a small cast of the interior of the shell, whose longest diameter is about three-quarters of an inch, three lobes and as many saddles can, it is true, be counted on one side of the siphonal saddle, but the whole of the exposed surface of this cast is so much worn that nearly all the finer incisions and ramifications of the sutures are obliterated.\n\nDimensions of the largest and most perfect specimen obtained; greatest diameter sixty-two millimetres: width of umbilicus, as measured from suture to suture, twenty-three mm.: height of aperture, inclusive of keel, twenty-two mm.\n\nIn addition to the specimen whose dimensions have just been given, six much smaller examples, and several impressions or fragments of others, were collected.\n\nThis shell is certainly very closely related to the Schloenbachia propinqua, from the \"Lower Sandstones or Division E\" of the Cretaceous rocks of the Queen Charlotte Islands, and may prove to be only a local variety of that species. Judging by the rather scanty material at present available for comparison, the present form appears to differ from the typical S. propinqua in having more slender whorls (in a dorso-ventral direction) and a consequently wider umbilicus,\u2014in its more distinctly doubly flexuous folds, and in the greater prominence of its abdominal keel. S. borealis seems also to be very nearly allied to the Schloenbachia cultrata (the Ammonites cultratus of d'Orbigny) of the French Neocomian, and to differ therefrom in almost exactly the same way as it does from S. propinqua.\nThe *Aptychus* or portion of an *Aptychus* represented on Plate 21, (fig. 6) was found in the same beds as the *S. borealis*, and may have belonged to that species. It is longitudinally semiovate in outline, and its outer surface is marked only with rather closely disposed concentric raised lines.\n\n**CRUSTACEA.**\n\n**PHYLLOPODA.**\n\n**ESTHERIA BELLULA.** (N. Sp.)\n\n(Plate 21, figs. 7 and 7a.)\n\nCarapace valves compressed at the sides, but regularly though moderately convex (so that a transverse section of both when closed would be ovately and narrowly lenticular in outline), inequilateral, a little longer than high and varying in outline in different specimens from obliquely subovate to longitudinally semiovate. Anterior end always shorter and generally narrower than the posterior.\n\nThe most perfect specimen collected, which is figured on Plate 21, fig. 7, and which may be regarded as the type of the species, is obliquely subovate in marginal outline. Its anterior and posterior ends are both rounded, as are also both of its cardinal angles, and its dorsal margin is comparatively short, though more than half the entire length. In one of the longitudinally semiovate examples (fig. 7a) the anterior end is angular at its junction with the dorsal margin above, and much narrower than the posterior end, which latter is rounded both above and below; while in another, the marginal outline is not far from semicircular, the dorsal border or hinge line extends nearly the whole length of the valves, and is angular at both ends. Umbones small, depressed, contiguous and placed near the anterior end, but not quite terminal.\n\nSurface marked by from thirteen to eighteen closely and rather regularly disposed concentric ridges, which are rounded and not very prominent, although distinctly defined.\n\nDimensions of one of the most perfect specimens collected: maximum length, seven millimetres; greatest height, five.\n\nOne perfect and well preserved cast of the interior of a pair of valves which had become widely spread out, a few similar but not quite so well preserved casts of detached valves, and a single cast of the exterior of a left valve.\nAs no portion of the thin test is preserved on any of these specimens, it is of course by no means certain that they are really the valves of phyllopod crustaceans. Still, in spite of the circumstance that the other organisms with which they are associated seem to indicate purely marine rather than fresh water or brackish conditions, these little fossils appear to the writer to bear a much closer resemblance to some of the species described and figured by Professor T. Rupert Jones in his \"Monograph on the Fossil Estheriae,\" published by the Palaeontographical Society, than they do to any lamellibranchiate bivalve.\n\nThe few fossils collected by Dr. Dawson at this particular locality on the Lewes River are, perhaps, not altogether sufficient to indicate the exact position which the rocks from which they were collected occupy in the Cretaceous System. The genera *Discina* and *Estheria* have such an extensive range in time that they afford no definite information on this point. The most characteristic fossil, apparently, which has yet been found in these rocks, is the *Schloenbachia* which has just been described under the name *S. borealis*. This species appears to be very nearly related to the *S. propinqua* of the lowest division yet recognized of the Cretaceous rocks in the Queen Charlotte Islands. As will be seen farther on, it occurs also in the Rocky Mountains near Devil's Lake, in deposits which hold several other species of fossils which were first described from specimens collected in the Lower Shales and Sandstones, or Subdivision C of the Queen Charlotte Island Cretaceous. So far as it goes, therefore, the paleontological evidence would seem to show that these rocks on the Lewes River represent as low a horizon in the Cretaceous system as has yet been definitely recognized in Canada.\n\n(2.) From the Rocky Mountains three miles north of the east end of Devil's Lake; collected by R. G. McConnell in 1887.\n\nProbably from the same geological horizon as the Lower Shales and Sandstones of the Queen Charlotte Island Cretaceous.\n\n**BRACHIOPODA.**\n\n*Terebratula robusta.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 22, figs. 1, 1 a, 1 b and 2.\n\nShell large, rather strongly convex, the maximum thickness through the closed valves being very little less than their greatest breadth marginal outline ovately subelliptical, the length being nearly one third greater than the breadth, and the greatest breadth a little in\nadvance of the midlength; front margin subtruncated in the centre; posterior extremity bluntly pointed.\n\nVentral valve rather more convex than the dorsal; the umbo of the former moderately prominent, its beak incurved and slightly decurved as well as somewhat obliquely truncated; deltidium very small as the central portion of the anterior margin of the truncated beak of the ventral valve almost touches the beak of the dorsal; foramen rather large and apparently complete. In an end view the front margin of the ventral valve is seen to be sinuated, the sinus being very shallow and indistinctly defined, but moderately broad and nearly straight in the centre. At a short distance from the front margin the mesial fold and sinus become obsolete.\n\nDorsal valve smaller as well as less convex than the ventral, its beak small and depressed, and its front margin provided with a shallow mesial fold which fits into the corresponding sinus of the opposite valve.\n\nThe foregoing description is applicable only to the adult shell. In immature specimens the marginal outline is very nearly circular, the length and breadth are almost equal, and the shallow fold and sinus of the front margin of the valves are not developed.\n\nThe surface markings are very imperfectly preserved, but the exterior appears to have been nearly smooth, and marked only by concentric lines of growth and by minute and crowded radiating striae.\n\nThe markings on the interior of the valves are also very imperfectly preserved. In a cast of a dorsal valve there is a longitudinal median groove less than half the entire length, which probably represents the septum. In the same cast the posterior adductor appears to have been long, narrow, pointed at both ends, and more convex on its inner margin than externally, while the anterior adductor, though also long, narrow and pointed posteriorly, is narrowly rounded and somewhat dilated in front.\n\nDimensions of an average adult specimen: maximum length, seventy-one millimetres; greatest breadth, forty-eight mm. and a half; thickness through the closed valves, forty-two mm.\n\nSeventeen more or less perfect casts of the interior of the closed valves were collected, some of which have portions of the test adherent thereto.\n\nTwo specimens of a *Terebratula* collected by Mr. James Richardson in 1872 from the \"Lower Shales and Sandstones\" of Skidegate Inlet in the Queen Charlotte Islands, appear to be immature individuals of this species.\nOstrea Skidegatensis, Whiteaves.\n\n*Ostrea Skidegatensis*, Whiteaves. 1884.

Beaks moderately prominent, anterior, terminal, the posterior umbonal slope forming nearly a right angle with the anterior. Ears and cardinal area unknown. The only portion of the test that happens to be preserved in either of the two specimens collected, is a small piece round the anal margin of the less perfect of the two. On this part of the shell the surface ornamentation appears to consist of very fine and delicate radiating striae or impressed lines, which are much narrower than the flattened spaces between them, and of concentric lines of growth.\n\nDimensions of the most perfect specimen collected: greatest length, forty-one millimetres; maximum breadth of the same, fifty-seven mm.

The following is a description of the specimens collected by Mr. McConnell, as they appear to the writer.\n\nShell rather large, very inequilateral: left valve compressed but somewhat tumid in the umbonal region, at least in some specimens; right valve nearly flat; marginal outline of the valves, apart from the two wings, obliquely and broadly semiovate, the maximum length very slightly exceeding the greatest height. Anterior side very short and broadly rounded; posterior side produced and much longer, as well as more narrowly rounded at its termination, than the anterior; pallial border convex; hinge line apparently straight both behind and in front of the beaks; anterior wing small and triangular; posterior wing apparently short and extending to less than half the distance from the beak to the farthest termination of the valve behind (at least in the most perfect left valve collected) but much longer proportionately in the most perfect right valve, its posterior margin concavely excavated; beaks small, scarcely projecting above the highest level of the hinge line, and placed considerably in advance of the midlength.\n\nThe surface markings of the largest and most perfect of the left valves collected consist of seventeen narrow but prominent, distant and simple radiating ribs, and these are separated from each other by broad flattened spaces which bear still narrower and much less prominent radiating raised lines. The principal ribs seem to have projected beyond the outer margin of the valve as short free spines, and between each pair, on and around the said margin, from five to six radiating raised lines can be counted.\n\nThe right valve is marked only by numerous fine radiating ribs, which are much smaller than the large ones in the opposite valve, as well as nearly equal in size and placed comparatively close together.\n\nHinge dentition and muscular impressions of both valves unknown.\n\nMaximum length of the largest specimen collected (a left valve) sixty-eight millimetres; greatest height of the same sixty-one mm.\nTwo well preserved moulds of the exterior of the left valve, one nearly perfect and both shewing the surface markings well; three casts of the interior of the same valve, and three imperfect right valves.\n\nIt is not improbable that specimens of an *Oxytoma* from Subdivisions C. and E. of the Cretaceous rocks of the Queen Charlotte Islands, which the writer referred to the *O. mucronata* of Meek and Hayden (on pages 238 and 251 of the first volume of Canadian \"Mesozoic Fossils\") may prove to be immature individuals of the present species.\n\n**Inoceramus.**\n\nThree casts of the interior of detached valves of shells which obviously belong to this genus, but which are far too imperfect and too badly preserved to be determined specifically. They seem, however, to represent two species, both of which are referable to the section or subgenus *Catillus* of Brongniart, in which the hinge line is elongated in a direction parallel with the longer axis of the shell.\n\n**Trigonoarca tumida**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Trigonoarca tumida*, Whiteaves. 1884.

Dawsoni* from the Iltasyouco River and Sigulat Lake.\n\nIn 1884 the writer expressed the opinion that the shells for which this name had been suggested were probably identical with the *Trigonia intermedia* of Fahrenkohl, from the Neocomian of Russia. About a year after this statement was made, however, three unusually large, perfect and well preserved specimens of *T. Dawsoni* from Skidegate Inlet, in the Queen Charlotte Islands, were presented to the Museum June, 1889.\nof the Survey by Mr. James Deans, of Victoria, V. I. A comparison of these specimens with Eichwald's description and figures of *T. intermedia* has not tended to confirm the impression that *T. Dawsoni* is synonymous with that species, but has led to the conclusion that there are apparently several points of difference between them, which may be thus briefly summarized.\n\n1. *T. Dawsoni* seems to have attained to fully twice the size of *T. intermedia*. According to Eichwald the latter measures one inch and a half in length, from the anterior to the posterior side, and one inch in height, measured from the middle of the inferior margin to that of the dorsal border, whereas the corresponding dimensions in the largest of the three specimens of *T. Dawsoni* from Skidegate Channel are, length three inches and an eighth, height two inches.\n\n2. The curved ribs of *T. intermedia* are said to be ornamented with very small spinous nodes, but in *T. Dawsoni* the nodes on the ribs can scarcely be called very small, and they are generally obtusely rounded, though often intersected or partly intersected by the concentric grooves which alternate with the rather crowded raised lines of growth.\n\n3. There appears to be a slight but constant difference between the sculpture of the broad posterior area of *T. Dawsoni* and that of *T. intermedia*. In the last named species this area is described as over-run (parcourue) with oblique, almost vertical, close stri\u00e6, divided into two parts by a horizontal groove. In the figures of *T. intermedia* these vertical stri\u00e6 are represented as straight, parallel, regular, continuous and devoid of tubercles, and the only tubercles on the posterior area appear to be those on the elevated ridge which separates it from the main body of the shell. But, in *T. Dawsoni* the vertical raised lines on the posterior area are often irregularly disposed, interrupted, more or less angularly bent as well as somewhat tuberculated, and there are indications of a row of transversely elongated tubercles on each side of the central groove, and of a similar but less distinct row on the sub-angular ridge which separates this area from the escutcheon proper.\n\nIn view of these apparent differences between the two forms, it is probably advisable to retain the name originally given to the types from British Columbia, for the specimens from that province and for those now under consideration from the Rocky Mountains.\n\n**Astarte Carlottensis**, Whiteaves.\n\n(For the synonymy of this species and reference to the publication in which it was figured, see page 154 of this Report.)\n\nOne fairly characteristic specimen of a left valve.\n**Protocardium Hillanum, (?)

Hillanum* only in being rather more produced behind and consequently a little longer than high. The maximum length of the largest specimen collected at this locality is thirty-nine millimetres and its greatest height, inclusive of the beaks, thirty-four mm., or as measured in the centre, just behind the beaks, thirty mm. The impressions left by the radiating ribs on the posterior area are plainly visible on these casts, but no traces of any concentric markings can be detected on the remainder of their surface. In d\u2019Orbigny\u2019s figures of a cast of a French specimen of *C. Hillanum* the maximum length and height are represented as exactly equal, but the small specimens from the Queen Charlotte Islands which the present writer has identified with that species, like those from the Rocky Mountains now under consideration, are a little longer than high.\n\n**Cyprina occidentalis**, Whiteaves.\n\n*Cyprina occidentalis*, Whiteaves.\u20141884.

It is quite possible that the shells for which this name was proposed, are only a local variety of the _Pleuromya papyracea_ of Gabb,* from the Shasta Group of California, and that the _Pholasomya Vancouverensis\u2020_ which was described and figured by the present writer from a single specimen collected by Dr. G. M. Dawson in 1877 from the north-east slope of Jackass Mountain, in the valley of the Lower Fraser River, is, as already stated on page 153, either another variety of the same species, or the same shell in an unusual and very peculiar state of preservation.\n\nCEPHALOPODA.\n\n_Schloenbachia borealis_, Whiteaves.\n\n(This species has already been described on page 160 of this Report and is figured on Plate 21.)\n\nTwo specimens, which do not seem to differ in any essential particular from the type of _S. borealis_ from the Lewes River. One is a badly preserved cast of the interior of a shell, and the other a well preserved mould of the exterior of another,\u2021 both of which measure about three inches and a half in their greatest diameter.\n\nA third specimen, which is probably only a variety of the same species, was also collected by Mr. McConnell at this locality. It resembles the type of _S. borealis_, both in external form and in the prominence of its simple abdominal keel, but has much coarser ribs, many of which bifurcate half way across the sides.\n\nThe occurrence of the same species of Ammonite at localities so wide apart as the Rink Rapids of the Lewes River and the Rocky Mountains near Devils Lake, is not without significance from a purely geological point of view.\n\n---\n\n* Geol.

(N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 23, figs. 2 and 2a.\n\nShell shallowly but widely umbilicated, the inner whorls occupying a little more than one half of the entire diameter: periphery encircled apparently with a central and very slightly raised, simple abdominal keel. Volutions about five, narrow, increasing slowly in size and but slightly embracing. Outer volution somewhat rectangular, its sides being compressed and its abdominal region slightly flattened on both sides next to the keel, though rounded off exteriorly. Aperture subelliptical but somewhat rectangular, higher than wide and very slightly emarginate by the encroachment of the preceding volution.\n\nSurface marked by distant, slightly curved, prominent and simple radiating ribs or rib-like folds. On the outer volution these ribs, which curve somewhat obliquely forward in a shallowly concave curve, become obsolete in the abdominal region and disappear before reaching the keel. They are much narrower than the broad, shallow depressions between them, and are most prominent a little more than half way across the sides, where each rib rises gradually into a low, pointed tubercle. Sutural line unknown.\n\nApproximate dimensions of the most perfect specimen collected: greatest diameter, one hundred and ten millimetres; width of umbilicus, from suture to suture, fifty-eight mm.; height of the aperture (at the broken anterior extremity, thirty mm.; width of the same, if measured on the summits of two opposite ribs, twenty-two mm., or, if in the interstices between them, eighteen mm.\n\nTwo imperfect and not very well preserved specimens, both of which are mere casts of the interior of the shell.\n\nAssociated with these, two other fragments of a Schloenbachia were collected by Mr. McConnell, in one of which the abdominal region is encircled by three prominent angular ridges, of which the central one is much the highest, just as in the Ammonites Tehamaensis of Gabb,* which would now be called a Schloenbachia. In several other respects, however, these fragments differ materially from the types of S. gracilis and from S. Tehamaensis. Their volutions are much more closely embracing, their outer volution is much broader in a dorso-ventral direction, and their umbilicus is much narrower in proportion to the size of the shell. The ribs on their outer volution, too, are very faint and indistinct, and in none can any trace of a tubercle be detached either near their centre or at their outer termination.\n\n* Geol. Surv. Calif., Palaeont. Vol. II [1869] p. 132.\nBelemnites. (Species undeterminable.)\n\nTwo portions of the phragmocone and five fragments of the guard, the latter all broken at both ends, of a species of Belemnite which it is, of course, quite impossible to identify from such imperfect specimens. One of the fragments of the guard has a deep median groove, which is not the case with any of the others.\n\n(3.) From the Peace River, a few miles below Fort Vermilion; collected by Mr. W. Ogilvie, D.L.S., in 1885.\n\nCEPHALOPODA.\n\nPlacenticeras glabrum. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 24, figs. 1, 1a and 1b.\n\nShell rather strongly compressed at the sides, its maximum breadth being a little more than one fourth of the greatest diameter, most prominent and broadest at the umbilical margin and narrowing very slowly from thence to the periphery, which latter is narrowly but regularly rounded. Umbilicus rather deep and occupying about one-fifth of the entire diameter, though its outer margin is rounded and indistinctly defined. Volutions deeply embracing, fully three fourths or more of the inner ones being covered: suture distinct. Aperture obtusely and narrowly subsagittate, its outline, outside of the deep basal emargination, being narrowly elliptic ovate. Length of body chamber unknown.\n\nSurface apparently smooth, though not a vestige of the outer layer of the test is preserved.\n\nThe sutural line, which is minutely and angularly incised throughout its entire length, is composed of two large outer lateral saddles and five much smaller inner ones, as well as one large outer lateral lobe and four much smaller inner ones (or seven of the latter, if three very small ones on the lower part of the umbilical wall be counted) on each side of the siphonal saddle and lobe. The small siphonal saddle is angularly notched on each side of the centre and divided into three erect spurs, the middle one of which is the shortest and the least incised at its margin. The first lateral saddle is much broader than high, it is also broader than the second, but not quite so high. The upper portion of the first lateral saddle is deeply divided near the middle into\ntwo nearly equal parts, each of which is subdivided into three spreading branchlets with bifurcate or trifurcate apices. Between the first and second lateral saddles there are two rather small auxiliary saddles, the outermost of which is the larger and the more subdivided of the two. The second lateral saddle is deeply divided near the centre into two unequal parts, the outer one of which bears four short incised branchlets and the inner five. The third lateral saddle is so deeply divided in the middle as to form two almost independent saddles. Of these, the outer one, which is the larger of the two, bears three branchlets at its summit, and the inner one two. The fourth lateral saddle is somewhat similar to the third, but a little smaller. The fifth, sixth and seventh, which are still smaller and decrease gradually in size toward the suture, are rather emarginate than branched at their summits.\n\nThe siphonal lobe is about equal in height to the first lateral lobe. On each side the former bears two spreading lateral branches, which trifurcate at their summits, besides a short, erect, incised spur next to the siphuncle above, and a similar but spreading spur or offset at the base. Between the siphonal and first lateral lobes, as also between the first and second, second and third, and third and fourth lateral lobes, there are three small auxiliary lobes, of which the central one is always the largest. The first lateral lobe is broad in its basal and undivided portion, which bears a lateral incised spur or offset on each side. Its upper moiety is deeply divided into two branches of unequal size, viz., into an outer and smaller one which bifurcates above and an inner or larger one which trifurcates above, while both widen outward and ultimately throw off a number of minute and more or less deeply incised lateral branchlets or spurs. The second lateral lobe is shorter and much narrower than the first. Though its apex is minutely bifid, the lobe itself is not deeply divided above, but it bears on each side three irregularly incised spurs or offsets, which also widen a little outward. The third lateral lobe is much shorter than the second, and its upper portion is divided into two branches which trifurcate on their outer sides. The fourth is smaller, but in other respects similar to the third, and the rest of the lobes, which are not branched but incised at their margins, are very small, and decrease gradually and regularly in size to the suture.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: greatest diameter, ninety six millimetres; maximum breadth, twenty-six mm.; greatest width of the umbilicus, nineteen mm.\n\nOne remarkably well preserved and nearly perfect cast of the interior of the septate portion of the shell, which shews the finest details of the lobes and saddles over nearly the whole of its surface, ex-\ncept where they are covered by small portions of the inner layer of the test.\n\nThis species appears to belong to the same group of Ammonites as the *A. Cleon* and *A. nisus*\u2020 of d'Orbigny and the *Placenticeras Poreczianum* of the Queen Charlotte Islands, and the remarks on pages 157 and 158 of this report, on the generic position of the shell last named, are equally applicable to *P. glutrum*.\n\n(4.)

Anterior side short and evenly rounded: posterior side about three times as long as the anterior, its extremity obliquely truncated above and somewhat bluntly pointed below: superior border descending rather abruptly in an obliquely convex curve in front of the beaks, and nearly straight and parallel with the ventral margin behind them: umbones swollen laterally, but scarcely prominent: beaks small, appressed and slightly depressed, placed about half-way between the centre and the anterior margin: lunule none: posterior area subangularly inflected, but very indistinctly defined: ventral margin nearly straight for the greater part of its length, but rounding up abruptly at the anterior end and forming an obtusely subangular junction with the posterior margin behind.\n\nSurface marked with rather coarse concentric lines of growth: test somewhat thin. Anterior muscular impression subovate: posterior muscular impression rather larger and more nearly circular: pallial line simple and entire: hinge dentition unknown.\n\nDimensions of the most perfect specimen collected: maximum length, twenty-three millimetres and a half; greatest height, fifteen mm; approximate thickness through the closed valves, ten mm.\n\nBattle River, Township 46, Range 4, west of the 4th Principal Meridian, 1885: apparently abundant.

Greatest height, as measured in the centre, behind the beaks, about equal to the maximum thickness through the closed valves; greatest height, as compared with the maximum length, about as three to five.\n\nLateral outline transversely subovate; anterior side very short, its outer margin broadly rounded but somewhat truncated inwardly below the middle; posterior side much more elongated, narrowing gradually at its upper margin and much more rapidly from below upward, its narrow and conspicuously gaping extremity being apparently somewhat obliquely truncated, though the margins of the cast of the united valves of the only specimen collected are both a little broken at this point. Superior border rounding abruptly downward in front, and nearly straight, but descending very gently behind: ventral margin broadly rounded, most prominent a little behind the middle: umbones swollen and prominent: beaks large, incurved and depressed, with a slight forward inclination and placed very near the anterior end: escutcheon broadly lanceolate and tolerably well defined.\n\nOn the umbonal region of the left valve only, a small portion of the test is preserved, and the outer surface of this is marked with concentric and rather irregularly disposed, ridge-like folds, which are often separated from each other by somewhat broader and rather deep con-\ncentric furrows. In addition to these, in each valve an elevated but narrow linear ridge runs obliquely backward from the posterior side of the beaks to a little behind the centre of the ventral margin.\n\nPosterior muscular impression narrowly subelliptical, placed very high up, almost within the escutcheon, and a little behind the mid-length; anterior muscular impression, pallial line and accessory valves unknown. The pedal opening in front seems to have been large and broadly rhomboidal in outline.\n\nThe measurements of the only specimen collected are approximately as follows: maximum length, about fifty-one millimetres; greatest height, as measured in the centre, immediately behind the umbones, and maximum thickness through the closed valves, both thirty-one mm.\n\nNorth Saskatchewan River, Township 54, Range 2, west of the 4th Principal Meridian, 1886: one nearly perfect and well preserved cast of the interior of the closed valves, with a small portion of the test adhering to the left valve.

II., p. 161 E.\n\nThe foregoing was suggested as a provisional name for a rather remarkable specimen of a long tailed decapod, which evidently belongs to the family Astacomorpha of Zittel. Of the Cretaceous representatives of this family, it seems to come nearest to such genera as Pal\u00e6astacus and Hoploaria, though it differs from each in some important particulars. In many respects it appears to the writer to be still more nearly related to the recent and fresh-water genera Astacus and Cambarus, but there is good reason for supposing that it will eventually prove to be the representative of a new generic type, which at present there is not sufficient material to define satisfactorily.\n\nNearly the whole of the under surface of the cephalothorax of the specimen is buried in the matrix, the front margin of the carapace is very imperfect, the tail fin as well as the under part of the five abdominal segments are broken off, and only small portions of the pinching claws and of the other ambulatory legs are preserved or exposed.\n\nThe carapace is moderately convex or slightly depressed, and not quite twice as long as broad. It is divided into two nearly equal parts by a single, well marked and deeply impressed neck furrow, which is arched forward in a shallowly concave curve. Behind this furrow the lateral margins of the carapace are slightly expanded, the test in the branchial region is moderately inflated, and the posterior margin\nis shallowly concave in the middle. A short distance in advance of the neck furrow, on the outer and lower portion of the carapace, on each side, there is a very short and transverse groove or narrow constriction, which may possibly be confluent with the neck furrow on the strongly decurved lateral margins of this part of the carapace. The exact outline of the anterior margin of the carapace cannot be ascertained, and the tip of the rostrum is broken off. The basal portion which remains is about seven or eight millimetres long. At the base it measures five mm. in breadth, and at the broken anterior extremity its breadth is two mm. Its outer margins are defined by two linear and acute, tuberculated and raised longitudinal ridges, between which the surface is smooth and concavely excavated.\n\nThe whole of the outer surface of the carapace is ornamented by rather distant, isolated tubercles. In its posterior moiety these tubercles are somewhat irregularly disposed, though there is a low, very narrow, and rather inconspicuous keel on the median line, on either side of which the cardiac region is comparatively smooth. On the anterior portion of the carapace the tubercles are grouped somewhat obscurely in two or three longitudinal rows on both sides of the narrow median keel, which is continued with greater or less distinctness up to the commencement of the rostrum.\n\nThe anterior pinching claws appear to have been unusually short and robust, while their surface is distinctly tuberculated. The portions of the posterior ambulatory legs that happen to be preserved, on the other hand, are very slender, and their surface is minutely granulated. The abdominal segments are badly preserved, but their outer surface seems to have been smooth, though a narrow median keel can be traced throughout the greater part of their dorsal surface.\n\nSounding Creek, Township 30, Range 8, west of the 4th Principal Meridian, 1886.\n\nAt the same locality and date, five detached pinching claws of an apparently second species of decapod were collected in as many concretionary nodules. These claws resemble those of *P. ornatus* in the comparative shortness and robustness of their terminal segments, but the outer surface of the latter is finely granulated rather than coarsely tuberculated.\n\n**FISHES.**\n\nA well preserved tooth of a Selachian was collected on the Battle River, in Township 46, Range 3, west of the 4th Principal Meridian, in 1885; and a pectoral fin, apparently of a large Selachian, at Sounding Creek, Township 30, Range 8, west of the 4th Principal Meridian, in 1886.\nC.

Most of these specimens are less than an inch in their greatest diameter, though they occasionally attain to a length of an inch and a half or an inch and three-quarters. In each of those from Thunder Hill the lower valve is attached to a fragment of a large *Inoceramus*, and the only example in which the shells are clustered is from the Rolling River. All the rest appear to be both single and unattached to any foreign body, though fully one half of the specimens are upper valves.

The central portion of the presumed ventral surface is marked also by a somewhat similar, but not quite so clearly defined, median impressed line, and by a few extremely faint and irregular impressed striae, which run nearly parallel with it, but which radiate slightly outwards towards the apex.

S. Geol. Surv. Terr., Contr. to Palaeont., by Dr. C. A. White, 1880, Nos. 2-8, p. 18, pl. 11, fig. 3 a.\nThe few specimens which have been collected at these localities are here referred to the genus *Belemnitella* rather than to *Belemnites* proper, on account of their surface being marked with distinct vascular impressions. They all consist of the posterior, fibrous portion of the guard, broken off at greater or less distances behind the apex of the phragmocone. As not a vestige of the alveolar border is preserved, it is quite uncertain whether the anterior margin of the latter had a straight fissure on its ventral side or not.\n\nThe species seems to be readily distinguishable from the most nearly related North American species, the *Belemnitella bulbosa* of Meek and Hayden from the Fox Hills group of Dakota, by its much greater size, less slender proportions and by the different outline of its transverse section at the larger end.\n\nAlthough in Meek's extended definition of the generic characters of *Belemnitella*,* the surface of the guard is said, perhaps inadvertently, to be marked \"on the ventral side by distinct vascular markings,\" yet in d'Orbigny's original description of that genus the two lateral vascular impressions are stated to be dorsal.\n\n**ARTHROPODA.**\n\n**CRUSTACEA.**\n\n**CIRRIPEDEA.**\n\n**LORICULA CANADENSIS.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 26, figs. 4 and 4a.\n\nThe foregoing name is proposed for the unusually perfect specimen of a species of *Loricula* figured on Plate 26, which was collected by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell, in 1887, at South Duck River, in Township 34, Range 23 W., from the Fort Benton group, or lower portion of the series.\n\nOf the nine plates of which the capitulum was originally composed no fewer than seven, viz., the carina, three of the four lateral plates, (*i.e.*, two on the under surface and one on the upper), one tergal plate, and two of the scuta (the one on the under side nearly covered by that on the upper) are preserved, more or less entire, in this specimen. Most of one side of the scaly peduncle, also, is preserved, though the whole of the exterior row of narrow plates immediately under the carina is absent, and the posterior or pointed end of the peduncle is imperfect, most of the scales in that region being considerably displaced.\n\nThe present species resembles the type of the genus, the *L. pulchella* of Sowerby, very closely in the number, shape and relative arrange-\n\n---\n\n*Rep. U.S. Geol. Surv. Terr., vol. IX., p. 502.*\nment of the capitular plates and scales on the peduncle, as well as in the surface markings of the former, but it seems to differ materially from *L. pulchella* in its much smaller size and more narrowly subfusiform lateral outline, while the scales of its peduncle appear to be more obliquely disposed and not at all curved. In the figure of *L. pulchella* in Darwin's Monograph on the British Fossil Cirripedes (published by the Palaeontographical Society), which is stated to be of natural size, the maximum height of the entire organism is twenty-six millimetres and a half, and its greatest breadth sixteen mm. and a half. The greatest breadth of the specimen collected by Mr. Tyrrell is seven millimetres, and although its exact height cannot be accurately ascertained, it may be approximately estimated at fourteen, or perhaps, fifteen mm.\n\nJudging by woodcut 721a. on page 536 of the second volume of Zittel's \"Handbuch der Pal\u00e4ontologie,\" the present species would seem to be more nearly related to the *L. levissima* of Zittel, from the upper chalk of Westphalia, than to *L. pulchella*.\n\nA few isolated capitular plates of *L. Canadensis* were also collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1887, at the Vermilion River, in Township 24, Range 20 W., from the Fort Benton group, or lower part of the series.\n\n**FISHES.**\n\n**SELACHII.**\n\n**Ptychodus parvulus.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 26, figs. 5, 5a and 5b.\n\nTooth (in the only specimen known to the writer) very small for the genus: the crown conical, with obliquely compressed sides, its maximum height being about equal to its breadth at the base, though, as its apex is somewhat worn down from use, its original height may have slightly exceeded its breadth. Outline of the base of the crown, as viewed from above, somewhat quadrangular and much longer than broad, but its posterior end is deeply excavated in the centre and produced on both sides into a small and short process, which expands slightly outward and is truncated and minutely grooved at its termination. Lateral outline of the base of the crown, shallowly concave: characters of the root unknown.\n\nAt the anterior end of the crown there is a triangular smooth space, but the rest of its surface is marked by corrugations or ridges, which appear to have crossed the summit and posterior end continuously. At the posterior end the continuity of three of the corrugations or ridges,\nfrom the base of one side to that of the other, is still clearly visible, and there is a certain amount of regularity in their disposition. In the central portion the wearing down of the summit has destroyed their continuity, and on the sides the corrugations are so much abraded as to be nearly obsolete. Near the anterior end the corrugations on the sides are more irregular in their shape and disposition than at any other part of the surface, and those which correspond to each other, on the two opposite sides, are seldom, if ever, exactly alike. Thus, on the right hand side of the crown, one of the corrugations close to the front branches three or four times below the middle, and its longest branch bends inward at nearly a right angle to the main stem and to the rest of the corrugations, but this is not the case with the corresponding one on the opposite side, and in no part of the surface do the corrugations cross each other sufficiently often to form a complete, or even partially complete, network. Under a lens also, the external orifices of the dental tubuli are plainly visible through the polished transparent enamel, and where the latter is worn away, as on the summit and at the anterior end, the orifices themselves are exposed and appear as close-set punctures of irregular shape.\n\nDimensions of the only specimen collected: maximum length of the crown, nine millimetres and three-quarters; actual height of the crown, as measured in the centre, six mm.; breadth of the crown at its base, also as measured in the centre, six mm.\n\nSwan River, below Thunder Hill, J.

Central cusp of the crown slightly recurved, conical and rather slender, its height, as measured on the longer and flatter of the two sides, being more than twice its breadth at the base, which latter, as viewed edgeways, is oblique, the plane face descending far below the convex. Outer coronal face nearly flat, but marked with a shallow longitudinal depression or faint groove on each side, next to the lateral margins, the intervening central space being nearly flat or very slightly convex,\u2014but its basal portion is ornamented also with a few acute and longitudinal plications of unequal size and length, the two nearest to the centre being longer and larger than any of the others. Inner coronal face convex, especially below, the greater part of its surface marked by numerous (about sixteen) irregular and longitudinal, but not quite straight, acute ridges or plications, some of which are comparatively short and do not extend the whole length of the cusp, while those that do usually bifurcate or trifurcate at the base. When examined with a lens, however, this plicated area is seen to be bordered with a narrow, smooth space, on both sides and next to the lateral margins. Cutting edge thin and sharp, with a minute tubercle at the base, on each side.\n\nThe lateral denticles are triangular, with their apices slightly divergent and pointing upward and outward: their height and breadth are about equal. On their outer side they are nearly flat and on their inner convex, while the ornamentation on both sides of the surface is essentially similar to that of the central cusp of the crown, though the plications on their inner or convex side, while equally well marked, are of course not nearly so numerous. The root also is nearly flat on its outer side, but on its inner face it is everywhere more or less convex, and immediately under the base of the central cusp it swells up into an elevated protuberance with a rounded summit.\n\nThe foregoing description is based upon two nearly perfect detached teeth collected by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1887, at Rolling River, two miles above Heart Hill, from the Niobrara group or upper portion of the series. The dimensions of one of these specimens, which is figured on Plate 26, are as follows: entire height, from the base of one of the radicles to the summit of the central cusp, eighteen millimetres; breadth of the tooth, near the base of the root and below the two denticles, nine mm. and a half; height of central cusp, ten mm. and a half on the outer or flattened side and seven mm. and a half on the inner; breadth of the same at the base, four mm. and a half.\n\nA few dental crowns of similar teeth were collected by Mr. Tyrrell in the same year at the Rolling River, in Township 36, Range 26 W.,\nbut only one of these has the lateral denticles preserved. In this latter specimen, whose inner or convex surface is buried in the matrix, the central cusp is exceptionally long and slender, and the plications at the base of its outer surface are unusually short, small and nearly uniform in size.\n\nThe detached teeth for which the present provisional name is proposed, seem to differ from those of the *L. macrorhiza*, from the \"Niobrara epoch\" of Kansas, in their proportionately broader and shorter dental crowns, in their very slightly divergent and nearly horseshoe-shaped roots, and more particularly in the distinctly though minutely plicated surface of their inner coronal faces.\n\n**TELEOSTEI.**\n\n*Enchodus Shumardi*, Leidy.\n\nPlate 26, figs. 7, 7a, 7b and 7c.\n\n*Enchodus Shumardi*, Leidy. 1873. Contr. Extinct Vert. Faun. W. Terr. (U.S. Geol. Surv.

P. R. crossing, from the Niobrara group or upper part of the series. These remains are probably referable to the *E. Shumardi* of Leidy, a species which was based upon a dentary bone with teeth, found by Dr. Benjamin F. Shumard in ash-coloured shales of the Cretaceous series of Nebraska, though, judging by the description, and more especially by the figures, in the fifth volume and atlas to the fifth volume of the \"Poissons Fossiles,\" it is difficult to see by what characters they can be distinguished from the *E. halocyon* of Agassiz.\n\nThe specimen collected by Mr. Tyrrell, like the fragment described by Dr. Leidy, shows that in this species the lower jaw was armed with nearly straight and erect, but very slightly incurved, slender teeth, placed at rather distant intervals, and that these teeth are of unequal size, the one nearest the anterior end of each ramus being much longer than any of the rest. Impressions of the greater part of each of the dentary bones, with the teeth in place, are preserved, and the surface ornamentation of part of the lower jaw is very well exhibited. The most perfect of the dentary bones indicated in the specimen figured (fig. 7) is forty millimetres long and thirteen mm. broad or deep at its broken\nposterior extremity, and its upper margin is armed with six teeth, the largest of which is nine millimetres high and three mm. broad at the base. The external surface of the dentary portion of the lower jaw (fig. 7a) is finely ribbed in a longitudinal direction, and the summit of each rib bears a single row of minute and closely arranged tubercles. One little bone, (fig. 7c) which is very similar in its shape and in the general style of its dentition to the palatine bone of *E. halocyon* as described and figured by Agassiz, but which is most probably one of the maxillaries, has its under margin fringed with a single row of very minute teeth, though these latter are of very nearly equal size, and not of distinctly different sizes as they are represented as being in the palatine bone of *E. halocyon*. A long and slender tooth, (fig. 7b) whose longitudinally striated exposed portion is fourteen millimetres long and only two mm. broad at the base, to the basal portion of which a small fragment of bone is still adherent, is evidently one of the elongated fangs at the anterior extremity of the premaxillary.\n\nIn 1875, the genus *Enchodus* was included by Professor Cope in a new family of physostomous fishes, for which the name Stratodontidae* was proposed, an arrangement which has since been adopted by Zittel in the third volume of his \"Handbuch der Pal\u00e4ontologie.\"\n\n**Cladocyclus occidentalis**, Leidy.\n\nPlate 26, figs. 8 and 9.\n\n*Cladocyclus occidentalis*, Leidy. 1873.

Evans and subsequently by Prof. Hayden and Mr. Meek in ash-colored shales of the cretaceous series of Nebraska.\" \"Mostly,\" Dr. Leidy says, \"they are\n\n---\n\n*Vert. Cret. Form. West.* (Rep. U. S. Geol. Surv. Terr., vol. II.) p. 218.\noval, with the length but little more than half the depth, while others are circular, and these may really pertain to a different species, if not genus, from the former.' In one of these scales, the depth of which \"is estimated to have been nearly 2\u00bd inches, and its length nearly 1\u00bd inches,\" the inner portion is described as exhibiting \"numerous radiating ridges, while the outer portion, separated from the former by a narrow, smooth tract, presents a minutely tubercular or granular aspect.\"\n\nThe specimens collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling from the northern continuation into Manitoba of the Cretaceous rocks of Dakota, at the localities indicated, are all large detached scales, which are very similar in size and shape to those described by Dr. Leidy, and which do not appear to differ from them except in some minute details of their surface ornamentation. Like those from Nebraska, too, they may represent more than one species, and, perhaps, even more than one genus.\n\nOf the two specimens figured, one (fig. 8), which measures forty-seven millimetres (or nearly two inches) in depth and twenty-four mm. (or about one inch) in length, is somewhat pointed above and below, while its lateral margin is broadly rounded anteriorly and nearly straight posteriorly. In the other, (fig. 9), which is twenty-nine millimetres in depth and twenty-nine mm. and a half in length, the marginal outline is more nearly circular. When examined with a lens, the radiating markings on the surface of each are seen to consist of fine grooves, which are more or less interrupted or broken up into rows of punctures, and not of continuous raised ridges as in the types of *C. occidentalis*. The smooth central area is well marked in both and in all the specimens collected, and the granulations on the exposed surface of each scale appear under the lens as longitudinal but slightly divergent and densely crowded rows of minute punctures with raised margins, the punctures in each row being connected by a still more minute ridge.\n\n**ERRATA.**\n\nPage 116.

F. WHITEAVES.\n\n5. The Fossils of the Devonian Rocks of the Mackenzie River Basin.\n\nIn 1887, 1888 and 1889 large and important collections of fossils were made by Mr. R. G. McConnell from the Devonian rocks exposed along the Hay, Mackenzie and Peace Rivers. A detailed report upon the species contained in these collections was written, and the five plates required to illustrate it were printed off in the fall of 1890. Before the manuscript of this report was sent to the printer, however, the receipt of an additional collection of fossils, made by Mr. McConnell in 1890 from the Devonian rocks of the Athabasca and Pembina Rivers, induced the writer to enlarge its scope so as to include therein a consideration of all the specimens now in the Museum of the Survey from the Devonian rocks of the Mackenzie River Basin. The whole of the specimens referred to in these pages were collected by members of the Staff of the Survey between the years 1875 and 1890, both inclusive, and some of the collections made prior to 1885 have been provisionally reported upon by the writer, in the Reports of Progress of the Survey for the years in which they were made. In the study and comparison of many of the species represented in these collections, and especially in ascertaining the internal structure of the corals and the minute peculiarities of the polyzoa, the writer has been ably assisted by Mr. L. M. Lambe.\n\nSPONGI.F.\n\nAstr\u00e6ospongia Hamiltonensis, Meek and Worthen.\n\nPlate 28, figs. 1, 1a.\n\n*Astr\u00e6ospongia Hamiltonensis*, Meek and Worthen. 1866. Proc. Chicago Ac. Se., vol.

It is, however, not yet certain that the specimens from these three localities are precisely identical with the species described by Schlotheim and Goldfuss.\n\nThe systematic position of the genus *Aulopora* has long been doubtful and is still far from settled. In their monograph of the British Fossil Corals (1850-54), Edwards and Haime refer it to the *Alcyonaria*, but in their subsequently published \u201cPolypiers Fossiles des Terrains Pal\u00e6ozoiques\u201d they create for it the special order *Zoantharia Tubulosa*, composed of the single family *Auloporid\u00e6*, and place both between their *Tabulata* and *Rugosa*. Nicholson, in the last edition of his Manual of Palaeontology (1889) refers *Aulopora* to the *Alcyonaria*, but Ferdinand R\u00f6mer, in the *Letheo Geognostica* (1876) places it at the end of the\n\n---\n\n*R\u00f6mer (Letheo Geognost., 1, 521) gives the date of this species as 1826, and Edwards and Haime (Polyp. foss., p. 312) as 1829.

Mr. Meek, however, expressed the opinion that C. arcticum \"resembles C. quadrigeminum of Goldfuss, as figured on pl. xviii, fig. 6b of his Petrefacta Germaniae, more nearly than any other species\" with which he was acquainted. In the writer's judgment, the two specimens collected by Mr. McConnell are much more like C. hexagonum, as originally described and figured by Goldfuss, and subsequently by Edwards and Haime, the Sandbergers, Ferdinand R\u00f6mer and others, if, indeed, they are not actually identical therewith. Both specimens are small convex masses of intimately connected, polygonal and for the most part hexagonal corallites, the apertures of the larger ones measuring as much as fifteen millimetres in their maximum diameter. The number of septa is essentially the same as those of C. hexagonum, but in the specimens from the \"Ramparts\" the writer has not been able to detect any traces of the paliform lobes on the septa, which, according to Edwards and Haime, \"form a very distinct crown round the centre of the calice\" in C. hexagonum.\nCyathophyllum c\u00e6spitosum, Goldfuss.\n\nPlate 27, figs. 7, 8.\n\nCyathophyllum c\u00e6spitosum, Goldfuss. 1826.

Their internal structure is essentially the same as that of the mass of compound corallites from the Peace River, but it is just possible that the specimens from the Hay River may be single corallites of Meek's C. arcticum.\n\nCyathophyllum Richardsoni, Meek (Sp.)\n\nPlate 27, figs. 3 and 4.\n\nAutophyllum ?

McConnell, 1888: six good specimens.\nAlthough Mr. Meek placed this species provisionally in the genus *Aulophyllum*, he expressly stated that he was quite uncertain whether it ought to be referred to that genus or to *Cyathophyllum*. On this point his exact words are as follows:\u2014\u201cI know this coral only from fragments less than 0.80 inch in diameter, none of which shew the entire length. They are also nearly all considerably compressed, but this seems to be from accidental pressure. The generic characters cannot be made out with much confidence from such materials, and hence I am by no means satisfied that the species should not be called *Cyathophyllum Richardi*.\u201d As near as its internal structure can be determined, however, from the specimens collected, it would seem to differ from that genus in having an inner wall encircling the central region, and thus more nearly approaching the genus *Aulophyllum*. It also wants the transverse tabulae generally more or less developed in the central region of *Cyathophyllum*.\n\nThe specimens upon which Mr. Meek\u2019s description was based, which are also from the \u201cRamparts,\u201d have been kindly lent to the present writer, for examination and comparison, by Mr. C. D. Walcott, of the U. S. Geological Survey. Their internal structure, it may be stated, is in a peculiar and not very good state of preservation. In those of which sections have been made, the appearance of a supposed \u201cinner wall encircling the central region\u201d seems to be due to the fact that the matrix filling up the vesicles of a narrow outer zone which corresponds in breadth to the length of the secondary septa, happens to be of a distinctly darker colour than that which fills up the vesicles of the central portion of the coral. In these and in the much better specimens collected by Mr. McConnell, the writer has failed to find any indications of an \u201cinner wall\u201d like that of *Aulophyllum*, and has consequently been induced to refer the species to *Cyathophyllum*.\n\nIn longitudinal sections the specimens obtained by Mr. McConnell shew that from the bottom of the calyx to the base of the coral the primary septa extend to the centre, where they are slightly twisted. There are no tabulae proper, but the spaces between all the septa are everywhere filled with vesicular tissue, the vesicles being larger and less regular in the central area than they are exteriorly. The most perfect specimen collected, which measures about three inches in length, has its epitheca densely and finely striated across, in addition to the ordinary surface markings.\nCyathophyllum Athabascense. (N.

Calyx circular, rather deep, with steep sides: septa about thirty four in number, simple, not bearing arched carinae on their sides and apparently not denticulated at their summits. Interior structure, as seen in longitudinal sections, consisting of an outer or peripheral zone of oblique ascending rows of rather large vesicles, and of a broad central area in which the interstices between the septa are crossed by large curved dissepiments, whose size, shape and disposition are very irregular. Transverse sections made a little below the base of the calyx show that the thirty four septa extend almost to the centre, and that they are all equal in length.\n\nAthabasca River, three miles below the Calumet, R.

McConnell, 1890: three good specimens.\n\nThe largest of these is strikingly similar in shape and in surface markings to the Cyathophyllum ceratites of Goldfuss as figured by the Sandbergers on plate xxxvii of their memoir on the fossils of the Devonian rocks of Nassau, but in C. ceratites there are said to be from sixty to one hundred and twenty subdenticulated septa.\n\nCampophyllum ellipticum.\n\nPlate 27, figs. 5, 6.\n\nChonophyllum (Ptychophyllum) ellipticum, Hall and Whitfield. 1873.

McConnell, 1887: three specimens, each of which has been slit longitudinally through the centre and the cut surfaces polished.\n\nOn treating in the same way a specimen of a coral from the Devonian shales at Rockford, Iowa, recently forwarded for comparison by Dr. H. G. Griffiths of Burlington, in that State, and labelled by him Chonophyllum ellipticum, the writer was surprised to find that its internal structure and external characters are essentially the same as those of\nthe specimens from the Hay River. In all four there is no satisfactory evidence of the existence of \"infundibuliform cups,\" but the internal structure, as represented in fig. 6, consists of a broad central tabulate area surrounded by an outer and rather narrow peripheral zone composed of large vesicles. The tabulate area occupies about three fifths of the entire diameter, the tabulae are close-set, flat and for the most part continuous, and their outer terminations are bent abruptly downward. In the outer vesicular zone the general direction of the rows of vesicles in the interseptal loculi is upward and outward. A transverse section of the specimen represented by fig. 6, made at a distance of about half an inch from the bottom of the cup, shows that the primary septa reach nearly if not quite to the centre, and the secondary ones a quarter of the way.\n\nIn their description of *Chonophyllum ellipticum* Professors Hall and Whitfield say that \"there may be some doubt as to its generic relations.\" If the specimen from Rockford, forwarded by Dr. Griffiths, be correctly referred to that species, its internal structure would seem to show that it is congeneric and even perhaps conspecific with the *Campophyllum Soetenicum* of Schluter,* from the Middle Devonian of the Eifel.\n\nA single specimen of a rather elongated and narrow variety of this species has since been collected (in 1890) on the Athabasca, thirty miles below Red River.\n\n**HELIOPHYLLUM PARVULUM.** (N.

Calyx circular in outline, moderately deep: septa thirty-six of each kind, at least in the broader of the two specimens figured, their edges, as seen in the cup, presenting a toothed appearance, which is due to the passing over them of arched carinae: primary septa reaching nearly to the centre at the bottom of the cup: secondary septa very short and feebly developed: septal fossette lateral, shallow.

The tabulate area occupies about one fifth of the entire diameter, and the tabulae are straight, regular and closely arranged. In the outer vesicular zone the vesicles are slightly smaller and more regularly disposed towards the outside than near the centre, their general direction being in rows which curve obliquely upward and outward. The general direction of the arched carinae which cross the sides of the septa throughout their entire length, on the other hand, is uniformly upward and inward.\n\nHay River, forty miles above its mouth, R.

McConnell, 1887: five specimens.\n\nThose from the Hay River are very variable in external form, no two of them being exactly alike. In one the corallum is \"depressed and moderately convex below,\" as in the type of *Smithia Verrillii*, Meek; in another the basal portion is so deeply conical that the entire depth of the coral is nearly equal to its maximum breadth at the summit, while a third is nearly spherical. The epitheca, which is beautifully preserved in the deeply conical specimen, has its outer surface finely and concentrically striated. The calices of the corallites, whose\nouter walls are conspicuously elevated, average about three millimetres and a quarter in diameter. They are placed at distances apart equal to from once to twice their own breadth, and their septa average eleven or twelve of each kind.\n\n*P. Hennahi* occurs, though rarely, in the corniferous limestone of Ontario. Three specimens which appear to be identical with it are in the Museum of the Survey, two labelled \"Woodstock, A. Murray,\" and the other \"Cayuga, E. De Cew,\" each of which must have been collected more than twenty years ago.\n\n**Phillipsastr\u00e6a Verrillii**, Meek. (Sp.)\n\n*Smithia Verrillii*, Meek. 1868.

The calices are\nstrongly exsert and project considerably above the spaces between them. They average seven millimetres in diameter, and are separated by depressed spaces which in some places are wider than the calices themselves and in others narrower. Externally, the resemblance of the specimen to *P. Woodmani* is not inconsiderable. Transverse and longitudinal sections of both, however, show that the Peace River coral differs from *P. Woodmani* in that its corallites have no definite walls and no central tabulate area, as those of *P. Woodmani* have, and in its non-confluent costae and septa which extend almost to the centre.\n\n**Cystiphyllum Americanum, var. arcticum.**\n\n*Cystiphyllum Americanum*, var. arcticum, Meek. 1868.

A few well preserved portions of branches of a coral which is somewhat doubtfully referred to this species, from each of these localities. These vary in thickness from half an inch to an inch and a half. In some the corallites are very small and in others comparatively large, but the lips of the calices are invariably thickened by a secondary deposit of sclerenchyma. Their apertures, which are often closed with opercula, are usually nearly or quite circular in outline, but they vary considerably in shape, those of one specimen, in particular, being transversely elliptical, with an obtusely conical protuberance at the base of each.\n\nLindstrom (Ovfersigt af Konigl.

McConnell, 1890: two specimens, attached to Orthis striatula.\n\n* Rep. Pal\u00e6ont. Prov. Ontario, 1874, p. 122, figs. 55 a, b.\nThe size of specimens of the present species seems to be determined by that of the objects to which they are attached. When growing upon the surface of comparatively large corals the colonies attain to a length of two inches or more, but when attached to the shells of brachiopoda of medium size (such as Orthis striatula or Atrypa reticularis), upon which they have no room to expand, the maximum length of the colonies is usually less than an inch.\n\nThe genus Hederella, which, so far as known, is exclusively confined to rocks of Devonian age, was constituted by Professor James Hall in 1884 for the reception of a small group of cyclostomatous polyzoa of the type of Aulopora Canadensis, Nicholson. Of the five nominal species now referred to that genus, only two, viz., H. Canadensis and H. filiformis, have as yet been found in Canada.\n\nIn regard to the first of these it may be observed that, after a direct comparison of authentic examples of both, the present writer is convinced that H. Canadensis is both generically and specifically identical with the Stomatopora alternata of Hall and Whitfield, from the Devonian rocks of Iowa.\n\nThe second is a little creeping polyzoon which is abundant in the shales of the Hamilton formation at Thedford and Bartlett's Mills, near Arkona, Ont., and which was identified with the Aulopora filiformis of Billings by Professor H. A. Nicholson in 1874. Subsequently, in 1881, Professor Hall, who seems to have taken the correctness of this identification for granted, referred it to his then newly constituted genus Hederella, under the name H. filiformis. Unfortunately, however, the only description that Billings gave of his species is quite insufficient to enable it to be recognized, and it was not accompanied by any figure. The type and only known specimen of the Aulopora filiformis of Billings, which is still preserved in the Museum of the Survey and which is here figured for the first time (on Plate xxix., fig. 1), appears to the writer to be the immature state of a species of Syringopora allied to the S. fascicularis of Linn\u00e6us, from the Wenlock limestone of Dudley and elsewhere. It is so completely silicified that all traces of its internal structure are obliterated, but, although its corallites are at first creeping and form a large-meshed network, they ultimately become erect, though only for a short distance, and are more or less fasciculated. The Aulopora filiformis of Nicholson, on the other hand, is unquestionably a Hederella, as pointed out by Hall, and if sufficiently distinct from H. Canadensis, it will have to be called H. filiformis, Nicholson. But, when a large number of specimens of Hederell\u00e6 are carefully compared, they are found to vary so much in the amount of regularity of their mode of growth and\nin the degree of slenderness of the colony, that it is often very difficult if not altogether impracticable, to distinguish between *H. Canadensis* and *H. filiformis*. Under these circumstances the writer is inclined to doubt whether the characters which have been relied upon to separate them are either permanent or of specific importance. According to Professor Nicholson, his *A. filiformis* is \"a much more robust species\" than *H. Canadensis*, \"with larger tubes, and much more irregular methods of growth and apertures generally distinctly elevated above the general surface.\"\n\n**Proboscina laxa.** (N.

Cells entirely immersed, irregular in their disposition, but usually obscurely alternating biserial, the terminal ones subovate in outline: cell apertures not quite terminal, averaging a little less than one half the greatest breadth of the cells, subcircular in outline, with slightly elevated, simple and thin lips.

Ventral valve moderately convex, its umbo broad and somewhat tumid, its beak small, depressed and incurved. On each side of the beak the cardinal edge is armed with three widely divaricating, long and slender spines. When viewed under a lens, the surface of the ventral valve is seen to be marked with numerous minute, but distinct and somewhat flexuous, round and radiating, thread-like raised lines which increase, by bifurcation and intercalation, from about fifty on the umbo to sixty near the front margin. These are crossed by slightly smaller and more close set, but in other respects similar, concentric raised lines (and occasionally also, by a few distant and comparatively coarse concentric wrinkles) in such a way as to produce a minutely nodulous network, though the radiating raised lines are more widely separated than the concentric ones, and the latter are sometimes interrupted, or in some cases dichotomous. Dorsal valve shallowly concave or nearly flat, its outer surface marked\nby about eight or nine small concentric plications or imbricating lamellae, with exceedingly minute and close set radiating striae between them, and its inner surface minutely papillose. Cardinal tooth of the dorsal valve very small and bifid externally.

Athabasca River, three miles below the Calumet and thirty miles below Red River, R. G. McConnell, 1890: apparently common at each of these localities. In Manitoba the same species is said to have been collected at Snake Island, Lake Winnipegosiss, by Professor H. Y. Hind, and several fine examples of it were obtained by Prof. Macoun in 1881 on the north shore of the Red Deer River, about half way between Red Deer Lake and Lake Winnipegosiss.\n\nAdult specimens of this shell from the Hay River and the \"Ramparts\" are in some respects intermediate in their characters between the large, broad and compressed form of *O. striatula*, from the Clearwater which Meek described and figured as *O. Iowensis*, and *O. McFarlanei*. They resemble the latter species in the great convexity of their dorsal valves and in the deep marginal sinus of the ventral, but are never so narrowly elongated immediately behind the midlength. Other specimens, again, from the Mackenzie River district, are strikingly similar to the large variety of *O. Tulliensis* of Hall, as figured by Prof. H. S. Williams on Plate 12, fig. 3, of his paper on the \"Cuboides Zone and its Fauna.\"\n\nIn the \"American Geologist\" for April, 1889, Prof. Williams says that *Orthis Iowensis* is but a western variety of the *O. impressa* of the New York faunas, both of which are but varieties of the European *O. striatula* of Schlotheim, and it is most probable that *O. McFarlanei* is only another local variety of the same species.\n\n---\n\n* Bulletin Geol. Soc. America, May, 1890.\nThe specimens from the Clearwater and other Canadian localities which have been referred to *O. Iowensis* appear to the writer to be practically indistinguishable from *O. striatula*, even as a local variety. At any rate they seem to correspond much better with Schnur's figures of specimens of *O. striatula* from the Eifel, and with Davidson's illustrations of British examples of the same species, than they do with Hall's figures of the types of *O. Iowensis* and its variety *furnarius*.\n\nIt is probably this species that was collected by Sir John Richardson in 1825 on the Slave River, forty miles below Lake Athabasca and referred to, on the authority of Mr. J. DeCarle Sowerby,* as a *terebatula* which resembles the *T. resupinata*. Judging by what is known of the geology of this region the shell last named could scarcely be the Liassic fossil now known as *Waldeheimia resupinata* but by no means improbably the *Orthis resupinata* (Martin, sp.) of the Carboniferous, the *Terebratula resupinata* of Plate 325 of the \"Mineral Conchology,\" which is regarded by many paleontologists as a variety of *O. striatula*.\n\n**Strophodonta demissa** (Conrad).\n\n*Strophomena demissa*, Conrad. 1842.

It is, however, much larger than the figured type of that variety, and the mucronate points at its cardinal angles are proportionately shorter and not so slender.\n\nProf. Williams (op. cit., p. 493) says that S. perplana \"appear to be an American type, and is seen with variations all through our Devonian, but it is not described in the American Devonian.\" \"In the European race\" (of the Strophodonta inequistrata type) \"as we reach the Cuboides Zone, the terminations of the hinge develop into slender mucronate points.\" \"In the American race\" (S. perplana) \"these mucronate points first appear in the Tully limestone, and are characteristic of the race afterward till it ceases.\" Mucronate lateral extensions of the hinge line, however, occur in the Strophomena Leda of Billings,* from the Silurian rocks at Anticosti, and in an undescribed species of Strophomena recently collected by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell from rocks of about the same age on the east side of Lake Winnipegosis, at Cedar Lake and on the Saskatchewan, they are developed into exceedingly long and slender spines.\n\n* Geol. Surv.

Although here called *Spirifera disjuncta*, Sowerby, on account of the very general usage to that effect, especially in American publications, it would seem that the proper name of the species is *S. Verneuilii*, Murchison. In Davidson's monograph (op. cit.), although the species is at first called *S. disjuncta* in the text, yet, in a foot note to page 100, the following very explicit statement is made:\u2014\"From having unfor-\ntunately overlooked the fact of Murchison's paper in the \"Bulletin\" having been read twenty-three or twenty-four days sooner than that of Sowerby, published in the Transactions of the Geological Society, I adopted at page 23 of this Monograph the term *Spirifer disjunctus*, Sow., while that of *S. Verneuilii* has a claim to priority.\" The Sandbergers, however, (Die Versteinerungen des Rheinischen Schichten-systems in Nassau, p. 320) adopt *Spirifer calcaratus*, J. Sowerby, as the oldest name for this species.\n\nCharacteristic specimens of *Spirifera Whitneyi*, Hall (which Professors Hall and Whitfield place as a synonym of the present species, on page 237 of the Twenty-third Reg. Rep. N. Y. Stat. Cab. Nat. Hist., under the heading of *S. Orestes*), were collected by Mr. McConnell in 1885, from limestones apparently of Devonian or Devon-Carboniferous age, in the easternmost range of the Rocky Mountains on the North Saskatchewan.\n\n**SPIRIFERA DISJUNCTA**, var.

The beak of the ventral, too, is erect rather than recurved, while its area is broad (in the direction of its height) and flattened almost horizontally.\n\nHay River, forty miles above its mouth, R.

This has been compared with authentic examples of *S. cyrtinaformis* from the \"marly beds\" at Rockford, Iowa, recently received from Professor S. Calvin, and has been found to differ therefrom only in the much larger size and consequently smaller number of its radiating ribs or plications. In\nthe original description of *S. cyrtinaformis* the surface of the valves is said to be \"marked by about forty five to fifty low, rounded plications, whereas in the specimen from the Hay River there are only twenty nine or thirty. This difference, however, can scarcely be regarded as of specific importance.\n\n*S. cyrtinaformis* is very closely allied to the *S. Utahensis* of Meek,* which Mr. Walcott places among the synonyms of *S. disjuncta*. On the other hand, *S. cyrtinaformis* appears to the writer to be specifically identical with the fossil from the Eifel which D'Archiac and DeVerneuil described and figured under the name *S. aperturatus*, var. *cuspidatus*. In his Monograph of the British Devonian Brachiopoda (page 26) Davidson says that *S. aperturatus* is a synonym of *S. canalifera*, Valenciennes (in Lamarck's Hist. Nat. des Animaux sans Vert\u00e8bres), but makes no reference to D'Archiac and DeVerneuil's description and figures of *S. aperturatus* and its var. *cuspidatus*. He farther states (op. cit., p. 26) that \"*Sp. canalifera* has much of the general shape of *S. disjuncta*, but will be easily distinguished on account of the bifurcation of its lateral ribs, a feature not observable in *S. disjuncta*.\" According to Prof. Hall, in *S. cyrtinaformis* \"the central plication on the mesial fold and sinus divides once or twice before reaching the front of the shell; the other plications are simple.\"\n\n**Spirifera subattenuata**, Hall.\n\n*Spirifera* indet.

Ventral valve much more convex than the dorsal, most prominent in the umbonal region, with the sides curving regularly to the margin, but depressed in the centre, its mesial sinus well defined, rounded, very narrow on the beak and umbo, but widening rather rapidly toward the front, where its width slightly exceeds one third of the greatest breadth of the valve: beak small, not very prominent, its apex only being slightly incurved, but not so much so as to cover or overarch any part of the fissure: area moderately high and slightly concave: fissure triangular, higher than wide, with an impressed line or narrow linear groove on each side. Dorsal valve very gently convex, its mesial fold rounded and not much elevated, sometimes with a faint narrow depression in the centre, its hinge line nearly straight and its beak minute and projecting very little above the cardinal margin.\n\nOn each side of the mesial fold and sinus there are from seven to nine rounded but somewhat flattened and simple radiating ribs or plications, but there are none on the fold or sinus. In addition to the ribs, the whole surface when examined under a lens is seen to be marked with exceedingly numerous, close-set and minute, but continuous, radiating raised lines, which are crossed by equally minute and nearly as densely crowded concentric raised lines, in such a way as to produce an exquisitely fine network, which is subgranulose at the points of intersection. The radiating raised lines are not always exactly parallel to the ribs, and the concentric ones are regularly arched where they cross over the ribs, fold or sinus.\nDimensions of the specimen figured: length, as measured in the centre, thirteen millimetres and a half; maximum breadth, fifteen mm.; greatest height or depth of the closed valves, nine mm.; width of mesial sinus at the front margin, six mm.\n\nAthabasca River,\u2014first ten miles below the mouth of the Clear Water, Dr. R.

Prof. H. S. Williams, who has kindly compared both of the specimens from the Athabasca with authentic samples of *S. tullia*, says that, in addition to these differences, the area of the ventral valve in the former is proportionately flatter and higher, and the finer surface striae are decidedly coarser than in *S. tullia*.\n\nSubgenus *Martinia*, McCoy.\n\n*Spirifer (M.) glabra*, var. *Franklini*.\n\n*Spirifer (Martinia) Franklini*, Meek. 1868.

The specimens from the \"Ramparts,\" however, most of which have the appearance of adult shells, are uniformly smaller than the typical *A.* (or *S.*) *Maia*, and show no trace of a mesial fold in the dorsal valve or of a corresponding sinus in the ventral, both of which features are marked characters in full grown examples of Mr. Billings' species.\n\nSPIRIFERA (M.)

Its surface appears to be smooth to the naked eye, but when examined under the lens it is seen to be marked with a few more or less distant concentric stri\u00e6, or lines of growth, and with twelve or thirteen faint, rounded and radiating plications. Mr. Walcott (op. cit., pp. 143 and 144) is inclined to think that *S. (M.)

Dorsal valve with a broad flattened mesial fold and a narrow divergent one on each side. The surface markings seem to consist of concentric striations only, no trace of any radiating lines being visible even under a lens. In average examples the greatest breadth is about half an inch and the maximum length a little less. The largest specimen collected, a detached ventral valve, is 15.5 mm. (or about five eighths of an inch) in its greatest breadth and 13.5 mm.\nin length. The specimens of *O.

Ventral valve more convex than the dorsal, its front margin depressed in the centre in such a way as to form a regularly concave mesial sinus which becomes obsolete at or near the midlength, its umbo prominent, tumid and rather broad, and its incurved beak truncated almost vertically and perforated with a circular foramen. Dorsal valve with a moderately elevated, rounded mesial fold on and near the front margin, its beak being small, narrow and not very prominent.\n\nSurface marked with regularly disposed, nearly equidistant and somewhat imbricating, concentric striations.

McConnell, 1890.\n\nThis diminutive little species seems to be more nearly related to the *Athyris vittata* of Hall than to the *S. spiriferoides* of Eaton, though it may prove to be only a local diminutive race of the latter. As compared with a series of authentic examples of *A. vittata*, from two localities in Iowa, recently forwarded by Prof. S. Calvin, the specimens collected by Mr. McConnell differ therefrom, not only in their much smal-\nler size, but also in the fact that their front margins are much more distinctly sinuated. From Ohio specimens of *A. vittata*, such as those described and figured by Prof. Hall, the specimens from the Athabasca differ also in their much smaller size and in the circumstance that the mesial fold and sinus of each are more rounded and do not extend nearly as far backward.\n\n**ATRYPA RETICULARIS, L.**\n\nFor a complete list of synonyms of this species see Davidson\u2019s \u201cMonograph of the British Devonian Brachiopoda,\u201d page 53, the same authors \u201cBritish Silurian Brachiopoda,\u201d p. 129, or Hall\u2019s Paleontology of the State of New York, vol.

McConnell, 1888; apparently as common as the typical form at each of these localities. The occurrence of this shell at the Ramparts and Fort Good Hope had previously been recorded by Meek, and an unusually large and fine specimen of it, which is now in the Survey collection, was collected by l'Abb\u00e9 Petitot in 1874 near Fort Good Hope.\n\nIn the typical *A. reticularis* the radiating ribs are very fine and numerous, so much so that in a large and well preserved specimen of it from the Hay River, as many as 180 of them can be counted on the front margin of the shell. According to Professor Hall, in the Iowa shells for which he proposed the name *A. aspera*, var. *occidentalis*, the surface is \"marked by ten or twelve dichotomizing plications upon each valve,\" so that there would not be much more than twice those numbers on their front margins. Professor Hall, however, states that in this western variety \"the number of plications is only about half as many as in full grown specimens of the species in the shales of the Hamilton group of New York.\"\n\nThe reasons which induced Dr. Davidson to concur with Hisinger, Lindstr\u00f6m, Brown and McCoy in regarding the *A. aspera* of Schlotheim as a mere variety of *A. reticularis*, are fully stated on page 57 of the \"British Devonian Brachiopoda.\" The numerous and perfect specimens collected by Mr. McConnell on the Peace, Hay and Mackenzie Rivers would seem to support this conclusion, as most of them are intermediate in their characters between *A. reticularis* proper and *A. aspera*. The greater number of them, too, correspond much better with Hall's descriptions and figures of the eastern shell which he has called *A. spinosa* than with the western form of *A. aspera*, and in several specimens from the Hay River the comparatively fine radiating ribs are distinctly spinose.\n\n**Rhynchonella pugnus**, Martin.\n\n*Conchyliolithus anomites pugnus*, Martin. 1809.

The one from the Hay River has eleven rounded and undivided ribs on the mesial sinus, at the front margin, ten similar ones on the fold, and fourteen or fifteen flattened ribs on each side. In the larger of the two specimens from the Peace River there are eleven flat ribs on the sinus, ten rounded ones on the central fold, and eighteen to twenty on each side.\n\nThe rather coarsely ribbed variety of the species from the State of New York to which Hall subsequently gave the name *Rhynchonella venustula*, was originally identified by Conrad and Vanuxem with the *Atrypa cuboides* of Sowerby. Under the heading of *Rhynchonella Emmonsi*, also, Mr. C. D. Walcott remarks:\u2014\u201cThere is very little doubt but that *R. intermedia*, *R. Emmonsi* and *R. venustula* are varieties of *R. cuboides*.\u201d The three specimens collected by Mr. McConnell are doubtless conspecific with the Nevada shell which has been called *R. Emmonsi*, but they also appear to the writer to be quite indistinguishable from the *R. venustula* as figured by Prof. Williams (op. cit., pl. xiii, figs. 4 and 8), from some of the specimens of *R. cuboides* figured by the same author, and from the coarsely ribbed forms of *R. cuboides* (var. *impleta*), illustrated by Davidson on plate xiii, figs. 20 and 21, of his Monograph of British Devonian Brachiopoda. Prof. Williams (op. cit., pp. 493-94) says that \u201c*R. venustula*, Hall, is by common consent closely allied to *R. cuboides* of Europe, the chief distinction lying in the number of plications in the median fold and sinus which are less than in the prevailing type of the European *cuboides*.\u201d Yet, in one of the specimens of *R. venustula* figured by Professor Hall (op. cit. fig. 43) there are as many as ten radiating ribs in the mesial sinus of the ventral valve.\n\n**Rhynchonella castanea**, Meek.\n\n*Rhynchonella castanea*, Meek. 1868.

Sp.)\n\nPlate 29, figs. 6, 6a, 7, 8, 8a and 9.\n\nShell compressed biconvex, the thickness through the closed valves varying in different specimens from a little more to a little less than one half of their greatest breadth, transversely subelliptical, a little broader than long; front margin truncated in the centre in some specimens (as in fig. 6), regularly rounded in others (as in fig. 7), and in some (as in fig. 8), produced into a short rounded lobe. Ventral valve moderately convex on the umbo, immediately below or in front of which there is a more or less well defined mesial sinus, which widens rapidly forward and outward. Beak of the ventral valve small, projecting very little beyond that of the dorsal, slightly incurved, truncated and perforated by a minute subcircular foramen, underneath which there is a very small deltidium. Dorsal valve differing little from the ventral in contour, except that it has a mesial fold instead of sinus, and a smaller and entire beak.\n\nThe finer surface markings are very imperfectly preserved, nearly the whole of the outer layer of the test of the specimens collected being exfoliated. Both of the valves, however, are marked with radiating plications, which vary in shape, number and disposition in different individuals. Thus, in the specimen represented by fig. 6 there are three strongly developed subangular plications in the ventral valve, one in the centre of the sinus and one forming each of its outer limits, and four on the dorsal, i.e., two on the mesial fold and one on each side of it. All of these plications, in this as in other specimens, are obsolete on the umbo of each valve, and most prominent around the front margin. In the original of fig. 7 the two plications on the mesial fold of the dorsal valve trifurcate before reaching the front margin, and there is a very short marginal fold intercalated between them. There are three faint but continuous plications on each side of the fold and sinus, so that round the front margin of this specimen as many as thirteen plications can be counted on the dorsal valve, and there are eleven on the ventral. Lastly, in yet another specimen (fig. 8) there are two rather broad, rounded and continuous plications on the mesial fold of the dorsal, and three in the sinus of the ventral (one in its centre and one forming each of its outer boundaries), but there are no lateral plications. Upon the only specimen in which any portion of the outer layer of the test is preserved, the surface of the latter is seen to be marked by narrow radiating raised lines of very small but unequal size, which are crossed by narrower concentric raised lines, the latter\nbeing very closely and regularly disposed, as well as slightly undulating when viewed with a lens.\n\nCharacters of the interior unknown, though in some specimens there are indications of a mesial septum in the dorsal valve, which appears to have extended from the beaks about half way to the front margin.\n\nThe dimensions of the three specimens figured are as follows:\u2014The one represented by fig. 6, length, twelve millimetres; breadth, fourteen mm. and a half; thickness, six mm. and a half: by fig. 7, length, eleven mm. and a half; breadth, fifteen mm.; thickness, four mm., and a half: and by fig. 8, length, fifteen mm.; breadth, sixteen mm.; and thickness, nine.\n\nHay River, forty miles above its mouth, R. G. McConnell, 1887: fifteen separate specimens and a small piece of rock consisting of an agglomeration of many others.\n\nAs the characters of the interior of the valves are unknown, it is of course doubtful to what genus this species should be referred. It is here provisionally regarded as an *Eatonia* on account of the strong resemblance that the specimens bear externally to some forms of the *E. medialis* of the Lower Helderberg limestone of the State of New York, of which it is just possible that they may prove to be a dwarf variety.\n\n**Pentamerus galeatus**, Dalman.

It differs from *P. comis*, Owen (which is possibly only another variety of *P. galeatus*), principally in the greatly produced umbo and strongly recurved beak of its ventral valve. The shallow mesial sinus in the front of its dorsal valve is bent abruptly inward at almost a right angle to the rest of the valve and bears a single faint plication in the middle,\nwhile the feebly developed mesial fold in its ventral valve is biplicated near the front, where the two folds are divided by a short groove. On each side of the mesial fold and sinus there are two or three very faint and short marginal plications.\n\nIn Europe *P. galeatus* has long been recognized as a Devonian as well as a Silurian fossil, but it does not seem to have been previously recorded as occurring in the Devonian rocks of North America.\n\n**Stringocephalus Burtini**, Defrance.\n\nPlate 29, figs. 10, 10a, 11 and 11a.\n\n*Stringocephalus Burtini*, Defrance. 1827.

Its dimensions are:\u2014length, not quite two inches and three quarters; breadth, a little over two inches and three quarters; thickness through the closed valves, exclusive of the test, about one inch and three quarters. The dorsal valve is somewhat more convex than the ventral, the thickness through the closed valves is much less than their breadth or height, and the umbo and beak of the ventral are prominent and nearly straight. The other (figs. 11 and 11a) which is somewhat distorted, represents an unusually globose form of the species, with the umbo of the ventral valve depressed and its beak closely recurved over that of the dorsal. The approximate dimensions of this specimen are:\u2014length, two inches and a half, breadth not quite as great; thickness through the closed valves, exclusive of the test, which is not preserved, two inches and a quarter. The test of this specimen seems to have been thick, judging by portions of it that are left in the matrix from which the cast figured was broken.\n\n**Cryptonella Calvini (?)** Hall and Whitfield.\n\n*Cryptonella Cultrini*, Hall and Whitfield. 1870.

Its dorsal valve is much flatter than the ventral, and its greatest breadth is, if anything, rather behind than in front of the midlength.\n\n**Newberria**, Hall. (Gen. Nov.)\n\n\"Diagnosis.\u2014Shells elongate-ovoid, having the general contour and external aspect of Rensseleria and Amphigenia, but without the strongly radiate-striate surface of the former genus. The convexity of the valves is greatest in the umbonal region, and the surface is distinctly flattened over the lateral slopes, leaving the median portion of the valves very prominent.\n\nThe pedicle-valve has the rostrum produced and incurved; the apex truncated by a circular foramen; deltidial plates not determined. The teeth are comparatively small, projecting forward and gently upward, free at their extremities, and supported by narrow dental plates, which join the interior of the valve above the middle of its depth and are continued forward as slender ridges upon the inner surface, which gradually merge into the shell.\n\nIn the bottom of the rostral and umbonal cavity there is a broad, scarcely defined muscular area, from which radiate a series of vascular ridges and depressions: the strongly marked pair of diductors are situated posteriorly, just within this muscular area; lying in front of these is a single (rarely subdivided) elongate adductor impression which often extends forwards to the centre of the shell.\n\nOn each side of the muscular impressions is a thickened triangular area, very narrow at its origin in the umbonal region, widening anteriorly and produced into two divergent furrows (four in all) which extend over the pallial region in some instances almost to the anterior margin.\n\nIn the brachial valve there are two short divergent crural plates, which are not united at their bases to form a hinge plate as in Rensseleria. A low median ridge arises between them, passing for a short distance along the bottom of the valve, separating the obovate narrowly flabelliform muscular scars of the adductor muscles. These scars are characterized by the strong striation of their surfaces.\nSurface smooth or with obscure radiating striae.\n\nShell substance punctate. (?)\n\nDedicated to John S.

On the interior of the pedicle valve *Rensseleria* preserves two broad, strong, dental plates which reach nearly to the bottom of the rostral and post-umbonal cavity, leaving a narrow space for the muscular area, quite unlike that of the corresponding valve of *Newberria*. It is from this narrow cavity, produced by the encroachment of these strong dental plates, that we have the narrow elongate rostral casts of *Rensseleria*, which are very dissimilar to those of *Newberria*.\n\nIn the brachial valve the thickened strong hinge plate of *Rensseleria* which supports the crura, does not exist in species of *Newberria*, and in the latter genus we have no knowledge, thus far, of the existence of any interior loop or plate, as in *Rensseleria*. The external form and surface characters of *Newberria* are very similar to those of *Amphigenia*, but the interior of the latter shell carries a spondylium or spoon-shaped process, an organ not present in *Newberria* nor in *Rensseleria*.\n\nSpecies of *Newberria* are known to occur in the Devonian rocks near Davenport, Iowa; in Manitou county, Missouri; and on the Mackenzie River.\"\n\n(Professor James Hall, communicated in a letter dated February 5, 1891.)\n\n*Newberria lavis*, Meek.

On page 293 of their monograph of the fossils of the Devonian rocks of Nassau, the Sandbergers place *P. flabellum*, of which they state that they have received an original example (\"original exemplar\") from the Hamilton Group of the State of New York, from Hitchcock,\u2014among the synonyms of *P. fasciculata*.\nActinopteria Boydii, Conrad.

Bell, 1882: one imperfect but well preserved and characteristic left valve.\n\nPtychoptera equivalvis. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 32, figs. 6 and 6a.\n\nShell of medium size, equivalve, rather strongly convex in the umbonal region, the umbonal convexity in each valve extending to the anterior end of the base, abruptly inflected into the anterior wing and narrowing much more gradually into the posterior alation: greatest thickness a little more than half the maximum length. Height and length very nearly equal, the greatest length being at the hinge line, whence the valves narrow downwards to the somewhat pointed basal margin, which is narrowly rounded on its anterior side but much more broadly convex posteriorly. Anterior wing comparatively large and distinctly angulated at its outer extremity: posterior wing about twice as long as the anterior, not separated from the central portion of the valves by any alar groove or plication, but consisting of a mere upward expansion of the post-umbonal slope, its outer termination nearly rectangular but very slightly produced. Cardinal area very narrowly pyriform in front of the beaks and linear lanceolate behind them. Umbones prominent, rather broad, and placed a little in advance of the midlength, beaks curved inward, downward and a little forward.\n\nSurface marked by extremely numerous and minute radiating impressed lines or narrow grooves. On the umbonal region and posterior wing some of these grooves are comparatively coarse and distant, with much finer ones intercalated between them, but on the anterior wing all the radiating grooves are of nearly uniform size and very closely disposed. On the anterior wing also the radiating grooves are crossed by very minute but distinct and close set concentric raised lines, which are absent on the umbonal region or central portion of the valves and very feebly developed on the posterior wing.\nDimensions of the only specimen collected, maximum length, estimated at twenty seven millimetres; greatest height, twenty five mm.; maximum thickness through the closed valves, a little over sixteen mm. (16.3 mm.)\n\nAthabasca River, first ten miles below the mouth of the Clearwater, Dr. R. Bell, 1882: one nearly perfect and well preserved specimen, with both valves.\n\nThis species would seem to be a very aberrant member of the genus *Ptychopteria*, for its shell is equivalve and its posterior wing is devoid of any longitudinal fold or groove and merges imperceptibly into the umbonal convexity.\n\nIt appears to be most nearly related to the *P. expansa* of Hall,* from the Chemung Group of Pennsylvania, but its beaks are more nearly central, its posterior wing is not nearly so much produced above, and the surface markings of the two species are quite different.\n\n**Leptodesma Demus**, Hall.

McConnell, 1888: three specimens which agree remarkably well with the description and figure of the E. inops of Hall, from the Schoharie Grit of the State of New York, especially in the peculiar concavity of the umbilical area, though it must be borne in mind that Prof. Hall's species was based upon a single imperfect cast of the interior of the shell and that its characters therefore are very imperfectly understood.\n\nEuomphalus (Straparollus) flexistriatus. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 31, figs. 2 and 2a.\n\nShell small, discoidal, spire depressed below the highest level of the outer volution. Volutions rather slender, coiled on nearly the same plane, contiguous and increasing gradually in size, their number uncertain, as nearly the whole of the inner ones are broken off in the only specimen collected, but probably, when entire, about three or four; outer volution compressed above and below and narrowly rounded on the periphery; umbilicus occupying nearly one third of the entire diameter of the base; aperture transversely elliptical, its lower portion occupying a little more than one third of the entire basal diameter.\n\nSurface marked by simple and flexuous transverse striae of growth. On the base of the only specimen collected, commencing at the umbilical margin, these striae at first curve gently and concavely backward, then obliquely forward and outward until they reach the centre of the periphery, after which their course cannot be traced, as they are not preserved on the upper side.\nMaximum diameter, twenty three millimetres; width of umbilicus (as measured on the suture), eight mm.; longest diameter of aperture, nine mm.\n\nMackenzie River, at the \"Ramparts,\" R. G. McConnell, 1888: one specimen.\n\nThis little shell seems to differ from the *Euomphalus inops*, *E. rudis* and *E. Hecale* of Hall in its depressed spire, and from the *E. clymenisides* of Hall (which is identical with the *Straparollus Canadensis* of Billings) in its smaller size, much less slender whorls and consequently narrower umbilicus.\n\n**Euomphalus Maskusi.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 31, fig. 4.\n\nShell rather large, discoidal, spire small, periphery flattened convex. Volutions four or five, coiled on nearly the same plane and increasing gradually in size, the inner ones, as seen from above, rounded, with a minute elevated apex, the two outer ones strongly angulated and bearing a single row of nodules or tubercles at their outer and upper margin. On the more perfect of the only two specimens collected the characters of the tubercles are shown only on the last volution but one. At its commencement they are quite minute and closely arranged, but, as they increase in size with great regularity, at its outer termination they are about three millimetres and a half in their largest diameter and somewhat quadrangular in outline. Characters of the lower or umbilical side and those of the aperture unknown. The only surface markings that happen to be preserved are a minute spiral impressed line in the centre of the nodulous keel bordering the periphery above, and an equally minute spiral raised line on each side of it.\n\nHay River, forty miles above its mouth, R. G. McConnell, 1887: two natural moulds of the exterior of the upper side of the shell. The figure on Plate 31 was drawn from and the foregoing description based on a gutta percha impression of the more perfect of these two moulds.\n\nThe species appears to have been very similar in size and shape to the *Euomphalus* (or *Pleuronotus*) *DeCewi* of Billings, from the Corniferous Limestone of Ontario, but in the former the outer margin of the last two volutions is tuberculated above and probably was so below.\n\n* An abbreviation of the Cree name (Maskusikan sipi) for the Hay River.\nCONULARIA SALINENSIS. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 32, figs. 9, 9a.\n\nShell elongate-pyramidal, transverse section quadrangular, with the opposite sides equal and the alternate ones unequal; faces of the pyramid flattened, each marked with a rounded, narrow and longitudinal, median raised line.\n\nIn addition to this median line, the surface of each of the sides is crossed by rather regularly disposed, parallel and nearly equidistant, very narrow transverse ridges, which curve gently forward and are separated by flattened spaces whose width is rather more than twice the breadth of the ridges. When viewed under a lens, the summit of each ridge is seen to bear a single row of minute pustules, each of which is continued longitudinally forward across the flattened space next to it, as an externally minute linear prolongation. The pustules on any two immediately adjacent ridges are not opposite but alternate, so that the interior prolongations of the pustules are never continuous nor united, or confluent in such a way as to form continuous lines. On each of the sides, too, all the transverse ridges pass over the summit of the median raised line.\n\nThe only specimen collected, which though well preserved is somewhat distorted, is nearly perfect at the smaller end but broken at the larger. Its actual length is about thirty millimetres. The whole of its flattened sides and a small portion of the other two are exposed, the remainder being buried in the matrix. Of the two sides which are fully exposed, the narrower one increases in breadth from two mm. at the smaller end to nine mm. and a half at a distance from it of twenty-five mm., and the broader one from two mm. at the same end to thirteen mm. at a corresponding distance.\n\nAthabasca River, opposite La Saline, R. G. McConnell, 1890: one specimen.\n\nThe discovery of this species and the elucidation of its characters, are entirely due to Mr. L. M. Lambe, who found the type specimen while breaking open a piece of argillaceous limestone containing Leptodesma Jason.\n\nIts most characteristic feature seems to be the longitudinal raised line in the centre of each of its flattened sides.\n\nCEPHALOPODA.\n\nORTHOCERAS.\n\nIn the collection made by Mr. McConnell at the Hay River in 1887,\nthis genus is represented by two specimens. These are both much too imperfect for identification or description, but they clearly indicate the existence of two distinct species of *Orthoceras* in the Devonian rocks at this locality.\n\n**Gyroceras.**\n\nA well preserved portion of what seems to have been the body chamber of a small, nodose and apparently undescribed species of *Gyroceras* was obtained by Mr. McConnell, in 1888, on the Mackenzie River, at the \"Rock by the river side.\" In this specimen the sides are expanded, the venter and dorsum compressed, and the outline of the transverse section is obscurely octagonal, with the two angles on the dorsal side obsolete. The surface markings consist of distant nodes, arranged in longitudinal and transverse rows, and connected in both directions by obscure ridges. In each transverse row there are six of these nodes.\n\nOn the Peace River, at Vermilion Falls, a very imperfect cast of a considerable portion of the interior of the shell of the outer volution of another and very different species of *Gyroceras* was collected by Mr. McConnell in 1889. This specimen, which is of considerable size, seems to be most nearly related to the *G. submamillatum*, from the Devonian rocks of Lake Winnipegosis,* and may possibly be referable to that species, though it does not show any indications of a row of large and low rounded promiences on either of its sides.\n\n**Goniatites.**\n\nPlate 31, fig. 5.\n\nHay River, forty miles above its mouth, R. G. McConnell, 1887: a cast of the interior of three chambers of the septate portion of the shell of a species of *Goniatites*, in which only the lateral lobes and saddles are preserved, each ventral lobe being completely obliterated by weathering. So far as can be ascertained from such an imperfect specimen, the species appears to have the closest affinities with the *G. Ixion* of Hall,\u2020 from the Goniatite limestone of Rockford, Indiana, which is the type of Hyatt's genus *Brancoceras*.\n\n---\n\n* Trans. Royal Soc.

Upper limestone ........................................ (about) 300 feet.\n2. Greenish and bluish shales, alternating with limestone ........................................ (about) 500 feet.\n3. Greyish limestone, interstratified with dolomites, the lower part of which may be older than the Devonian ........................................ 2000 feet (or more.)\n\nThe whole of the fossils referred to in this Report are from the upper part of the middle division of this section. Although some of the localities* at which these fossils were collected are very far apart, the writer is informed by Mr. McConnell that the lithological characters and stratigraphical relations of the shales and limestones at each are almost identical. The fossil fauna at the whole of these localities seem to show similarly close relations, and it is most probable that all the species in the foregoing lists are from practically the same geological horizon.\n\nAn analysis of these lists shows that twenty two of the species are found also in the Hamilton Formation of Ontario or the State of New York.\n\nThese are:\n\nAstracospongia Hamiltonensis. Cerampra Huronensis.\nAulopora serpens. Crania Hamiltoniae.\nStreptelasma rectum. Chonletes Loganii, var. Aurora.\nPachypora cervicornis. Strophodonta demissa.\nAlveolites Ru-meri. \" perplana.\nSpirorbis omphalodes. Productella spinulicosta.\n\" Arkomensis. Atrypa reticularis.\nCornulites (Ortonia) sublevis. Cyrtina Hamiltonensis.\nHederella Canadensis. Pterinea flabellum.\nAscodictyon stellatum. Actinopteria Boydii.\nPaleschara quadrangularis. Proetus Haldemani.\n\n* The Ramparts, on the Mackenzie, for instance, are 570 miles from the locality on the Hay River at which fossils were collected, and nearly 1,000 miles from La Saline on the Athabasca.\nTen of the species occur also in Iowa, in beds that are now referred to the Chemung.\n\nThese are:\n\nCampophyllum ellipticum. Spirifera cyrtiniformis.\nHederella Canadensis. Atrypa reticularis.\nProductella dissimilis. \" \" var. aspera.\nOrthis striatula. (= O. Iowensis.) Rhynchonella pugnus. (= R. alta.)\nStrophodonta demissa. Cryptonella Calvini.\n\nSeven are identical with species that are said to be characteristic of the Chemung of the States of New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nThese are:\n\nProductella lachrymosa, var. lima. Leptodesma Demus.\nSpirifera disjuncta. \" Jason.\nAthyris Angelica. Schizodus Chemungensis.\nRhynchonella cuboides. (venustula.)\n\nIn the Mackenzie River district, however, the subdivisions of the Devonian System that exist in the State of New York and Ontario are probably not recognizable, and there are strong reasons for supposing that the whole of the fossils reported upon in these pages belong to the \"Cuboides Zone.\"\n\nIt is true that Rhynchonella cuboides itself has so far been found only on the Peace and Hay Rivers, where it is invariably associated with Spirifera disjuncta (or Verneuili), but other fossils eminently characteristic of the Cuboides Zone will be noticed in nearly all the foregoing lists of species from the Athabasca and its tributaries or from the Mackenzie.\n\nIn a paper published as a Bulletin of the Geological Society of America and dated May, 1890, Prof. H. S. Williams cites three species, which, according to Kayser, are the \"principal fossils of the Cuboides Schichten\" in Europe, and thirteen others as \"conspicuous fossils in its fauna.\" Of the first three, two are Rhynchonella cuboides and Spirifera disjuncta (or Verneuili,) which, as before stated, occur together at the Peace and Hay Rivers. Of the thirteen others, five, viz., Productella subaculeata, Orthis striatula, Atrypa reticularis, Rhynchonella pugnus and Pentamerus galeatus are found in one or other of the lists of species on pages 247-50. Pachypora cervicornis, too, which was collected at the \"Ramparts\" by Mr. R. W. McFarlane in 1857, and Strophalosia productoides, which has since been found by Dr. Bell and Mr. McConnell in the Devonian rocks of the Athabasca, are both stated to be characteristic of the Cuboides Zone in Europe. The Cyathophyllum hexagonum of the Cuboides Zone of Belgium is represented at the \"Ramparts\" by\nC. arcticum, and the Spirifera concentrica of the same zone and locality, by the Athyris parvula of the Athabasca, which is little more than a diminutive race of S. concentrica.\n\nProf. Williams correlates the Cuboides Zone of Europe with the Tully Limestone of the State of New York, together with certain \"shaly strata several hundred feet above it.\" He suggests also that \"if we wish to express precise correlation in our classification of American rocks, the line between middle and upper Devonian formations should be drawn at the base of the Tully Limestone, to correspond with the usage of French, Belgian, German and Russian geologists, who include the Frasnien, Cuboides Schichten, and correlated zones in the upper Devonian.\" For comparison with the fauna of the Cuboides Zone in Europe, Prof. Williams says that \"the more important species in the Tully Limestone of New York are the brachiopods, of which he gives a list of thirteen. Of these, Chonetes Logani, var. Aurora, Productella spinulicosta, Strophodonta perplana, Spirifera tullia, Cyrtina Hamiltonensis, Atrypa reticularis, Atrypa aspera and Rhynchonella venustula (cuboides) occur also in the Devonian of the Mackenzie River district. The large variety of Orthis Tulliensis, from the Tully Limestone, figured by Prof. Williams, also, is practically indistinguishable from some of the specimens of O. striatula from the Athabasca River, Hay and Peace Rivers.\n\nThe occurrence of two specimens of Stringocephalus Burtini, associated with several examples of Rensselaeria laevis, Meek (not Hall), and the apparent absence of Spirifera disjuncta, at the \"Ramparts,\" on the Mackenzie River, are, doubtless, rather suggestive of the \"Stringocephalus limestone,\" but nearly all the other species found at this locality are characteristic of the Cuboides Zone as developed in Europe, or of its American representative the Tully Limestone.\n\nFinally the following table has been prepared to shew the close resemblance which the fauna of the Devonian rocks of the Mackenzie River district, as exemplified in these pages, bears to that of the same formation in Europe or upon the European side of the Atlantic.\n\n| Mackenzie River District | Europe |\n|--------------------------|--------|\n| Aulopora serpens         | Aulopora serpens |\n| Cyathophyllum arcticum   | Cyathophyllum hexagonum |\n| Cyathophyllum cespitosum | Cyathophyllum cespitosum |\n| Cyathophyllum Athabascensis | Cyathophyllum ceratites, Goldfuss |\n| Campophyllum ellipticum  | Campophyllum Seetenicum, Schluter |\n| Phillipsastraea Hennahi  | Phillipsastraea Hennahi |\n| Pachyphyllum Devoniense  | Pachyphyllum Devoniense |\n| Pachypora cervicornis    | Pachypora cervicornis |\nMackenzie River District.\n\nSpirorbis omphalodes.\nStomatopora moniliformis.\nStrophalosia productoides.\nProductella subaculeata, var. cataracta.\nProductella spinulicosta.\nOrthis striatula\nSpirifera disjuncta.\nSpirifera cyrtim\u00e6formis.\nSpirifera glabra, var.

F. WHITEAVES.\n\n6. The Fossils of the Devonian Rocks of the islands, shores or immediate vicinity of Lakes Manitoba and Winnepegosis.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nThe northern extremity of Lake Winnepegosis, it may be well to premise, is in the District of Saskatchewan, but by far the larger portion of that lake and the whole of Lake Manitoba are in the province of Manitoba. The shores of the southern portion of Lake Manitoba are so low and flat as to exhibit no rock exposures, and the area from which the fossils referred to in this report are collected is included between latitudes 51\u00b0 and 53\u00b0 N, and longitudes 98\u00b0 30' and 101\u00b0 10' W.\n\nPrior to the year 1888 but little was known of the fauna of the Devonian rocks of the islands and shores of Lakes Manitoba and Winnepegosis, or of the geographical distribution and stratigraphical relations of these rocks. Up to that date, the little that was known on either of these topics is to be found in Professor H. Youle Hind's official \"Report on the Assiniboine and Saskatchewan Exploring Expedition,\" published at Toronto by the Ontario Government in 1859, and in Mr. (now Dr.) J. W. Spencer's \"Report on the country between the Upper Assiniboine River and Lake Winnepegosis and Manitoba,\" published at Montreal in 1875, in the Report of Progress of the Geological Survey of Canada for 1874-75.\n\nIn the earlier of these two publications the existence in Manitoba of rocks of Devonian age was first announced by Mr. E. Billings, on the evidence of a few fossils collected by Prof. Hind at Snake Island, Lake Winnipegosis, and at Manitoba Island, Lake Manitoba, which were presented by or through him to the Museum of the Survey. The fossils from Snake Island, as identified or described by Mr. Billings in the twentieth chapter of Prof. Hind's report, are as follows: *Atrypa reticularis*, L., and its var. *aspera*; *Orthis Iowensis*, Hall; \"two small species of *Productus*\"; \"*Lucina elliptica*, Conrad;\" *Lucina occidentalis*, Billings (sp. nov.); two species of *Euomphalus*. \"a fragment of a *Loxonema*, most probably *L. nexilis*\"; \"fragments of *Orthoceras*, *Gomphoceras*, and a species of *Van-\n\nSeptember, 1892.\nIn reference to these Mr. Billings remarks that \"although we have none of the characteristic spirifers, corals or trilobites to guide us, yet I think that upon the evidence of the above fossils we can safely say that this locality is Devonian and most probably about the age of the Hamilton group.\" The fossils from Manitoba Island, he adds, \"are mostly the same as those from Snake Island, with the exception of two species of Chonectes and fragments of a large fish. There is also here a large Stromatopora, probably S. concentrica.\"\n\nThe present writer has never seen the specimens referred to by Mr. Billings as \"two small species of Productus,\" and as \"two species of Euomphalus\"; but, apart from these, the following is submitted as an amended list of the species obtained by Prof. Hind at Snake Island: Orthis striatula, Schlotheim (= O. Iowensis of Billings and Meek); Atrypa reticularis, L.; Atrypa reticularis, var. aspera, Schl.; Paracyclasp elliptica, Hall, non Conrad, of which Lucina occidentalis, Billings, which is incorrectly figured by his artist, is only a distorted form, both it and the typical P. elliptica being very doubtfully distinct from P. livata, Conrad; Loxonema, species undeterminable, the specimen being a mere fragment; Orthoceras Hindii (= Actinoceras Hindii, Whiteaves, but not a true Actinoceras); Gomphoceras, species undeterminable; and Gyroceras submutillatum, Whiteaves. The four specimens of Chonectes collected by Prof. Hind at Manitoba Island, and seventeen precisely similar ones obtained by Mr. Tyrrell and the present writer at the same locality in 1888, are all clearly referable to a single species, which is described and figured in this report under the name Chonectes Manitobensis. The exposures of Devonian limestone examined by Prof. Hind are those at Flat Rock Point, Steep Rock Point and Manitoba Island, on or in Lake Manitoba, and at Snake Island, in Lake Winnipegosis.\n\nIn 1874 Dr. J. W. Spencer examined several outcrops of Devonian rocks on the shores of Swan Lake, Manitoba, and Lake Winnipegosis, and gave the name of Dawson Bay to the north-western portion of the latter, in honour of Sir J. W. Dawson, the principal of McGill University. About a page and a half (pp. 61-62) of Dr. Spencer's Report is devoted to a general description of Lakes Winnipegosis and Manitoba, and two pages (pp. 67-68) to an account of the \"Deposits of Devonian Age\" in and around Lake Winnipegosis and Swan Lake. On page 68 he states that \"the best localities for fossils, so far as my observation extended, are Warren Island, in Swan Lake, and Points Wilkins and Carrollida, on Dawson Bay. The paleozoic fossils which I collected have been determined by Mr. Billings, who pronounces them all to be of Devonian age. The following were collected from rocks in situ at the above localities: Athyris, Cyrtina, Atrypa aspera, A. reticularis (Devonian type), Spirifer and Orthis.\" The \"Athyris\" of this list is A. cincta, Hall, and the\n\"Cycrina\" most probably C. Hamiltonensis of Hall. \"The following,\" he says, \"were obtained on the western shore of Dawson Bay, from slabs apparently derived from the neighbouring cliffs: Receptaculites (?), Favosites (2 species), Syringopora, Accurcularia profunda (this occurs in the Hamilton group in Iowa), Heliophyllum (like H. Halli), Diphyphyllum, Stromatopora, crinoidal columns, Gypidula, Rhynchonella, Atrypa reticularis, Athyris, Strophomena, a brachiopod resembling Stringocephalus, Enomphalus, Pleurotomaria, Bellerophon and Phillipsia.\" The specimens referred to in this list as \"Receptaculites (?)\" are two worn examples of Sphaerospongia tessellata; the two species of Favosites are F. Gothlandica, var., and Pachyppora cervicornis. The \"Heliophyllum like H. Halli\" is a new species of Actinocystis, which will be found described and figured in this report as A. variabilis; the \"Gypidula\" is Pentamerus comis; the \"brachiopod like Stringocephalus\" is S. Burtini; the \"Enomphalus\" is a small species of Straparollus here described and figured as S. jucinatus; the \"Bellerophon\" appears to be B. Pelops, Hall, and the \"Phillipsia\" a variety of Proctus Haldemani. To this list, also, may be added Orthothetes Chemungensis, var., and Conocardium Ohioense, Meek, which Prof. Whitfield says is the young of C. trigonale, Hall, though Prof. Hall himself says that his C. trigonale is a synonym of Conrad's C. cuneus. Finally, Dr. Spencer says, \"among other specimens which had evidently been transported from a greater or less distance, there were Pentamerus, Atrypa reticularis, A. aspera, Strophomena, Chonetes, Enomphalus, &c. The \"Pentamerus\" of this list is a Silurian species, which has since been described by the present writer under the name P. decussatus, and which, so far, has only been found in place at the foot of the Grand Rapids of the Saskatchewan.\n\nBy far the most complete examination of the geology around Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis that has yet been made, was effected by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell, M.A., B.Sc., of this Survey, in the summer seasons of 1888 and 1889. All the rock exposures on the islands, shores and immediate vicinity of these two lakes were examined by Mr. Tyrrell, who outlined the boundaries of the belt of Devonian rocks across this tract of country, discovered many new fossils in these rocks, and traced out the horizons in which these fossils occur, as well as the stratigraphical relations of the different bands of limestone to each other and to the Cretaceous rocks by which they are overlaid. In 1888 he discovered a small exposure of rocks of Silurian (Upper Silurian) age at Davis Point, Portage Bay, Lake Manitoba, and in 1889 a large area of rocks of the same age on the northeastern shore of Lake Winnipegosis. During both these years he was assisted by Mr. D. B. Dowling, B.A.Sc., in a topographical survey of this district and in the collection of fossils, and in the summer of 1888 the present writer had the pleasure of visiting nearly all the fossiliferous ex-\nposures in or around Lake Manitoba in company with Mr. Tyrrell. The collections of fossils which Mr. Tyrrell obtained from the Devonian rocks of the neighbourhood of these two lakes on the occasions referred to, and which will form the subject of the present report, are among the largest and most important that have been brought back by any of the Survey explorers for many years. The species represented in these collections are of unusual interest, not only on account of the number of new forms among them, but also as showing the close relations that exist, in so many respects, between the fauna of these rocks and that of the Devonian rocks of Europe. As several of the localities mentioned in this report are not to be found in any of the older maps, it may be mentioned that they are all laid down on the \"Geological Map of North-western Manitoba and portions of the districts of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan,\" recently published by this Survey, and here referred to as Mr. Tyrrell's map.\n\nThe whole of the species enumerated or described in this paper appear to be from the Middle or Upper Devonian, in the sense in which these terms have been recently used by Kayser, Tschernyschew and other European writers. By far the larger number are from the Stringocephalus zone, and, in order to avoid repetition, a capital s (S) will be prefixed to the names of each of these. According to Mr. Tyrrell, the rocks which are here called Middle Devonian, consist of \"a series of dolomites which extend upward from the basal beds at Devils Point, Lake Winnipegosis, to the upper beds exposed on the islands and shores of Dawson Bay, in which Stringocephalus is particularly abundant. The Upper Devonian of this district consists of a series of more or less impure limestones, extending from the lowest beds at Onion Point, Lake Manitoba; Snake Island, Lake Winnipegosis, and a few other localities, through the light grey shales (of the Cuboides zone) \"on the Red Deer River, &c., to the light pinkish limestones at Point Wilkins.\"\n\nIn the preparation of this paper the writer is indebted to Mr. L. M. Lambe, F.G.S., of this Survey, for valuable assistance in ascertaining the exact character of many of the species, especially the internal structures of the corals and the minute generic and specific features of the Polyzoa; to Dr. Fritz Frech, of Halle, Germany, who paid a short visit to Ottawa in October last, for critical suggestions in regard to the affinities of the Cyathophyllidae; and to Mr. E. O. Ulrich, of Newport, Kentucky, for notes on the specific relations of some of the Polyzoa.\n\nThe classification followed, as in previous parts of this volume, is mainly that adopted by Dr. Karl Zittel in his \"Handbuch der Palaeontologie,\" but the corals are arranged in conformity with Dr. Frech's memoir on the Cyathophyllidae and Zaphrentidae of the German Middle Devonian.*\n\n* Palaeontol.

Spencer in 1874, on the western shore of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis. On examining these specimens in the spring of 1888, the writer became convinced that they are identical with the *Spherospongia tessellata*, Phillips, (sp.) as described and figured by Dr. G. J. Hinde and others. A single specimen of the same species was collected by Mr. A. P. Low, in 1886, at the Limestone rapids of the Fawn branch of the Severn River.\n\nIn July, 1888, four tolerably good specimens of *S. tessellata* were obtained by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell and the writer on the north-west shore of Lake Manitoba, at Pentamerus Point. Two of these specimens were\n\n* Geol. Surv. Canada, Rep. Progr. 1874-75, 1875, p. 68.\nloose, but the other two were found in place, in a pale yellowish-brown coloured or nearly white dolomite of Devonian age, associated with *Stringocephalus*.\n\nIn 1889, a large number of specimens of a *Spharospongia*, which, in the writer's judgment, are undoubtedly identical with *S. tessellata*, were collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling at several localities on the shores and islands of Dawson Bay, especially on its south-eastern shore, at a point four or five miles north of the mouth of Shoal River, called Whitecaves Point on Mr. Tyrrell's map. These specimens, some of which are in unusually fine condition, were obtained in place, from a partly compact and partly vesicular dolomite, also holding *Stringocephalus*. The originals of all the figures on plate xxxiii are from Dawson Bay.\n\nAt this locality the specimens are more or less curved or twisted, especially near the base, the most curved specimen collected being that represented by fig. 6. They vary considerably in shape, size and proportions, but they all enclose a large central cavity. In some specimens the contour is subpyriform (figs. 1, and 10) and the height not much greater than the maximum breadth. Others, again, are subconical (fig. 9), arcuate and club shaped (fig. 6), or even almost cylindrical (fig. 4), and the latter, of course, are much higher than broad.\n\nThe details of their structure have been carefully studied by Mr. L. M. Lambe. He finds \"that, with the exception of a basal circlet and a very small area at the summit, the whole of the outer surface of the organism consists of close fitting hexagonal plates, which are slightly convex on their outer surface, arranged in alternating vertical rows, and that each plate has a small rounded elevation or tubercle in the centre, as described and figured by Phillips, Hinde and others. In addition to the central elevation, each of the hexagonal plates in the Dawson Bay specimens is marked by a few lines of growth parallel to the periphery, as shown in fig. 2.\n\nThe base of the organism is entirely closed, pointed and composed of four longitudinally elongated, five-sided plates, as represented in figs. 5 and 5a. These basal plates are marked with sculpture lines similar to those of the hexagonal plates, but in each of the basals the central or subcentral portion is developed into a comparatively large protuberance.\n\nThe external characters of the summit are not yet satisfactorily known, but in the only specimen in which any portion of it is preserved (fig. 1) the appearance is as there indicated, and there are no indications that the summit was covered by hexagonal plates.\n\nThe interior of the fossil presents the appearance of a number of interlocking, hollow cruciform 'spicules,' each of which has its central and undivided portion anchylosed to the centre of the inner surface of one of the hexagonal plates. The four rays of each 'spicule' lie in a plane parallel\nto that of the plate of which they form a part, and project considerably beyond its margin, but in two of the rays the general direction is vertical, and in the other two horizontal or lateral. All the rays are thickened at their junction with each other, striated longitudinally, and taper gradually to an acute point. The horizontal or lateral rays are longer than the vertical, and the former are curved slightly inward and downward. The distal rays, or those vertical rays which are directed forward, incline slightly inward, and the proximal rays, or those vertical rays which are directed backward, incline as slightly outward.\n\nThe rays of the 'spicules' of immediately adjacent plates interlock in a very regular manner, as shown by Dr. Schluter in his figure of *S. megaraphis* and as specially indicated in fig. 1 a, of plate xxxiii, in which the dotted lines represent the relative position of the hexagonal plates. The distal ray of each 'spicule' passes behind or inside of the proximal ray of the 'spicule' immediately above it. The lateral rays of each 'spicule' pass between the distal and proximal rays of the 'spicules' lying to the right and left of it, while the right lateral ray of each 'spicule' passes above the left lateral ray of the corresponding 'spicule' in the second row to the right of it.\n\nIn the narrow portion next to the base the 'spicules' appear to be partially amalgamated and are less clearly defined, so that this part of the fossil often presents a longitudinally ribbed appearance, the ribs being rounded or flattened and convergent posteriorly.\n\nAt the summit the distal rays of the last two or three 'spicules' in each longitudinal row are prolonged and convergent and ultimately meet together at its apex. These prolonged summit rays are hollow and flattened laterally and the central summit area formed by them is about fourteen millimetres broad at the base, in the only specimen (fig. 1.) in which it is preserved.\n\nIn attempting to free the organism from the matrix, the rock in these specimens from Dawson Bay often carries with it the outer covering of hexagonal plates. The result of the fracture of these plates from the 'spicules' of which they formed a part, is shown in fig. 1 a. When the rays of the 'spicules' are not present, which is often the case, their original shape and position are indicated by corresponding moulds of their exterior in the matrix. The spaces between the spicules, also, are represented by raised ridges crossing each other at right angles and directed diagonally across the specimen, thus giving the peculiar reticulated appearance shewn in figs. 1 and 4.\n\nThe maximum breadth of the largest specimen collected, which is too imperfect to show the height, is fifty six millimetres. The most perfect\n\n---\n\n* Zeitschr. der Deutsch. geol. gesellsch., 1887, vol. XXXIX, pl. i, fig. 6.\nspecimen is forty mm. high and twenty eight mm. in its maximum breadth. In the central portion of this specimen the dimensions of the rays of the 'spicules,' as measured from the centre of each 'spicule,' are as follows: length of the proximal rays, 3\u00b75 mm., length of the horizontal or lateral rays 5\u00b75 mm.; thickness of the rays at their bases 9 mm. The dimensions of the four basal plates shown in figs 5 and 5a are, length 4\u00b75 mm., breadth 3\u00b70 mm. The subcylindrical specimen represented by fig. 4 is rather more than 35 mm. in height, and 12\u00b75 mm. in its greatest breadth.*\n\nThis species is the type of Pengelly's genus Spharospongia, which was first characterized in 1861, and of Ferdinand Roemer's genus Polygonospherites, which was published in 1880. It is still doubtful which of these names should be retained, the first having been given on the hypothesis that the organism was originally a sponge, and the second on the assumption that it was not. Of late years Phillips' species has been referred to Spharospongia by Dr. G. J. Hinde in 1884 (op. cit.) and by Dr. Clemens Schluter in 1887*, but to Polygonospherites by Zittel in 1883\u2020, and by Herr Rauff\u2021, as well as by Professors Nicholson and Lydekker in 1889\u00a7. Dr. Hinde claims that it is a Lyssakine Hexactinellid sponge, but Herr Rauff maintains that it and the Receptaculitidae are not silicious organisms, but that their skeletons were originally calcareous and the silicious specimens mere pseudomorphs, or the result of subsequent silicification. The group therefore, he concludes, cannot be referred to the Hexactinellid sponges, and its systematic position is still entirely uncertain. In the present Report, however, the generic term Spharospongia is still retained, though not without some hesitation, on the ground that the hypothesis that the type of the genus was not a sponge, has not yet been conclusively proved.\n\nA specimen of a Spharospongia which appears to be indistinguishable from the present species, has been figured under the name S. cornucopiae, Goldfuss (Sp.)|| by Dr. Schluter, who states that it was recorded (aufgef\u00fchrt) by Goldfuss in 1832 as occurring in the Devonian rocks of the Eifel and named by him Scyphia cornucopiae. The volume in which the latter name was first indicated is inaccessible to the writer, but it would seem that the species was never properly characterized by Goldfuss, and hence that his specific name cannot be accepted as prior to Phillips', for, on page 30 of Davidson's Monograph of the British Devonian Brachiopoda the following passage occurs. \"In 1833\" (according to Dr. Schluter this\n\n* Zeitschr. der Deutsch. geol.

This volume, p. 200, pl. xxvii., figs. 7 and 8.\n\nDr. Frech, who has examined the specimens referred to *C. vespitosum*, Goldfuss, on page 200 of the present volume, thinks that the small mass of loosely aggregated corallites from the Peace River, collected by Professor Macoun in 1875, is conspecific with *C. vespitosum*, but that the simple, or nearly simple, specimens from the Hay River, collected by Mr. McConnell in 1887, are referable to *C. dianthus*, Goldfuss. A single example of a coral which has precisely the same internal structure as these Hay River specimens of *C. dianthus*, and which differs from them chiefly in having six lateral buds, was collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889, at the Lower Salt Spring on the Red Deer River.\n\n*Cyathophyllum Waskasense.*\u2020 (N.

Epitheca faintly ribbed longitudinally, transversely striated and marked also with a few irregularly disposed constrictions and re-elevations, the results of periodic arrests of growth: calyx rather deep, flat at the bottom and with nearly vertical sides: primary septa twenty four, extending about half way to the centre and slightly irregular: secondary septa equal in number to the primaries, but not reaching more than half as far inward. Internal structure, as seen in longitudinal sections, consisting of a very narrow outer zone of vesicular tissue and of a broad inner tabulate area. The vesicles are small and rather regularly disposed, while the tabulae, which are for the most part complete and regular in their disposition, are very close-set flat in the centre but bent downward at their outer margins.\n\nRed Deer River, at the Upper Salt Spring and about five miles from Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889; abundant. Beardy Island, Dawson Bay, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: one specimen.\n\nThe specimens for which the foregoing name is proposed appear to differ from those which are here referred to C. dianthus, in the much greater regularity and completeness of the tabulae in the central tabulate area.\n\nCyathophyllum petraeoides. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 34, figs. 1, 1a and 2.\n\nCorallum simple, straight or slightly curved, in well preserved specimens attached to some foreign body by a small and partially clasping basal expansion, conical and broadly spreading, the entire height being not much greater than the width at the summit. Outer surface marked with faint longitudinal costae, also by fine transverse striae and a few rather coarse wrinkles at irregular intervals. Calyx circular, oblique in some specimens but not in others, subconical but irregular in shape, usually very deep and in most cases excavated to within an extremely short distance of the base: septa about forty five in number and apparently equal in size, consisting of mere ridges, which are acute and moderately prominent in the upper portion of the sides of the cup, but which are much more strongly developed at and towards its base. Internal structure, as shown in longitudinal sections, consisting of vesicular tissue between the septa: tabulae almost but not entirely absent, a single transverse diaphragm at the bottom of the cup being observable in two out of the ten specimens collected.\n\nDimensions of the specimen figured: greatest height, thirty nine millimetres, maximum width, twenty nine mm. In another specimen the\ngreatest height is about forty mm., and the width at the summit thirty two.\n\nOnion Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F.

Red Deer River, at the Lower Salt Spring (five specimens) and at the Upper Salt Spring (four specimens): J. B. Tyrrell, 1889.\n\nThis species is singularly like a Petraia, both in its external shape and internal structure, but it differs from that genus in the development of vesicular tissue between the septa. It resembles the \"Zaphrentis solida\" of Hall and Whitfield, from the Devonian rocks of Iowa, in many respects, but differs therefrom in the almost entire absence of tabulae. In Z. solida the tabulae are described as \"distinct, closely arranged\" and \"extending half the diameter of the cup.\" If all the specimens collected by Mr. Tyrrell and the present writer had been of small size, the absence of tabulae in them might be attributable to their being immature individuals in which these structures were not yet developed, but, as a matter of fact, most of the specimens of C. petraeoides are considerably larger than the largest known examples of Z. solida.\n\nGroup of Cyathophyllum hecagonum, Goldfuss.*\n\n(S.)

A single specimen of a coral collected by Dr. R. Bell in 1877, from the Long Portage of the Missinaibi River, in the district of Algoma, and referred to in the Report of Progress of this Survey for 1887-88 (page 5, c) as Cyathophyllum Davidsoi, has since been found to be referable to the present species.\n\nThe generic name Stylastraea was proposed by Lonsdale in 1845, for a fossil coral from the Carboniferous rocks of Russia. The type of the genus, which Lonsdale described and figured under the name S. inconfera, has since been pronounced to be a Lithostrotion, by D'Orbigny, in the \"Prodrome de Pal\u00e9ontologie,\" published in 1850, and by Edwards and Haime\n\n* Dr. Frech thinks that the Cyathophyllum arcticum of Meek, from the Devonian rocks of Alaska and the Mackenzie River district, is synonymous with this species, as suggested by the writer on page 199 of the present volume.\nin the \"Polypiers Fossiles des Terrains Palaeozoiques,\" published in 1851. Morris, in the second edition of his \"Catalogue of British Fossils\" (1854), Lindstr\u00f6m, in his \"Index to the genera of Palaeozoic Corals\" (Stockholm, 1883), and Etheridge, in the first volume of his \"Fossils of the British Islands\" (1888), also make *Stylastera*, Lonsdale, a synonym of *Lithostrotion*, though Zittel, in the first volume of his \"Handbuch der Palaeontologie\" (1876-80), regards it as a synonym of *Diphyphyllum*, but uses the name *Stylastera*, Fromentel, for a Liassic genus of corals belonging to the *Astreidae*.\n\nAlthough they agree perfectly with Professor Whitfield's description and figures of the coral from the Devonian rocks of Ohio which he calls *Stylastera Anna*, it yet seems to the writer that the specimens collected by Dr. Bell and Mr. Tyrrell are referable to *Cyathophyllum* rather than to *Stylastera*, and that they are very nearly related to the *C. rugosum* of Hall. From the last named species they seem to differ only in the circumstance that their septa only reach about half way to the centre and that they are not continued, as carinations, on the upper surface of the tabulae.\n\n(S.) **Cyathophyllum profundum**, Hall. (Sp.)\n\n*Aceratia profunda*, Hall. 1858. Rep. Geol. Surv. Iowa, vol. I, pt. 2, p. 477, pl. i, figs. 7a b, c.\n\n\"Western shore of Dawson Bay, from slabs apparently derived from the neighbouring cliffs,\" J. W. Spencer, 1874: two or three specimens in which the internal structure of the corallites is beautifully preserved. These were identified with the present species by E. Billings, on page 68 of the Report of Progress of this Survey for 1874-75.\n\nSince then, precisely similar specimens have been collected \"in place\" by J. B. Tyrrell, at Lake Manitoba, on the east side of the Narrows, in 1888, and by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, at Lake Winnipegosis, on three islands in the southern part of Dawson Bay, and on the Red Deer River at the Lower Salt Spring, in 1889. In each of these, the average maximum diameter of the adult corallites is from thirteen to fifteen millimetres, and the number of their septa from thirty eight to forty.* Some of the septa extend to the centre and others not quite so far, but these latter are of varying length and do not regularly alternate with the former. There are no tabulae; the spaces between the septa being filled with vesicular tissue, the general direction of the vesicles being upward and outward.\n\nAccording to Dr. Rominger, \u2020 \"the corals described under the name\n\n---\n\n* Prof. Hall says that there are from forty one to forty six septa in full grown individuals of his *Aceratia profunda*.\n\u2020 Geol. Surv. Michigan, Fossil Corals, p. 106.\nAcervularia Davidsoi and Acerr. profunda, which latter,\" he considers \"merely as a variety of the former, are in structure identical with Cyathophyllum rugosum.\" \"The genus Acervularia is represented as having its central portion of the polyp cells surrounded by an internal wall, but neither the above-mentioned corals nor the typical forms of the genus Acervularia (Cyath. pentagonum and Cyath. annus of Goldfuss) exhibit an internal wall. In the circumference of the abrupt inner cell-pits of all these forms a sort of annular demarkation is conspicuous in transverse sections, because the shorter ones of the alternately larger and smaller radial lamelle terminate there with somewhat thickened edges, but they never combine into a closed, ring-like wall.\" While following Dr. Rominger in regarding Acervularia profunda as a Cyathophyllum, and Dr. Frech, who has seen the specimens collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, in referring them to the group of C. hexagonum, it is thought desirable to retain Hall's specific name for these specimens, as they correspond much better with his description and figures of A. profunda than with those of A. Davidsoi.\n\nCyathophyllum profundum. (Var.)\n\nPlate 34, figs. 4 and 4a.\n\nCorallum large, composite, massive, in the only specimen known to the writer depressed subspherical: corallites polygonal or rounded polygonal, intimately united throughout their length, and separated only by a single and extremely thin wall, unequal in size, the adult ones averaging from seventeen to nineteen millimetres in their maximum diameter. Calyces shallowly concave externally, the abruptly and not very deeply excavated central portion occupying rather more than one half of the entire diameter of each corallite; septa as many as fifty four in number in the largest corallites; at the bottom of the cup and below it many of the septa reach to the centre, the others being shorter but very unequal in length. Internal structure, as shown in longitudinal sections, consisting of fine vesicular tissue between the septa, their being no tabulae nor arched carine.\n\nSouth end of Snake Island, Lake Winnipegosis, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: a single colony, about six inches in length, five in breadth and two and a half in height, a portion of which is figured. The specimen seems to indicate or represent a local variety of C. profundum, in which the adult corallites are larger, their septa more numerous and the interseptal vesicles proportionately smaller and more numerous than those of the typical form. Dr. Frech thinks that the specimen is very nearly related to the C. hypocrateriforme of Goldfuss.\nGroup of *Cyathophyllum* (*Blothrophyllum*) *decorticatum*, Billings.\n\n*Cyathophyllum Athabascense*.

Tyrrell, 1889: a single and perfect specimen, which appears to be a mere variety of this species. It differs from the types from the Devonian rocks of the Athabasca River only in having its central area occupied by flexuous, irregularly disposed but for the most part continuous tabulae, rather than by large interseptal dissepiments, and in its narrower vesiculose peripheral zone, the inner margin of which is more clearly defined.\n\n(S.) *Columnaria* (*Cyathophylloides*) *disjuncta*. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 34, figs. 3, 3a and 3b.\n\nCorallum composite, consisting apparently of a colony of cylindrical, straight or flexuous, ascending or erect corallites, which are separate but sometimes partially in contact, and more or less closely aggregated: diameter of the corallites averaging about five millimetres, their mural investment single and external. Surface markings of the corallites unknown, though in transverse sections there are indications of longitudinal ribs corresponding to the septa within. Calyces deep, with erect sides: primary septa thirteen, simple, neither crenulated nor denticulated, very thin, laminar and extending to the centre at and below the bottom of the cup: secondary septa similar in number and structure to the primaries, but reaching only half way to the centre. The only internal structures, besides the septa, are rather distant, thin and laminar horizontal diaphragms, which partake partly of the nature of tabulae and partly of dissepiments. These diaphragms either form almost continuous floors across the corallites (at intervals of from one to two millimetres apart) and thus resemble tabulae, except that their continuity appears to be interrupted by the septa, or they are disconnected and not on the same plane and thus partake more of the nature of dissepiments, though they are never curved.\n\nPentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F. Whiteaves, 1888. South-west shore of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, at the mouth of Steep Rock River, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889. At each of these localities a few comparatively large portions of a single colony were collected,\nin which the corallites are everywhere surrounded by hard compact dolomite, though their interior is quite free from the matrix. The specimens present good longitudinal and transverse sections of the corallites, which show the internal structure of the latter admirably, but the surface markings of the corallites are nowhere visible, and the exact mode of growth of the whole corallum is uncertain.\n\nThis species differs from the typical forms of *Columnaria* in its cylindrical, separate, and probably fasciculated corallites, and belongs to an aberrant section of that genus, for which Dybowski has proposed the name *Cyathophylloids*. It is clearly congeneric, and may even prove to be conspecific, with the *Cyathophylloides Rhenanum* of Frech, from the Devonian rocks of the Eifel, which Dr. Frech informs the present writer is also a *Columnaria*. Around Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis, too, *C. disjuncta* has, so far, been found invariably associated with *Stringocephalus Bartini*, as *C. Rhenanum* is at Paffrath.\n\n(S.) **Amplexus**, or **Diphyphyllum**. (Sp.)\n\nPlate 35, figs. 2 and 2a.\n\nA number of fragmentary specimens of a species of *Amplexus*, *Pycnostylus* or *Diphyphyllum* were collected by Mr. Dowling in 1889, on the western shore of Dawson Bay, on two small points, one two miles and a half and the other four miles and a half north of the mouth of the Red Deer River. These specimens do not show conclusively whether the entire corallum was originally composite or simple, the surface markings are unknown, as are also the characters of the calyces. On the other hand, the internal structure of the corallites (or corallum) is well preserved and clearly shown in numerous natural sections. The specimens consist of straight or flexuous cylindrical tubes, which average about five millimetres in length, are imperfect at both ends and imbedded in compact or vesicular dolomite. The interior of these tubes is composed of a very narrow outer or peripheral and septate zone and of a broad central tabulate area. The outer zone appears to be bounded internally by an inner wall. The septa, which are equal in length and thirty-two in number, all extend from the outer to the supposed inner wall, and terminate on the inner surface of the latter, in some cases as continuous and slightly raised longitudinal ridges, in others as linear rows of minute tubercles, both modifications being observable in the same tube. The interseptal spaces between the outer and inner wall are traversed by small dissepiments. In the central tabulate area, which occupies about four fifths of the entire diameter, the tabulae are for the most part flexuous and irregular in their shape and disposition, the distances between them varying from half a\nmillimetre to two millimetres. Most of the tabulae are complete and stretch completely across from one side of the inner wall to the other, but they sometimes inosculate and occasionally one or two incomplete ones are intercalated between two of the others.\n\nDr. Frech, who has examined the specimens collected by Mr. Dowling, is of the opinion that they belong to the genus *Amplexus* and that they are nearly related to the *A. Hercynicus* of A. R\u00f6mer, from the Stringocephalus limestone of Germany. Dr. Frech thinks that the supposed inner wall of the tubes, represented on Plate 35, fig. 2a, is caused by the cutting of the curved tabulae. On the other hand, there are clearly dissepiments between the specimens from Dawson Bay, which are stated to be wanting in *Amplexus*, and there is a remarkably close resemblance, in size, shape and internal structure, between these specimens and the *Diphyphyllum stramineum* of Billings, which Dr. Rominger says is both congeneric and conspecific with the *Eridophyllum Simcoense* of the same author, and which therefore should be called *D. Simcoense*. In the actual types of *D. stramineum*, however, the central area of the corallites is not separated from the peripheral cycle by an internal wall (as pointed out by Dr. Rominger), the septa are unequal in length and extend much farther inward than do those of the Dawson Bay specimens, and the tabulae are straighter and more regular in their disposition.\n\n(S.) **Actinocystis variabilis.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 35, figs. 3 and 3a.\n\nCorallum simple, slightly curved, varying in shape from broadly turbinate and widely expanding, with the breadth at the summit exceeding the height, to cylindro-conical and somewhat contracted at the summit; outer surface apparently almost smooth and marked only with a few transverse wrinkles; calyx rather deep, conical, narrow at the base; septa about eighty five in number, extending from the exterior to within a short distance from the centre, but feebly developed, thin, and rarely, if ever, quite straight, their regularity being frequently disturbed by anchylosis with the walls of the interseptal vesicles. Internal structure, apart from the septa, essentially the same as that of *Cystiphyllum*, and consisting exclusively of coarse vesicular tissue. The vesicles are very large in the central area and diminish gradually in size towards the periphery. As viewed in longitudinal sections, they appear as lenticular cells which radiate obliquely upward and outward from the centre of the coral.\n\n\"Western shore of Dawson Bay,\" Lake Winnipegosis, \"from slabs apparently derived from the neighbouring cliffs,\" J. W. Spencer, 1874: one small specimen, which was referred to by E. Billings as a \"*Heliophyllum*\" September, 1892.\n(like *H.

B. Tyrrell, 1889. A few specimens, which seem to be intermediate in their characters between the typical *F. Gothlandica* and the var. *Billingsii*, and which can scarcely be distinguished from the *F. Hamiltoniae* of Hall, were collected at each of these localities.\n\nMost of the specimens are well preserved portions of large colonies, but one large and nearly perfect example is a depressed expansion of irregular form, which measures about eleven inches in length, seven inches and a half in breadth and five inches in height. In each specimen the corallites are polygonal (not rounded polygonal) and most of them are nearly equal in size, their average diameter being about three millimetres. The septa are represented by rather short, rounded and apparently very fragile spines, which are usually broken off. The mural pores are disposed in one or two (rarely three) longitudinal rows on each of the prismatic faces of the corallites, and where there are two rows the pores are sometimes alternate and at others opposite. The tabulae are complete, continuous and rather regularly disposed, but they do not show the \"marginal punctiform depressions\" which Dr. Rominger describes as one of the characters of *F. Billingsii*.\n(P.) Pachypora cervicornis, DeBlainville.

A few specimens also were collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889 at several localities in the southern portion of Lake Winnipegosis, as at the south end of Snake Island, the north side of South Manitou Island and Point Brabant, also at two localities on the south-west side of Dawson Bay.\n\nThe specimens from these localities consist of rather small or medium sized corals, with much the same general shape and proportions as Pachypora polymorpha. The stems are cylindrical, widely and doubly bifurcating, with an average diameter of about eight or nine millimetres in the thickest part. The corallum in each seems to differ from that of P. polymorpha in the much greater obliquity with which its corallites open outward to the surface; also, in the circumstance that their apertures are frequently transversely semielliptical, semilunar, or sub-triangular, and broader than high, with the lower lip of each distinctly projecting. In most respects, these specimens agree remarkably well with the published descriptions and figures of Alveolites cryptodens, Billings, and even with the types of that species in the Museum of the Survey, but the throats of their corallites are almost invariably filled with dolomite, and shew no traces of the three internal ridges or \"longitudinal crests\" which are so characteristic of A. cryptodens.\n(S.)\n\n**Alveolites Vallorum**, Meek.\n\n*Alveolites vallorum*, Meek. 1868.

B. Tyrrell, 1889.\n\nThe specimens of *A. vallorum* from the Hay, Mackenzie and Peace Rivers referred to on page 207, have the outer surface of the corallum well preserved, but the structure of the interior of the corallites is more or less obliterated by crystallization, the corallites being completely filled with matrix. In the specimens from Lake Winnipegosis, however, which do not occur in shale, but in a compact or vesicular dolomite, the exterior of the corallum is not so well preserved, but the corallites are nearly free from the matrix throughout their length. The corallites are laterally compressed, and their apertures vary in outline from narrowly elongated or somewhat crescentic to polygonal, and in their greatest diameter from half a millimetre to a millimetre and a half. The septal spines are well developed, but apparently very fragile. As many as from six to eight rows of these can be counted, though with difficulty, but there do not appear to be ever as many as twelve rows, as there are said to be in *A. squamosus*. The tabulae are complete and often rather regularly disposed.

These were collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889, one on a small island on the east side of Dawson Bay and the other on a small island at the south end of the bay. The more perfect of these two specimens has ten of the calycinal plates preserved and not quite two inches of the column. Each of these calycinal plates is hexagonal, slightly convex externally, smooth in the centre, but crenulated round the margin. The column is thick, averaging about seventeen millimetres, or about three\nquarters of an inch, in diameter, circular and annulated, with one or two flat articulations usually alternating with a single raised and moderately prominent one. In some portions of columns, however, from the same localities, the raised articulations bear rounded and much elevated tubercles. Both of the specimens are far too fragmentary to be identified, even generically, but they bear a striking resemblance to the *C. decudartylus*, as figured by the Sandbergers, and to the *C. typus*, as figured by Zittel, though some paleontologists regard *Ctenocrinus* as synonymous with *Metocrinus*.\n\n**VERMES.**\n\n*Spirorbis omphalodes*, Goldfuss.\n\n*Serpula omphalodes*, Goldfuss. 1826-33.

Under surface covered with an extremely thin laminar epitheca; upper surface consisting of a broad central celluliferous area, surrounded by a projecting lateral expansion of the epitheca, which is entirely devoid of cells. Celluliferous area marked with large star-shaped maculae, whose centres are about six mm. apart. Outer and noncelluliferous expansion variable in breadth, its upper surface marked by longitudinal and nearly parallel raised lines of unequal size, which in some specimens are interwoven with a few similar but concentric lines. Zoecia (or autopores) at first recumbent but ultimately erect, very short, cylindrical, about a third of a millimetre broad at their summits, arranged in subparallel lines which radiate from the maculae, but very closely disposed, and in some cases almost touching each other: orifices of the zoecia frequently closed by flat opercula, and surrounded in each case by a thin, slightly elevated and apparently granulose peristome. Interspaces very narrow, occupied by a single series of polygonal interstitial cells or mesopores (over whose apertures a thin smooth calcareous membrane or \"roof\" is usually stretched) except on the maculae, where they are disposed in small clusters. Lunarium nearly or quite obsolete. Microscopic sections show that the interstitial cells or mesopores are comparatively large, and placed one over the other, even in the maculae, so as to form tabulated tubes, and not vesicular tissue as in Fistulipora.\n\nLake Winnipegosis, at a small island on the south-east side of Dawson Bay, J.

Tyrrell, 1889; two specimens, loose.\n\nThis species is referred to Pinacotrypa rather than to Fistulipora or Lichenalia, on the authority of Mr. E. O. Ulrich, who, in a letter to the present writer, dated 23rd September, 1891, makes the following remarks on two of the best specimens collected by Mr. Tyrrell, which were sent to him for examination: \"This is a remarkable form which I think may be safely described as a new species of Pinacotrypa. The general expression of the surface is much as in several species of Fistulipora, but the constant nummiform shape is distinctive. The chief peculiarity, however, is the longitudinal striation of the basal lamina. This is a very remarkable feature, and one quite unknown to me. The cells are smaller and the macule more distinct than in P. elegans, the Fistulipora elegans of Rominger.\"\n(S.)

Tyrrell, 1889.\n\nThese specimens agree very well with Mr. Ulrich\u2019s description and figures of *F. vera*, but they are not sufficiently well preserved to show the \u201cvery minutely granulose\u201d surface of \u201cboth branches and dissepiments,\u201d said to be characteristic of that species. Only the outer or non-celluliferous side is exposed in any of these specimens, but the shape, number and disposition of the zoecia has been clearly ascertained by scraping away small portions of the exterior.

B. Tyrrell and D. B. Dowling, 1889.\n\nThe specimens from these localities agree fairly well with Hall's figures of *F. dispanda*, but their identification with that species is doubtful, owing to the contradictory nature of the measurements given in its description. They differ from the specimens here referred to *P. vera*, in their straggling mode of growth, striated noncelluliferous surface, large oblong fenestrules, and in their more slender branches and dissepiments.\n\n(S.)\n\n**Polypora (porosa ? var.)

Branches slender, usually zigzag when the fenestrules are alternate, but occasionally straight where they are opposite and appearing externally, on the noncelluliferous side, as smooth (?) slightly angular longitudinal ridges, which are a little broader than the transverse noncelluliferous dissepiments. Fenestrules large, a little longer than wide, elliptical or approaching to hexagonal in outline and averaging about 8 mm. in length and 6 mm. in width. In a distance of six millimetres there are four fenestrules as measured longitudinally, and six as measured transversely. Cell apertures disposed in from two to four alternating longitudinal rows, about four of these apertures in each row to the length of a fenestrule.\n\nMonroe Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B.

Dowling, 1889; a few specimens from each of these localities.\n\nIn each of these it is only the noncelluliferous outer surface that is exposed, the characters of the zoecia having been ascertained by scraping down small portions of the branches. The close affinity of these specimens to the *P. porosa* of Hall was suggested to the writer by Mr. Ulrich.\nFrom that species they appear to differ principally in their much more slender branches and dissepiments, more hexagonal fenestrules, and in the greater extent to which the arrangement of the zoecia in two rows prevails.\n\nBRACHIOPODA.\n\n(S.)

Ventral valve compressed convex, its cardinal border armed on each side of the beak with three or four slender and widely divaricating spines, which increase in length outward: its beak inconspicuous, minute and not projecting; its hinge area narrow, with a small triangular fissure. Dorsal valve shallowly concave, its beak minute and its hinge area narrower than that of the ventral.\n\nSurface marked with very minute radiating raised lines, which increase in number at variable distances from the beaks, by bifurcation, trifurcation or intercalation, so that around the outer margin as many as from seventy\nto a hundred can be counted under a lens. In addition to these, the exterior of well preserved specimens is marked with exceedingly fine and close-set, concentric raised lines. Interior of the valves minutely papillose. Muscular impressions unknown.\n\nThe dimensions of two average specimens are as follows: of one, maximum length nearly ten millimetres, greatest breadth, nineteen; of another, length ten mm. and a quarter, breadth twenty.\n\nRather abundant at the north end of Manitoba Island, in Lake Manitoba, where it was collected by Prof. H. Y. Hind in 1858 and by J. B. Tyrrell and the present writer in 1888.\n\nThis small Chonetes seems to differ from the C. carinata (or coronata) of Conrad, as described and figured by Prof. Hall in the fourth volume of the Palaeontology of the State of New York, in its uniformly smaller size, flatter and more transversely elongated valves, finer sculpture and in the greater length and smaller number of the spines on the cardinal margin of the ventral valve. According to Prof. Hall, a careful measure of the radiating striae on numerous specimens of C. carinata from the State of New York \"shows that they range from nine to fifteen striae in the space of two tenths of an inch,\" while specimens from Illinois gave from nine to twelve in the same space. In three average examples of C. Manitobensis, from twenty to twenty-two radiating raised lines were counted in a corresponding space.\n\nC. Manitobensis is also very closely allied to the C. striatella of Dalman, from the Silurian (Upper Silurian) of Europe, and to the C. Hardrensis of Phillips, from the English Devonian. Of the former it may prove to be a local and stratigraphical variety, and from the latter (as described by Davidson) it seems to differ chiefly in the circumstance that its radiating \"striae\" are not minutely spinose.\n\n(S.)

Ventral valve much flatter than the dorsal, with a concave sinus at and near the front margin, its hinge area apparently broader in the direction of its height than that of the dorsal, and its beak prominent but nearly straight. Dorsal valve strongly convex, its umbonal\nand central region tumid, its umbo rather prominent, and its beak incurved and slightly recurved.\n\nSurface markings consisting of fine, subequal and closely disposed, radiating raised lines, which increase in number by bifurcation, trifurcation and intercalation, and are crossed by a few irregularly disposed, but for the most part distant, concentric striae of growth. Around the outer margin of the dorsal valve figured (fig. 3), about 136 radiating raised lines can be counted, and in a still larger dorsal valve, which is not figured, about 150 were counted.\n\nThree casts of the interior of the dorsal valve of a shell which is probably referable to this species, from the local base of the Middle Devonian at Devils Point, Lake Winnipegosis (figs. 5 and 5 a) shew two linear grooves, which probably represent the impressions made by the brachial processes, diverging on each side of the umbo, also a minute and very short slit, which widens into a small subcircular or subrhomboidal perforation in the apex of the beak. Muscular impressions not clearly defined in any of the specimens collected.\n\nOf the two testiferous specimens figured, the one showing the dorsal valve only (fig. 3) is thirteen millimetres long and sixteen broad, while the one drawn to shew the front margin (fig. 4) and relative convexity of the two valves, is nineteen mm. broad and eleven mm. and a half in depth or thickness, though it is too imperfect posteriorly to show the exact length.\n\nDawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, on the east side, at Whiteaves Point, and on two small islands in its immediate vicinity; on a small island about three miles north of Salt Point, and, on the west side, at the first small point north of the mouth of the Red Deer River, J. B. Tyrrell and D. B. Dowling, 1889: one to three specimens from each of these localities, most of the former being detached dorsal valves, the only example with both valves preserved being very immature.\n\nThe specimens for which the foregoing provisional name is suggested may prove to be only a small local variety of of the typical O. Iowensis of Hall, as originally described and figured in the Geology of Iowa, but not of the large northern form which has been referred to that species. They seem to differ from the typical O. Iowensis chiefly in their much smaller size and more quadrangular form; also, though this may be due to their being highly dolomitized, in the apparent absence of the \"tubular openings\" on the surface of the radiating striae, and of \"fine pores or punctae over the entire surface,\" which are said to be characteristic of O.

The ventral valve figured \"is a good representative of the *Leptana interstrialis*, Phillips, as it appears at Lummaston, in South Devonshire. I have compared it with good specimens identified by Davidson. Our *Strophodonta inaequistrata*, *S. Patersoni* and *S. Cayuta* are allied forms, but your specimens are closer to the Lummaston forms than to either of our New York species.\" Davidson's figure of *L. interstrialis* on plate iii of the \"Supplement to the British Devonian Brachiopoda,\" leave no doubt on the mind of the present writer that Phillips' species belongs to Hall's genus *Strophodonta*.\n\n(S.) **Spirifera fimbriata**, Conrad.\n\n*Deltthyris fimbriata*, Conrad. 1842.

A single specimen of this species was also collected by Mr. J. B. Tyrrell or Mr. D. B. Dowling in 1889, at each of the following localities on or near Lake Winnipegosis: in the southern portion of the lake at a small island off Weston Point; in the Stringocephalus zone at several exposures in the eastern, south-western and western shore of Dawson Bay; on two small islands on the east side of the bay, and at the south end of Rowan Island, on its west side; also, in the Cuboides zone on the Red Deer River, half a mile below the Lower Salt Spring.\n\nSpirifera (Martinia) Richardsonii, Meek.\n\nPlate 37, fig. 7.\n\nSpirifera (Martinia) Richardsoni, Meek. 1868.

They are all a little longer than broad, nearly smooth, with an undeveloped or very feebly developed mesial fold and sinus.\n\nIn 1888 Mr. Dowling collected numerous specimens of a small Spirifera, which is probably referable to the present species, on the south-west side of Dawson Bay, at the second point north of the Red Deer River. These specimens (one of which is figured) are invariably hollow and imbedded in a vesicular dolomite in such a way as to show the character of the interior of the valves only, the spiral coils and hinge teeth being beautifully preserved. The hinge teeth of the ventral valve are slightly curved and diverge rapidly outward and forward. The shelly cones consist of only five loosely coiled, separate and rather distant, apparently smooth volutions, on each side.\n\nSeptember, 1892.\nCyrtina Hamiltonensis, Hall.\n\nCyrtia Hamiltonensis, Hall. 1857.

On Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis, the two varieties, which almost always occur together, are remarkably constant to their respective characters. At each of these lakes the specimens of *A. reticularis* often have the broad \"marginal fringe\" or \"foliated expansion\" of the ventral valve preserved entire, but, as the matrix in which they occur is a hard dolomite, it is very difficult to reduce such specimens to a portable size without injuring them. The marginal fringe of the specimen figured (from Pentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba) is nearly an inch and three-quarters broad, and the shell has a maximum breadth of about four inches and a-half.\n\n(S.) **ATRYPA RETICULARIS**, var. **ASPERA**, Schlotheim.\n\nFor a list of the synonyms of this shell, with references, see page 229 of the present volume.\n\nLocalities, collectors and dates practically the same as those for the preceding species.

Marginal outline subovate, the length being about one-fourth greater than the height: outer margin of the valves in adult specimens shallowly but distinctly lobate. Anterior side short, its wing comparatively large, pointed and projecting, and the lower part of its margin, beneath the wing, rounding abruptly into the base, at least in the immature specimen represented by fig. 3, but apparently somewhat produced above and sinuate below in adults, as in the original of fig. 1, which shows indications also of what seems to have been a byssal sinus, below the anterior ear of the right valve. Posterior side longer than the anterior: the outline of the former not satisfactorily shewn in any of the full or even half-grown specimens collected, though in the largest individual (fig. 1) it appears to be longest and obtusely pointed a little below the middle, beneath which it narrows rapidly into the base below, in two shallowly concave curves, with a slight prominence between them. Posterior wing of the adult shell elongated, its exact contour unknown, but, in the left valve of a very young shell which may possibly be referable to this species (fig. 4), the posterior alation is concave at its outer margin, and the posterior end rounded and somewhat produced below. Beaks rather small, scarcely raised above the highest level of the hinge line and placed a little in advance of the mid-length.\n\nCentral portion of each valve marked by from five to seven, usually six, rounded and slightly nodulous radiating plications, which broaden rapidly outward and project a little beyond the front margin as rounded lobes, with a shallowly concave sinus between each pair. The spaces between the plications and the posterior wing also, are marked with narrow radiating ridges, and the concentric markings consist of numerous, more or less close-set, raised lines, which seem to be most prominent on the posterior wing of the left valve. Hinge dentition and muscular impressions unknown.\n\nDawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis,\u2014on the south-east side, at Whiteaves Point, and on a small island between that point and Salt Point; on the south-west shore, at a small point about two miles east of the mouth of Steep Rock River, and at an exposure about two miles west of Salt Point, J.

Ventral border straight for the greater part of its length; postero-dorsal margin moderately elevated, most prominent and faintly subangular a little behind the midlength; hinge line short, oblique; posterior or anal margin broadly and obliquely rounded, though its junction with the end the farthest removed from the beaks is either narrowly rounded or somewhat pointed umbones prominent, much narrower in their dorso-ventral than in their lateral diameter; beaks terminal, curved strongly inward and slightly forward.\n\nSurface markings and characters of the interior of the valves unknown. The casts of the interior of the valves, however, are marked with a few, irregularly disposed but for the most distant lines of growth or concentric wrinkles.\n\nIn the largest specimen collected (the original of fig. 5) the maximum length is thirty-eight millimetres, the greatest height twenty-one mm., and the thickness through the closed valves is estimated at twenty mm., but in other specimens, such as the one represented by figs. 6 and 6a, the greatest thickness considerably exceeds the maximum height.\n\nPentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F. Whiteaves, 1888: ten specimens, most of which are very small.

B. Tyrrell, 1889.\n\nIn this species the greatest height of the valves is invariably a little behind the midlength, the dorsal margin being longer than the anal. In this and in some other respects the largest specimen collected (fig. 5) differs materially from the M. gibbosa of Hall, to which it otherwise bears a certain general resemblance. Other and smaller specimens of M. inflata approach nearer to some of the shorter varieties of M. curvata, Hall, in lateral outline, but the former are never as distinctly angulated on the umbonal slope as the latter are said to be. According to Dr. Frech, *Mytilacea*, Hall, is exactly synonymous with Myalina, and, if this be the case, the present species will have to be called Myalina inflata.\n\n(S.) Myalina trigonalis. (N.

Valves broader than high, most prominent and strongly angulated on each of the ventral umbonal slopes, and flattened in the ventral region, the outline of which, as seen in full front view (as in fig. 7 a) is ovate cordate: sides (see fig. 7) obliquely compressed, faintly and longitudinally depressed next each ventral umbonal slope, then slightly elevated in the same direction, in such a way as to form a low, rounded and obscure dorsal umbonal ridge, which becomes obsolete at a short distance from the posterior end, in each valve, and ultimately narrowing abruptly into the dorsal margin. Hinge line short, oblique: dorsal margin long, nearly straight, but slightly bent a little in advance of the midlength, at first divergent from the anterior margin at an angle of about $55^\\circ$ but afterwards nearly parallel with it, the greatest height of the valves being at the junction of the dorsal margin with the truncated posterior end, which is obtusely pointed below.

They differ from the typical form chiefly in being almost exactly twice as long as high, and in the circumstance that their posterior umbonal slopes are obscurely or very faintly subangular.\n\n*S. subelliptica* is obviously congeneric with *Spathella ventricosa*, the *Orthonota ventricosa* of White and Whitfield, as figured by Hall*, and differs from that species only in being much shorter in proportion to its height.

The specimen, which is not more than five millimetres in length, is too imperfect for specific description, but it shows clearly the impression of the \"vertical clavicular ridge just anterior to the beaks,\" which is so characteristic of the genus. The general contour of this specimen is not very dissimilar to that of the *N. oblongatus* of Hall (from the Hamilton group of the State of New York), but that species attains to a length of from twenty-four to thirty-five mm., and is much more obtusely pointed at the longer and so-called posterior end.\n\n(S.) **Kefersteinia subovata.**\n\n*Megalodon subovatus*, Whiteaves. 1890.

For this new genus the name *Kefersteinia* has been recently proposed by Professor M. Neumayr, in a paper published since his death by the Royal Academy of Sciences of Vienna.*\n\nOn the other hand, it is only proper to add that, so far back as 1851, Gr\u00fcnwaldt\u2020 claimed that the *Megalodus truncatus* of Goldfuss is a *Myophoria*. Dr. Frech, also, in a paper upon *Mecynodon* and *Myophoria*,\u2021 places Goldfuss's species in the group of *Myophoria larvigata* and maintains that it belongs to the older Trigoniad\u00e6. Dr. Frech thinks that all the species figured by Hall under the name *Schizodus*, on Plate lxxv of vol. V, pt. 1 (Lamellibr., 2) of the Pal\u00e6ontology of the State of New York, belong to the genus *Myophoria* and that the name *Schizodus* should be restricted to the Permian species. According to this view, the fossil from the Hay River, which is referred to *Schizodus Chemungensis* on page 241 of the present volume and figured on Plate xxx, figs. 5 and 5a, would also be a *Myophoria*, but it may be a *Kefersteinia*, and not very improbably even an immature example of *K. subovata*.\n\n(S.)\n\n*Mecynodon.* (Sp.)\n\n(Cfr. *M.

The phrase \"umbonibus postmedianis\" of the original description of that species, it is true, is not applicable to any of the specimens collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, but in Goldfuss's figures of *L. antiqua*, the umbones and beaks are represented as placed a little in advance of the midlength.\n\nJudging by the descriptions and figures of both, it is difficult to see upon what grounds the *Paracyclas Ohioensis* of Meek is separated from *P. antiqua*. Each of the eight specimens from Lake Winnipegosis is characterized by the \"strongly oblique sulcus, extending from the back part of the beaks to the upper part of the posterior margin,\" on the \"posterior dorsal slope of each valve,\" which Mr. Meek relies upon as the distinguishing feature of *P.

Youle Hind collected two lamellibranchiate shells, which are still in the Museum of the Survey, from the Devonian\nrocks at Snake Island in Lake Winnipegosis. Both of these were figured by Mr. E. Billings (op. cit. p. 187), who regarded one as identical with *Lucina elliptica*, Conrad, (sic), and described the other as a new species, under the name *Lucina occidentalis*. To the present writer these two specimens appear to be merely somewhat distorted individuals of the same species, the one referred to *L. elliptica* being abnormally compressed in the direction of its height, and that described as *L. occidentalis* in the direction of its length. Similar specimens collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and the present writer, at Manitoba Island and Onion Point, Lake Manitoba, in 1888, and by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling abundantly at most of the exposures on the shores or islands of Lake Winnipegosis, in 1889, are almost exactly intermediate in their characters between *P. elliptica*, Hall, and *P. lirata*, Conrad. They perfectly resemble the latter species both in size and shape, but their \"concentric undulations of growth\" are rounded and flattened, not prominent and subangular as in *P. lirata*. It is highly probable, however, that *P. elliptica* is only a variety of *P. lirata*.\n\nBoth the typical form and the var. *occidentalis* of Billings (not of Hall and Whitfield) are most abundant in the argillaceous limestones above the Stringocephalus zone, and at the local base of the Upper Devonian.\n\nIn his latest description of *P. elliptica*, Prof. Hall points out that it is \"subject to great variation in form from compression,\" a statement which is equally applicable to the specimens from Lake Winnipegosis, four of which are represented on plate xxxix. Fig. 8 on that plate represents the type of *L. occidentalis*, Billings, the wood-cut of that shell in Prof. Hind's report being neither as accurate nor as characteristic as could be wished. Fig. 7 represents a specimen from Dawson Bay, which is quite free from distortion or compression. In the original of fig. 10, which is from the Red Deer River, at the Upper Salt Spring, the compression in the direction of the height has reached its maximum, while in the original of fig. 9, which is also from the Red Deer River, the compression has obviously been oblique.\n\n(S.) **Paracyclas.** (Sp.

Two of these are casts of the interior of the shell, and one is a natural mould of the exterior of the closed valves, but all three are too imperfect and too badly preserved to admit of identification or description. The figures on plate xxxix are taken from a wax impression of the\nmould of the exterior, but the ventral margin is slightly restored from the lines of growth. The shell seems to have been larger and more globose than *P. elliptica*, but the wax impression from which the figures were made does not give a clear idea of the shape of the valves, or of their surface markings.\n\n(S.)\n\n**Conocardium Ohioense**, Meek.\n\n*Conocardium Ohioense*, Meek. 1871.

In the absence of any knowledge of the hinge dentition of the valves this species is here provisionally referred to Cardiopsis, on account of its resemblance in external characters to the C. radiata of Meek and Worthen, as figured by Hall,* but it may be a Puravva. It differs, however, from C. radiata in its more nearly circular outline, and in the position of its beaks, which are not placed nearly so far forward.\n\nThree casts of the interior of a shell, collected by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1889, at Whiteaves Point, in Dawson Bay, are also probably referable to C. tenuicostata, though they show no traces of the radiating ribs characteristic of the exterior of its test.\n\n(S.)\n\nCypricardella bellistriata, Conrad.

The surface markings of the whole are not well preserved, but appear to consist of transverse annular striations, which are usually very closely disposed, but in some individuals there are indications also of fine longitudinal striae. It is only proper to add that the specimens from the localities have much the same shape and surface markings as the Coleolus crenatocinctus of Hall*, which Whitfield thinks is a Dentalium, but there is at present no satisfactory evidence to show that the transverse striae of the former are crenate.\n\nGASTEROPODA.\n\n(S.)

If it belongs to the former of these two families, the apex is of course anterior to the midlength, but if to the latter then the apex would be posterior. The species is here placed provisionally in the genus *Palaeacmaea* on account of its general resemblance in external characters to such shells as the *P. typica* of Hall, from the Potsdam sandstone of the State of New York, and to the *P. annulata* of Barrois*, and *P. Barroisi* of Ehlert\u2020 from the Devonian rocks of France. The circumstance that the *P. typica* of Hall was first characterized in the \"Twenty-third Report on the State Cabinet\" in a paper bearing the general title \"Descriptions of Devonian Fossils,\" would seem to have misled Drs. Fischer and Zittel into the statement that the genus *Palaeacmaea* was originally based upon a Devonian species.\n\n(S.)\n\n**Pleurotomaria goniostoma.**\n\n*Pleurotomaria goniostoma,* Whiteaves. 1890.

Volutions four or five, those of the spire flattened above, their sides completely covered by the overlapping of those which succeed them, except at the anterior end of the last volution but one, where a very small portion of the upper part of the side is exposed: outer volution shallowly concave above, its peripheral angulation slightly produced on the apical side, in such a way as to form a minute and not very prominent crenulated spiral ridge. Slit band placed on the peripheral angulation of the outer volution and of about equal breadth on each side of it: on the apical side it is concave, but not separated from the rest of the surface by any distinct bordering lines or line, on the umbilical side it is flat but bounded externally by a very minute spiral impressed line: crescents not distinctly defined, but producing the minute crenulations on the periphery.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, marked only by extremely faint lines of growth, which curve convexly backward to the slit band both above and below.\n\nOnion Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F. Whiteaves, 1888: abundant, associated with *Euomphalus Manitobensis*, which is now known to belong to the genus *Omphalocirrus*, and both forms of *Paracyclas elliptica*. Lake Winnipegosis, at Point Brabant, and on the southwestern shore of Dawson Bay, at two small points, one about half a mile, the other about three miles north of the mouth of Bell River; also, on Swan Lake, near the mouth of Swan River, and on the Red Deer River, at the Lower Salt Spring, D. B. Dowling, 1888: a few specimens from each of these localities. Collected also by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, in 1889, at many other localities in or around Lake Winnipegosis, as on a small island at the extreme south end of the lake, at Weston Point and a small island off that point, at South Manitou Island, on the southwest side of Cameron Bay, and at eight exposures on the islands or shores of Dawson Bay.\n\nMost of the specimens are mere casts of the interior of the shell, but three examples collected at Dawson Bay in 1889 have the whole of the test preserved, and it is from these that the foregoing description was made. These internal casts, as shown by figs. 6, 6a and 6b on Plate xli, are usually broader, flatter and often much larger than the few testiferous specimens yet collected, such as the original of figs. 5 and 5a on the same\nplate, and the former are narrowly umbilicated. In testiferous specimens the umbilicus is completely closed by an internal thickening of the shell on that side, the filling of the umbilical cavity being usually the only part of the test left remaining on internal casts.\n\nThe species appear to range throughout the whole thickness of the Devonian rocks in this district, but to be more abundant above the Stringocephalus zone than in or below it. It appears to be the Canadian representative of the *Raphistoma Bronni* (Goldfuss, sp.) of the Middle Devonian of Germany and Russia, but differs from that species in its imperforate base, and in the absence of two distant spiral keels or ridges on the apical side of the outer volution.\n\n(S.)\n\n**Murchisonia Archiacana.** (Nom.

VI, p. 356, pl. xxxii, fig. 7; but not *M. angulata*, Phillips, 1836.\n\nA few specimens of a species of *Murchisonia*, which appears to the writer to be identical with *M. angulata*, var. A, of MM. d'Archiac and de Verneuil, were collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling in 1889 at Weston Point and at five different localities in or around Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosiss. Most of the specimens are well preserved moulds of the exterior of the shell, in dolomite, and the figure on Plate xli is taken from a gutta percha impression of one of the most perfect of these moulds, in which, however, only a very small portion, if any, of the body volution is preserved. The original of this figure has nine angular volutions preserved, each encircled with a single (not channeled) spiral keel, which is subcentral on all those of the spire, and there is a \"second, less evident keel on the last volution.\" The other specimen figured, in which the body whorl and two of the preceding volutions are preserved, shows that the maximum breadth of the body whorl at the aperture is as much as an inch and a quarter, that the base is strongly convex and almost or quite imperforate, and that the aperture is somewhat rhomboidal in outline. Only one specimen with the test preserved has as yet been obtained at any of the localities visited by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling.\n\nIn a paper on some Carboniferous species of *Murchisonia*, Miss Jane Donald states that \"considerable confusion has arisen with regard to the identification of the *Murchisonia angulata* of Phillips, owing to his having described three distinct species under this name. In 1836, in the 'Geol. Yorks,' vol. ii, p. 230, pl. xvi., fig. 16, Phillips figures and describes two\n\n---\n\n* Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc., Lond., vol. XLIII (1887), pp. 621-23.\ndifferent Carboniferous shells as *Rostellaria angulata*; and in 1841, in the 'Pal. Foss. of Devon,' p. 101, pl. xxxix, fig. 189, he figures and describes a Devonian shell as *Murchisonia angulata*, identifying it with the shells previously described as *Rostellaria angulata*, and referring them all to the genus *Murchisonia*, d'Arch. and de Vern. This last shell is evidently quite distinct from those first described, being much smaller, and the keels differently disposed; the only point of resemblance being that both it and the shell figured on the right hand of pl. 'xvi (not xii),\u2019 fig. 16, in the 'Geol. Yorks,' are tricarinate.\" After discussing the relations of the British Carboniferous species of *Murchisonia* to Phillips's *M. angulata*, she goes on to say: \"A. d'Archiac and E. de Verneuil and Goldfuss have referred Devonian shells to this species. That of the former differs from both of Phillips's figures; the more rapid increase of the whorls, and the absence of the keels below the band, distinguish it from the right-hand figure, while the whorls are more excavated than those of the left-hand figure. The shell described by Goldfuss, which I have examined in the Bonn Museum, increases more rapidly; the band is formed of two keels placed close together and the whorls are more excavated.\" Koken,* also, states that the *Muricites angulatus* of Schlotheim (1822) is a *Murchisonia*, but that it is quite different to the *Murchisonia angulata* of d'Archiac and de Verneuil.\n\nUnder these circumstances, a new name seems to be required for the species now under consideration, and as L. G. de Koninck has already given that of M. de Verneuil to a Carboniferous species, it may not be inappropriate to dedicate this to the memory of his fellow-labourer, the viscount d'Archiac.\n\n(S.) **Murchisonia Dowlingii.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 41, fig. 8.\n\nShell elongated, turreted, very slender and many whorled. Volutions thirteen or more, the first three or four rounded or indistinctly angulated, the remainder strongly angulated and distinctly bicarinated considerably below their midlength, the two prominent spiral keels being placed close together and separated by a narrow but rather deep groove, and the centre of the basal or anterior side of the upper keel encircled by an impressed line: sides of the volutions obliquely flattened and somewhat concave both above and below the two spiral keels, but narrowing much more abruptly inward below them: suture deeply and angularly excavated, its centre occupied by a very fine but deeply impressed line or minute spiral groove.\n\n---\n\n* \u00dcber die Entwickel der Gastrop. vom Cambrian bis zur Trias.

The figure on plate xli. is taken from a gutta percha impression of one of these moulds.\n\nThis species appears to differ from the preceding one in its much more slender form, more numerous volutions, and in the circumstance that its spiral keel is not only double, but placed distinctly below the centre of each volution.

One or at the most two specimens were obtained at each of these localities.\n\nAltogether, nineteen specimens were collected, and, of these, thirteen are mere casts of the interior of immature shells, five are either very small or not fully grown specimens with most of the test preserved, and one, as previously stated, is an imperfect cast of the interior of an adult shell. Not a vestige of the columellar callosity of the inner side of the aperture is preserved in any of them.\n\nThe whole of the specimens are so imperfectly preserved that it is doubtful whether they should be regarded as specifically identical with *B. Pelops* or not. The only points in which they seem to differ from that species, as described and figured by Professor Hall, are that they seem to attain to a much larger size when adult, and that the closing of the umbilical cavity on both sides of immature individuals is not caused by a spreading over it of the columellar callus. Small specimens of the species now under consideration are very similar, in shape and sculpture, to the *B. propinquus* of Meek*, from the Corniferous limestone of Ohio, but that species is narrowly umbilicated and its slit band is said to be \"furrowed along the middle, so as to present a biangular appearance.\"\n\n(S.) **Porcellia Manitobensis.** (Nom.

Dowling, 1889.\n\nOf the eight specimens collected, one is small and very imperfect but wholly testiferous, four are casts of the interior of the shell, with portions of the test preserved on either or both sides of the slit band, but not actually upon it, and the rest are sharply defined moulds of the exterior of the shell. The nuclear volution is not preserved in any of these specimens, and in casts of the interior the slit band appears as a narrow rounded and not much elevated spiral ridge with a linear groove on each side of it.\n\nAs it is doubtful whether these few and imperfect specimens are or are not actually conspecific with *P. striata*, it is thought desirable to designate the former by a local and provisional name. The only differences, however, that the writer has yet been able to detect between *P. Minitobrasis* and *P. striata* are that the former appears to attain to a much larger size than the latter, and to be slightly expanded at the aperture in the adult state.\n\nIn the Geological Magazine for May, 1891, Mr. R. B. Newton proposes to change the name *Porcellia* of L\u00e9veill\u00e9 (1835) to *Leveillia*, on account of the circumstance that that of *Porcellia* had been given by Latreille in 1804 to a genus of Isopods. Still, the substitution of a new name for one with which paleontologists have become familiar by long usage, seems to the writer a greater inconvenience than would result from the use of two similar but not identical names, in such widely different divisions of the animal kingdom as the Mollusca and Arthropoda.\n\nDecember, 1892.\nShell ovate turbinate, a little longer than broad, base ventricose, imperforate; spire moderately elevated, but shorter than the outer volution, which is encircled with six nodulose ridges or spiral keels.

Three of the specimens, however, are entirely testiferous. The largest example collected, when perfect, must have been fully ten inches in length. The nodules or tubercles on the spiral ridges of the later volutions are very feebly developed in half-grown shells, but on the outer volution of adult individuals they are moderately elevated, rounded, conical and placed at distances apart about equal to or a little greater than their own diameters at the base. Casts of the interior of the shell are perforated by a narrow but deep umbilicus.\n\nThe species has much the same shape as the *Eunema capitaneum* (=*Turbo capitaneus*, Goldfuss), but in that species the outer volution is encircled by five comparatively large nodulose ridges, which alternate with five rows of smaller tubercles.\n\nShell turbinated, spire short, about equal in height to one-half of that of the outer volution near the aperture; base ventricose, imperforate; outer\nvolution encircled by three rows of transversely elongated tubercles. Volutions five, the first, second and third obliquely compressed and the fourth with nearly vertical sides, the third and fourth encircled with two rows of tubercles, one next to the suture above, and the other, which is partially overlapped by each succeeding volution, at the suture below: outer volution considerably inflated, obliquely flattened or concavely constricted above the midheight and ventricose below, encircled with one row of from twelve to fourteen crescentic or spout-shaped, elevated tubercles close to the suture above, with a second row of somewhat similar but much more elongated tubercles a little below the midheight, and with a third row of more feebly developed elongated tubercles around the base, which radiate from its centre. Aperture broadly rounded on the outer side, more narrowly rounded at the base, its columellar side obliquely and concavely emarginate by a slight encroachment of the preceding volution: outer lip simple: columellar lip slightly thickened.\n\nSurface marked by fine transverse striae or lines of growth, in addition to the rows of tubercles. Casts of the interior of the shell have regularly ventricose volutions with a deeply channelled suture, and the base of each is perforated by a narrow but very deep umbilicus.\n\nWestern shore of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegos, at an exposure four miles west of Salt Point (three specimens), and at the mouth of the Steep Rock River (one specimen); D.

B. Tyrrell and D. B. Dowling, 1889.\n\nThis species, like the last, is represented almost exclusively by sharply defined moulds of the exterior of the shell, with corresponding casts of the interior, the intermediate test not being preserved. The figures on Plate xlii are drawn from gutta percha or wax impressions of two of these natural moulds. One completely testiferous specimen, however, was obtained at Dawson Bay. In its short spire and ventricose outer volution E. brevispira shows a certain amount of similarity to the E. coelatum (= Turbo celatus, Goldfuss) of the Devonian rocks of the Eifel, but the latter shell is much the smaller of the two, and their sculpture is entirely different.\n\n(S.) EUNEMA SUBSPINOSUM. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlates 42, fig. 8, and 45, fig. 5.\n\nShell small, turbinated, somewhat conical, a little longer than broad: spire moderately elevated but shorter than the outer volution, base appa-\nrently imperforate. Volutions three, or perhaps four, the apex being rather imperfectly preserved in the few specimens collected, increasing rapidly in size, the nuclear ones small and apparently smooth, the last but one obliquely compressed above, rounded below and encircled with six close-set, regularly disposed, fine tuberculated spiral ridges; outer volution much broader than high, broadest near the base, somewhat compressed above, truncated obliquely at the aperture and encircled with six or more spiral rows of tubercles, some of which are spinose or subspinose, especially those on the upper row and those on the lowest: suture deeply impressed.\n\nSurface marked by oblique lines of growth which run parallel to the outer lip. In one specimen, also, there are indications of a minute raised line between each pair of rows of tubercles on the outer volution.\n\nApproximate dimensions of the most perfect specimen collected: height about twelve millimetres; maximum breadth of the outer volution, about ten mm.\n\nDawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, at the mouth of the Red Deer River, D. B. Dowling, 1888, about two miles west of Salt Point, and at the first small point north of the mouth of the Red Deer River, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: one well preserved mould of the exterior of the shell from each of these localities. The figure represents a gutta percha impression taken from one of these natural moulds.\n\n(S.)\n\n**Eunema clathratulum. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 42, fig. 9.\n\nShell small, turbinated, somewhat turreted, height a little greater than the maximum breadth, spire rather higher than the outer volution, which is nearly twice as broad as high, base imperforate. Volutions five, increasing much more rapidly in breadth than in height, the first, second and third comparatively slender, the fourth considerably expanded,\u2014the second, third and fourth obliquely compressed above, angular or sub-angular in the centre, and with nearly vertical sides below: suture distinctly defined: outer volution ventricose and much expanded laterally, somewhat flattened at the base.\n\nSurface marked by fine spiral ridges, which are crossed by very numerous, close-set, regularly disposed and nearly straight, minute laminar costulae, the points where the former are intersected by the latter being minutely tuberculated, when examined under a lens. In the specimen figured, which though unusually perfect, is not more than half grown, there are two or three distant spiral ridges on the last volution but one,\nand six or seven on the last, but in larger though less perfect individuals there are nearly if not quite twice this number on the corresponding volutions.\n\nPentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F. Whiteaves, 1888: a single nearly perfect but not very well preserved testiferous specimen. A few sharply defined moulds of the exterior of shells of this species were collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, in 1889, at Dawson Bay, Lake Winnepegosis, on a small island near Beardy Island, at the mouth of Steep Rock River, about two miles west of Salt Point, and at the mouth of the Red Deer River.\n\n**Astralites. (Gen. Nov.)**\n\nShell conical, imperforate, flattened at the base, periphery sub-angular, in the only species known fringed with a thin, regularly lobate or sinuate lateral expansion. Columella or internal axis encircled with a single, narrow but prominent spiral fold, which is represented by a deep spiral groove in casts of the interior.\n\nThe shells for which this new generic name is proposed are essentially similar in their external characters to some recent species of the subgenus Uranilla, of the genus Astralium, especially to the *U. unguis* of Mawe, from south-west Mexico. They bear, also, a considerable resemblance to the *Onustus (Haliph\u00e6bus) alatus* of Koken,* from the Devonian rocks of Germany, and to the \"alate\" *Pleurotomaria*. They differ, however, from *Uranilla*, *Onustus*, *Pleurotomaria* and any other genus that the writer is acquainted with, in the presence of a conspicuous fold upon the columella.\n\nThe peripheral alation of the outer volution of the typical species of this genus is indicated or preserved in only two of the specimens collected. One of these is an unusually perfect and well preserved mould of the exterior of nearly the whole of the upper surface of the shell. Figure 10 on Plate xlii was drawn from a gutta percha impression of this mould, but a still better impression from it, which shows nearly the whole of the upper side of the peripheral alation, and which is represented on Plate xlv, fig. 6, has since been obtained in wax. The other is the testiferous specimen figured on Plate xlii, fig. 10a, in which the upper or apical portion is buried in the matrix and only the base exposed. From these two specimens it is impossible to ascertain whether the peripheral alation is formed of two thin lamell\u00e6 which coalesce at their summit and enclose the slit band,\u2014or solid throughout. If it encloses a slit band, the affinities of the genus are probably with the alate species of *Pleurotomaria* for which Ferdinand Roemer proposed the genus *Euomphalopterus*, but if solid, with *Astralium* or the *Onustid\u00e6*.\n\n---\n\n* Neues Jahrb. f\u00fcr Mineral., Geol. und Pal\u00e6ont., 1889, Beilageband VI, p. 437, pl. xi, figs. 10 and 11.\nPlagiothyra, Whidborne,* has a tooth but not a fold on the columellar lip, but the Littorina alata of G. and F.

Tyrrell, in 1889, from Dawson Bay, at Whiteaves Point, at the mouth of Steep Rock River, four miles west of Salt Point, and at the mouth of the Red Deer River.\n\nThe specimens so far obtained at these localities consist of numerous casts of the interior of the shell, a few moulds of the exterior, in dolomite, and a single testiferous specimen (fig. 10a) in which only the base is exposed.

The writer had given the manuscript name Straparollus filicinctus to the specimens collected by Dr. Spencer, before the fourth part of the first volume of Mr. Whidborne's Monograph of the Devonian Fauna of the South of England had been received in Ottawa, but from the detailed description of E. annulatus in that memoir, it has since become apparent that they are referable to that species.\n\nEuomphalus (Phanerotinus).

It is not unlike the shell which Goldfuss figures on Plate exci, figs. la and e, of the third volume of the Petrefacta Germaniae, as Euomphalus serpula, DeKoninck, var. teres, but which De Koninck considers the typical form of that species. It also closely resembles the large specimen of Euomphalus (Phanerotinus) larus figured by Hall on Plate xvi, fig. 9, of vol. V, pt. 2, of the Palaeontology of the State of New York, but it may prove to be only a partially uncoiled variety of some at present unknown species, whose volutions are usually in contact.\nEuomphalus (circularis?

Volutions about four, though the apex is not preserved in any of the specimens collected, those of the spire depressed convex, the outer one widely expanded, more than twice as broad as high, sub-triangular in transverse section, flattened above, laterally compressed on the periphery, subangular at the shoulder above and around the umbilical margin below: umbilicus wide but shallow, exposing the basal side of each of the inner volutions: suture channeled and distinctly defined: aperture ovately subtriangular, narrow and obtusely pointed at the base below.\n\nSurface markings unknown, not a vestige of the test being preserved on any of the specimens collected, which are all mere casts.\n\nIt is not practicable to give very accurate proportional dimensions of any of these casts, but the figure on plate xlvii. is of the natural size.\n\nOnion Point, Lake Manitoba, J.

All from the limestone immediately overlying the Stringocephalus zone.\n\nThe precise specific relations of these specimens must remain doubtful until examples with at least some portion of the test preserved are collected. In the meantime all that can be said about these casts is that they correspond very well with the description of \"decorticated\" specimens of one of the varieties of the Euomphalus circularis of Phillips figured in the monograph cited above. They are also somewhat similar in shape to the E. trigonalis, of Goldfuss, but the outer volution of each is not nearly so sharply angulated either above or below, and their apertures, in consequence, are not so distinctly triangular in outline.\n(S.)\n\nOmphalocirrus Manitobensis.\n\nPlate 43, figs. 5, 6 and 7.\n\nEuomphalus Manitobensis, Whiteaves. 1890.

Volutions five when perfect, though the nuclear one is not preserved in any of the specimens collected, in contact but very slightly embracing, coiled on nearly the same plane, those of the sunken spire depressed convex above, the last whorl but one subangular below and encircled on its outer margin with a row of tubercles close to the suture. Outer volution angular or subangular and encircled by from thirteen to nineteen, or, in unusually large specimens, by as many as twenty-six, large, arched and more or less spout-shaped nodes or tubercles at the shoulder above and on the umbilical margin below, the rather broad and comparatively smooth zone between these two rows of nodes being compressed obliquely inward and downward: suture deeply impressed on both sides: aperture subcircular: test apparently rather thick.\n\nSurface marked with flexuous lines of growth, which curve obliquely and concavely forward both above and below and very gently but convexly forward across the zone between the two rows of tubercles on the outer volution. In well preserved specimens these incremental lines are so prominent, numerous and close-set upon the upper surface as to give it a distinctly costulate appearance, while in half-grown testiferous specimens the outer zone between the two rows of tubercles is minutely and densely but very regularly granulose.\n\nOperculum calcareous, moderately thick, nearly flat internally, slightly convex externally, circular in outline and multispiral.\n\nIn the Stringocephalus zone at Pentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba, at many exposures on the shores and islands of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, and on the Red Deer River, between the Lower and Upper Salt Springs, where it was collected by J.

In the above description it is assumed to be dextral, but, should it prove to be sinistral, the terms \"above\" and \"below,\" \"spire\" and \"umbilicus,\" will, of course have to be reversed.\nislands and on a small island off Weston Point, at Point Brabant, on the west side of Cameron Bay, and at a few exposures on the shores and islands of Dawson Bay; also, on the Red Deer River at or near the Lower Salt Spring. At each of these localities it was obtained in more or less abundance by Messrs. Tyrrell, Dowling and the present writer in 1888 and 1889.\n\nMost of the specimens from the Stringocephalus zone are natural moulds of the exterior of the shell, with the surface characters fairly well preserved, and it is from wax impressions of several of these moulds (two of which are figured) and from two small testiferous examples, that the foregoing description was made. The specimens from the limestone immediately above the Stringocephalus zone, on the other hand, are mere casts of the interior of the shell, most of which are very badly preserved, together with a few opercula, and it was upon these casts and opercula that the description and figures of Enomphalus Manitobensis were based. One of these casts is so broken as to show the operculum in situ, though a little displaced from its natural position, but none of them show the characters of the lower side at all well. Before these angulated and nodose moulds of the exterior of the shell were very critically studied, they were regarded by the writer as not only specifically but also subgenerically distinct from the comparatively rounded, smooth and frequently depressed internal casts for which the name E. Manitobensis was proposed, but they are now all regarded as different states of preservation of a single species of Omphalocirrus. The angulation and peculiar tuberculation of the outer volution, as seen in moulds of the exterior or in testiferous specimens, is obviously caused by a thickening and plication of the outer layer of the test and does not affect the inner layer, while the depression of many of the internal casts, especially that of the type of E. Manitobensis figured in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, is evidently abnormal, as the operculum shows that the aperture must have been circular in outline when undistorted.\n\nThe type of the genus Omphalocirrus of De Ryckholt (1860) is the Enomphalus Goldfussii of d'Archiac and de Vermul, but in that species the outer volution is angulated and tuberculated on one side only, and the whole shell is more deeply concave above than below. According to Fischer*, Coelocentrus, Zittel (1882) is a synonym of Omphalocirrus.\n\n(S.) STRAPAROLLINA OBTTSA. (N.

Volutions seven or eight, the earlier or apical ones depressed convex, the later or lower whorls of the spire moderately convex but somewhat compressed laterally,\u2014the outer volution rounded, slightly inflated and gradually expanding, more than twice as broad as high: umbilicus occupying nearly one-half of the total diameter of the base, though the umbilical margin is rounded and very indefinite: suture deeply impressed: aperture apparently sub-circular.\n\nSurface marked by numerous minute spiral raised lines, which are crossed by equally minute but much more numerous and closely disposed flexuous transverse ridges. Under a lens, these latter are seen to curve gently backward on each side of the periphery, where each one forms a shallow sinus, and to be tuberculated at the points where they pass over the spiral lirulae.\n\nThe approximate dimensions of the specimen represented by figs. 12 and 12a, which is a remarkably perfect cast of the interior of the shell, are as follows, as measured in the centre of the dorsal surface: entire height, 18\u00b775 millimetres; height of last volution, 8\u00b77 mm.; breadth of the same, 18 mm.\n\nPentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba, J.

B. Tyrrell and D. B. Dowling, 1889: a few specimens, some with considerable portions of the test preserved, from each of these localities.\n\nThis very distinct species is evidently congeneric with the *Straparollina asperostriata*, *S. Circe* and *S. Eurydice* of Billings*, from the Black River limestone of Paquette's Rapids, on the Ottawa River. It is not very dissimilar, in general form, to *S. Eurydice*, but its sculpture is more like that of *S. asperostriata*. The genus is represented in the Lower Cambrian by the *S. remotu*, Billings, of the Olenellus zone of Newfoundland, in the \"Quebec Group\" of that island by *S. pelagica*, Billings, and in the Black River limestone of Canada by the three species already enumerated. In the writer's judgment, the \"*Straparollus Daphne*\" of Billings, from the Guelph limestone of Ontario, is also a *Straparollina*.\n\n---\n\n*Described in the Can. Nat. & Geol., 1860, vol.

B. Tyrrell, 1889: one imperfect specimen with the test preserved. A specimen of essentially similar shape and size, but whose surface is encircled by numerous small spiral ridges, in addition to the oblique lines of growth, and which therefore may not belong to the same species, was collected by Mr. Tyrrell in the same year on a small island in Dawson Day, about half way between Salt and Whiteaves Points.\n\nThe name Pseudophorus was proposed by Meek in 1873* for an \"undescribed group of shells,\" the type of which is a remarkable species from the Corniferous limestone of Ohio, which he provisionally described and figured under the name Xenophora? (Pseudophorus) antiqua, Meek. This shell, Mr. Meek writes, \"is almost certainly not a Trochita, because the broad underside does not have the character of a mere spiral lamina within the margin, but is really the lower side of the body volution. It seems to be more nearly related to Xenophora, Fischer (= Phorus, Montfort) or Quastus, Humphrey; but differs from both in not having the habit of attaching foreign bodies around its periphery, as well as in wanting the distinct umbilicus of the latter.\"\n\nThe comparatively elevated form together with the much more convex and almost dome-shaped volutions, of P. tectiformis, will at once enable that species to be distinguished from P. antiquus.\n\n* Rep.

B. Tyrrell and J. F. Whiteaves, 1888.\n\nIt is doubtful whether this species and the next should be referred to *Naticopsis* or *Natica*. The opercula of both of these species are unknown, and there is no evidence that the columellar lip of either was flattened or transversely striated, as in *Naticopsis*, but in the most perfect specimens of both, the aperture is filled with the matrix and the columella almost completely covered. Deshayes and others have maintained that the genus\nNatica occurs as far back as the Silurian epoch, and the recent discovery of paucispiral and possibly naticoid opercula in the Guelph limestone of Ontario seems to the writer to afford strong presumptive evidence of the correctness of this conclusion. Still, as the occurrence of the genus Natica or of any of its subgenera, in rocks of Palaeozoic age, cannot at present be satisfactorily proved, it is thought better to refer this and the next species to Naticopsis.\n\nThe surface markings of the present species appear to be essentially similar to those of the Naticopsis aquistriata of Meek,* from the Corniferous limestone of Ohio, and of the Natica antiqua of Goldfuss,\u2020 from the Devonian rocks of Germany and England. According to Mr. Meek, however, the Naticopsis aquistriata is less than five millimetres in height, broader than high, with a depressed spire. Natica antiqua, also, has a shorter spire than that of Naticopsis Manitobensis, and a much more expanded outer volution.\n\n(S.) Naticopsis inornata. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 43, fig. 14.\n\nShell imperforate, ovately subglobe, the height and breadth being nearly equal, spire short, conical, occupying rather more than one-sixth of the entire height. Volutions about four, increasing rapidly in size, those of the spire obliquely compressed, the outer one large, obliquely expanding and increasing rapidly in height, as well as breadth, toward the aperture, its base narrowly rounded and somewhat produced; aperture subovate, outer lip thin and simple.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, and showing only a few obscure lines of growth.\n\nDimensions of the largest and most perfect specimen obtained, the one figured: maximum height and greatest breadth, each about twenty-three millimetres and a half; height of spire, as measured on the median line of the dorsal surface, four mm.\n\nDawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, on a small island north north-west of Beardy Island, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: one nearly perfect specimen, with the test preserved, the original of fig. 14 on plate xliii. A few casts of the interior or moulds of the exterior of shells apparently referable to this species, were collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, in 1889, in Dawson Bay, at Whiteaves Point, on a small island three miles north of Salt Point, at the mouth of Steep Rock River, about two miles west of Salt Point, and at the first small point north of the mouth of the Red Deer River.\n\n*Geol.

III, 1841-44, p. 117, pl. excix, figs. 2 a, b.\nThe distinguishing features of this species, as compared with those of *N. Manitobensis*, are the shorter and more conical spire of the former, its obliquely expanding outer volution and different surface markings.\n\n**Loxonema**, Phillips.\n\nThe most typical species of *Loxonema*, as described by Phillips and others, are no doubt those whose surface is marked by sigmoidally arched costulae or crowded growth lines, parallel to the outer lip. Still, the fact that Phillips himself, on page 139 of his \"Paleozoic Fossils of Cornwall, Devon and West Somerset,\" included in that genus his own *L. reticulatum*, whose whole surface is stated to be \"reticulated by raised longitudinal and spiral threads,\" evidently shows that he intended the original diagnosis of the genus to be enlarged so as to include those species which are marked also with spiral ridges or keels. The few species collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling may therefore be arranged in two groups, as follows.\n\nA. Typical and non-reticulate species, whose surface is either marked only with sigmoidal costulae, or growth lines, parallel to the outer lip, or nearly smooth.\n\n**Loxonema altivolvis.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 45, figs. 8 and 9.\n\nShell rather large, elongate, subulate; volutions compressed laterally, but slightly convex in the middle, the later ones of the spire about as high as broad, the earlier ones unknown; outer volution considerably higher or longer, but apparently not very much broader than the one which immediately precedes it; suture indistinctly defined and devoid of band in the few specimens upon which the test is preserved, but deeply channeled in casts of the interior; aperture subovate, higher than broad, attenuate above and narrowly rounded below.\n\nSurface finely costulate and marked with closely and regularly disposed, slightly flexuous and simple raised lines, which cross the volutions transversely. Upon the later volutions of the spire and upon the upper and central portion of the outer volution, these raised lines are nearly straight or faintly concave, but on the base of the outer volution they curve convexly and rather abruptly backward.\n\nA few imperfect casts of the interior of shells of this species, some with small pieces of the test adhering to them, were collected by Mr. Dowling, in 1888, on the south-west shore of Dawson Bay, at two small points, one half a mile and the other three miles north of the mouth of Bell River. Similar specimens, some a little more perfect and others\nmere fragments, were obtained by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, in 1889, at many localities in, on or near Lake Winnipegosis, as, at the south end of the lake, at an exposure two miles west of Meadow Portage, and on Charlie Island; on the south-west side, on a small island off Weston Point and on South Manitou Island; on the south-east side, at Point Brabant; and at the north-west end, in Cameron Bay and at five exposures on the shores and islands of Dawson Bay; also on the Red Deer River, at and near the Upper Salt Spring.\n\nThe exact number of volutions in the shell of this species is unknown, as the upper part of the spire is broken off in the most perfect specimens collected. Of the two specimens figured, one (fig. 8) has a considerable portion of the test preserved on three contiguous volutions. The other (fig. 9) is a cast of the interior of a shell of this species, which has been slightly and abnormally compressed in such a way as to make the four or four and a half volutions preserved, appear unusually broad in proportion to their height. The actual height or length of this specimen is two inches and three-quarters, and it is probable that when entire its height slightly exceeded three inches.\n\nThe preceding description will no doubt have to be somewhat amended when more perfect specimens shall have been collected, but so far as can be ascertained at present, this species of *Loxonema* seems to differ from any of those from the Devonian rocks of North America, England or Europe that the writer can find described, in its laterally flattened volutions, crossed by densely disposed and nearly straight costulae.\n\n(S.) *Loxonema priscum*, Munster.

Spencer in 1874 on the west shore of Dawson Bay (\"from slabs apparently derived from the adjacent cliffs\"); by J. B. Tyrrell and the writer in 1888 from rocks in or nearly in place at Monroe and Pentamerus Points, December, 1892.\nLake Manitoba; and by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling in 1889, on or in Dawson Bay, at Whiteaves Point, at the mouth of Steep Rock River, and at the south end of Rowan Island.\n\nSome of the specimens from these localities are extremely like the two Lummaton examples of *L. priscum* figured by the Rev. G. F. Whidborne (*op. cit.*), but the former are apparently a little the larger. The approximate dimensions of a large and nearly perfect specimen from Pentamerus Point are: height or length, twenty-eight mm.; greatest breadth, nine mm. height of outer volution as measured in the median line of the dorsal surface, about nine mm. In some of the specimens from Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis the outer volution is more ventricose than that of the original of the figure on Plate xlv, and not so narrow at the base. The surface markings are not satisfactorily shown in any of them, but so far as can be ascertained, the shell is practically smooth to the naked eye, though a few obscure and minute lines of growth, parallel to the outer lip and close to it, can be seen with a lens on one specimen. In another, there is a single faint transverse constriction at a short distance from the aperture.\n\nB. Slightly aberrant and reticulate species, whose surface is marked with spiral revolving raised lines or small ridges, as well as the usual sigmoidal costulae or crowded growth lines.\n\n(S.) *Loxonema cingulatum.* (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 44, fig. 3.\n\nShell rather large, narrowly elongated and many whorled spire between three and four times as long as the outer volution. Volutions nine or ten, the apical ones being imperfectly preserved in the few specimens collected, compressed convex and increasing very slowly in size, those of the spire a little broader than high: outer volution moderately convex, as high as broad, narrowly rounded and somewhat produced at the base: axis imperforate: suture distinctly defined: aperture subovate, higher than wide and abruptly pointed above.\n\nSurface marked with small and very narrow but prominent spiral ridges, which are regularly arranged and nearly equidistant, also by slightly flexuous and somewhat sigmoidal lines of growth. In the largest specimen collected, whose surface markings are not very well preserved, there appear to have been about seven spiral ridges on the dorsal surface of the last volution but two, nine on that of the last but one, and probably not less than ten and perhaps as many as eleven or twelve on that of the outer volution.\nThe figure on Plate xlv is taken from a wax impression of the dorsal surface of the last four volutions of an apparently adult specimen, with the earlier volutions restored from a gutta percha impression of another specimen in which these happen to be well preserved.\n\nThe maximum breadth of the outer volution of the largest specimen collected is twenty four millimetres, and the entire height or length of an adult specimen is estimated to have been about eighty five mm.\n\nLake Manitoba, at Point Richard, and Monroe Point, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F. Whiteaves, 1888: one specimen at each of these localities. Dawson Bay, Lake Winnepegosis, at Whiteaves Point (four specimens), on a small island about half way between that point and Salt Point (one specimen), and at the south end of Rowan Island (one specimen); J. B. Tyrrell and D. B. Dowling, 1889. All the specimens are mere natural moulds of the exterior of the shell, in dolomite, but in some the corresponding cast of the interior of the shell also is preserved.\n\nThe prominent spiral ridges of this shell, which resemble those of some of the recent and tropical Melanias from the Pacific or eastern hemisphere, will at once enable it to be distinguished from any other species of Loxonema.\n\n**Loxonema gracillimum. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 45, fig. 10.\n\nShell very small, narrowly elongated, slender, turriculated and many whorled. Volutions about nine, increasing very slowly in size, the earlier ones of the spire moderately convex, the later ones ventricose in the middle and below (or anteriorly), but narrowly and concavely constricted next to the suture above, a little broader than high. Outer volution apparently considerably higher but not very much broader than the one which immediately precedes it, though the basal portion and the characters of the aperture are unknown: suture distinctly defined.\n\nSurface (of the lower volutions) marked with spiral revolving ridges, which are crossed by numerous and very minute sigmoidal costulae, or simple and entire thread-like raised lines. In the only specimen collected, which is imperfect at the base, nine spiral or revolving ridges can be counted on the last volution, and six on the last but one. These ridges, most of which are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, are unequal in size, four of those on the most prominent and lower part of the two latest volutions being larger and more elevated than the others, and all of them are narrow and minutely tuberculated at the many points where the sigmoidal costulae pass over them. The sigmoidal costulae, which cross the\nvolutions transversely and are parallel to the outer lip, have a slightly concave curvature above, or posteriorly, and an equally slight but convex curvature below. They are closely and very regularly disposed and so small as to be invisible without the aid of a lens.\n\nHeight or length of the only specimen collected, which, as already stated, is slightly imperfect anteriorly, nine millimetres and a half; maximum breadth of the outer volution of the same, about three mm.\n\nDevils Point, Lake Winnipegosis, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: a single but unusually well preserved mould of the exterior of the shell, in dolomite. The figure on Plate xlv is taken from a gutta percha impression of this mould, upon which the foregoing description also is based.\n\nThis species and the one previously described, although encircled by distinct spiral ridges, are also marked with the sigmoidal costulae or growth lines parallel to the outer lip, which are so characteristic of *Loconema*.\n\nA fifth species of *Loconema* is indicated by a single and nearly perfect cast of the interior of the shell, collected by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1889, at Roderick Point, Birch Island, Lake Winnipegosis. The outline and proportions of this specimen are quite unlike those of either of the four species already described or identified, but as its surface markings are entirely unknown, its specific relations cannot be ascertained.\n\n(S.) **Macrochilina subcostata**, Schlotheim.

B. Tyrrell, 1889.\n\nMost of the specimens from these localities are either imperfect casts of the interior of the shell, with well preserved portions of the tests attached, or sharply defined moulds of the exterior, in dolomite. Only two or three testiferous specimens were obtained and these are very imperfect. The surface markings are very variable, not only in different specimens, but sometimes also in different parts of the same shell. Thus, on the outer volution of one of the specimens from the small island north of Salt Point, (fig. 5) the markings consist of slightly sigmoidal, acute ridges, from two to three millimetres apart, with fine striae between them and parallel to them. On the other hand, in the original of fig. 4, which is drawn from a wax impression of a natural mould of a specimen from the mouth of the Red Deer River, the crowded subsigmoidal growth lines or minute costulae are very nearly equal in size and not more than from one-half to a whole millimetre apart. In another specimen from the mouth of the Red Deer River the sigmoidal costulae on the last whorl but one are nearly a millimetre apart, with finer striae between them, but they suddenly become nearly equal in size and much closer together on the outer volution. The entire height of one of the largest specimens from Dawson Bay would probably have been about sixty millimetres.\n\nIt is still doubtful whether the distinction between *M. subcostata* and *M. arcuata* can be sustained. The characters which Mr. Whidborne, the most recent writer on the subject, (op. cit., pp. 159-63) seems to rely upon for separating English or German examples of the two forms are, the proportionately narrower and shorter body whorl of *M. arcuata*, its \"flat, angulated shoulder,\" and finer and more irregular surface markings. Yet Mr. Whidborne includes in the synonymy of *M. arcuata*, the specimen figured under the name *Macrocheilus arcuatus* by Ferdinand Roemer, on Plate xxxii. (fig. 6) of the \"Lethaea paleozoica,\" in which no such shoulder is apparent, and the Chudleigh specimens of *M. arcuata*, which he himself figures, are all equally shoulderless. Fischer's figure of *Macrocheilus arcuatus,* which is not referred to by Mr. Whidborne, is almost a facsimile of F. Roemer's, and the present writer has failed to understand how the specimens of *M. arcuatus* figured by F. Roemer, Fischer, or Frech,\u2020 can be distinguished from the specimen of *M. subcostata* figured by d'Archiac and de Verneuil under the name *M. Schlotheimii*.

Volutions five or six, those of the spire obliquely compressed, the outer one moderately convex, slightly inflated, but very faintly constricted above, about as broad or a little broader than high and narrowing abruptly into the evenly rounded base; suture impressed, linear and minutely crenulated by the transverse costulae; aperture subovate, higher than wide and occupying more than one-half of the entire height, pointed above and rounded below; outer lip thin and simple.\n\nSurface marked with closely and regularly arranged, flexuous raised lines, or nearly equidistant, extremely thin and acute, minute costulae, which cross the volutions transversely but somewhat obliquely.\n\nDimensions of the specimen figured: height or length, eighteen millimetres and a half; maximum breadth, twelve mm.\n\nSouth-west shore of Dawson Bay, about two miles west of Salt Point, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: one nearly perfect specimen with the test preserved. Three casts of the interior of shells which are probably referable to this species, but which do not show a trace of the characteristic surface ornamentation, had previously been collected by Mr. Tyrrell and the writer, in 1888, at Pentameras Point, Lake Manitoba. The largest of these casts is nearly an inch in length.\n\nThis delicately sculptured shell appears to differ from *M. arcuata* chiefly in its diminutive size. It has somewhat the same general contour as the *Polyphemopsis Louisvillae* of Hall and Whitfield,* from the Upper Helderberg limestone at the Falls of the Ohio, but that species is represented as narrow and somewhat pointed at the base, and its surface is stated to be smooth.\n\nThe following description should have followed that of *Pleurotomaria infranodosa*, on page 313.\n\n---\n\n*Twenty-third Reg.

Volutions four, expanding rather gradually in a lateral direction, those of the spire depressed convex, the outer one occupying three-tenths of the entire diameter, somewhat flattened, both above and below, and depressed next to the suture above: periphery narrowly rounded: suture distinct. Aperture oblique, transversely elliptical, with the peristome interrupted on the columellar side, the interruption being caused by the encroachment of the narrow peripheral portion of the preceding volution: lip with a notch or slit obscurely indicated on the apical side of the periphery, but otherwise thin and simple, its inner margin shallowly concave.\n\nSurface marked with numerous, closely and rather regularly disposed minute spiral ridges, which are crossed by still more minute lines of growth, parallel to the outer lip. These incremental striae are too small to be seen without the aid of a lens, and are not shewn on any of the figures on Plates xli or xliii. They are, however, represented somewhat diagrammatically in fig. 1 on Plate xlvi. Slit band not clearly observed, though its presence is inferred, partly from the obscure notch or slit on the outer lip at the periphery and partly from the backward curvature of the lines of growth, both above and below.\n\nMaximum breadth of the largest specimen collected, twenty-five millimetres: approximate height of the same, as measured in the median line of the dorsal surface, about ten mm.\n\nWestern shore of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, \"from slabs apparently derived from the neighbouring cliffs,\" J. W. Spencer, 1874: one specimen, the original of the figures on Plate xli. A few smaller and less perfect specimens, six in all, were collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling in 1889, in place, at exposures on two small islands in the southern part of Dawson Bay, and on the western shore of that bay, at the mouth of the Red Deer River and on the first small point north of the mouth of the Red Deer River. Small specimens, whose maximum diameter is about eight or nine millimetres, which are probably the young of this species, were collected by Mr. Tyrrell and the writer, in 1888, at Pentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba, and by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling in 1889, on three small islands in the southern portion of Dawson Bay. One of these specimens (from Pentamerus Point), is represented, twice the natural size, on Plate xliii, fig. 13. At this stage of growth the\naperture of the shell is not far from circular in outline, and in one specimen the suture appears to have been somewhat channelled. Adult specimens have much the same shape as the recent *Stomatella imbricata* of Lamarck, but some which are not quite full grown have more the aspect of a *Sigaretus*.\n\nThis shell is very similar, both in shape and sculpture, to the *Pleurotomaria Sigaretus* of G. and F. Sandberger, but as the slit band and even the lines of growth of that species have never been seen, its generic position is quite uncertain. When that portion of this paper was published in which the species of *Pleurotomaria* are enumerated or described, (pp. 312-314) the writer was under the impression that the shell now under consideration should be referred to *Cyclonema* or *Polytropis*. Professor E. Koken (of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia), who has since examined the original of figs. 4, 4a and b, on Plate xli, is, however, of opinion that it is a true *Pleurotomaria*, and a careful re-examination of the minute growth lines of all the specimens has led the writer to form a similar conclusion. Professor Koken, in a letter to the writer, says that the whorls of *P. Sigaretus* are more rounded and more inflated than those of the present species, and the spire proportionately higher.\n\nThe writer has much pleasure in naming this shell in honour of its discoverer, Dr. J.

Shape of the aperture not clearly ascertainable, though on the dorsal side there is a broad and rather deep sinus, which is nearly flat at the bottom, in the middle of the lip, and a projecting lobe, which is broadly rounded on its inner margin and narrowly rounded or sub-angular externally, on each side, as represented by fig. 3.\nThe only surface markings that are preserved in any of the specimens are a few lines of growth on the dorsal side parallel to the outer lip. Operculum unknown.\n\nOnion Point and Little Sandy Point, Lake Manitoba, J. B. Tyrrell and J. F.

B. Dowling, 1888: one or two specimens from each of these localities. A few specimens, also, were collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling, in 1889, at Lake Winnipegosis, on Snake and South Manitou islands, at Devils Point, in Cameron Bay, and at ten different exposures on the islands and shores of Dawson Bay; also, on the Red Deer River, half a mile above the Lower Salt Spring. The species appears to be rare in and below the Stringocephalus zone, and to be most abundant in the beds above that zone.\n\nIn the foregoing description the flattened side of the shell is regarded as the dorsal, and the strongly convex and angulated portion as the ventral, in accordance with the terminology used by Sowerby, Morris and Salter, and by Walcott in his later publications.\n\nMost of the specimens collected are either separate casts of the interior of the shell, or casts with the corresponding mould of the exterior, from which the intervening test has decayed. The outline of the transverse section of the shell, as represented by fig. 4, is well shown in many specimens. The test is rarely preserved, but indications of it are shown in three or four specimens, particularly in the original of fig. 3, which consists of the anterior moiety of a specimen, in which the central portion and one of the broad lateral wings of the dorsal surface are well exhibited, with the lines of growth and shape of the lip on that side.\n\nMr. Walcott says* that the *H. princeps*, Billings, \"is the largest species of *Hyolithes* known,\" but some of the specimens of *H. alatus* collected by Messrs. Tyrrell and Dowling are considerably larger than any of Billings's types of *H. princeps* in the Museum of this Survey.\n\nThe present species is only referred to *Hyolithes* provisionally, as it seems to differ from that genus in its broad latero-basal alation, and more particularly in the deep central sinus of the lip on the dorsal side. It is most probable that a new genus will have to be constituted for its reception, but the specimens so far collected are too imperfect to admit of an accurate or sufficiently explicit generic description.\n\n*Bulletin U.

Sp.)\n\nPlate 46, figs. 5, 6 and 7.\n\nThis singular species is based upon very imperfect specimens of the head of five different individuals, but as it is not quite certain that they all belong to the same species, it is thought best to describe each specimen separately.\n\nSpecimen No. 1 (fig. 5), consists of the median portion of the head of an unusually small individual, of which little more is preserved than the glabella, with its long posterior median spine, and the postero-lateral spine on each of the fixed cheeks. This specimen was collected by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1889, on a small island north of Whiteaves Point, Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, and may be characterized as follows. Glabella moderately convex, inversely subconical in outline, broadest anteriorly and narrowing gradually backward, shallowly sinuated at its margin on each side by the second or median pair of lateral glabellar depressions, then slightly expanded posteriorly and ultimately faintly constricted and narrowing rather abruptly into a nearly straight and very slender, median and posterior, tubular spine, which is fully twice as long as the non-spinose portion of the head, if not more, and directed backward. Although three pairs of glabellar furrows are obscurely indicated in specimens Nos. 3, 4 and 5, by as many short lateral depressions or pits, only the anterior and median pair can be detected in this specimen and the next. On each side of the glabella, but just outside of it and commencing much farther forward than the median posterior spine, there is a rather shorter, stouter and more curved postero-lateral spine, which is nearly parallel with the median spine, and, like it, directed backward. The surface, which is rather worn, is marked indistinctly with minute scattered tubercles, which are too small to be seen without the aid of a lens.\n\nThis is the only specimen in which the long and slender postero-median and postero-lateral spines are preserved.\nSpecimen No. 2, which not figured, was collected by Mr. Tyrrell or the present writer, in 1888, at Monroe Point, Lake Manitoba. It is a portion of a glabella of a rather larger individual than the last, with a very short piece of the postero-median spine preserved. It is very imperfect anteriorly and shows only two pairs of the lateral glabellar depressions. The tuberculation of the surface, however, is much more clearly shown in it than in specimen No. 1.\n\nSpecimens Nos. 3 and 4. These are two examples, one of which is figured (fig. 6), of the central portion of the head of still larger individuals than Nos. 1 and 2, collected by Mr. Tyrrell and the present writer, in 1888, at Pentamerus Point, Lake Manitoba. Both are nearly perfect anteriorly, but imperfect posteriorly. They show that the front margin of the head is nearly straight, or but slightly convex in the centre, and that it is bordered by a narrow raised rim, which is succeeded by a transverse linear depression or faint groove. On the glabella of both there are three pairs of short lateral depressions or pits. The postero-median spine of each is broken off and scarcely a vestige remains in either of the two postero-lateral spines. The tuberculation of the surface is well preserved in both, and in one of these specimens there is a low conical tubercle, much larger than any of the others, nearly in the centre of the glabella.\n\nSpecimen No. 5 (fig. 7). This is a fragment of the anterior portion of the head of an individual of much larger size even than Nos. 3 and 4, collected by Mr. Dowling, 1889, on the west side of Dawson Bay, at the south end of Rowan Island. The anterior and median lateral depressions of the glabella are well shown on the right side of this specimen, and the posterior lateral depression on the left. The surface of these depressions is nearly smooth and the more or less scattered tubercles upon the remainder of the test are very irregular in their distribution. When examined with a lens, the anterior portion of the glabella shows traces of raised lines running parallel to the front margin of the head.\n\nThe position of the eye is not indicated in any of these specimens, and not a vestige of the free cheeks is preserved. Still, the few fragmentary examples so far obtained seem to indicate a hitherto undescribed species of *Bramkus*, in which the postero-median spine of the glabella and the pair of postero-lateral spines on the fixed cheeks, are far longer and more slender than the corresponding spines on the head of the *B. rhinoceros* of Barrande.* Apart from the circumstance that they both bear three spines on the posterior portion of the head and, possibly another in the centre of the glabella, there is indeed very little resemblance between this species and *B. rhinoceros*, the shape and surface ornamentation of the glabella and the modifications of the glabellar furrows in these two forms\n\n---\n\n*Sil. Syst. du Centre de la Boh\u00eame, vol. I, Suppl., 1872, p. 131, pl. ix, figs. 12-19.\nbeing quite different. The surface markings of the head of the present species are more like those of the *B. granulatus* of Goldfuss, as described and figured by European and English writers.\n\n(S.) **Lichas (Terataspis).** N. Sp.\n\nPlate 46, fig. 8.\n\nPortions of the marginal spines of the pygidium of a trilobite apparently congeneric with the *Terataspis grandis* of Hall, were collected by Mr. Dowling, in 1889, on the west side of Dawson Bay, Lake Winnipegosis, at the south end of Rowan Island. These specimens, which are figured, probably represent an undescribed species of *Terataspis*, which cannot yet be properly characterized for want of sufficient material. The species indicated, however, was clearly of much smaller size than *T. grandis*, and the spinules on the spines of the pygidium of the former are feeble and ramoso, not stout and simple like those on the tail spines of *T. grandis*.\n\n(S.) **Cyphaspis bellula.** (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 46, figs. 9 and 9a.\n\nHead strongly convex and distinctly three-lobed, much broader than long, rounded in front, nearly straight at the sides, but slightly constricted posteriorly; genal angles produced backward into a pair of slender and nearly parallel or but slightly divergent spines, which are nearly as long as the unarmed portion of the cephalic shield, as measured along the median line. Border prominent but rather narrow, although thickened by doublure, the test being very thin; marginal sulcus rather broad but shallow. Facial suture intersecting the occipital sulcus just inside the genal angle, passing obliquely and rather abruptly inward and forward to the eye-lobe, thence rather more gradually outward and forward to the anterior margin. Glabella occupying about one-third of the length of the cephalic shield, as measured in the median line, convex, prominent, egg-shaped, longer than broad, broadest anteriorly and surrounded by a groove, the basal portion of which is formed by the occipital sulcus; latero-basal lobes small, moderately prominent, egg-shaped, a little longer than broad and broadest behind. Eye-lobes more prominent than the latero-basal lobes, their visual surface not preserved. Cheeks strongly convex round each eye-lobe and sloping abruptly downward to the lateral margin. Thorax and pygidium unknown.\n\nSurface ornamented with numerous and rather closely disposed but distinct, minute rounded tubercles, which are obsolete upon the anterior\nmarginal and occipital sulci, as well as upon the genal spines. The occipital ring also is smooth, with the exception of a single circular tubercle in the centre. Most of the projecting part of the outer border is broken off in the few specimens collected, and even when otherwise uninjured its surface markings are very badly preserved, though they seem to have consisted of a single row of tubercles.\n\nDimensions of the most perfect specimen collected: maximum breadth of head, 8\u00b725 mm.; length of the same, as measured in the median line, 6\u00b725 mm.; length of glabella of the same, 4\u00b725 mm.\n\nLake Winnipegosis, on three small islands in the southern portion of Dawson Bay, J. B. Tyrrell, 1889: four specimens from one of these islands and one from each of the others. The specimens consist of nearly perfect and fairly well preserved detached heads, with the free cheeks in place, but the summits of the eye lobes of each specimen are broken off, as are also the slender genal spines, with one exception, and the surface ornamentation of the anterior border is very obscurely indicated.\n\nThis little trilobite seems to have much the same kind of surface markings as the *C. ornata* of Hall* (from the Hamilton formation of the State of New York) though the anterior border of the former may prove to be spinose, when better preserved specimens shall have been collected. The glabella and fixed cheeks of *C. ornata*, however, are represented as being very much less convex than those of the present species.\n\n(S.)\n\n**Proetus mundulus.** (N.

Frontal area rather broad and flattened, margined externally by a very narrow but rather prominent upturned rim. Facial suture normal, intersecting the anterior margin almost in a line with the most prominent lateral portion of each eye. Glabella (fig. 11) moderately convex, distinctly defined and bounded on all sides by a narrow groove, a little longer than broad and broadest posteriorly, ovately subtriangular in outline, but with the anterior angle more broadly rounded than the postero-basal angles, and the sides very faintly constricted at\n\n---\n\n*Palaeont.

Glabellar furrows in three pairs, each lateral and oblique: the first pair straight and very short, the second curved and longer than the first, the third longer than the second and curving obliquely into the occipital furrow on each side, thus separating a pair of lateral lobes at the base of the glabella. Occipital lobes represented by a pair of small, distant tubercles in the occipital furrow, one placed close to and immediately behind the postero-basal angle of each of the latero-basal lobes of the glabella: occipital furrow narrow; occipital ring rather broad and flat. Cheeks moderately prominent around the eye-lobe, sloping rather abruptly downward and outward: eyes prominent, appressed close to the sides of the glabella, and placed much nearer to the occipital furrow than to the anterior or lateral margins of the cephalic shield.\n\nThoracic segments, apparently nine in number, those of the axis prominent and strongly convex, the pleura not quite so convex.\n\nPygidium rather more narrowly rounded at its outer margin than the cephalic shield, its border narrow and flat: axis composed of from about eleven to thirteen segments: pleura about nine.\n\nGlabella and fixed cheeks minutely tuberculated, the flat frontal area smooth. Surface markings of thorax and pygidium unknown, as the test is not preserved upon either, in any of the specimens collected. Under a lens, however, well preserved casts of the pygidium show that its axis and pleura are also minutely tuberculated, and that there is a comparatively large pair of tubercles on each annulation of the axis, one on each side of its outer boundary.\n\nApproximate length of the most perfect specimen collected, as measured in the median line, twenty-one millimetres; greatest breadth of the thorax of the same, ten millimetres.\n\n\"Western Shore of Dawson Bay,\" Lake Winnipegosis, \"from slabs apparently derived from the neighbouring cliffs,\" J. W. Spencer, 1874: one cast of the head, minus the free cheeks, and casts of two pygidia. Several additional specimens of this trilobite were collected by Mr. Dowling in 1888, and by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889, in the Stringocephalus zone at three small islands in the southern portion of Dawson Bay, and at an exposure on the south-western shore of that bay, about two miles west of Salt Point. These specimens consist of a few detached heads, with the free cheeks in place, some with most of the test preserved; numerous sharply defined casts of the pygidium: one cast of the dorsal surface of the united head (minus the free cheeks), thorax and pygidium; an united head and thorax, and a cast of the thorax and pygidium.\n\nDecember, 1892.\nAt the time that the introduction to this paper was written, the writer was under the impression that the three specimens of the trilobite now under consideration, collected by Dr. Spencer, represented \"a variety of Proetus Haldemani,\" as stated on page 257 (lines 17 and 18 from the top). A subsequent study of the whole of the specimens collected, however, has led to the conclusion that they indicate a previously undescribed and probably distinct species of Proetus, which is more nearly related to the P. Rowi, Green (Sp.), P. Pronti, Shumard, and P. curvimarginatus, Hall, as described and figured in the seventh volume of the Pal\u00e6ontology of the State of New York, than to P. Haldemani. The characters by which these three most nearly related species of Proetus can most readily be distinguished from P. mundulus, are as follows. The anterior margin of the cephalic shield of P. Rowi is not narrowly upturned, its eyes are apparently larger proportionately than those of P. mundulus, and there are only from nine to ten annulations in the axis of the pygidium of P. Rowi, and from six to seven pleurae. P. Pronti has an upturned border to the anterior margin of the head, but it is said to have four pairs of lateral furrows on the glabella, eight to ten annulations on the pygidium and six to eight pleurae. P. curvimarginatus is described as having four pairs of lateral glabellar furrows, large occipital lobes, and a pygidium with thirteen to fourteen annulations on the axis and twelve pleurae.\n\nTwo fragmentary specimens of a small trilobite which may be referable to P. mundulus, were collected by Mr. Tyrrell in 1889, at Devils Point, Lake Winnipegos, from beds whose stratigraphical position is immediately below the Stringocephalus zone. These specimens are mere casts of the under surface of the right free cheek of two individuals.\n\nA few specimens, which are also probably referable to P. mundulus, were collected by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1889, from beds whose stratigraphical position is above the Stringocephalus zone, on the south-western shores of Pelican and Cameron bays, Lake Winnipegos; in Dawson Bay, at the first small point north of the mouth of Bell River; and on the Red Deer River, at the Upper Salt Spring. Most of the specimens from these localities are separate pygidia, with the test preserved. Some of these pygidia are much larger and more narrowly rounded posteriorly than those of the typical form of P. mundulus from the Stringocephalus zone, and, in the largest of these large pygidia there appear to be about thirteen or fourteen annulations on the axis and perhaps as many as eleven pleurae. The surface of these testiferous pygidia, also, when examined with a lens, is seen to be faintly and very minutely tuberculated. One of the specimens from Cameron Bay is a detached left free cheek with the test preserved, but its lower surface only is exposed, the upper being buried in the matrix. In this specimen only the rather broad basal portion of the genal spine is preserved.\nFISHES.\n\nHOLOCEPHALI.\n\nCHIMEROIDEI.\n\nPtyctodus calceolus, Newberry and Worthen.\n\n*Rinodus calceolus*, Newberry and Worthen. 1866.

Upper and expanded portion of the tooth convex externally and concave internally: the angle formed by its upper and\nouter sides much more acute than those formed by the upper and inner and outer and lower, that formed by the upper and inner side being not only obtuse but rounded off.

B. Dowling, 1889: the specimen figured.\n\nThis detached tooth or dental plate is apparently homologous with one of the large dental plates, which Dr. Newberry provisionally termed the \"premaxillaries,\" in the centre of the upper jaw of Dinichthys. It is doubtful, however, whether it represents the so-called \"premaxillary\" of the right side, or that of the left. In the preceding description, it has been regarded as the \"premaxillary\" of the right side, because, in the corresponding dental plate of D. Terrelli and D. Hertzii, as represented diagrammatically by Dr. Newberry*, it is the outer side of the upper portion that is laterally expanded. If the specimen from Snake Island should prove to be the \"premaxillary\" of the left side, the terms inner and outer, in the preceding description of its characters, will of course have to be reversed. In either event, it is not at all likely to be confounded with the \"premaxillary\" of any of the described species of Dinichthys.\n\nAspidichthys (?) Notabilis. (N. Sp.)\n\nPlate 17, figs. 1 and la.\n\nThe foregoing name is suggested provisionally for a specimen, which, as suggested to the writer by Professor Cope, is probably the median plate of the ventral shield of a large fish belonging to the family Coccosteidae. When entire, this plate must have been eight inches or more in length and at least seven inches in its maximum breadth. The specimen, which\n\n*Rep. Geol. Surv. Ohio, vol. II, pt. 2, Palaeont., (1875), pp. 7 and 8.\nwas collected by Mr. Tyrrell, in 1889, at South Manitou Island, Lake Winnipegosis, is very well preserved, although imperfect and somewhat crushed or distorted. It is nearly flat but slightly convex above, and shallowly concave below. As viewed from above, it consists of a central tuberculated area, with a broad and slightly bevelled outer margin devoid of tubercles. The central tuberculated area, whose outer limits are by no means sharply defined, is longer than broad, symmetrical, and somewhat five sided, though the side which presumably represents the anterior end of the plate and which therefore it will be convenient to call the antero-median side, is shorter and narrower than any of the others, and concavely and rather deeply emarginate, apparently to allow of the overlap of the narrowly rounded posterior end of an antero-median plate. The two antero-lateral sides are at first nearly straight and parallel to the longitudinal axis of the plate, but they are very slightly expanded about the midlength and concavely contracted posteriorly. The two postero-lateral sides are nearly straight and converge gradually and obliquely until they meet at an acute angle in the centre posteriorly. The outer and non-tuberculate margin is nearly two inches in breadth at its broadest part.\n\nThe surface markings of the central area consist of numerous small, smooth and rounded tubercles, which are unequal in size and irregular in their distribution, though the largest average two millimetres in diameter at the base, and from two to five millimetres in their distance apart at the summits. The greater part of the bevelled outer margin is smooth to the naked eye, but around its outer limits there are indications of short and irregular radiating grooves and ridges.\n\nThe actual length of the central tuberculated portion of the specimen, as measured in the median line, is 167 millimetres; the approximate breadth of the same, at the lateral angles, is about 113 mm. The maximum thickness of the test is six mm.\n\nThe genus *Aspidichthys*, Newberry, was based upon a single dorso median plate, of gigantic dimensions, which is stated* to be \"similar in form to that of *Pterichthys*, but many times larger\" and to be \"covered with large hemispherical, smooth, enamelled tubercles.\" \"The most striking feature in this plate,\" Dr. Newberry says,\u2020 \"is its external ornamentation. This consists of knobs or bosses of smooth, shining enamel, of the size and form of split peas. In its general aspect this tuberculation resembles that of *Pterichthys* or *Corcorus*, but differs strikingly in this, that the tubercles are perfectly smooth and polished, and show nothing of the\n\n* Rep. Geol. Surv. Ohio, vol. I, pt. 2, Paleont., (1873), p. 322.\n\u2020 Ibid., p. 323.\nstellate ornamentation which is to be seen on the plates of nearly all the great mailed fishes of the old world.\" This character, Dr. Newberry thinks, is of generic value.\n\nThe ventral armature of *Aspidichthys claratus*, Newberry, the typical and heretofore only known species of the genus, is entirely unknown, and the imperfect median ventral plate collected by Mr. Tyrrell is referred to *Aspidichthys* provisionally, only on account of the similarity of its surface ornamentation to that of the dorso-median plate of *A. claratus*. The impression that the specimen from South Manitou Island makes upon the mind of the writer is that of the median ventral plate of a large fish more nearly allied to *Coccostenus* than to *Pterichthys* or *Bothriolepis*, but which differs from that of *Coccostenus* in the circumstance that it is partially overlapped, not only by the two postero-lateral and two antero-lateral plates, but also by the narrowly rounded end of an antero-median plate. The median ventral plate of *A. notabilis* was evidently of much smaller size than that of *A. claratus* could have been, besides being much more minutely tuberculated, and it is quite likely that the discovery of more perfect specimens of these two forms may show differences between them that are of generic rather than of specific value.\n\n**TELEOSTOMI.**\n\n**CROSSOPTERYGII.**\n\n**ONYCHODUS.** (Sp. Undt.)\n\nAn imperfect scale of a fish, which is probably referable to this genus, was collected by Mr. Tyrrell or the present writer, in 1888, on the north shore of Manitoba Island, in Lake Manitoba. The scale is not quite three-quarters of an inch in its maximum diameter, cycloidal and not far from circular in outline. Its under surface, the surface which happens to be exposed, is marked by fine concentric wrinkles and by very minute radiating raised lines, which are too small to be seen without the aid of a lens. The substance of the scale is so thin as to be transparent, and with a lens minute tubercles, apparently for the most part disposed in radiating lines, can be detected over most of its upper surface.\n\nAll the remains of fishes that have so far been collected from the Devonian rocks of this region, are from the beds immediately above the Stringocephalus zone, at the supposed base of the Upper Devonian.\nThe stratigraphical relations of the subdivisions of the Devonian system in this region are described in detail in Mr. Tyrrell's \"Report on North-western Manitoba, with portions of the adjacent districts of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan,\" published as Part E of vol. V, New Series, of the Annual Reports of this Survey. In a preceding paper, published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1894,* Mr. Tyrrell states that \"near the north-eastern angle of Lake Manitoba the typical Niagara dolomites are overlain by a few feet of thick-bedded stromatoporoid magnesian limestone holding *Pycnostylus Guelphensis,* which probably represents the Guelph formation. \"Over these Silurian limestones there is, in the lacustral region, a gap in the known section,\" and the lowest Devonian rocks exposed are a few feet of soft red shales, which are apparently unfossiliferous. Above these shales, \"a hundred feet or more of harsh porous dolomites, containing *Pentamerus comis,* &c.,\" are \"overlain by a similar thickness of tough white dolomites containing *Stringocephalus Burtini.*\" Above these dolomites are fifty to seventy feet of calcareous shales marked by many brine springs along their line of outcrop; to these succeed a \"highly fossiliferous limestone containing great beds of *Atrypa reticularis,* and this is \"overlain by light grey compact brittle limestones which represent the local top of the Devonian.\" \"As far as could be seen, the whole of these rocks \"are practically conformable and almost undisturbed throughout.\n\nIt has already been stated (on page 258) that all the fossils that are enumerated or described in the present paper, are probably from the Middle and Upper Devonian. The Middle Devonian appears to be represented in this region by the Stringocephalus zone and the hundred feet or more of fossiliferous dolomite immediately beneath it, and the Upper Devonian by all the beds above the Stringocephalus zone and beneath the Cretaceous.\n\nThe discovery of dolomites in which *Stringocephalus Burtini* is one of the most characteristic fossils, at many localities on the shores or islands of Lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis, is of considerable interest to the geologist. In Manitoba the Stringocephalus zone appears to occupy much the same stratigraphical position as the Stringocephalus limestone of Germany and England, and it is noticeable that among the fossils of the Stringocephalus zone of Manitoba there are several which can be identified with well-known European species. Among these are *Sphaerospongia tessellata,* *Farosithe Gothlandica,* *Pachypora cervicornis*:\n\n---\n\n*Vol. IX, Sect. 4, pp. 91, 92.\nProductella productoides, var. membranacea; Strophodonta interstrialis; Atrypa reticularis, and its var. aspera; Rhychoonella pugnax; Paracyclas antiqua; the Murchisonia referred to on p. 315 as M. Archiacana, but which, as stated in a postscript a little farther on, is probably a variety of the M. turbinata of Schlotheim; Euomphalus annulatus; Loxonema priscum; and Macrochilina subcostata, besides the Stringocephalus Burtini itself.\n\nIn the preceding pages a (S.) is prefixed only to those species which are characteristic of beds in which Stringocephalus has actually been found. It has been omitted in some few instances, such as in the case of Cyrtina Hamiltonensis, for example, where the species seems to be rare in the Stringocephalus zone, but abundant in the beds below or above that zone; and it is of course not prefixed to species from beds whose lithological characters and stratigraphical position are believed to be identical with those of the Stringocephalus zone, although no specimens of Stringocephalus have as yet been found in them.\n\nThe \"Cuboides zone\" appears to be represented in this region by those beds on the Red Deer River and elsewhere, in which Cyathophyllum corniculare, var. precursor; Cyathophyllum dianthus; Chonetes Loganii, var. Aurora; Productella subaculeata; Orthis striatula; Strophodonta arcuata; and Cyrtina Hamiltonensis are the prevalent fossils, although Rhychoonella cuboides itself has not yet been found in them.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT.\n\nMURCHISONIA TURBINATA, Schlotheim.

On some additional or imperfectly understood fossils from the Hamilton formation of Ontario, with a revised list of the species therefrom.\n\nThe second paper in this volume, on the fossils of the Hamilton formation of Ontario, was based upon all the specimens that the writer had seen, and upon all the information on the subject that was available up to the close of 1886. In that paper, the names of the earliest collectors of the fossils of these rocks and the dates at which the collections were made, were inadvertently omitted. All the authentic information on these points that the writer has been able to gather, is as follows:\n\n1855. Alexander Murray and James Hall collected fossils together at Widder and along the Rivi\u00e8re aux Sables at Bartlett's Mills, and elsewhere, in 1855, as stated in Murray's Report for that year and verbally by Professor Hall to the writer in the spring of 1890.\n\n1868. Numerous fossils in the Museum of the Survey are labelled \"Hamilton formation, Bosanquet, J. Pettit, 1868.\"\n\n1873-74. Professor H. A. Nicholson (in a letter dated March 7, 1898) says that his collecting near Widder and Arkona was carried on principally, if not entirely, during the years 1873 and 1874.\n\n1872-79. Dr. G. J. Hinde (in a letter dated February 5, 1898) says that he collected fossils at Thedford (Widder) and the neighbourhood for the seven consecutive years from 1872 to 1879, both years inclusive.\n\nSince this paper was written, the publication of several monographs on special groups of fossils has thrown new light upon this local fossil fauna, and much additional material has been accumulated by local collectors. During three visits to Thedford, in 1889, 1891 and 1897, the writer has not only collected the fossils of that neighbourhood (inclusive of Bartlett's Mills) but also made careful examinations of the collections made by the Rev. Hector Currie, and more recently by Mr. G. Kernahan and Mr. N. J. Kearney, of Thedford. These gentlemen have kindly lent to the writer most of the choicest specimens that they have obtained up to the present\ndate and have presented many of them to the Museum of the Survey. Mr. Charles Schuchert, who made an unusually large collection of the fossils of the Thedford district in 1895 for the United States National Museum, has favoured the writer with a most accurate list of all the species that he obtained on this occasion, and generously supplemented it with a loan of specimens of forty-five of the species, for examination and comparison. Exclusive of some undetermined and possibly undescribed polyzoa (bryozoa), Mr. Schuchert's list, which, with his permission, has been freely used in the preparation of this paper, includes the names of about thirty species that had not previously been found in this formation in Canada. Mr. B. E. Walker, of Toronto, who made a collection of the fossils of the Thedford district in 1896, has also given the writer every facility for examining his specimens and has lent many of them for further study and comparison. To each of these obliging friends the writer's thanks are due and are here very cordially tendered.\n\nThe present paper is a succinct statement of the results of a detailed study of this new material and of additional studies of all the specimens from this formation and province, in the Museum of the Survey. In connection therewith, the writer desires to express his obligations to Mr. Schuchert for several critical suggestions; to Mr. L. M. Lambe for valuable assistance in ascertaining the minute characters of several species and in checking off measurements; to the late Dr. S. A. Miller (of Cincinnati) for comparing specimens of two species of Dolatocrinus with the types of the species described by him, in connection with Dr. Gurley; and to Mr. Victor W. Lyon (of Jeffersonville, Indiana) for the comparison of two specimens with the types of Megistorcrinus rugosus is his possession, and for the use of an original drawing or diagram of the plates composing the dorsal cup and tegmen of that species, by his father, the late Major Sidney S. Lyon.\n\nC\u0152LENTERATA.\n\nSPONGIAE.\n\nASTREOSPONGIA HAMILTONENSIS, Meek and Worthen.\n\n*Astraeospongia Hamiltonensis*, Meek and Worthen. 1866. Proc. Chicago Acad. Sc., vol.

This volume, pt. 3, p. 198, pl. 28, figs. 1 and 1a.\n\nSeparate six rayed spicules, which appear to be referable to this species, have been found at Thedford and Bartlett's Mills, as stated elsewhere (*op. cit.*, p. 198) in this volume.\nSupposed Bundles of Spicules.\n\nTwo specimens, which Mr. Schuchert thinks are \"anchoring bundles of spicules,\" were collected by him, in 1895, in the \"Middle third of the section\" at Thedford. Both are No. 26,462 of the United States National Museum Catalogue of Invertebrate Fossils. The more perfect of the two is a bundle of extremely slender and apparently simple spicules, upwards of an inch in length, forming a nearly cylindrical, narrow and densely aggregated mass at one end, but flattened, spreading and moderately expanded at the other.\n\nSupposed Cliona Borings.\n\nTwelve specimens of Spirifera pennata, Atwater (= S. mucronata, Conrad) collected by Mr. Schuchert from the \"Upper third of the section\" at Thedford, show peculiar markings which he thinks are \"Cliona borings.\" For the greater part of their length these markings are rather minute grooves than burrows, but this circumstance is probably due to the exfoliation of the outer layer of the test of each of the Spirifers. These twelve specimens are No. 26,463 of the United States National Museum Catalogue of Invertebrate Fossils.\n\nAnthozoa.\n\nAlcyonaria.\n\nAulopora serpens (Goldfuss) Rominger.\n\nAulopora serpens (Goldfuss) Rominger. 1876. Geol. Surv. Mich., Fossil Corals, p. 86, pl. 33, fig. 2.\n\nNumerous specimens of a creeping, parasitic, auloporoid coral, which Mr. Schuchert has identified with this species, and which certainly agree very well with Rominger's description and figures of it, have been collected near Thedford and at Bartlett's Mills. Mr. Lambe, however, thinks that these specimens are merely young colonies of a species of Syringopora, and it is obvious that their internal structure is essentially as in that genus.\n\nIn his first report on the Palaeontology of the Province of Ontario, Professor Nicholson refers a coral, which he says is \"common in the Hamilton formation of the Township of Bosanquet, adhering to brachiopods and corals,\"\u2014to the Aulopora cornuta of Billings. Upon the strength of this identification the name of A. cornuta was inserted in a previous list of the fossils of this formation. But the types of A. cornuta are from the Corniferous limestone, and Mr. Lambe, who has recently studied their\ninternal structure, is of the opinion that they are only parts of the basal reticulation of specimens of *Syringopora Macurei*, Billings.\n\nMr. Schuchert also identifies two creeping attached corals that he collected at Bartlett's Mills, with the *Aulopora procumbens* of Davis, which is figured on Plate 73 of \"Kentucky Fossils Corals.\" But that species has never been described, and there is nothing to show what its internal structure is like.\n\n**Monilopora antiqua. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 48, figs. 1, 2, 3 and 3\u03b1.\n\nCorallum compound, at first attached to and either wholly or partially encircling foreign bodies, but apparently free and ramosely ultimately. Most of the specimens that the writer has seen are parasitic on portions of the columns of crinoids, in some cases (as in fig. 1) completely enveloping them, except at the ends, and throwing out corallites in every direction; in others (as in fig. 2) only partially attached and spreading out into a thin, nearly flat, sub-circular lateral expansion, with all the corallites springing from its upper surface, and the lower surface consisting of a concentrically wrinkled epitheca. In this state of preservation the corallites are numerous, tubular, or somewhat conical and widening slightly outward, rather short, simple, bifurcate, trifurcate, or twice bifurcate, very unequal in size, the larger ones averaging about four millimetres in diameter at their summit. In two or three fragments, however, the most perfect of which is represented by figure 3, the branches are entirely free, and zigzag, with alternating corallites. In all the specimens the calyces are deep, the septa are almost obsolete and represented only by a faint minute longitudinal grooving of the inner surface of the calyx, and the upper or outer edges of the calyces are thin and finely denticulated by the minute longitudinal channelling of the exterior of the summits of the corallites.\n\nExcept upon the basal epitheca of laterally expanded specimens, the whole of the surface is minutely granulo-striate and marked by irregularly disposed and very minute granules, tubercles, or low, interrupted longitudinal ridges, with equally minute grooves or channels between them.\n\nA longitudinal section of a portion of a free branch, which is bifurcate above, shows that the branch is hollow throughout its length, and quite devoid of tabulae or of funnel-shaped diaphragms. The wall is rather thin, but no thin microscopic sections of any portion of it have yet been made, to show whether its structure is minutely cancellated or not.\n\nThis well-marked species appears to be not uncommon at Thedford, where specimens were collected by Mr. Johnson Pettit in 1868, by the\nRev. Hector Currie in 1880, by the Rev. J. M. Goodwillie in 1882, by Dr. H. M. Ami in 1883, and by the writer in 1889. So far as the writer is aware, it is the first species that has been recognized as occurring in rocks of Devonian age. It is easily distinguished by its very peculiar surface ornamentation, which, although rather difficult to describe adequately in words, is well shown by figure 3a.\n\nZoantharia.\n\n(Tetracoralla, Haeckel : = Rugosa, Edwards and Haime.)\n\nHeliophyllum juvenile, Rominger.

This vol., pt. 4, p. 272.\n\nMr. Schuchert has identified with this species three specimens of a coral which he collected in 1895 from the \"Middle third of the section\" near Thedford. These specimens, which the writer has examined, are evidently conspecific with the coral from lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis referred to on page 272 of the fourth part of this volume as a variety of *Favosites Gothlandica*, Lamarck. The latter determination was based upon the largely extended definitions of the characters of *F. Gothlandica*, by E. Billings and Prof. H. A. Nicholson, and more particularly on Mr. Billings's statements that the size of the tubes in the corals which he refers to that species, \"ranges from three-fourths of a line to a little more than two lines,\"*, and that \"the spiniform rays (or septa) exist in both upper Silurian and Devonian specimens of *Favosites*.\"\u2020\n\nIt is not clear to the writer why Dr. Rominger, in his monograph of the fossil corals of Michigan, proposes to substitute the new name *Favosites Hamiltonensis* for the *F. Alpenensis* and *F. dumosus* of Winchell.\n\nFavosites arbustula, Hall.\n\n*Favosites arbustula*, Hall. 1876. Illustr. Devonian Fossils, pl. 36, figs. 1-9.\n\n\" \" Calvin. 1888. Amer.

Corallites simple, short, tubular and slightly expanding, but closely amalgamated at the sides, radiating from an imaginary median axis, but appressed and very slightly divergent, their apertures directed outward and upward, all, but a few terminal ones, opening at the sides. Calyces deep, septa rudimentary, almost obsolete, apparently represented by numerous minute isolated tubercles, or possibly spine bases, with which their inner surface is strewn. Apertures of the calyces variable in outline, but mostly subovate or almost circular, the larger ones averaging from four to five millimetres in their longer diameter. Mural pores rather large and irregularly disposed.\n\nSurface nearly smooth, but marked with a few faint transverse striae of growth, which are scarcely visible without the aid of a lens. Where portions of the surface were rubbed down to show the internal structure, there are indications of funnel-shaped diaphragms immediately below the calyces.\n\nThe writer has seen only four specimens of this species, all of which are now in the Museum of the Survey. Two of these were collected by Mr. Townsend and are labelled by him, Township of Bosanquet; one was found by Mr. Kernahan, at Thedford; and one by the Rev. Hector Currie, at Stony Point, four miles east of Kettle Point, Lake Huron. It is just possible that these specimens should be referred to *Vermipora*, Hall, as redescribed by Rominger on pages 68 and 69 of his Fossil Corals of Michigan, but in *Vermipora* the transverse diaphragms or tabulae are said to be flat.

Primary arms in each ray, two. Basals and lower halves of the radials deeply incurved, like those of D. lacus, Lyon (as recently described by Wachsmuth and Springer on pages 311 and 312 of the first volume of their monograph of the \"North American Crinoidea Camerata\"), and formed, as in that species, into an \"inverted funnel-shaped cavity which is wider than the column, the latter touching only the bottom part.\" Around the base there is a large pentagon, the outer boundary of which is formed by a narrow continuous ridge which connects the radials laterally. Each of the angles of this pentagon is intersected vertically by a linear ridge, which occupies the middle of each ray, and each side of this pentagon forms the base of a triangle, the apex of which is the centre of the first interbrachial. The linear ridge along the median line of each ray is prominent, acute, and bears two laterally compressed, rather\nobtusely pointed tubercles, one at the midheight of the ray and in the centre of the first costal, and one at the point of bifurcation of the ray and in the centre of the second costal. The first interbrachials are ornamented with a large, prominent, upward pointed tubercle in the centre, with linear ridges radiating from it, and the tegmen with numerous, very small tubercles.\n\nBasals small, inverted: radials hexagonal, broader than high: first costals quadrangular, also broader than high: second costals pentangular and much broader than high: distichals $1 \\times 2$. A respiratory, slit-like opening on one side only of each arm base, and hence ten in all, each opening linear, well defined, placed close to and parallel with the ambulacral furrow. First interbrachials single and very large: second interbrachials also single, pentagonal and bent abruptly inward at their midheight. Tegmen composed of rather numerous large plates, the anal tube subcentral and rising gradually therefrom.\n\nThe foregoing description is based upon three well preserved and nearly perfect specimens of the calyx, one collected at Bartlett's Mills by the Rev. J. M. Goodwillie in 1882 and presented by him to the Museum of the Survey, and two found quite recently at Thedford by Messrs. Kernahan and Kearney. The first of these is the specimen referred to on page 98 of the second part of this volume and identified with *D. liratus* (Hall), on the authority of Mr. Wachsmuth, who thought that it might be a small form of that species, although it has \"only $1 \\times 2$ secondary radials.\" In view of the more detailed and illustrated description of *D. liratus* published by Wachsmuth and Springer, this identification seems to be no longer tenable, and the three specimens now under consideration more probably represent a small, strongly and very peculiarly sculptured, ten-armed and previously undescribed species, perhaps most nearly allied to *D. pulchellus* of Miller and Gurley, which, however, has a respiratory slit on both sides of each arm base, or twenty slits in all. Dr. S. A. Miller, who has kindly examined one of these specimens, regards it as quite distinct from *D. pulchellus*, and from any species known to him.\n\n**Dolatocrinus. (N. Sp.)**\n\nA single specimen of the calyx of a large *Dolatocrinus* which has a different arm formula to either of the two preceding species, and which is therefore presumably distinct from both, was collected at Thedford by the Rev. Hector Currie in 1882. On the authority of Mr. Wachsmuth, who thought that it has four primary arms in each ray, this specimen was identified with *D. lamellosus*, the *Carabocrinus lamellosus* of Hall, on page 99 of the second part of this volume. But, in the first volume of their monograph of the American Crinoidea Camerata, published in 1897,\n(page 311), Messrs. Wachsmuth and Springer say that they have been unable to get authentic specimens of Hall's *Cacabocrinus lamellosus* and *C. Troostii*, and that the descriptions of them are too general for specific determination. Moreover, the original types of *C. lamellosus* are stated by Hall to be from the Upper Heiderberg limestone.\n\nDr. S. A. Miller, who has examined this specimen also, has convinced the writer that it really has seventeen arms, its arm formula being $4 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 4 = 17$, and thinks that it should be regarded as the type of a new species. It is, however, unfortunately too imperfect to admit of a satisfactory description of its characters, although previously but incorrectly represented as \"nearly perfect,\" when most of its surface was covered by the matrix.\n\n**Dolatocrinus. (Species uncertain.)**\n\nPerhaps a var. of *D. tuberculatus*, Wachsmuth and Springer.\n\n*Cfr. Dolatocrinus tuberculatus*, Wachsmuth and Springer. 1897. N. Amer. Crinoidea Camerata, vol. I., p. 324, pl. 25, fig. 3.\n\nA single specimen of a large *Dolatocrinus* with a surface ornamentation differing materially from that of the preceding species, but which does not show the arm formul\u00e6, was collected at Thedford by Mr. Kearney in 1895 and is now in the Museum of the Survey. The dorsal cup of this specimen is apparently similar to that of *D. tuberculatus* in size, shape and sculpture, but the prominent circular rim at the base, which encircles the upper part of the column, is proportionately larger and thicker, so that the five large pointed tubercles which surround it, almost touch its outer edge and are not placed at some distance from it. In the type of *D. tuberculatus*, as figured in the monograph cited, the basal rim is about six millimetres and a half in its maximum diameter and the summits of the five large tubercles nearest to it are about five mm. from its outer margin. The basal rim of the Thedford specimen is fully ten mm. in diameter and the summits of the five large tubercles nearest to it are not more than two mm. from its outer margin. Although the external sculpture of this specimen is well preserved, the sutures between the plates of which the dorsal cup is composed are entirely covered by the matrix, so that it is not yet practicable to compare the number and relative shape of these plates with those of *D. tuberculatus*.\n\nNothing is known of the ventral disk or arms of that species, and of the Thedford specimen all that is preserved is a large portion of the dorsal cup, with most of the upper part of one of the rays. On the left side of this ray there was clearly one arm, but on the right side it is scarcely practicable to decide whether there was one arm or whether there were two.\nMegistocrinus rugosus, Lyon and Casseday.\n\nMegistocrinus rugosus, Lyon and Casseday. 1859.

Goodwillie in 1882, and presented by him to the Museum of the Survey. A similar, but much larger and in some respects better preserved specimen, was picked up in the Rivi\u00e8re aux Sables, near Thedford, in 1891, by Mr. G. H. Stone (of Almont, Michigan), who has also presented it to the Museum of the Survey. Both of these specimens have been sent to Mr. Victor W. Lyon, of Jeffersonville, Indiana, for comparison with the types of M. rugosus in his possession, and in regard to the former Mr. Lyon writes as follows, in a letter dated Nov. 5, 1897:\u2014\"I have compared the two Canadian crinoids with type specimens of Megistocrinus rugosus,\nLyon and Casseday, and find that your specimens are young specimens of that species. All *M. rugosus* that I have seen have sixteen arms. The larger one you sent has sixteen arms, and the shape and ornamental markings are identical with the type specimens, although somewhat worn. The markings on the smaller one are more distinct, but the basal plates do not show so well as in the larger one. Both are true *Megistocrinus rugosus*. I am obliged to you for sending these two crinoids, for I know now that *M. rugosus* has an extended distribution.\n\nThe original types of *M. rugosus* are from the \"quarries at Bear Grass Creek, near Louisville, Kentucky,\" though Clarke County, Indiana, is the first locality indicated for this species by Wachsmuth and Springer (*op. cit.*, p. 543).\n\n**Gennaeocrinus Arkonensis.

Diagram of all the plates of the dorsal cup that are visible in the specimen figured on Plate 18, with some of those at the commencement of the arms. Three times the natural size.\n\nCalyx unusually small for the genus, the most perfect specimen known (the one figured) being about ten millimetres in its maximum breadth, though slightly and abnormally compressed, and a little broader than high: arms very long in proportion to the size of the calyx, pinnules also long, numerous and densely crowded. Dorsal cup semiglobose, cup-shaped, widening gradually upward and widest above, its surface markings very faint and indistinctly defined. In the median line of the radial and first costal each ray is marked by an obscure, low, rounded, longitudinal ridge, which bifurcates in the upper portion of the second costal. The surface of the lower and larger plates also, especially that of the radials and first \"interbrachials,\" is marked with six or seven obscure, low, depressed-convex, radiating ridges near their outer margin, the central portion being entire and either smooth or occasionally bearing a\nminute tubercle. All the interbrachials, except the first, appear to be nearly or quite smooth.\n\nBasals three, hexagonal, rather more than twice as broad as high, slightly concave at their lower margin, which is thickened and projects outward in such a way as to form a narrow elevated rim. Radials and costals as high as broad, the radials and first costals hexagonal, the second costals heptagonal, but with an angular notch in the upper margin, between the two surfaces which articulate with the bases of each pair of primary distichals. Distichals $2 \\times 10$: primary distichals rectangular and higher than wide, secondary distichals pentagonal; palmars rectangular, nearly square; arms biserial and apparently eight in each ray. \"Interbrachials\" 1, 3, 5 (though the plates in this genus which Wachs-muth and Springer call the first interbrachials seem to the writer to be true interradials), the first large and heptagonal, the others hexagonal, decreasing slowly in size upward and succeeded by a row of about seven smaller plates. Characters of the tegmen unknown.\n\nColumn long, slender, in some cases apparently adherent to foreign bodies by a small, thin, laterally expanded base of attachment: its segments cylindrical or slightly swollen in the middle externally, circular in section, uniform in breadth and distinctly crenulated on both of their articulating faces.\n\nGood fragments of the arms and pinnules of this crinoid are not rare at Bartlett's Mills, but the only specimens with the dorsal cup preserved that the writer has seen are two collected at that locality by Mr. Kearney, one in 1895, and the other in 1896. The one collected in 1895, which has been kindly lent by Mr. Schuchert, belongs to the United States National Museum, and is No. 26,470 of its Catalogue of Invertebrate Fossils, and the one collected in 1896, which is figured on Plate 48, is now in the Museum of the Survey. Both of them have the whole of one side of the dorsal cup buried in the matrix. The specimen figured shows, on one side, two rays and a considerable portion of their arms and pinnules in situ, with the interradial or \"interbrachial\" plates between them, and a detached portion of the column;\u2014and on, the other, a beautifully preserved aggregation of arms and pinnules, with another small piece of the column. In a specimen from Thedford, which consists of the two posterior segments of the column only, and which seems to be referable to this species, the terminal segment is attached to a flattened branching polyzoon by a thin lateral expansion.\n\nAn apparently well marked species, characterized by its small dorsal cup, slender column, and, more especially, by its very feeble and almost obsolete surface markings.\nBotryocrinus crassus, Whiteaves.\n\n_Homoerinus crassus_, Whiteaves. 1887.

Bather makes the following remarks, on page 103 of his \"Crinoidea of Gotland\": \"This is founded on a dorsal cup from the Hamilton group, which cannot be distinguished from that of a Botryocrinus. The posterior side of the cup is not shown in the figure, but Mr. Whiteaves has very kindly sent me the type specimen, the evidence of which is quite clear.\"\n\nAncyrocrinus bulbosus, Hall.\n\nPlate 48, figs. 8 and 9.\n\n_Ancyrocrinus bulbosus_, Hall. 1862.

Hector Currie, who has presented four of them to the Museum of the Survey. Each of these specimens has four strongly developed \"obliquely ascending, spine-like processes,\" or \"lateral extensions,\" which are rarely less than a quarter of an inch and sometimes fully half an inch in length, when unbroken. In two of the specimens these processes originate at about the same height and are arranged in a rather regular cruciform manner, but in the other two they originate at different heights and are very irregularly disposed. No tendency to become square or nearly square anteriorly is seen in any of them, although the axial canal of each is cruciform, as viewed in transverse section at the anterior end, and none show any indication of division into segments.\n\nBlastoidea.\n\nPlate 48, figs. 8 and 9.\n\n_Pentremites Lucorias_, Hall. 1863.

Owen's description and figures of *S. costata*, however, are very vague and unsatisfactory, being based upon a specimen only three-eighths of an inch in its greatest diameter, though it should not be forgotten that the original type of *S. plicata* is described as a \u201clittle more than half an inch in length,\u201d with the \u201clength and width nearly equal.\u201d\n\nPholidostrophia Iowensis, Owen.

E. Billings, in his paper \"on the Devonian fossils of Canada West,\" published in 1860, identifies Chonetes\nhemisphaerica, Hall, as occurring in the Oriskany sandstone and Corniferous limestone of Ontario, but does not attempt to determine any of the species from the Hamilton formation of that province. Professor H. A. Nicholson, in his first \"Report upon the Paleontology of the Province of Ontario,\" published in 1874, identifies Chonetes lineata, (Conrad not Vanuxem) C. scitula, Hall, and C. lepida, Hall, as occurring in the Hamilton formation of that province, but thinks that C. lepida may be the young of C. scitula. It seems doubtful, also, whether the distinction between the specimens from this formation, which Nicholson refers to C. lineata and C. scitula, can be maintained. In the second part of this volume, published in 1889, (p. 113) the writer identified a specimen from Bartlett's Mills with the C. carinata (or coronata) of Conrad, and similar specimens have since been collected at that locality. Mr. Schuchert informs the writer that the species which he found at Thedford and Bartlett's Mills are C. scitula, C. coronata and C. vicina.\n\nChonetes lineata (?)

P. Whitfield, who had kindly compared them with authentic examples of that species. Mr. Schuchert, however, in his MSS. list of fossils from these\nlocalities, makes the following remarks upon similar specimens collected by himself. \"I believe this species to be distinct from *S. truncata*.

Three of these have both valves more or less well preserved, the others being imperfect single valves, but none of them show any indication of a fold or sinus. The most perfect of these specimens, which is about ten millimetres and a half in length, and twelve mm. in breadth, has about eight subangular plications on each valve, which do not reach to the beak. In a larger but very imperfect ventral valve, the plications are more feebly marked and nearly marginal, and the length is apparently a little greater than the height. Some of these specimens are very similar to the shell which Owen figures on Plate 3 A, fig. 1, of the Illustrations to his \"Report of a Geological Survey of Wisconsin, Iowa and Minnesota,\" which Mr. Schuchert identifies with *Pentamerella dubia*, Hall, but in that species the surface is said to be \"marked by from fourteen to twenty or more plications.\"\n\n**Gypidula L\u00e6viuscula**, Hall.\n\n*Gypidula l\u0153viuscula*, Hall. 1867.

Billingsi* of the Corniferous limestone in general shape and surface ornamentation, but differing therefrom persistently in its much more diminutive size, and more compressed valves. The largest specimens that the writer has seen are three collected at Thedford by the Rev. Hector Currie in 1882, which are of the following dimensions in millimetres. No 1, length 5, breadth 7; No. 2, length 6\u00b75, breadth 6\u00b725; No. 3, length 5\u00b75, breadth 6. Average examples, which appear to be adult, are not quite so large. On the other hand, two of the largest examples of *C. Billingsi* in the Museum of the Survey measure, the one 8\u00b725 mm. in length by 10\u00b775 in breadth, and the other 8 mm. in length by 9\u00b75 in breadth.\n\nAbundant at Thedford, where specimens have been collected by the Rev. Hector Currie, Mr. Kernahan, Mr. Kearney, Mr. Macintosh and Mr. Schuchert.\n\nIn a previous list of the fossils of this formation the three specimens collected by Mr. Currie in 1882 were regarded as a small form of *C. Billingsi*, but the subsequent examination and study of more than a hundred and fifty specimens has thrown considerable doubt on the correctness of this conclusion. Under the circumstances it seems desirable to distinguish these little shells by a local and provisional name, as they seem to bear about the same relation to the typical *C. Billingsi* that it does to *C. Horsfordi*, or that *C. Tethys* does to *C. Sappho*.\n\n**Leiorhynchus iris?** Hall.\n\nCfr. *Leiorhynchus iris*, Hall. 1867. Pal. N. York, vol. IV., p. 360, pl. 56, figs. 41-43.\n\nIn 1895, Mr. Schuchert collected, at Thedford, a somewhat imperfect specimen of a small rhynchonelloid shell, which he refers to this species, but with some doubt. This specimen is No. 26,504 of the United States National Museum Catalogue of Invertebrate Fossils, and two similar but more perfect specimens have since been collected by Mr. Kernahan at the same locality. On the ventral valve of each of these specimens there are two distinct longitudinal subangular plications in the sinus and two on each side or six in all, and on the dorsal three well marked plications on the mesial fold and two fainter ones on each side, or seven in all. None of these plications extend quite to the beak. Hall's description of *L. iris* does not give the number of plications on either valve, but, if his figures of that species are correct, there would appear to be ten or twelve plications on the ventral valve and ten on the dorsal.\n\n**Pugnax Kernahani.** (N. Sp.)\n\nShell very small for the genus, varying in marginal outline from subovate and a little longer than wide, to subpentagonal or nearly circular\nand as wide or a little wider than long, strongly convex, some specimens being higher or deeper than broad, most prominent on the dorsal side anteriorly, subtrigonal in a full edge view, and truncated in front.\n\nVentral valve shallower than the dorsal, regularly convex in the umbonal region and for about one half its length, but impressed anteriorly with a rather short mesial sinus which is bounded on each side by a short subangular ridge. At the front margin of this valve the mesial portion is prolonged and bent abruptly inward, and the lateral portions are minutely serrate or denticulate, there being apparently three minute denticles on each side of the sinus. Beak of the ventral prominent, acute, and but slightly incurved, the deltidium apparently longer (or higher) than wide.\n\nDorsal valve faintly plicated in the median line anteriorly, the fold being longitudinally depressed in the middle and bounded on each side by a short subangular longitudinal groove, which widens outward and is followed by a short subangular lateral plication.\n\nIn addition to the coarser markings already described, the surface is ornamented with fine lines of growth which are too small to be visible without the aid of a lens. Over most of the surface, they are comparatively few and distant, but close to the anterior margin they are very numerous and densely crowded.\n\n![Fig. 3.

Macintosh in 1895, has been identified with the A. spinosa of Hall by Mr. Schuchert. In two previous parts of this volume A. spinosa was regarded as synonymous with the Atrypa reticularis, var. aspera of European paleontologists, but as A. spinosa is still regarded as a valid species, the writer has thought it better to retain that name for the present and to give only American references. Thus, the Rev. G. F. Whidborne, in the third part of the second volume of his Monograph of the Devonian Fauna of the South of England, published by the Paleontographical Society in 1893, makes the following remark in reference to Atrypa aspera (Schlotheim). \"Atrypa spinosa, Hall, A. hystrix, Hall, and A. aspera, v. occidentalis, Hall, do not seem to me to be identical with this species, but closely allied.\" Professors Hall and Clarke, also, in 1895, in their\nexplanation of Plate 55 of the second part of the eighth volume of the Paleontology of New York, retain the name *Atrypa spinosa* for specimens from the Hamilton formation of that state, though, on page 172 of the same volume they expressly state that \"the *A. spinosa* of the Hamilton shales is but an *A. aspera* with the lamellae enfolded into tubular spines.\"\n\n**Spirifera pennata**, Atwater.

Billings, who called it Spirigera concentrica. In 1867 Professor Hall identified Canadian specimens of the same shell with A. spiriferoides. Mr. Billings was under the impression that A. concentrica was described by Bronn, in 1829, under the name Terebratula concentrica, in accordance with the statement made by Bronn himself on page 1233 of the second volume of his \"Index Palaeontologicus.\" Davidson, however, in the synonymy of that species in his monograph of British Devonian Brachiopoda, says that Terebratula concentrica was first described by Von Buch in 1839, and definitely accepts that year as the date of its publication. If Davidson's conclusion is correct, it follows that, whether the American fossil be identical with the European species or not, the name A. spiriferoides has eight years priority of date over A. concentrica. Mr. Schuchert thinks that all the small specimens from Thedford and Bartlett's Mills should be referred to Athyrus Fultonensis, Swallow (= A. vittata, Hall) and that only the larger ones are A. spiriferoides. Professor Hall says that the spires or spiral coils of the interior of A. vittata are quite distinct from those of A. spiriferoides, but the writer has never seen any specimen of an Athyrus from Thedford or Bartlett's Mills in which any portion of the internal spires is visible.\n\nATHYRIS FULTONENSIS, Swallow.

In the Museum of the Survey there are a few characteristic examples of the typical form of P. turbinatum, collected by J.

This specimen, which is No. 26,485 of the United States National Museum Catalogue of Invertebrate Fossils, is about fourteen lines in length, or height, and has most of the test preserved, although somewhat pyritized. Three specimens of essentially the same size and shape, but with little or no portion of the test preserved, had previously been found, one at Bartlett's Mills by the Rev. Hector Currie, and the others near Thedford by J. Townsend and G. Kernahan.\n\n**Pleurotomaria Arkonensis. (N. Sp.)**\n\nPlate 48, figs. 12 and 12a.\n\nShell depressed turbinate, nearly twice as broad as high and flattened below.\n\nVolutions six, the first four forming a moderately elevated subconical spire, the last two almost step-shaped, and much more rapidly expanding laterally. Outer volution depressed, flattened next to the suture, then sloping obliquely downward, above, and truncated at the periphery; its surface marked by a spiral row of minute rounded tubercles, of uniform size and closely contiguous, above the slit-band, and by a similar row of tubercles below it; the upper row being placed about half way between the suture and the slit-band, and the lower one on the lower or anterior margin of the periphery. Slit-band placed on the outer edge of the apical side of this volution, and bounded by two minute and parallel spiral ridges, the outermost of which constitutes the upper or posterior margin of the periphery. Umbilicus apparently of moderate width in casts of the interior and rather narrow when the test is preserved, but all the specimens that the writer has seen have most of the umbilical surface covered by the matrix.\n\nThe foregoing description is based upon two specimens collected at Bartlett's Mills, by Mr. Kernahan, in 1895, both of which are now in the Museum of the Survey. One of these, which is figured, has the test preserved, and the other is a mere cast of the interior of the shell. The former, which is twenty millimetres in its maximum breadth, and about eleven mm. high, has most of the umbilical side covered with the matrix, and the flattening of the base is perhaps abnormal. A worn cast of the interior of a shell, which is probably referable to this species, in the Museum of the Survey, is labelled \"Hamilton formation, Township of Plympton, A. Murray,\" and a similar but unworn cast was found at Thedford, a few years ago, by the Rev. Hector Currie. In each of these casts the outer\nportion of the last volution is obliquely flattened above and below, and the volution itself is encircled with four low, obtusely angular spiral ridges, one on each side of the periphery, one about half way between the suture and the upper or posterior margin of the periphery, and one which forms the umbilical margin.\n\n**Euomphalus (Phanerotinus) laxus.**\n\n*Euomphalus laxus*, Hall. 1861.

Only one of these has any portion of the test preserved, the other six being mere decollated casts of the outer volution of the shell. A fine specimen, with two volutions and most of the test preserved, which is also referable to this species, was collected at Thedford, in 1897, by Mr. R. Mackintosh, who has kindly presented it to the Museum of the Survey.\n\nThe specimens from lakes Manitoba and Winnipegosis that are identified with the *Euomphalus annulatus* of Phillips, on page 325 of the fourth part of this volume, and figured on Plate 43, (figs. 1, 1a, & 2) seem to differ from this species only in being much more closely coiled.\n\n**Loxonema** (Species undeterminable).\n\nTwo casts of the interior of the shell of a rather slender species of *Loxonema*, labelled simply \u201cWidder,\u201d are among the old collections of the Survey, and were probably collected at least thirty years ago. Both of these casts are very imperfect posteriorly, but the more perfect of the two is two inches in length and has four volutions preserved, those of the spire being rather strongly convex, with an oblique suture. Scarcely any vestige of the test is preserved on either, but the cast of the last volution of each is marked by coarse, distant, flexuous, transverse plications. These specimens do not seem to agree very well with Hall\u2019s description and figures of any of the species of *Loronema* from the Hamilton formation, in the second part of the fifth volume of the Paleontology of New York, but come rather close to the *L. persuta* of the Upper Helderberg limestone, and especially to the two specimens represented by figures 11 and 12 of Plate 13 of that volume.\nPTEROPODA.\n\nColeoptrion (?) tenuis, Hall.\n\nColeoptrion (?) tenuis, Hall. 1879.

Under these circumstances the following provisional arrangement of the species is suggested.\n\nA. Shell large,\n\nA. 1. Chamber of habitation apparently much longer than the septate portion of the shell.\n\nORTHOCERAS ANAX, Billings.\n\nOrthoceras Anax, Billings. 1875. Canad. Nat. and Geol., vol. VII, (N. S.), p. 238.\n\nThe original description of this species, which is the only one that has been published, is as follows. \"Shell about two feet long and from three to three and a half inches in diameter at the aperture. Septa from six to eight in a length of two inches, where the diameter is eighteen lines.\nSiphuncle nearly central, cylindrical or nearly so, two lines in thickness where the diameter of the shell is sixteen lines.\"\n\n\"The best specimens in the collection (those from one and a half to two feet in length) show none of the septa except in the five or six inches of the smaller extremity. One only, shows a single septum which is five and a half lines deep where the diameter is two inches and a quarter. In the same locality, and in the same state of preservation, were found a number of fragments in which there are eight or nine septa in a length of four inches, where the diameter is between two and three inches. I think these all belong to the same species.\"\n\nMr. Billings does not say whether his types of O. Anax are from the Hamilton formation or Corniferous limestone, but several specimens of a large Orthoceras, in the Museum of the Survey, which are labelled as having been collected in the Township of Rosanquet by Mr. J. Richardson, in 1855, and by Mr. Johnson Pettit, in 1858, are evidently the originals of the foregoing description. Six of these specimens, which are probably some of the \"fragments\" referred to, are much too imperfect for specific determination, but five are fine and apparently typical but very badly preserved examples of O. Anax. The approximate dimensions of three of these latter is as follows, commencing with the largest. No 1 (which is very slightly curved), total length twenty-one inches, of which between about four inches and three-quarters at the smaller end are distinctly septate; No. 2, total length sixteen inches and three-quarters, of which between three and four inches are septate; and No. 3, total length fourteen inches and a half, of which about two inches are septate. A fourth specimen, which is not more than five inches in length, is also probably the one upon which Mr. Billings based the statement that the siphuncle of O. Anax is \"two lines in thickness where the diameter of the shell is sixteen lines.\"\n\nJudging by these five specimens, and by Mr. Billings's description of the species, it would seem that the only distinctive character of O. Anax is the apparent length of its chamber of habitation, a character which is not exhibited in any of the Devonian species of Orthoceras described and figured by Hall in the second part of the fifth volume of the Palaeontology of the State of New York, and one which is very possibly due to the imperfect preservation of the specimens.\n\nA. 2. Chamber of habitation much shorter than the septate portion of the shell.\n\nOrthoceras Lambtonense (Nom. prov.)\n\nPlate 49, figs. 1 and 1 a\n\nShell longicone, increasing very slowly in thickness, and circular in transverse section: chamber of habitation nearly cylindrical, apparently\nunconstricted, much shorter than the septate portion; siphuncle almost central, small, and not encircled by an \"elevated areola\" at the septa (as in *O. Marcellense*, Hall), its elements between the septa unknown: surface markings unknown, though all the casts of the interior that the writer has seen are smooth and entirely devoid of a median central carina.\n\nThe most perfect specimen of this species that the writer has seen was collected near Thedford, in 1894, by Mr. Kernahan, who has kindly presented it to the Museum of the Survey. It is slightly imperfect at both ends, and its termination anteriorly is both irregular and indefinite, but its dimensions are approximately as follows: Total length, about seven inches; length of chamber of habitation, from two inches to two inches and a quarter; thickness, at the smaller end twenty-seven millimetres, at the larger forty-eight; number of septa preserved, seventeen; distance between two contiguous sutures, about six mm. and a half at the smaller end and eight mm. at the larger.\n\nThe only other specimens that the writer has seen which are clearly referable to this species, are three fairly good ones (two of which have part of the body chamber preserved), and three fragments, collected at Bartlett's Mills by G. Kernahan and C. Schuchert in 1895. All six are now in the United States National Museum, and are No. 26,442 of its Catalogue of Invertebrate Fossils. In one of these specimens the sutures of the septa are as much as nine and ten mm. apart.\n\nThe shortness of the chamber of habitation is practically the only character that is relied upon to distinguish this species from *O. Anav*. The former is very similar in shape to *O. Marcellense*, Hall, but that species is described as having an eccentric siphuncle encircled by an \"elevated areola,\" and a median ventral carina on casts of the interior. The specific name for the fossil now under consideration is suggested by the fact that Thedford is in the county of Lambton.\n\nB. Shell small.\n\nB. 1.

A. Nicholson, that \"fragments of a slender *Orthoceras* which appear to belong to this species, are not rare in the Hamilton formation at Widder.\" The writer has not seen any of the specimens upon which this opinion was based, but most of the small Orthocerata from Thedford and Bartlett's Mills in the Museum of the Survey that have been loaned, for comparison, by local collectors, except those here referred to *Bactrites*, seem to agree better with Hall's latest description and figures of *O. subulatum* than with those of *O. exile*. In the remarks which follow the latest description of *O. exile* it is stated that it differs from *O. constrictum* and *O. subulatum* in its excentric siphuncle and more distant septa. The air chambers of *O. exile*, too, are described as \"increasing in depth towards the outer chamber,\" and as \"varying from two or three mm., to five mm., in the length of 100 mm., or about thirty chambers.\" With the exception of the *Bactrites* and of the two specimens here described as *O. Arkonense*, all the small Orthocerata from Thedford and Bartlett's Mills that the writer has seen, have a central or very nearly central siphuncle, about one millimetre in diameter. Some of them are crushed nearly flat, but others, which are undistorted, are circular in transverse section. The depth of the air chambers and consequent distance of the sutures apart, varies from as little as one millimetre throughout, to two or even three millimetres, in different specimens, though it is by no means certain that all these belong to the same species. However that may be, in this respect also they seem to agree better with the description of *O. subulatum* than with that of *O. exile*.\n\n**B. 2.

Surface markings unknown.\nBartlett's Mills, G. Kernahan, 1894: the two specimens figured, which he has kindly presented to the Museum of the Survey. The smaller of these (figs. 14 and 14a) is an undistorted fragment fifteen millimetres in length, and five mm. and a half in its greatest diameter, consisting of two whole air chambers and part of a third. The distance between the posterior septum and the one next to it, in this fragment is nearly seven mm. The larger one, the original of figure 13 on the same Plate, is about forty mm. in length. It is slightly but abnormally compressed, and consists of eight air chambers, the four posterior ones being deep with the septa widely distant, and the four anterior ones shallow with the septa comparatively near together.\n\nThe salient features of this species would seem to be the great distance of the septa apart, at a short distance from the body chamber, coupled with the very slender contour of the shell, and its eccentric siphuncle.\n\n**Bactrites (obliqueseptatus? var.)

In all the others the sutures are straight and continuous where they pass over the siphuncle. Yet, in the specimen represented, enlarged four times, on Plate 48, figs. 16 and 16a, which consists of ten air chambers, the ventral sinus is distinctly visible on each of the septa. Moreover, the Sandbergers, in their original description of *Bactrites*, say that this sinus, which they call the \"dorsal lobe,\" and regard it, as Hyatt says, as \"due to the approximation of the funnels to the side,\" is sometimes entirely wanting (\"interdum omnino nullus\"). In their representation too (*op. cit.*, pl. 18, fig. 2e) of the siponal or ventral side of two of the air chambers of *Orthoceras obliqueseptatum*, magnified, the exposures of the siphuncle at each of the\nsutures is so irregular in outline as to be evidently due to minute imperfections or breaks in the casts of the interior, or of the shell wall of these chambers.\n\nThis little pyritized *Bactrites* is abundant at Bartlett's Mills, but not quite so common at Thedford. At both of these localities specimens were collected by the Rev. Hector Currie in 1882, and more recently by Messrs. Kernahan, Schuchert, Walker and others. Altogether the writer has seen nearly a hundred of these specimens, the largest of which are not quite an inch long. Some of them are casts of the interior of the body chamber, either alone, or with one, two or more of the air chambers attached. In such specimens the body chamber is from nineteen to twenty-three millimetres long, and its dorso-ventral diameter anteriorly averages five mm. Others are casts of considerable portions of the septate end of the shell, sometimes with a small piece of that of the body chamber, and in one of the former fourteen septa can be counted in a fragment that is a little over fifteen mm in length.

One of these, a cast of the interior of the five last air chambers and of a considerable portion of the chamber of habitation, about 100 millimetres in length and about sixty-three in breadth at the aperture, has from thirty-five to forty spiral ribs. The other, which is a distorted cast of the chamber of habitation of a much larger specimen, about 141 millimetres in length and 103 mm. in breadth at the aperture, shows no indication of any ribs.\n\nIn his latest description of *N. liratus*, Hall says that in the typical specimen there are \"fourteen revolving ridges over the chambered portion of the shell,\" and that in another specimen there are \"nine strong plications seen on the lateral face of a partially compressed grand chamber.\" But, in the specimen of *N. liratus* represented by fig. 9 of Plate 60 of the second part of the fifth volume of the Paleontology of the State of New York, as many as fifteen ribs can be counted in one half of the circumference.\nCRUSTACEA.\n\nOSTRACODA.\n\nPrimitiopsis punctulifera, Hall.

This volume, pt. 4, p. 354, pl. 47, figs. 1 and 1a.\n\nNumerous small fragments of the dermal armature of fishes, from Thedford and Bartlett's Mills, with a surface ornamentation very similar to that of the cranial plates of Macropetalichthys Sullivanti were identified with that species on page 119 of the second part of this volume. Quite recently, however, the discovery, at Bartlett's Mills, of the two much larger fragments represented on Plate 50, has convinced the writer that the identification of the smaller ones with M. Sullivanti is no longer tenable. Both of the specimens figured are quite flat externally and hence clearly are part of the ventral region of the fish, and not of the dorsal or cranial. In both, also, there is a large, longitudinally median, tuberculated area, and, when perfect, both evidently had a broad, smooth, bevelled outer margin on both sides, for the overlap of lateral plates, and hence must have formed part of the median element. The original of fig. 1 on Plate 50 was collected in 1897 by Mr. Kernahan, who has kindly presented it to the Museum of the Survey. In it a portion of the smooth, bevelled surface, on each side of the tuberculated area, is preserved. The specimen represented by figure 2, on the same Plate, was collected by Mr. Kearney, in 1875, and is also in the Museum of the Survey. It is only a large portion of the right side of the plate (as viewed with the ventral surface uppermost) not far from its midlength, with the margin bevelled on the right of the tuberculated area, but in two directions, as if for the overlap of two lateral plates. Both of these specimens are evidently referable to Aspidichthys rather than to Macropetalichthys, and would seem to have formed portions of the ventromedian plate of a fish which at present can scarcely be satisfactorily distinguished from A. notabilis. The specimen collected by Mr. Kernahan (fig. 1) probably represents part of the anterior end of such a plate, though it shows no indication of the transverse, terminal, crescentic bevelled area preserved in the type of A. notabilis, and that collected by Mr. Kearney, (fig. 2) seems to be a portion of the right side of a similar plate.\n\nPlate (or scale), genus and species indeterminable.\n\nPlate 50, fig. 3.\n\nThe singular plate or scale represented on Plate 50, is labelled \"Rosanquet, Range 3, Lot 24,\" and was evidently collected before the \"Geology\nof Canada\u201d was published (in 1863), as this particular locality is referred to on page 382 of that volume. The organic part of the specimen is thin, nearly flat, somewhat diamond shaped, but unsymmetrical and unequal sided, with one of the sides deeply and almost angularly concave. Its maximum diameter is twenty-six millimetres, and its surface ornamentation consists of numerous, fine and closely disposed radiating raised lines or minute ridges, which are crossed by equally fine concentric striae or lines of growth.\n\nRevised list of the fossils of the Hamilton formation of Ontario.\n\nThe arrangement of the species of this list, as in a previous one, is generally in accordance with the classification adopted by Zittel in his Handbuch der Palaeontologie, but with some exceptions.

Dulmenensis, as stated in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1895.\n\nStill more recently, on receipt of the American Journal of Science for October, 1897, containing a description, with illustrations, of Linuparus atavus, the writer was struck with the resemblance of the specimens figured under that name to Podocrates Canadensis. In a correspondence which ensued, Dr. Ortmann says that he is now fully convinced of the identity of Linuparus atavus with Podocrates Canadensis, and that the species should be referred to the genus Linuparus, which was proposed by Gray, in 1847,* and based upon the recent Palinurus trigonus of De Haan. He also says that the genus Podocrates was first published by Geinitz in 1850, and that it is founded on a good figure.\n\n*List of the specimens of Crustacea in the British Museum, p. 70.\nPART 2.\n\nPage 151.\n\nFor \"Aucella mosquensis, var. concentrica,\" and the list of its synonyms, substitute the following.\n\nAucella crassicollis, Keyserling.\n\n*Aucella crassicollis*, Keyserling. 1846.

M. Dawson, in 1877, are *A. Piochii*, var *ovata*, but that those from all the other localities mentioned on pages 151 and 152 of this volume, should be referred to *A. crassicollis*, Keyserling. All the Aucell\u00e6 that the writer has yet seen from Canadian localities are from a well-defined horizon in the Earlier North American Cretaceous.\n\nPage 156.\n\nFor \"Placenticeras Perezianum\"\u2014read:\n\nDesmoceras Perezianum.\n\nAnd, add to the list of references:\n\n*Desmoceras Perezianum*, Whiteaves. 1892.

Ogilvie, in 1885, from the Cretaceous rocks of the Peace River, a few miles below Fort Vermilion. Numerous other specimens, from rocks of similar age on the Peace River and its tributaries, collected by Mr. McConnell in 1889, were described and figured in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada for 1892. As the surface of none of these specimens can be called smooth, or even very nearly smooth, the species was redefined under the name Desmoceras affine, on account of its close resemblance to D. Beudanti, and the name glabrum retained in a varietal sense and restricted to those specimens in which the distant periodic arrests of growth are not developed.\nPART 3.\n\nPage 202.\n\nFor \"Campophyllum ellipticum\"\u2014read:\n\nCyathophyllum McConnelli.

Professor Calvin, who has recently compared the best of them, the original of Plate 27, fig. 5, of this volume, with Iowa specimens, thinks that it is generically but not specifically identical with Hall and Whitfield's species. Rominger, also, in his Fossil Corals of Michigan, page 104, says that C. ellipticum is not a Chonophyllum but a Cyathophyllum allied to C. Houghtoni. Under these circumstances it seems most prudent to distinguish the three Hay River specimens formerly designated as Campophyllum ellipticum by the foregoing new specific name, in honour of their discoverer, and to refer them provisionally to the genus Cyathophyllum.\n\nPage 204.\n\n\"Phillipsastr\u00e6a Hennahi, Lonsdale.\"\n\nThe corals from the Peace and Hay rivers which were referred to this species, were so identified solely by their external characters. Sections since made shew that they and the specimens from the Hay River referred to Phillipsastr\u00e6a Verrillii, have more the structure of Pachyphyllum than of Phillipsastr\u00e6a proper, though Rominger maintains (Fossil Corals of Michigan, page 127) that the separation of these two genera is both \"artificial and inappropriate.\" It is quite likely that all those which have been identified with Phillipsastr\u00e6a Hennahi are mere varieties of Pachyphyllum Woodmani, although the specimens from the Hay River have rather smaller and less prominently exserted calyces, with a somewhat smaller number of septa.\n\nPage 205.\n\n\"Phillipsastr\u00e6a Verrillii, Meek.

In that publication he includes the specimens referred to un-\nder the name *P. subaculeata*, var *cataracta* on page 217, and those identified with the typical form of *P. subaculeata* on page 283, of this volume, in the synonymy of *P. spinulicosta*. On the other hand, it is to be noted that the Rev. G. F. Whidborne, in his Devonian Fauna of the South of England, vol. II., pt. 3 (1893), p. 155, says that *P. spinulicosta* and *P. subaculeata* var *cataracta*, are both varieties of *P. subaculeata*.\n\nPage 222.\n\nFor \"Spirifera cyrtin\u00e6formis, Hall and Whitfield\"\u2014read:\n\n*Cyrtia cyrtin\u00e6formis*, Hall and Whitfield.

Mr. Schuchert, however, who regards *Rhynchonella Emmonsi* as distinct from *R. cuboides*, thinks that the specimens collected by Mr. McConnell on the Hay and Peace rivers are referable to the former rather than to the latter species, and that they should be called *Hypothyris Emmonsi* (Hall and Whitfield).* \n\n*See his \"Synopsis of American Fossil Brachiopoda\" (1897) p. 233.*\nPage 232.\n\nFor \"Rhynchonella castanea, Meek\"\u2014read:\n\nHypothyris castanea, Meek.

Surface of the cast marked by very numerous, close-set, minute annulations or transverse raised ridges, which are rather variable in their arrangement and proportionate size. In some specimens, or in different parts of the same specimen, they are either very close-set and uniform in size, or alternately a little larger and a little smaller, or of equal size but not quite so close together.
