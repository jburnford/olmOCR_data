There is\nvery little furniture, namely one bed, dresser and stand, one small table, four chairs and a cook stove.\n\nI would ask that another bed and dresser be bought, a large kitchen table, and a Studer lounge in Buttefield and a small living room table. There is but one small coal oil lamp.

This may mean for what you again.\n\nI might say the house has been redecorated and looks very nice.\n\nThe kitchen floor has no carpeting or tile and is in very good shape. It is a room 11' x 15' also used as our living room and I am at present using their barrel from an old fireplace. The stove back that you mentioned for me to get a picture can now be had, they are very scarce, but the maker in Southampton will make me one it will run around fifty to sixty pounds.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Way, I would inform the Dept. that I have paid Mr. Way the full amount of the fee, having borne the cost of hiring a horse to transport the goods from the Bank of Hamilton, also board bill & hired help while doing this work.\n\nI would therefore request the Dept. to make the cheque payable to me.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJohn Duffield\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa\nOttawa, 8th September, 1902.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to return you herewith voucher in favor of Fred R.

I have been in charge\neach consecutive year since that date. Throughout these\nyears I have exercised the utmost care to keep down\nall unnecessary expenses both in connection with\nthe school and the teacher's dwelling.\n\nWhen I came here over seventeen years ago my\nfamily consisted of but two small children, myself\nand myself. My family consists now of eight members:\nsix children, their mother and myself a total of eight.\nThe accommodation which was adequate seventeen\nyears ago is entirely inadequate today.\n\nThere is just one small room downstairs in the\nhouse for a living room. This room is 15 ft. by 10 ft. 4 in.\nwith a 10 ft. ceiling. This small room is all that can\nbe used for both a living room and kitchen for\na family of eight. This small room has but one small\nwindow. The window faces the east and is so located\nthat less than an hour's sun can possibly enter\nthe room during the twenty-four hours of day.\n\nThere is a wood-shed attached to the main building\nfinished on the outside identically like the main\npart of the dwelling house and is connected to the\nlittle kitchen living room by a door giving convenient passage from one to the other. What I desire the Department to do is to have this wood-shed lathed and plastered and a proper floor placed in it so as to convert it into a comfortable living room or rather kitchen for either winter or summer use. It would require another window. This would make it into a well-lighted airy and very convenient addition to the little room we are now compelled to use for both kitchen and living room and would add immensely to the health and comfort of myself and family at but a small financial outlay to the Department.\n\nIn addition to this I beg to suggest that the house be sided with steel sheeting and that the shutters which are largely rotted to pieces, be repaired and both to be then painted in colours to suit the teacher and his family. The building is so deteriorating by rain, wind and weather and the present siding so loose and open that it would be an act of economy to have this done even if the comfort of the teacher and his family were left entirely out of consideration.\n\nHoping to hear from the Department at its convenience. I am your humble servant,\n\nT.J. Wallace\n\nTeacher.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to forward to the Dept. a request from Mr. Wallace, Teacher at the French Bay School on the Saguenay Agency requesting that some repairs be done to the Teacher's dwelling at French Bay which I would recommend that the repairs asked for be authorized by the Dept. as the dwelling house is out of repair and needs attention.\n\nI have the honor to be in your obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent\n\nSecretary Dept. of Indian Affairs\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am not in a position to recommend the last two items, as I was not aware the Dept. furnished more than one stove, as there is a kitchen stove there already, belonging to the dwelling.

It will be necessary, if possible to obtain competitive prices for the stove and the purchase should be made from firm quoting the lowest price.\n\nIf the teacher cannot build the kitchen cabinet you may arrange for the labourers to do this work.

Saving is both a duty and a necessity. Therefore a device that while heating the home will also do the cooking and baking and will save much fuel and floor space is clearly valuable.\n\nThe Composite is a real patented invention that by intrinsic merit has found a place in thousands of homes throughout Canada.\n\nBriefly, fuel is saved by providing perfect combustion in a large round brick-lined fire chamber. Provision is made whereby the heat generated can be perfectly controlled, first for heating the home, second for cooking on the four hole top and third by baking in the handy elevated oven. Naturally the greatest saving results when all its capabilities are utilized.\n\nCOMPOSITE BAKING\n\nThe remarkable baking powers of the \"Composite\" are largely due to its oven construction. A glance at the sectional view of the range will show that the heat not only travels on five sides of the oven, but confined as it is in the side and back pockets by patented flues will give abundant baking heat with the minimum of fuel.\n\nRECORD OF ACTUAL TEST\n\nThat capable housekeepers may know what to expect from this remarkable device, we give the following record from actual tests at our factory:\n\nWithin twenty minutes of lighting the fire, baking heat was reached. Twelve pounds of anthracite coal was used in the charge and baking heat was steadily maintained throughout ten hours by the addition of three pounds coal at four times. Thus, with twenty-four pounds of coal baking heat was steadily maintained ten hours. Meantime, the \"Composite\" was radiating comfort-giving heat and providing top cooking possibilities sufficient for any daily home purpose.\n\nManufactured by\n\nBEACH FOUNDRY LIMITED\n\nOTTAWA, CANADA\n\nBranches:\n\nWINNIPEG VANCOUVER\nA FEW OF THE MANY EXCELLENT FEATURES DISTINGUISHING THE \"COMPOSITE\"\n\nA.

Thousands of homes throughout Canada and the United States have bought Beach Composites. When you buy a Composite you can buy with confidence, for we know you will be delighted with your investment.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nHaving used the Beach Composite for over a year now I can say without reserve that it is just the right thing. My wife would not have any other stove to bake with as she says she can bake to perfection on her Composite. The oven heats up very quickly after lighting the fire; the oven is ready to bake anything, and as regards cooking, it is excellent.\n\nI have a five-room house on two floors and until I had this stove I was never comfortable.

When I did not sell it at once, I had it taken into my own house and it has given me the very best of satisfaction.\n\nI would not sell it for twice the amount if I could not get another. I have found nothing that has discovered our big range.\n\nYours truly,\nL.

I have had the school cleaned ready to open, I have also ordered the fuel for the residence. Miss Stead stated that she could supply her own dishes and part of the bedding required but as there is no furniture in the residence she could hardly carry on her duties at once, I told her to be ready to start teaching on Monday, January 8th, and I would try and have some furniture ready. The following is a list of what would be required, II window shades @ $1.70 each, 5 curtains with rods, for downstairs only, @ $1.25, 2 rugs @ $9.50 each, kitchen table $5.50, 4 chairs @ 95\u00a2 each, bed, spring, mattress, dresser and wash stand $68.00, 2 wicker chairs @ $8.50 each, 1 couch for living room, $22.00, 1 living room table, $12.00, blankets, sheets and pillows $12.00, lamp $2.00. Would you kindly advise me as soon as possible regarding these furnishings.

In this connection it is noted that Miss Stead, who was appointed teacher, will require to live in the residence, as there is no available boarding accommodation. It is noted, further, that this teacher will supply her own dishes and part of the bedding required but that there is no other furniture in the residence.\n\nYou may obtain competitive prices from firms on the list to receive consideration for the supplying of the following articles:- the number of window shades, curtains with rods, two rugs, a kitchen table, 4 chairs, a bed with spring and mattress, a dresser and wash-stand, two wicker chairs, one living room table, blanket, mats, pillows and a lamp. You should then make purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. It is considered that the prices which you submit for these articles are high in a number of cases and that serviceable articles could be obtained at a much lower cost. As our funds are extremely limited, the total amount available to cover the cost of the furnishings is $125, and this sum is not to be exceeded. It is thought that a couch for the living room is not necessary at the present time.\n\nIn making purchase of the furnishings, you should be guided by the total amount available, as accounts in excess of the amount stated cannot be paid. After the articles have been purchased, you should obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate. There, you should attach to proper voucher forms, certify in the usual manner and forward for payment. The quotations received by you should also be attached. The purchase and delivery of the furnishings should receive your prompt attention.\n\nI note that Miss Stead has been instructed by you to commence teaching duties on the 8th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It would cost about $65.00 for labour placing the siding on the building.\n\nIt would require about 3\u00bd gallons of light brown and 1 gallon of white paint for the interior of the residence, the cost of painting the interior would be about $40.00 for labour.\n\nI had Mr. Indoe, a painter from Southampton, to look over this residence and he states that the present siding could be cleaned and repainted with metallic paint in a light brown color. He states this paint would cover the rust and stand the weather. If it was decided to paint the present siding it would require about 3 gallons of paint, the cost of labour would be about $90.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon.

Have you considered the feasibility of removing the metal siding and replacing it with ordinary wooden siding. Please let me have an estimate of the cost of the latter.\n\nIn connection with the painting of the interior of this school it is noted that while only 4\u00bd gallons of paint would be required the cost of the labour would be $40.00. This appears excessive. Did you secure competitive prices for this work? Are there no Indians on the Reserve who could do the painting at a lower cost?\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

There are some of the Indians who could do this work if they had a white foreman with them who could show them what to do.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDon. Robertson\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant please let me have detailed information regarding the lumber that you will require for the siding in order that the necessary information can be given our Purchasing Agent.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter would it not be possible for you to supervise the painting of the interior of this building and employ Indians for the work? In this event do you consider that it would require $40.00 for the labour? As pointed out in my letter of the 29th ultimo this sum appears excessive in view of the amount of painting that has to be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nD.

I know he felt he was at different times employed successfully in other schools.\n\nOf course I will do every attempt to do matters through to my utmost. No one is more anxious than I am to have competent and energetic teachers in all our Indian Schools. It is not always easy to induce teachers of high rank to take such work. And for my own part I feel convinced that however good an Indian may be there will a disappointment in work among his first coming to parents indifference relations.\n\nBelieve me\n\nVery faithfully yours\n\nG. Algoma\nSCHOOL,\n\nDec 5th 1901\n\nMr. McLean,\nSec. Indian Dept., Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI called on the Bishop of Algoma today and he lordship showed me a letter from the Indian Department in which complaints are made by the Church of England school at Garden River that the Public School Inspector states \"that the teachers employed there are generally those who can find no other place and have no legal qualifications, and that Indian schools above all others require teachers who know how to teach them since the work is a failure.\"\n\nAs I am the Church of England missionary at Garden River and the school is in a state under my charge and I examine scholars and give instructions to the best of my knowledge, and also taught the school entirely for three months while teacher was sick and besides having been acquainted with this school and these Indian schools for thirty years, you will grant I think that I might say a word in its defense.\n\nYou will agree with me that the charges are of a grave and sweeping character especially when we consider what they are.\nmade by one who sees the school for an hour or two once or twice a year, more often than twice.\n\nIt is rather singular and scarcely consistent that Mr. McCaig stated at his last visit \"that the school was better than he had ever seen it before\u2014referring to attendance of scholars especially.\"\n\nMoreover as his lordship has already stated, the remarks are untrue. As far from being the fact that the teachers would find no other place, we have had the greatest difficulty in getting the teachers we so desired. The school was kept untaught because no one could be convinced or incompetent\u2014but we kept the position for Mr. Kane who was one of the best teachers that could be found having taught successfully in white schools in different places but he left us because it was so difficult to secure attendance of children notwithstanding her ability and accomplishments.\n\nWhen we consider that it is very seldom that Indian children get away long enough at school to get beyond the second reader\u2014and the simple rules of arithmetic\u2014one fails to see why any great scholarship is required on the part of the Indians. The school inspectors notwithstanding, my experience is that the great difficulty to get the children to school. I make continual visits to the homes and school from pulpit, but still it is the difficulty still over the same\u2014but then should not be charged against school or teacher but the innate hatred of the Indian children for school and neglect of parents.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Frost\nThe present teacher of the Garden River Church of England Indian School was educated in London Ont under the care of the Roman Catholic Auxiliary of the Church of England.

With 40 children on the reserve, the attendance is very low and very irregular. Very few pupils get beyond the First Book, and even in that they cannot read with any ease or knowledge of what the lesson is about. Teachers have the lowest or no legal qualifications whatever, and easily get into a hump-drum, squaw-show-please sort of way, which at the end of the year counts nothing, except that they have drawn their salaries.\n\nThe present teacher, Miss Ethel Frost, has had charge of the school for a little over a year and her qualifications, the Inspector says are very low and she has had no success.\n\nIn November of last year the attention of the Bishop of Algoma was called to the Inspector's remarks on this school, which were somewhat similar to those quoted, and His Lordship was asked to secure the services of a competent and energetic teacher to take charge of this school after the summer holidays of this year. His Lordship promised to attend to this matter and he wrote to the resident missionary, Rev. Mr Frost, who is the teacher's father, and that gentlemen wrote the Department, taking exception to\nthe Inspector's remarks.\n\nThe Indians have contributed $1300.00 of their own funds for the erection of a modern schoolhouse with comfortable accommodation for a teacher. This building is now completed and occupied for school purposes only, as the teacher lives at home with her father. I think that with the salary of $300.00 paid by the Department and the comfortable quarters provided, the Bishop should have no difficulty in securing the services of a properly qualified teacher, without whom no good results can be obtained. When a good teacher is obtained, the Department can enforce the Regulations and compel a good attendance. The Roman Catholics have a school on this reserve, which is doing good work, and there is no reason why the Protestant school should not be equally successful.\n\nI may add that the Department concedes the privilege of nominating teachers to the different religious denominations carrying on missionary work among the Indians in this district. If, however, the Bishop is unsuccessful in obtaining a good teacher, I think that the Department could, by advertising, obtain one.\n\nI have turned out the correspondence referred to on this file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOTTAWA, 23rd December, 1902\n\nMy Lord:\n\nI regret to have again to call your attention to the remarks made by the Public School Inspector in regard to the Church of England school at Garden River.

Hardiman\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 16th December, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Hardyman, teacher of the Church of England school on the Garden River reserve, has applied for an increase of salary. He is doing good work on the reserve and is only receiving $300.00 a year which is paid by the Band. I do not think the Band can stand any increase as they are contributing $300.00 as well for the maintenance of the Roman Catholic school on the reserve. Mr Hardyman is said to be a careful and zealous teacher and Mr Public School Inspector Green says that by his unremitting interest in the school, he is winning the children and their parents. The Inspector also states that he hopes Mr Hardyman's salary may be liberally supplemented as he cannot live decently and keep a wife and two children on the allowance he receives. Mr Hardyman has been engaged in Indian school work for the past fifteen years. The Ch. of England, properly speaking, should supplement his salary but the Diocese of Algoma is too poor to contribute anything. Mr Hardyman is evidently a good man and it would be a pity to lose him for the want of a small addition to his salary.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nSup.

Mr. Hardyman states that he has been offered the position of Principal of one of the boarding schools in the West, but that he would prefer to remain at Garden River if the salary could be increased by at least $50 per annum.\n\nThe Public School Inspector for Algoma recommends that Mr. Hardyman be granted a higher salary and that his services should be retained as his example and thrift have been a splendid object lesson to the Indians on the reserve and the school has been, on the whole, most satisfactory. The Agent says that he has no hesitation in recommending that the increase asked for be granted rather than that an efficient teacher should be lost to the school.\n\nMr. Hardyman's salary is at present $350 and as Garden River is an expensive place to live and as there is no doubt that he has been most successful in the school, I am of opinion that the Department should make an effort to retain his services and I think it would be well worth the additional $50 to keep him. Mr. Hardyman has had charge of this school since 1902; he previously taught the Bulls Horn day school on the Blood reserve but moved east on account of his wife's health.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 18, 1906.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th inst., forwarding a communication from Mr. Hardyman, teacher of the Church of England school on the Garden River reserve, who states that he has been offered the position of principal of one of the boarding schools in the West but would prefer to remain at Garden River, if his salary could be increased by at least $50 per annum.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the recommendation of yourself and the Public School Inspector of Mr. Hardyman's work, the Department will pay him at the rate of $400 per annum from the 1st of July next, if he decides to remain an instructor of this school, which is an increase of $50 on his present salary.\n\nBe good enough to advise the Department whether Mr. Hardyman will accept this offer.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nW.

In view of his long service he was granted an extension of one month, till the end of September, and Dr. Gibson was told that, should Mr. Hardyman wish further leave, the services of Rev.

He was told that additional leave had been granted him for the month of September but that if he wanted a further extension he would have to provide a substitute at his own cost.\n\nFrom the above it will be seen that the Department intended to allow the school to be closed for the whole of the month of September and that a substitute was not to be furnished, unless Mr. Hardyman wished to prolong his absence beyond that time.

School are commendable it is desired that you should give more particular attention to discipline and to modern methods of teaching. Where discipline in a school-room is poor results cannot be satisfactory. It is thought that if you would take up the reading of some practical works on school management and methods you would be able to greatly improve your work in this school. It might be well for you to correspond with the Public School Inspector, Mr. Green, who would be able to advise you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nL. F.

Hardyman, teacher of an Indian School at Garden River, near Sault Ste. Marie, has applied to you for some ornamental shrubs for the grounds and I should be very glad if you can comply with Mr. Hardyman's request. I may say that his school is situated on the main road and Mr. Hardyman takes a great deal of pride in keeping the grounds in good condition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. T. Macoun, Esq.,\nHorticulturist,\nCentral Experimental Farm,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI have been requested by a member of the Garden River Band to draw your attention to the good work that is done at Garden River by the teacher in the Anglican School. Mr. Hardyman not only in teaching but visiting the sick and having a general overseeing of the whole Band. Many a night he sits up with a sick patient. He is at all times at their beck and call and some of them seem to think that he does not get the remuneration for his services that he is worth.\n\nI am well aware of the fact that should Mr. Hardyman leave us it would be a bad thing for the Band. I am sure it would be an impossibility to replace him. I would therefore recommend that his salary be increased by the sum of One Hundred Dollars per annum, hoping that you will not think that I am presuming too much on your good nature in making this recommendation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, November 7, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. Agent McNabb of Sault Ste. Marie writes the Department at the request of a number of the Indians of the Garden River Band, who ask that the salary of Mr. Hardyman, teacher of the Protestant school on their reserve, be increased by the sum of $100.00. Mr. McNabb says that, in addition to the school work, Mr. Hardyman takes great interest in the whole band, looking after the sick and being at all times at their beck and call, and he would recommend that his salary be increased by the sum mentioned. He is now paid at the rate of $500.00 a year and has living accommodation over the school. Mr. Hardyman has been in charge of this school for the past nine years and was granted his last increase two years ago. The whole of his salary is paid by the Indians.\n\nMr. Hardyman has been a faithful and competent teacher and, as the Agent remarks, it would be a difficult matter to replace him. He has a family and $500.00 a year.\nis hardly sufficient recognition for his long service and good work and I would recommend that the application be granted.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant recommending that an increase of $100.00 be made to the salary of Mr. Hardyman, teacher of the Protestant School on the Garden River Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the satisfactory manner in which Mr. Hardyman has been conducting this school for the past nine years, this increase has been granted and you will be good enough to inform Mr. Hardyman accordingly. This increase will take effect from the first of the current quarter, and his salary will be at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst.

The original return for the said quarter, on file in the Department, cannot be sent you.

Indian School\nGarden River, Ont.\nOttawa, April 10, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nMr. MacKenzie, who visited with you the schools in the Garden River reserve at the end of January, last, has reported upon conditions as he found them.\n\nHe speaks very favourably of the class-room work of the Garden River (R.C.) School but states that the class-room work of the Church of England School is not so satisfactory. All the pupils present were in the lowest standards, their work was only fair and the discipline evidenced very poor. I may say that this report is also borne out by reports received previously from the Public School Inspector. On the other hand Mr. MacKenzie reports very favourably on the appearance of the building and surroundings and also on the good work done among the Indians on the reserve by Mr. Hardyman. The Department would like, however, to have him pay more attention to the class-room work and endeavour to improve the discipline.\n\nYou will be good enough to let Mr. Hardyman know the wishes of the Department and it is hoped that when the Public School Inspector next visits the school he will be able to report an improvement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

McNaughton\nIndian Agent\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the closing of my school on account of the measles epidemic I beg to say the school was ordered to be closed by the local doctor, and I asked permission to re-open last Monday but Dr. McNaughton said it was too soon, so I hope to get his permission soon to teach next week; and although I have not been teaching my whole time has been taken up either in the school grounds or visiting the sick, & have taken no time for my private affairs, as I did not feel at liberty to do so when it was not holidays, & I could not very well visit friends outside the village when I was in and out amongst the sick every day.\nI have two reasons for explaining because I foresee a difficulty in opening the school during August, as the women at that time make considerable money picking berries selling them, & they will all their children, so I would not get any children, & I expect my son out from England about Aug. 15th & I want if possible to get him a position in the town before school opens, & I cannot attend to this in school time & he cannot come sooner as the ferries in England do not commence till August. So I would feel under the circumstances I can explain that re-opening the school before Sept. 1st, to be quite a difficulty & little would be gained as the attendance would be so small. Hoping the Dept will not feel I am trying to shirk my duty.\n\nI am your most obedient\n\nLucius F.

D. Macdonald\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. M. Maclean, Esq.,\nActing Deputy Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOct. 25th\nJune 24, 1913\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn my opinion it would be a great benefit to these Indian children to bathe every day, as a bath in their homes is almost unknown. In order to get the parents to allow the children to bathe it would be necessary to rip off a piece of water and would accompany them at least three times a week.\n\nTherefore I beg to requisition for about 200 ft of rope & about 2 lbs of spiles, & 2 sets of rings, the latter for the school swings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLucius F. Hardyman\n\nA. D. W. Webb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nGarden River, Ont.\nOttawa, July 9, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo enclosing a communication from the teacher of the Garden River (C.E.) School in reference to the children bathing in the river.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are hereby authorized to purchase the necessary ropes and spikes to make a swimming pool and also two sets of rings for the school swings.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nMy Lord Bishop, Mr. Ferris & Friends\u2014\n\nI am very pleased to welcome you all here this evening, and I thank our Bishop especially for honoring us with his presence. Last year was the first time our school had received official recognition by his lordship, and I know the reason he is here again is to impress upon us the importance of giving the children an education.\n\nGive a child a good education, & it matters not whether he has a cat in his pocket or not.\n\nIt is an extremely difficult & slow business to create an interest in education amongst uneducated people, they will say, well I have managed to get along & I guess my children will pull through somehow.\n\nBut take a man who has been raised amongst every advantage educationally & he has wasted his school days, ask him whether it matters and he will tell you a different tale.\n\nI came here tonight feeling more enthusiastic than I have ever felt, after 10 years of work on this Reserve; it seemed to me, I labored here for years, no one seemed to take the slightest interest in school matters but myself, except to find fault every now & then, & perhaps you may wonder what change has occurred to make me feel enthusiastic.\nnot till 6 months ago, children came to school when their parents felt like sending them, if they were old enough to help their parents at home. School was only a secondary consideration, as one person told him, on one occasion. To encourage more children to go to school as soon as there is nothing to do at home.\n\nSince Mr. MacNab assumed office as Indian Agent, it is quite apparent he is determined to make the schools more successful than they have been in the past, so he has appointed a new Constable as Truant Officer, and children now of school age, in good health must attend one or other of the schools on the Reserve, if this policy has been carried out on the Reserve from the start when the schools were first established, what a difference it would have made by this time.\n\nI am very glad to say, this new policy only started in last fall has been well received by the people, with one or two exceptions. I have no complaint to make, the same is being carried out at the Roman Catholic School, and in order to prove to all persons the benefit I have derived by Mr. MacNab's new policy, I obtained from his office the statistics of the present December just closed for the two schools for the Anglican Church of children in the vicinity of the school.\nAt the R.C. school there are 70\nnumber attending school here 86\nat the R.C. School 54\nso here we have a far better showing while\nwe have only 4 absentees they have 16.\ntotal number of attendances here 1296\u00bd\nat the R.C. School 1324,\n2\u00bd more than here.\ntotal number of absences at this school\nthese are the important figures 573\u00bd,\nat the R.C. School 1591,\na difference of over a thousand in our\nfavor.\nAverage attendance here 23\u00bd\nat R.C. 24\u00bd\nthese figures are not given in any\ndisparaging sense, but only as encouragement\nto press on, not rest content\ntill every healthy child is attending school in this village.\nthere are one or two matters connected\nwith our own children I would like\nto suggest, so that the parents take\ntheir children regularly to church,\nand also send them to school, as it\nis at present hardly any children\nare brought to church & the school\nis also poorly attended.\nAnd to our people at large I\nwould earnestly appeal to you to\nguard the Sabbath Day & keep it holy,\nwhat use is their teaching your children\nto keep Sunday holy if the parents\n& older people are not setting their\nchildren a good example.\n\nI cannot take up any more of your time, but would close with my hearty wishes for a happy new year to all, & hope that if we are spared next year to meet again that we may be able to make still greater progress all over this Reserve.

He told the Constable that it was his boy and he would do as he liked about sending him to school.\n\nI went to him personally and told him he must send him, he would not give me any satisfaction. As he is a nephew of the Chief's he thinks he can do as he pleases. The boy is not over 12 years of age.

Everything went off well. The Bishop of Algoma presided, assisted by Mr. A. D. McNabb, Indian agent, and Chief John Pino, who is the elder brother, John Pino, and W. J. Pino, stood as interpreters. The school was crowded.\n\nThe proceedings opened with a hymn, \"O Come all ye faithful,\" one of the choirs presiding at the organ. The marks were then read, and the list of prize winners, and Mr. Hardyman made a report of the work done in Reserve. A very brief character sketch of each pupil was also read. The children then gave a piano and vocal recital, followed by readings and recitations. A committee consisting of Revs. C. H. Ferris and B. Fuller, Indians and whites, whose record was won by Phillip Stevens, his selection being entitled \"People will talk.\" Dewey Wigwam was second, with \"Fireside.\"\n\nThe Bishop gave a stirring address. He was pleased to see improvement, especially when he urged the whites present to do all in their power to uplift the Indian people. The Chief, and his brother, then gave an address. The entertainment closed with \"Auld Lang Syne\" and the National Anthem, and the Lordship pronounced the benediction.\n\nThe following letter from Mr. L. A. Green, B.A., Public School Inspector, arrived too late for the meeting:\n\nC. F. Hardyman, Esq.,\nSir: I regret that owing to pressure of work I am not able to be with you at your exercises today.\n\nI am pleased to give you this statement, however, for the pupils. The school has steadily improved in efficiency and in discipline; and with a little stronger co-operation on the part of the interested parties, success to the community will continue to increase.\n\nBy co-operation of parents, I mean the holding up of the standard as to duty, and acting in behalf of all for their own good. Many get the idea that they must be punished to pieces every time he does not do what the child or parent thinks he should do. This attitude may be different, but because they are that is no reason why he should not be upheld. The minute parents begin to show confidence in the teacher or the minister before their children, who are sitting in their feet daily, they see the usefulness of their lesson begins to fade. In justice to your children therefore support your teacher as a man worth the example to your children\u2014a Christian gentleman\u2014capable in many ways of teaching them the best patriotism, and the standards of morality so necessary for all boys and girls to receive at school and carry with them carry away. I trust we will have a successful evening and that this may be the beginning of greater things for the school this year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL. A.

I found the last time I examined their teeth only one had perfectly sound teeth; if the Department thought it advisable I would have liked to have had a dentist examine all their teeth, and I think I could make a satisfactory arrangement with one of our local dentists.\n\nMr Inspector Green agrees with me that once a month was not sufficient to scrub the school, and I would suggest allowing me to have it done twice a month as it only costs $3 a month, as I have the daily sweeping done myself.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, December 3, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo stating that you would like to have a dentist examine the teeth of the pupils of the Garden River Anglican School and suggesting that you be allowed to have the school scrubbed twice a month, as Mr. Inspector Green agreed with you that once a month was not sufficient.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to pay for the services of a dentist to attend to these children's teeth.\n\nIt is considered that scrubbing the school once a month should be sufficient, as the school is swept daily.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nU.

Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to ask you for a ruling in a case in dispute in connection with the Garden River Schools, the point in dispute is as follows:\n\nPat Whalen a Roman Catholic has a little girl 9 years of age who attended the Anglican School for a couple of years, they sent her to the R.C. school to prepare her for communion. She is not very strong and it is about 2 miles from her home to the R.C. School, when the River is frozen over it is only a short way. Now her parents wants to send her to Mr Hardyman for the winter or at least until the River freezes, and Mr Hardyman refuses to let her attend unless she promises to remain with him and attend his School only. I asked him to let her attend as I am anxious that all children should be in school, and owing to the fact that she cannot attend the R.C. School, he positively refused to do so saying that there is a clause in the Indian School law which forbids him to receive her as a pupil.\n\nThe little girl is a smart intelligent girl and it is too bad she cannot be allowed to attend this school if only till the Ice takes so she can walk across the River. I am enclosing the letter Mr Hardyman sent to Mr Whalen.\n\nI have endeavored since I became Agent to foster good feeling between the Roman Catholics and Protestants on the reserve and cases like the above tends to undo all I have tried to do. Hoping you will give me instructions at your first opportunity.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst.

I would sooner she did not start at all than do that.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nLucius J. Hardyman\n\nP.S.

If, however, she is to be sent to the Roman Catholic School as soon as the ice forms so that she can cross the river, it is hardly fair to place her in the Anglican School for such a short time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

Marie, Ont.,\n7th December 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOur teacher in the Garden River Church of England school, Mr. Lucius F. Hardyman, has approached me upon the subject of the admission of Roman Catholic children to his school. I have told him that in my judgment it is very unwise to admit Roman Catholic children, lest the kindly relations between ourselves and the Romanists should be interrupted. I further said that I thought it was contrary to the avowed policy, if not to the rules, of the Department of Indian Affairs, for non-Roman Catholic schools to admit Romanist children, or for Romanist schools to admit non-Roman Catholic children.\n\nSome time ago I found that Mr. Hardyman had admitted one or two Roman Catholic children to his school, and I then warned him of possible dangers in such a step. He did not at that time think any risk would be involved. Since then my apprehensions have been verified and trouble has arisen over the admission of the children alluded to above.\n\nI bring the matter before you in order that the mind of the Department upon the subject I refer to may be obtained for our guidance in the future.\n\nI cannot escape from the conviction that when two schools exist, for Roman Catholics and non-Roman Catholics respectively, in the same reserve, the wiser course is for us to be extremely careful not in any way to trench upon each other's prerogatives.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Anglican Settlement\nGarden River Oats\n\nThe Secretary\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn Dec. 2nd I forwarded to you a letter through the Indian Agent's Office, giving a full explanation of my reason for refusing to admit James Walter as a pupil, and as I have had no reply would be much obliged if you will let me know whether you received the letter.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, February 15, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant stating that on the 2nd of December last, you forwarded to the Department a letter through the Indian Agent's office, giving a full explanation of your reason for refusing to admit Irene Whalen as a pupil of the Garden River Anglican School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this letter has not yet reached the Department.

I had felt all along\nthat my letter had not reached the Department, but for\nthe sake of peace I had decided to let the matter rest,\nuntil I found things happening which were very disagreeable\nto me.\nREPORT ON GARDEN RIVER AGENCY.\n\nBy R. H. Abraham, B.S.A.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nx x x\n\nEnglish School.\n\nTeacher, L. F. Hardyman.\n\nPupils in section of school age 30.\n\nOn roll 19.\nPresent 9.\n\nIn grade 3 there are 3\n\" \" 2 \" \" 5\n\" \" 1 \" \" 11\n\nThere are no pupils in the 4th grade.\n\nAlthough Mr. Hardyman has been in this school for 15 yrs. he has not, as yet, had a single pupil in grade 4.\n\nI am of the opinion that a new teacher should be engaged. My reasons are as follows:\n\n(1) Mr. Hardyman is not a competent teacher, has never had any training as a teacher.\n\n(2) He is very slouchy about the school, often is not properly dressed.\n\n(3) He has the school closed much too often, I am told by a reliable white man that often the school is closed 2 days a week.\n\n(4) He is at present paying marked attention to an Indian girl of questionable character and the Indians are talking.\n\n(5) He has adequate private means to live on.\n\n(6) The parents refuse to send their children to him.\n\nI believe a suitable boarding place could be found.\nfor a lady teacher at Mr. Eddy's, the store keeper.\n\nI interviewed Inspector Green regarding Mr. Hardyman's work in the school. He admitted that he is not a competent teacher, but said that he had no other school where he could place such a poor teacher. He said that he didn't think the Indian Dept. required a very high standard.\n\nI would recommend that the truant officer be instructed to prosecute parents who refuse to send their children to school. The attendance is very poor, as you will see.\nOttawa, March 20, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Green, in his report of his inspection of your school, which was made on the 5th instant, states that your methods of teaching are not up to the required standard and that your discipline is lax.\n\nMr. Green recognizes the difficulties you are working under and reports favourably upon your personal endeavours for the betterment of the Indians on the reserve, but states that, while you have been a friend to the people and helpful in many ways, it is possible that you have carried this too far to the detriment of the school. He suggests that you should be informed that the school is your first consideration and that other things, if they interfere with it, must be thrust aside. The Department agrees with Mr. Green and trusts that in future your best endeavours will be devoted to the advancement of the pupil under your care.\n\nMr. Green also states that he asked you to apply yourself in mastering the principles of teaching as laid down in the manuals which you have in the school. It is hoped that you will make good use of these manuals in future and also that you will be guided by the suggestions given in Mr. Green's letter to you of the 11th instant, a copy of which he forwarded to the Department.\n\nL.

The Department would like to know whether this statement is correct and, if so, why it is closed. As you are no doubt aware, it should not be closed without permission, except on statutory holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

School states as follows,\u2014\"There seems to be an idea on this reserve that as soon as a boy or girl can work they should be taken out of school. They should be disabused of this and encouraged to remain and to be kept at school until they have received a complete education\".\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Indians on this reserve that all children between the ages of six and fifteen must attend school and you should see that the truant officer attends to his duties. Mr. Hardyman, the teacher of this school, has been asked to furnish the truant officer each week with a list of the absentees.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. D.

Last year it was closed by permission, to attend two funerals, Mrs. James Adams', Mrs. B. Fuller's, also 3 days in Feb. to enable me to attend a church conference at Bear River at my own expense, & for the local fair.\n\nI would suggest that if you deem it wise, Truant Officer report to the Indian Agent if the school is closed, so then this will be quite satisfactory to me, & also to the Government.\n\nI have the honor\n\nTo be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nLucius F.

Marie, Ont., in which she states that she has been giving instruction at the Garden River Anglican School in the subjects mentioned in her letter and asks if the matter has been previously mentioned by the local authorities.\n\nI may inform Your Grace that Mr. Agent McNabb, in his report on this school for the month of February, 1916, stated as follows:\n\n\"Mr. Hardyman and myself are getting some of the music teachers and professors of the Sault to each take one pupil from this school for an hour or half hour on Saturdays to teach them the rudiments of music. We have succeeded in getting three of them to accede to our requests.\n\nWe are also trying to get some of the women interested in giving the girls lessons in sewing, etc. Several women have agreed to go down week about and give the girls a couple of hours lessons.\"\n\nThe Department wrote Mr. McNabb that it was pleased to see that so much interest was being taken in the pupils of this school and that, if any material was required for sewing classes, it would be prepared to furnish.\n\nMost Rev.

Deputy and Secretary.\nDear Mr. McLean,\n\nI am sorry that your letter about Mrs. Stephenson's services at Garden River has been so long without an answer.\n\nIt is quite true that Mrs. Stephenson has given efficient service at Garden River, and has exerted an exceedingly good influence among the Indians on that reserve. She has, as far as I know, the confidence and gratitude of the Indian Agent and Mr. Hardyman; and I am glad to approve of her doing what she can under Mr. Ferris and Mr. Hardyman. She is very zealous and quite efficient. She must, of course, be clear as to her entire subordination to the authorities of the mission and reserve.\n\nI am not aware that she has taught sewing, or that she has much interest in that branch of instruction. It is very important that the girls should learn to sew, and I shall be glad indeed if Mrs. Stephenson will do her best to teach them. It would certainly be a great help if you would supply the necessary materials.\n\nI am\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ. D.

While this is the case exceptions have, in a few instances, been made in the way of a gratuity to teachers who have given their services for a number of years.\n\nI may say that Mr. Hardyman has been continuously in the employ of the Department as teacher of an Indian school for the past twenty-eight years, first in the west and for the past fifteen years in his present position at Garden River. During all this period he has been untiring in his efforts to be of service to the Indians. While not a very successful teacher, he has exercised a good influence on the reserve.\n\nMr. Hardyman's salary for the past six years has been $600.00 per annum, which has been paid out of the band funds. With this salary he has had no opportunity of laying by anything and, should he retire, I think the Department would be quite justified in giving him a gratuity.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 8, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th ultimo, in which you state that you presume the matter of a retiring allowance for you is under consideration, as you are considering sending in your resignation as teacher of the Garden River School as soon as something definite is decided by the Department.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that it is unable to grant you any retiring allowance, as there is no provisions for the retirement of teachers of Indian schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

He holds a first grade certificate in the State, so could doubtless easily obtain like standing here.

Mr. Neighen -\n\nWith reference to the attached communication from Mr. Inspector Green, of Sault Ste. Marie, I beg to say that we have carefully considered Mr. Hardyman's case. We allowed him a gratuity of six months' salary, which was the most liberal treatment that we could accord.\n\nMr. Green appears to be under a misapprehension regarding superannuation. There is no superannuation scheme at present in effect for any class of Civil servants, appointed since 1898.\n\nAs I have stated to you in previous memoranda, we appreciate the work that Mr. Hardyman did, and regret that there is nothing further that we can do for him.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 6th instant, informing me that Mr. Harshman is not eligible for appointment to the position of teacher of the Indian school at Garden River.\n\nI regret sincerely that I have given you needless trouble in this matter. I ought to have known that there would be difficulty in making such an appointment, but it never occurred to my mind.\n\nI now wish to suggest the appointment of Miss Madge Ferris, the daughter of the Rev. S. H. Ferris of Garden River, as teacher in the Garden River school. As you will remember, Miss Ferris has been teaching in the school at Sheguianah, and has done so with great efficiency and acceptability. She has just been suffering from influenza and is on the point of resigning her school at Sheguianah, if she has not already done so. She will therefore be free to accept the Garden River school at an early date. I understand that Mr. Hardyman is desirous of completing the current quarter at Garden River, which will tide us over that difficulty, and I imagine the\nDepartment will see no objection to that proposal.\n\nI remain\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ.

S. H. Ferris of Garden River, and who is at present teaching at Sheguiandah, as teacher in the Garden River Anglican School and states that Mr. Hardiman is desirous of completing the current quarter at Garden River.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, if Your Grace is unable to obtain a fully qualified teacher for this school, the Department will be prepared to accept Miss Ferris' services and will allow her a salary at the rate of $500.00 per annum. She should, however, forward her resignation as teacher of the Sheguiandah School.\n\nMr. Hardiman may remain in charge of the Garden River School until the end of the current quarter and Miss Ferris may then take charge of this school on the first of April, next.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is hoped that these will reach you in ample time before you leave Garden River.\n\nThe Department is unable to comply with your request to have a draft sent in your favour covering the amount of the gratuity allowed. The war bonus granted teachers terminates on the 31st instant, and I may say that at the present a further bonus is not contemplated, and, if at a later date a further bonus is granted for teachers it will be impossible to continue the payment to you during the six months term covered by the gratuity granted to you.\n\nIn terminating your services with this Department after a period of 30 years as teacher in Indian Schools, I wish to assure you of the Department's appreciation of your work and efforts towards the education of the Indian children and to extend to you best wishes for the future.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nL.

Hardymon\nExtract from report of Mr. Benson dated July 29, 1919, on his recent trip to Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nWhile at the Soo I called on Archbishop Thorneloe. He wishes the Department to allow Mr. and Mrs. Ferris, the parents of the present teacher of the Garden River (O.E.) School to live in the teacher's residence there. They are very old and the daughter could not live alone there. They contemplate relieving Mr. Ferris of his missionary work and they would, therefore, require the house he is now occupying for the new missionary. I spoke to Mr. McNabb about the suggested arrangement and he stated that the Indians would make no objection. I also called on Mr. Public School Inspector Green in regard to the work of Miss Ferris, and he assured me that she is a qualified teacher and doing excellent work, and both he and Mr. McNabb state that she is popular with the Indians. I would recommend that the Archbishop's suggestion be carried out.\nOttawa, August 5, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that Mr. Benson of this Department who recently returned from a visit to the See, reports that his Lordship the Bishop of Algoma desires permission to allow Mr. and Mrs. Ferris, the parents of the present teacher of the Garden River Church of England Indian Day School, to live with their daughter in the teacher's residence at that school.\n\nThe Department will consent to this arrangement being carried out. Mr. Benson states that he consulted you about the matter and that you informed him that the Indians would make no objection to Mr. and Mrs. Ferris residing with their daughter in the teacher's residence.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma of the Department's consent being granted for Mr. and Mrs. Ferris to live in the teacher's residence during the period which their daughter remains as teacher of the Church of England Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise that the Teacher Mrs. Madge A. MacNabb, who taught at the Anglican School at Garden River has made up her mind to go west, and therefore there is a vacancy at this School. I would be very much pleased if this appointment was made at once as I understand that the former Teacher Mr. L. F. Hardiman is returning from the Old Country and I fear if he gets here before a Teacher is engaged the Arch Bishop will want to install him again and the Indians do not want him.\n\nI am also of the opinion that we will require a principal at the Garden River R. C. School and also a Teacher at Goulais. Both of these Teachers Miss Leahy and Miss Kelly could not give me a decided answer whether they would come back or not. If Miss Leahy does not come back I wish you could get Margaret M. Daly to come back. She is worth all the money you can afford to pay her and I am sure the Indians would be very much pleased to have her back again.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

McNabb, teacher of the Church of England School at Garden River, does not intend to resume duties upon the re-opening of the school after the holidays, as she has planned to go west.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you should consult the church authorities and endeavour to secure the services of a properly qualified teacher for this school, to begin duties on or about the first of September next. The name, age, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by the church authorities should be submitted for the approval of the Department.\n\nWith reference to the Roman Catholic school I beg to say that as far as the Department is aware Miss Leahy intends to resume duties when the school re-opens.\n\nWith reference to Goulais Bay I beg to say that, if Miss Kelly does not intend to return, you should endeavour to secure the services of a qualified teacher to succeed her and it might be well to consult the Roman Catholic missionary at this point regarding the securing of the services of a teacher. If a new teacher is secured the name, age, qualifications and experience should be submitted for the approval of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McNabb,\nAsst.

He informs me that he wants Mrs Stephenson to take the School.\n\nMrs Stephenson has no Certificate for Teaching, but I think she has every qualification for a good Teacher she is a Married Woman. Her husband is a retired English Church Clergyman, and she is a very fine Lady. She has been teaching the pupils at Garden River to Paint in Mr Hardyman's time as teacher.\n\nIf Teachers are allowed to teach Indian Schools without Certificate I am sure this Lady would fill the bill satisfactorily to the Dept. and Pupils as well.\n\nAs the time is getting late if you are satisfied to let Mrs Stephenson take the work would you please wire me as I would like to get her settled in time to commence teaching on Sept. 1st.\n\nAwaiting your wire,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

A qualified teacher should be secured.\"\n\nIt is considered in the interests of the education of the children that a qualified teacher be secured. Mrs. Stephenson, who was nominated by the Church authorities, has no professional qualifications and the Department must request, that, if possible, qualified teachers be secured, for the schools on the Garden River reserve. This school is located in a convenient locality with living accommodation for the teacher and there should not be any great difficulty in obtaining a teacher.\n\nA.D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie,\nOnt.\nteacher with the necessary qualifications.\n\nYou should inform the Church authorities of the Department's requirements and endeavor to secure a teacher as soon as possible. The name, qualifications and experience of all applicants should be forwarded for the consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\nSept 7th 1920.\n\nSuperintendent\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that no teacher has yet been engaged for the Garden River Anglican Indian School. The difficulty seems to be that the salary offered is not sufficient to induce teachers to apply.\n\nA few days ago we advertised for teachers for the school in the Children's Shelter near this city and stated the salary at $1200. The result was that we received 30 applications all from experienced well qualified teachers.\n\nThe remedy therefore in all cases where teachers cannot be secured seems to lie in the salary offered. My suggestion would be therefore that eventually the Department should take over the matter of the engagement of teachers for all such schools; meantime that the churches having missions among the Indians should be induces by an offer of higher salaries to place teachers with regular qualifications in them and that they should advertise the remuneration as equivalent to $1000 to $1200 according to the conditions.\n\nIf this was done I do not fear that any school would be closed for any length of time.\n\nI have a number of applications in my possession now from the Children's Shelter that I would be glad to communicate with were it possible for me to do so, but I cannot because of the church and the Department lying between me and the solution of the problem.\n\nI am writing you on the suggestion of Mr. A.D.McNabb and trust that this may be of some assistance in solving the difficulty.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nBishophurst,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario,\n6th September 1920.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have just returned home from England, and find the Garden River school vacant. I presume that the rule still holds that you desire me to nominate a duly qualified teacher for the position. This I have no doubt I can do at an early date. Will you kindly let me know whether I am correct in the above conclusions.\n\nWith warmest good wishes, I am,\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nDuncan Campbell Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, September 11, 1920.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nIn the absence from Ottawa of the Deputy Superintendent General I beg to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 6th instant with reference to obtaining the services of a qualified teacher for the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will be pleased if you will nominate a qualified teacher for the position. I would request that Your Grace give this matter your early attention, so that the school may not remain closed, especially at this season of the year when the children could attend more regularly. The name, qualifications and experience of the teacher nominated by you should be submitted for the consideration of the Department. If a teacher having professional qualifications is secured, the Department will allow a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus additional at the rate of $150.00 per annum during the period it is continued to teachers in Indian day schools.\n\nIt is hoped that Your Grace will be able to obtain the services of a qualified teacher at an early date.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. Geo. Thornloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste, Marie, Ont.\nOttawa, September 11, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant with reference to the securing of a qualified teacher for the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School and the salary allowed.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, as this school is conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, the nomination of a teacher rests in the hands of His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, who is being requested to endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher as soon as possible.\n\nWith reference to the salaries paid teachers in white schools I beg to request that you will inform the Department as to the average salary received by the teachers in the rural day schools in your inspectorate according to the qualifications which they possess. It is noted in the case of the salary mentioned by you for a teacher for the Children's Shelter, that this is in the city. It is thought that teachers in the rural schools do not receive this rate of pay; I may point out that teachers in Indian schools, besides the salary allowed, also receive a bonus additional at the rate of $150.00 per annum, and, in the case of the Garden River Anglican School there are living quarters provided. His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma is being informed that, if a teacher having professional qualifications is secured, a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum, together with the bonus at the above rate, will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nfor Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nL.

A. Green, Public School Inspector, Sault Ste. Marie, in which he recommends that, as this school is located in a good position, the services of a married man be obtained. He states that he would be glad to see one settled there, as it has few attractions for the young teacher. It is his opinion that a married man who is generally useful and could teach the school is preferable and he hopes that such a one may soon be found.\n\nThe recommendation of Mr. Green is submitted for your consideration and I may add that the Department concurs in his opinion that it would be in the interests of the work if a married teacher were secured. It is hoped that you will soon be in a position to nominate a qualified teacher.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie\nFor Asst.

Marie, Ontario,\n27th September 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have been in correspondence with Mr. Weeks, our teacher at Sheshigwaning, who has for some time been anxious to have a change. I gather from him that having started in with the present year he would prefer to wait before making a change until the new year. In that case, as he is the only certificated teacher I have at the present moment suited to undertake the work at Garden River, I would suggest that you place there Mrs. Stephenson, who has no certificate, but is admirably qualified to undertake the work. She could go on until the new year, and then Mr. Weeks could change with her, going over to Garden River and leaving the work at Sheshigwaning for the remainder of the year in Mrs. Stephenson's hands.\n\nI write now to explain to you the present situation, and to inquire whether, this being the best I can do at the moment, you are willing to fall in with it. Of course if Mr. Weeks consents to come at once I should be glad. In that case I would ask you to allow Mrs. Stephenson to undertake the work at Sheshigwaning in the place of Mr. Weeks.\n\nIf there is any insuperable difficulty in carrying out one or other of these plans kindly let me know and I will go no further.\nBut I fear if we do not adopt some such course one or other of these schools will have to remain vacant for some time.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nFor Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nP.S. Mr. Stephenson is the wife of the Rev. E.H.C. Stephenson who is at present taking a long rest which he needs badly. Mr. Stephenson would go well his wife and would be a good influence of great use among the Indian population of Sheshagshaway. G.A.\nOttawa, September 30, 1920.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Grace's letter of the 27th instant regarding the appointment of a teacher for the Garden River Anglican Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the arrangements mentioned by you will be satisfactory to the Department and it will approve of Mrs. Stephenson being appointed as teacher until the new year and Mr. Weeks, the present teacher at the Sheshegwaning Anglican School can then be transferred to Garden River and Mrs. Stephenson may then take charge at Sheshegwaning. If Mr. Weeks is ready to remove to Garden River he may do so now and Mrs. Stephenson can be sent to take his place at Sheshegwaning. The Department will leave this matter in your hands to make the best arrangements possible between these two teachers. It is most anxious that the school at Garden River be opened as soon as possible. The appointment of Mrs. Stephenson, who has no qualifications, is only temporary, and it is hoped that a qualified teacher will be secured by you as soon as possible to take Mrs. Stephenson's place. I shall be pleased to hear from you as to what arrangements you have made regarding the placing of these two teachers and, if Mrs. Stephenson takes charge of the Garden River School until Mr. Weeks is ready to make the change, the date on which she begins duties should be stated.\n\nThe salary allowed Mrs. Stephenson will be at the rate of $600.00 per annum and bonus, while Mr. Weeks' salary, when he is transferred to Garden River, will be at the same rate as he now receives, namely, $650.00 per annum and bonus.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nMost Rev.

Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, September 30, 1920.\n\nSir\u2014\n\nThe Department has received a communication from His Grace the Archbishop of Algoma, in which he suggests that Mrs. Stephenson be placed in charge of the Garden River Anglican Day School until the new year, when Mr. Weeks, the present teacher at the Sheshegwaning Anglican School, who has applied for a transfer, will then take charge and Mrs. Stephenson will be transferred to Sheshegwaning.\n\nHis Grace is being informed that, as the Department is anxious to have the Garden River School re-opened, approval will be given for the temporary appointment of Mrs. Stephenson and also, if he can arrange for Mr. Weeks' transfer to Garden River before the beginning of the new year, he may do so and Mrs. Stephenson can then be sent to Sheshegwaning. You might consult His Grace regarding this matter and he will be able to inform you as to the arrangements he has made. It is hoped that the Garden River School will be re-opened at an early date. Mr. Weeks' salary, when transferred to Garden River, will remain at the same rate as he is now receiving, namely, $650.00 per annum and bonus, while the salary allowed Mrs. Stephenson, who has no certificate, will be at the rate of $600.00 per annum and bonus.\n\nIt is regretted that a teacher having professional qualifications has not been secured, but His Grace has been unable to secure any applicants and the Department, in order that the children may no longer be deprived of an education, is approving of the above arrangement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.

You are good enough to approve of my proposals in regard to Mr. Weeks and Mrs. Stephenson, and you leave things in my hands to be worked out along the lines indicated. I have therefore communicated with Mrs. Stephenson and Mr. Weeks, and arranged that the former shall carry on the work at Garden River, beginning as soon as possible, and go on till the end of the year, when matters will be readjusted in some way.\n\nWe understand that Mrs. Stephenson's appointment is temporary; and I think that she is ready to secure the necessary certificate by taking the prescribed examination at as early a date as possible. This being done, I presume the Department would have no objection, provided her work proves satisfactory, to her continuing, at either Garden River or Sheshigwaning, the work she is undertaking.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nA.

I hope to be able in due course to propose a suitable person for the position.\n\nBelieve me\nVery faithfully yours,\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ.W. McLean Esq.\nActing Deputy Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa, Ont.\nMy dear Mr. McLean,\n\nIn regard to the Indian School at Garden River I would much like to make an experiment. A Mr. Richard Black, an Indian from Depot Harbor or Pauzy Sound has cast in his lot with us. He was trained in a Methodist College and has served the Methodist Church for some years. He is a fairly educated man. I would like to give him a chance in our own Indian Schools, by preference Garden River where I can look after him carefully. Have I permission from the Department for him to teach next year at Garden River School on a period? And if so what would be salary be? If he should prove to be, or even promise\nTo be a success I will do my best to get in to qualify as a Teacher in the usual way. I have no doubt as to his mental capacity and general knowledge.\n\nAwaiting your reply\n\nJan\n\nMost faithfully yours,\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAss't Deputy or Secretary\nIndian Department\nOttawa, O.\n\nP.S. If permission is granted to Mr. Black to teach the Garden River School I suppose he may enter the rooms at once when Mr. Stephenson vacates them on the 30th of this month.\n\nG.A.\nOTTAWA, June 13th, 1921.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 4th instant, nominating Mr. Richard Black, an Indian, as teacher of the Garden River Anglican Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department cannot approve of the appointment of Mr. Black as teacher, as he has no professional qualifications for the position. I would point out to Your Lordship that there is a good school at this point, and an opportunity under the charge of a qualified teacher to make a success of the work. The services of a teacher having professional qualifications should be obtained, and if such is secured, the Department will be prepared to provide an increased salary over the amount allowed former teachers who have had very little qualifications for the work. I will therefore be pleased if your Lordship will make further enquiries and endeavour to secure a qualified teacher. The salary which the Department will allow will depend upon the qualifications which the teacher possesses.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMost Rev. Geo. Thorneloe, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Algoma,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nI am only restate what has been already set forth in this report. There must be a change of teacher in this school. The children attending this school are not getting the chance the children attending the Roman Catholic School on the other side of the River are getting. The schools are being compared by the public who are disinterested, entirely to the disadvantage of the Anglican School.\n\nThe average attendance shows that something is wrong. I beg to refer you to my letter of Sept. 7th and yours of the 11th in reply. Let me further say that the salaries in the district around this city are $1000 to $1200. If the Indian school is to receive the tuition it is entitled to it should also be taught by a Normal Trained teacher who should at least get the minimum salary of $1000.\n\nI realize the difficulties in filling the vacancy. The living quarters can only be a part of the salary of any person who has a family depending upon him. Supposing this be set down as worth $150 per year, bonus $150, leaving straight salary of $700 if $1000 be the original amount.\n\nOur teachers who are looking to the future begin at the $1000 minimum and work up to $1600 in this city. The rural schools are beginning to see the folly of a low salary and an untrained teacher. The two go together and the result is loss of time and the sacrifice of an education to many boys and girls.\n\nI shall use my very best endeavours to assist in securing the best possible teacher. I feel if the matter is taken in time there is every likelihood of securing a good teacher, that is if the salary is made attractive.\n\nI trust action may be taken at once.\n\n\"L.A. Green\"\nInspector\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI regret, but am not surprised, that the Department decline to approve of the appointment of Mr. Black, an Indian, as teacher of the Garden River School. I think had the authorities been able to have a personal interview with Mr. Black the result might have been different. As an educated man, trained in Victoria College, he will have a good record as a minister of the Methodist Church; Mr. Black, who is now seeking a place in the Ministry of the Church of England, would probably be a more efficient teacher than many young persons duly qualified by the possession of the required certificate.\n\nOn general principles the Department is beyond question right, and I have no just cause of complaint that my recommendation is not received with favour. I will write again when I have succeeded in finding a teacher formally qualified for the Garden River position.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMeanwhile it is a great encouragement to me in the task of finding such a person that the Department will be \"prepared to provide an increased salary.\" There can be no question that the meagreness of the salary hitherto paid in Indian Day Schools has had much to do with the extreme difficulty of finding qualified teachers willing to accept such positions.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeorge Algoma\n\nP.S. My ambition has been to find teachers really qualified for their work. I think the experience of the past year at Garden River shows that this is not always the same thing as finding teachers who are technically qualified. G.A.\nBishophurst,\nSainte-Marie, Ontario,\n3rd August 1921.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nMrs. Stephenson, who has been acting as teacher of the Garden River School during the past year, has intimated to me her willingness to go on for a further period of time if the Department will consent to her doing so. She has done her best. She is not a certificated teacher, but she is a well educated woman, and her heart is in her work. As the Department knows well, qualified certificated teachers are not easy to get for our Indian schools. The salary has been small, and the conditions are not attractive. The school should have a male teacher, and he should have $1000.00 per annum. It may take some time to find such a man. Meanwhile, for a term or so, Mrs. Stephenson might be allowed to go on with the work. Kindly let me know what is decided, that I may let Mrs. Stephenson know what is expected of her.\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq., Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nP. S. - Mrs. Stephenson tells me there is need of certain\nimprovements at the school. We will communicate with Mr. McNabb on the subject, and feel sure the Department will approve what he recommends.\n\nG.A.\nOTTAWA, August 5th, 1921.\n\nMost Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of Your Lordship's letter of the 3rd instant requesting that Mrs. Stephenson be continued as teacher of the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the inspector, in his recent report regarding the work being done by Mrs. Stephenson, states that she is quite unfitting in many ways for the work, and that the progress made was not satisfactory. He states that she has a fine character, but has no academic qualifications which would fit her to teach this school.\n\nIf the services of a qualified teacher can be obtained, the Department would be prepared to provide a salary at the rate of $500 per annum, together with bonus during the present fiscal year at the rate of $150, making a combined salary and bonus of $650, which is equal to that allowed to teachers in the surrounding rural white schools. Mr. Inspector Green stated that he would be pleased to use his best endeavours to assist in securing the best possible teacher, and if Your Lordship would consult him it may be that he would be able to assist you in securing a qualified teacher.\n\nHowever, rather than have this school remain closed after the holidays, the Department would consent to Mrs. Stephenson's teaching temporarily until a qualified teacher could be obtained, but it is hoped that Your Lordship will be able to nominate a suitable teacher in time to take up duties when the schools reopen after the holidays.\n\nI have the honour to be, Most Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have communicated this information to Mrs. Stephenson.\n\nWhat you tell me about your willingness to increase the salary encourages me to hope that I may be able to find a suitable teacher. There is no doubt whatever that the attractions of outside positions are such that no well qualified teacher is likely to look in the direction of our Indian schools unless the salary be made more adequate and the conditions brought up to a good level. I will do my best to find a suitable teacher.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst.

He mentioned a Miss Sholts who taught at the Shingwauk for a short term. Mr. Fuller would not keep her there, he also talked of keeping Mrs. Stephenson for another term. I may be over-stepping my position but I feel that the children at the Garden River Anglican school should be given a chance. For the past 16 or 17 years we have not had one child that passed the second book. Mr. Hardyman taught for fifteen years and Mrs. Stephenson has been there a year, and the last is worse than the first. The children are smart and willing, and anxious to learn, but they never had the chance, only the short time that Mrs. McNab, now Miss Ferris was there. I do not think that the Archbishop cares whether they learn or not, as long as the teacher belongs to the English Church.\n\nIt is nearly all church matters that they are taught in School.\n\nYou have on several occasions reprimanded me for not visiting this school monthly. I could not make false reports. As I do not know much about the Anglican religion, and do not know the Catechism, I would like to see a good teacher in this school for one year and if there was no improvement then, I would not say anything about the schools.

However, the price I have had to pay for a little carelessness has been a very severe one, and it caused me untold suffering.\n\nThe little boy I had adopted while at Garden River was taken from me in July 1931 and I have not been allowed to see him since or even to know where he is.\n\nWhat is even more serious, the magistrate at the juvenile court suggested that I was discharged from the Indian School for drunkenness or I was a dope fiend, and suggested even worse.\n\nAs I have in my possession excellent reports from the School Inspectors in different\npauls in the country, and as I lived a harmless life, as is my wont, at Garden River, and would have done considerable good had I been allowed to remain there \u2014 I would ask you to let me have a statement refuting such charges, as I have already suffered too much and it is unfair to expect me to bear any more, as I am a returned soldier and my nerves are not of the best. I repeat very much that it was also a returned man who discharged me, and plunged me into a time of depression with hardly sufficient reason.\n\nI am Sir\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGilbert A.

Sim\nAugust xviii 1937\n\nCamp 13\nDorsel\nOntario\n\nSir,\n\nI would like to know why I was discharged from the Church of England Indian School at Garden River in June 1930. I ask this as I have had to suffer so much since that time, and it seems hard that a good man and an undoubted efficient teacher should be asked to undergo so much torture.\n\nNot only did the Bishop refuse to ordain me, but a little boy I loved very dearly was taken from me by the Children's Aid Society once I was\nthrown into the common jail because I tried hard to retain the little fellow. I have been accused of being a dope fiend, drunkard, and even worse crimes have been laid to my charge. Owing to a nervous breakdown brought on by such conditions I have been a nervous wreck and have not earned a cent since July 1931 when my boy was forcibly taken from me. I have been in flop houses and at times absolutely destitute. At present I am on a road relief camp, and try and imagine the mortifications a sensitive man is exposed to every day. Every time\nI go to the children's aid society office a policeman is fetched to eject me, and I am always asked in mysterious terms \"why were you discharged from Garden River?\"\n\nI always quote the reasons that were given to me, and always the reply is \"there is something worse than that\" and you know it.\n\nYou will readily see that this matter needs attention, as I was a most efficient Indian Teacher and in my R.C days my church would champion me. It seems to me that in this matter the churches also\nthe Department is not without blame and I trust you may do something to right this wrong or let me have an explanation, as you may have information about me which is absolutely untrue with regard to the pecuniary part of the business. I am as innocent of women as a child in his fifth year, and my life at Sandon Park was an open book.\n\nI am Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sim, 169 Mississauga St. East, Orillia, Ont., is referred to you for departmental attention and reply in the absence from Ottawa of the Superintendent General.\n\nGeorge Buskard\nPrivate Secretary\n\nper\nFebruary 21st, 1935.\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nI am informed that the Department had, prior to the summer of 1930, a teacher by the name of Mr. Gilbert A. Sim, who, I understand, was Principal of the School for Indian children at Garden River, Ontario. I believe Mr. Sim was dismissed from the Service.\n\nWill you be good enough to let me have some information as to the reason for his removal.\n\nPrivate Secretary.\nFebruary 25, 1936.\n\nMR. BUSKARD,\n\nI have your memorandum of the 21st instant, requesting information as to the reason for dispensing with the services of Mr. Gilbert A. Sim, who taught the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School, on Reserve No. 14, Garden River Agency.\n\nMr. Sim was appointed teacher of this school on the recommendation of His Lordship the Bishop of Algoma, on January first, 1930. He taught until June 30th, following, when his services were dispensed with, on the recommendation of Mr. Inspector McCookin and Dr. Stone, of this Department. Mr. McCookin's report reads as follows:\n\n\"I visited the Garden River C. E. Indian Day School and found conditions most unsatisfactory. The classroom was positively filthy. It looked as if it had not been scrubbed or dusted for months. It was unfit for any Indian child to sit in. The teacher himself was disreputable looking in an old soiled khaki shirt and pants and unshaven. The conditions were such that I had thought of wiring the Department to close the school right away until another teacher could be found. Recently, Mr. Sim has taken a little boy of about eleven years of age from the Children's Aid Society to live with him. This is causing comment and criticism. To what extent it is justified I have no knowledge, but, on the grounds of general inefficiency, I have no hesitation in recommending that Mr. Sim be relieved of his teaching duties at the end of this present term. The school under the present management is a disgrace to everyone having any interest in it.\"\n\nMr. Sim was afterwards before the Juvenile Court, when the Indian boy he had living with him was removed from his charge. He is a frequent letter-writer. I am of opinion that this man is not quite normal in his mind, and I would suggest that little attention be paid to his communications.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nSir,\n\nI would like to know why Comrade McFookin discharged me from my School in June 1930. One of us must have been drunk and it certainly was not me. I would ask you to reinstate me in some position in your Department, as I am not only a returned soldier but have other very desirable qualifications. Any man that would do a comrade out of his job at the time of a depression unless said man was absolutely inefficient, must be a cad of the first water and should be severely censured.\n\nI was not without blame, but the price I paid was too dear.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nGilbert A. Sim.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that Miss Esther Clement, teacher of the Garden River Indian Day School, has sent me her resignation to take effect at the end of the current term.\n\nI also beg to submit for your approval the appointment in her place of Miss Alice Davies, who holds a second class professional certificate of 1908 and is at present teaching in the Shingwauk Indian Residential School. I understand that she has been teaching there since 1926 and has received most favourable reports from the Inspectors.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6126, File 389-1, part 3)\n169 Mississauga St. East,\nOrillia,\nOntario\n\nJune iv 1935\n\nGentlemen\n\nI have been unemployed since June 1930, and that is not necessary. I was for a number of years a most successful teacher of Indian children. The Bishop of Algoma appointed me to take charge of his school on the Reserve at Garden River Sault Ste. Marie. An official from the Indian Department a certain \"comrade\" McGookin discharged me from my poor little job where I was very happy and very successful. Since that I have been unemployable as it is claimed I committed a serious crime at Garden River. Kindly have this put right, as it is not often an efficient man can be found for Indian work, so many are merely time servers. I have been living in flop houses police stations etc. ever since.\n\nI think comrade McGookin should be censured for doing a returned man out of a little living, and to stop him in a work for which he is eminently suited.\n\nYours Respectfully\n\nGilbert A.

Miss Davis has a second class professional certificate and previous teaching experience.\n\nThe salary allowed at this school is at the rate of $90.00 per teaching month.\n\nI submit, for your approval, the appointment of Miss Alice Davis as from September first, next, the beginning of the new school year.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 13, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the third instant, informing the Department that Miss Esther Clement, teacher of the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School, has forwarded her resignation to you, to take effect at the end of the current school year, and nominating the services of Miss Alice Davies to succeed her for the coming school year.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the resignation of Miss Clement is accepted. The qualifications which Miss Davies possesses are satisfactory, and the Department will approve of her appointment, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on September third, next. The salary allowed Miss Davies will be at the same rate as was paid Miss Clement, viz.: $90 per teaching month.\n\nMr. G. H. Sims, Indian Agent, Sault Ste.

I happen to me a most efficient teacher of Indian children. In spite of this I was, without previous reason, discharged from my school by a certain \"Comrade\" McSorley and consequently have been destitute ever\nsince and unable to secure another school.\n\nI would respectfully suggest what it would be better not to have irresponsible people running around the country at public expense, and discharging from a very humble living other men less fortunate than ourselves.\n\nFurthermore I should be reinstated with an apology from aforementioned offenders.\n\nG.A.

Indian Schools,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nWhen visiting the Garden River School last fall, you will probably remember having met Miss Betterell, who for over twenty-one years was Head matron of the Shingwauk Home and who in an interview with Dr. Mc. Caig yesterday, was strongly advised to go to Toronto for an immediate radium treatment. As you probably knew, Miss Betterell had to give up her position at Shingwauk having lost her sight. This will necessitate someone accompanying her.\n\nHaving talked the matter over with Mr. Sims, Dr. Mc. Caig, and Rev. C. F. Hives, and finding my attendance very small, this severe weather we thought you might consider allowing me to close the school for a week and I will make up lost time in the holidays when the Indians will be back from camp. Pupils of three families are at the camp till Spring, and this weather has caused much sickness. My attendance has been less than half. I can assure you that every day will be made up to the children.\n\nIf you feel that you can grant this favour, which will mean so much to us, would you send word as soon as possible. Dr. Mc. Caig is waiting to write to Toronto. We would like to leave here Friday evening to see the Toronto doctor Saturday morning, so if you feel that your answer by mail will not arrive soon enough, will you send a message \"collect\" to us care of Mr. Sims, Indian agent.\n\nHoping for the best, I remain\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nAlice Davies\nTeacher, Garden River\nOttawa, February 4, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department has received a communication from Miss Alice Davies, teacher of the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School, requesting permission to close the school for one week from the tenth instant, in order that she can accompany Miss Botterell to Toronto for medical treatment. She states that she would like to leave Friday evening, next, and, in order that there would be no delay in her receiving the necessary permission, you are being sent the following night lettergram of today's date:\n\n\"Inform Miss Davies, teacher, Garden River Anglican School, she may close school for week beginning tenth instant, to accompany Miss Botterell to Toronto\".\n\nIt will not be necessary for Miss Davies to make up the lost time during the holiday period. It is noted that, owing to the severe weather the attendance has been small at this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nG. H. Sims, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

The first point can be dismissed at once. The second cannot be conceded in light of my vast experience (covering 20 years), and my excellent reports.\nI do not think such a one give his talents to Indian work, and to dismiss me was absolutely inexcusable and decidedly cruel, as it not only deprived me of my living but delayed me from Ordination for which I had studied for many years. I may have been at fault but my good points should have far outweighed what, and I can never understand Comrade Mcgowan's action, and still consider it a proper and manly thing to reinstate me, as a very small compensation for what I have suffered.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

As I am a school master with many years experience, and especially successful with Indian children, I deserved better treatment.\n\nHaving been subjected to the humiliation of being discharged from an Indian school,\n\nFEB 25 1936\nI have been unable to secure a position since and have been drifting about the country in Road Camps, and am at present on relief in this town. It was particularly cruel and unwarranted to put me out of the only little job I have had since the war, and at a time of depression, unless there was strong reason to do so.\n\nI have excellent credentials and Inspector reports, and am well respected everywhere I go.\n\nIt is not usual for me to advertise my war service, but I left a very excellent appointment in the United States to come over and\nenlist into the ranks of the Canadian Forces, and was on the fighting line for three and a half years.\n\nMy Bishop (Dr. R. Smith) at Algoma was very sorry to lose me, but being in England at the time was unable to protest; and a very weak man was acting in his absence.\n\nI worked for the Liberal Party at the election of 1930, as scrutineer at Hawk Junction.

Her conception of teaching is largely that of transferring knowledge supposed to be useful, or at least contained in text-books. She talks immeasurably too much and leaves too little for the pupils to do. I believe she exerts a good influence on pupils and does much useful work.\n\n\"Walls and pictures are very dusty, cob webs are plentiful, and the walls and ceiling are very dingy. Toilets are not in good condition.\"\n\nI am inclined to feel that it would be in the best interests of the work at this school to appoint another teacher. I should, therefore, appreciate it if you would give this suggestion your very careful consideration and nominate a fully qualified teacher to take charge of this school for the academic year 1939-40.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRight Rev.

Under the circumstances it has been decided not to insist on her replacement at the present time.\n\nThe next occasion on which the Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Ontario visits Sault Ste.

Mr. Walkom, the Inspector for this district has informed me that teachers are very scarce and he has none to recommend for the Garden River School. I have consulted with the Rev. C.F. Hives, Principal of the Shingwauk School, and he and I are prepared to recommend for an appointment Mr. William Henry Peeling who has been supervising boys' work and play at the Shingwauk School during the past few months.\n\nMr. Peeling has complete Junior Matriculation certificates and in addition to this, he has six subjects of his Senior Matriculation. He is physically fit, having passed an Army Medical Test recently. Although he is only twenty years of age, he is mature in character and I feel sure he would do well at the school. He has not been to Normal School but as he will be in fairly close touch with the teachers at the Shingwauk School, he will be able to consult them about matters of teaching methods.\n\nI do hope you will approve of his appointment as it is most important that the Garden River School be opened at the beginning of October.\n\nKind regards,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nGeorge Frederick Algoma  \nBishop.\n\nGFA/BK\nOttawa,\nSeptember 19, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Garden River C.E.

Mr. Hardyman is not a man to ask for charity, indeed would not accept it, but many of his friends including myself feel that here is a case worthy of serious consideration by the Dept. of Indian Affairs for a pension for his remaining years.\n\nI am appealing to you rather than directly to the Dept. of Indian Affairs as I know you to be a man who knows the frontier life and the many hardships which a man like Mr. Hardyman must have experienced during his long service among the Indians, and that you will readily appreciate the circumstances of this case.\n\nIf there is anything you can do to help, I know you will use your influence in his behalf.

It is somewhat difficult to state the exact period during which he was employed by the Government. I note from your letter that he was for a time in charge of the Shingwauk Home Residential School at Sault Ste. Marie. The officials are of the opinion that during this period he was an employee, not of the Government, but of the Anglican Church.

CEBEAN\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Date] Dec. 1\nREPORT ON SAULT STE. MARIE AGENCY FOR THE MONTH JANUARY, 1944.\n\nQuite a number of cases of flu have been reported this month, but not of a serious type. The Doctor attending the Spanish River Reserve closed the Schools on this reserve for two weeks on account of same.\n\nH.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nThe Anglican Indian Day School,\nGarden River, Ontario.\nMay 9, 1944.\n\nWelfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept.of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nRegarding work of an extra-curricular nature conducted at this school.\n\nLast winter we, the boys and myself, built the brooder house. We raised 303 of the 312 chicks. Gave 25 to each of ten families and kept 50 ourselves for the work. I bought lumber and have built a laying pen to be a double decker. I want to prove to the people here that there is money in hens if they are housed and fed properly. We have had the next batch of chicks for a week now and have lost six of the 311 we received. I may say that we got New Hampshire Reds in pullets because they are meant, I thought, to supply eggs for the diet of the Indians.\n\nWe have kept two cows all winter. We have raised a bull which is now ready for service. He is running in the common pasture with six cows. People are taking more of an interest in cows I believe.\n\nI wintered a sow and had her bred last winter. She will farrow on June 11. My Indian neighbours have spoken for all she will have and more.\n\nI have a couple of small patches of ground offered me by interested Indians. On one of them I am having a larger vegetable garden than last year. On the other I am trying an experiment to rid a patch of scutch grass from it. I am cutting the scutch grass the last of June, then plowing and sowing to millet which is a fast growing crop in hopes that after a year or two the millet will smother the scutch grass. The people here are hampered by this weed. On another small piece I am sowing a mixture of oats, wheat and barley and will feed it in the straw as we have no way of getting it threshed. It will be for hen feed. Then I am sowing some alfalfa as it is excellent for green feed for hens in winter.\n\nNext year we are going to have a hot bed and will grow cabbage and tomato plants for the Indians. I can build it fairly cheaply and feel that it would be a great help.\n\nOf course we have the garden at the school and with it we are planting hedges this year as well as the usual cleaning up which we didn't get done last year. In a few years time we hope to have it looking civilized.\n\nHoping you are in favour of this work, I am,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will please find enclosed herewith two letters received from Mr. Albert E. Smith, teacher at the Anglican Indian Day School, Garden River Reserve, which are self-explanatory.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nMay 18, 1944.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, enclosing two letters from Mr. Smith, teacher of the Garden River C.E. School. In one of these letters he applies for an increase of salary from $900 to $1000 a year and in the second letter he outlines considerable work outside the classroom which he states he is doing for the benefit of the Indians.\n\nYou did not make any comment on either of these letters and, as you are in the best position to decide if the statements made by Mr. Smith are correct, the Department would appreciate having a report from you regarding Mr. Smith's activities at Garden River and at the same time you should make a definite recommendation regarding his request for an increase in salary.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nMay 29, 1944.\n\nDear Dr. Greer:\n\nWe have recently received a request from one of our teachers for an increase in salary and he bases his claim on the statement that the Department of Education for Ontario has set $1000 as the minimum salary for rural school teachers in this province.\n\nI remember seeing recently in the newspapers some item to the effect mentioned, but I was not previously aware that it had become a settled policy. I should appreciate your advising if the amount mentioned is the minimum salary allowed in rural schools in Ontario at the present time and also the cost-of-living bonus, if any, that is paid by rural school boards.\n\nIn Indian schools at the present time we are paying bonus at the rate of 17% to unmarried teachers and a flat rate of $18.43 a teaching month to married teachers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDr. V.K.

She called in here last weekend and gave one lesson of half an hour. The pupils are all for it and are eager to have her each week.\n\nWe await your decision,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will please find attached herewith letter received from Mr. A. E. Smith, teacher at the Garden River Anglican Day School which is self-explanatory regarding music lessons for his pupils.\n\nRPGI/NY\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nOctober 13, 1944.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, enclosing letter from Mr. A.E. Smith with reference to engaging a music teacher to teach singing to the pupils at the Garden River C.E. School. There is no doubt that the action suggested by Mr. Smith would be very desirable, but we are not making such arrangements at any other Indian school at the present time and cannot make an exception in the case of the Garden River C.E. School.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, Ontario.\nFebruary 14, 1946.\n\nA letter from Garden River, Ontario, dated Jan. 31st signed by Albert E. Smith and addressed to Mr. Hoey requests as follows:\n\n\"May I also ask that the children be immunized against smallpox and diphtheria and that their teeth, eyes and tonsils receive attention.\"\n\nMay we have a report on this as to the number of immunizations done and further information on what Mr. Smith refers to as attention to teeth, eyes and tonsils.\n\nW.

Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI wish to draw your attention to the fact that Alex Pine has not paid us for keeping his daughter Gloria during the two months of July and August.\n\nIt might be borne in mind also that when he was up in court a year ago last February the Magistrate ordered him to pay $15 per month plus $7.50 until the debt for her board amounting to $108 was paid off. Since then he has never paid any more than $12 per month and missed paying in July 1945.\n\nI think it is nearly time for some definite arrangement regarding the payment for this child. I still cannot see why the Department cannot pay this amount and then we would be sure of it. As it is we have to hunt it up every month. The mother is dead and the father is a cripple. The Department is paying to keep three of Ray Lesages children at the Shingwauk school. They are not in need of help near as much as this child is. The mother is in good health and the father is working in Detroit making $8.00 a day.\n\nPlease give this your consideration.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.E. Smith\nThe Anglican School,\nGarden River, Ont.\nSept. 6, 1946.\n\nMr. R. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe regulations of the Department forbid me to allow any child to attend school without having recently (within the last three years) been immunized against smallpox. When I opened school here on Sept. 3rd, I found that none of the children had as yet been inoculated against typhoid or vaccinated for smallpox or immunized against diphtheria.\n\nYou will remember that I have asked to have this done several times during the past four years that I have been in charge of this school.\n\nThis will have to be done now. I shall refuse to admit any child after Monday September 16th, unless he has been vaccinated. I am only carrying out the orders of the Department in doing so.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nTeacher-in-charge.\nGarden River, Ont.\nSept. 6, 1946.\n\nDept.

Smith, teacher of the Garden River C.E. School wrote to you on September 6th.\n\nNo doubt you have taken whatever action you considered necessary. However, with reference to Gloria Pine, it is difficult to understand why she should be residing with Mr. Smith. If she is a Protestant and is in good health and the parents refuse to support her, I feel she should be placed in the Shingwawk Home. From Mr. Smith's letter it appears that the arrangement to keep her was a private arrangement between Pine and himself. Certainly the Department is not responsible for the girl's maintenance in Mr. Smith's home.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nTHE INCORPORATED SYND OF THE DIOCESE OF ALGOMA\n\nRev.

You will note the letter we wrote to Mr. Laurence on this occasion.\n\nIs there anything which can be done to speed up the medical care given to the children at this reservation?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nEnclosed is a copy of a letter from Albert Smith, the teacher at the Garden River School. I think, if at all possible, you should have the children inoculated and vaccinated. The doctor doing our work in Sault Ste Marie should carry this out. I think we can ignore the greater part of this letter. Mr. Smith seems to have a chip on his shoulder and looking for trouble, however, I will drop him a line and send you a copy.\n\nW. L. Paleonor, M.D.,\nActg.A/Supt. Indian Health Services.\n\nH.P.G. Laurence, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSaulte Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nCF\nDr. J. Moore,\nSupt. of Indian Health Services,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSince coming to this school four years ago I have been trying to persuade the Indian Agent, who is also Health Officer for the Indians, to have the children immunized by vaccination against Smallpox, Diphtheria and Whooping cough. Nothing has been done. This spring I received a supplement to the Guide for Dispensers which stated that teachers should not allow children to enter school unless they had been vaccinated. On Sept. 6 I wrote to the Indian Agent saying that I could not allow the children to attend school unless they were vaccinated. I set Sept. 16 as a deadline and sent a carbon copy of the letter to the Department at Ottawa. The Doctor made one excuse after the other and the last one was that he had no vaccine. Then the Agent ordered it from Ottawa and still there is no sign of vaccination.\n\nAfter November 1st, I shall not allow any child to attend school unless he is vaccinated. None of them have so there will be no classes held until this has been done.\n\nThis Fall all the Indians were rounded up and X-Rayed in the Soo. A few were found to be infected. I believe all but two are willing to go to the San for treatment. One of the two has skipped out to the U.S.A., the other one is the mother of three children and she will not stay at home but persistently visits a home where there are eight children. I asked the Agent if they could not be forced to go. He said no not until they became a menace. If tuberculosis is active are they not a menace? Or has Medicine advanced beyond that theory since 1929.\n\nLittle need to wonder that T.B. is so prevalent among the Indians. A boy of seven years old was forced to walk three miles to school with tubercular abscesses on his neck. I had to dress them three different times and when they did not clear up I defied the Agent and Grunt Officer and sent him home. A person dies in the Sanatorium and the body is sent home. The coffin is opened and a three night wake is enjoyed by all. Then the corpse is dutifully kissed and buried.\nThis spring I ordered medicine in March and got it June. This Fall in September I ordered Medicine including Liver Oil which we need badly and so far have not received it yet. Why should there be such a delay now when the service was so good in former Years?\n\nThe children in this school are vile with head lice. I have kept sending them home for a clean up. This lowers the attendance. This spring a druggist friend of mine put me wise to D.D.T. That is the only way that I can keep them under control at all. I get tired of watching my wife comb them out of our little girl's hair and also got tired of combing them out of my own. The Indian Agent did not want to try to clean up the condition because he said it would be too much trouble. The lice breeders are still at large. This condition need not be as they have been cleaned up on the Oka Reserve where I taught for nine years and never saw a head louse, thanks to a wide awake doctor.\n\nIn the four years that I have been here we have never had an examination of the children's teeth, eyes or tonsils. This will soon have to be done as there are some of them who need attention.\n\nWe are paid $5.00 a month for dispensing and have to pay $1.75 a month for the telephone which is necessary so that we can get the doctor's advice. I may say that we cannot get the doctor unless we call the R.C.M.P. and have them stir him up. But you will see that for $3.25 a month we are on call 24 hours of the day. Never have so few done so much for so little.\n\nIt is to be hoped that you will be able to awaken some people out of their lethargy and get them to do some work.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert Smith,\nTeacher.\nOttawa, Ontario\nNovember 13, 1946\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of October 28th, addressed to Dr. Moore and complaining of conditions at the Garden River School. I am making arrangements to have the children inoculated and vaccinated, however, it is not necessary to exclude them from school until this is done.\n\nConcerning the tuberculous patients, every effort is made to have the patients that are a menace, in other words, that have a positive sputum, admitted to sanatorium. I would point out that the preventive laws definitely state that patients with positive sputum can be forced to go to sanatorium. There are many cases of active tuberculosis that have not positive sputum and we cannot force them to take treatment.\n\nThe drug list includes \"larkspur\" for the treatment of head lice and this seems quite efficacious. I do not think it advisable to use D.D.T. for this purpose.\n\nIt has not been our custom to have dental and eye clinics for day schools and it is felt that if there is local work to be done the patient should be taken to the local doctor and he will do the work there, and if it is dentistry, send him to the local dentist. We do hold clinics for residential schools when there is a large group of children.\n\nWe cannot accept any responsibility for payment of the telephone in your house. The $5.00 a month you receive is for dispensing medicines and we do not see any connection between this dispensing and telephone charges.\n\nW. L. Falconer, M.D.,\nActg. A/Supt.

Indian Day School.\n\nMr. A.E. Smith, age forty-six, fourteen years Indian experience, twelve years Provincial Experience.\n\nEnrolment is as follows:\n\n| Grade | Enrolment |\n|-------|-----------|\n| 1     | 7         |\n| 2     | 6         |\n| 3     | 4         |\n| 5     | 3         |\n| 6     | 4         |\n| 7     | 2         |\n\nThe attendance on February 3rd, the day on which I inspected this school was sixteen. I tested only Grade 5 and Grade 7 with Achievement Tests and found them good in Spelling and weak in English and especially in Arithmetic.\n\nThis teacher seems to be in a rut and I feel that a change is definitely indicated. He admits frankly that he has lost interest in the lower grades and would like to handle the Senior Room at a two-room school. He is quite willing to move if we so request.\n\nDiscipline is no problem and the children are well mannered. They work well on their own and speak out well. The room is very untidy. In a corner is a work bench which takes up quite a bit of room (see recommendations below). The teacher was unshaven and his appearance left much to be desired in the way of cleanliness and tidiness.\nThis school is about fifty years old and has a large brick fireplace in the front of the room. This cuts down the blackboard surface considerably. The teacher's quarters are made up of a kitchen, diningroom/sitting room at the back. The whole is lighted with electricity and is adequately wired. The classroom has six semi-indirect lights in the ceiling.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n1. A brooder house at the back of the school should be fixed up as a small workshop and the Manual Training equipment should be moved to it. There is an old stove which can be quite easily put up in the workshop. It could also be used as a small storeroom for Scout and Guide supplies.\n\n2. During 1949-50 we should have an Engineer visit the school and decide what can be done about the foundation. The building seems sound in spite of its age. The present teacher and the Agent seem to feel that the foundation could be dug behind the school and that the building could be moved back to this new foundation. We could then arrange to have it heated by a furnace and at the same time remove the brick fireplace.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nCol.

This will require a two-roomed school.\n\nThis class room is full now. There are 30 pupils with four due to start after Easter and I do not know where I will put them. I may add that the class-room is poorly lighted and ventilated and is out of date. The residence and class-room are both hard to heat. The toilets are too far away from the school.\n\nMay I suggest that a modern two-room school be built with basement for toilets, furnace and a water pressure system. It could also be used as a play-room and work-shop and should be the full size of the school building.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTeacher.\n22nd February, 1949.\n\nMr. R.F.G.

We realize the difficulties that have been encountered and you can rest assured that you have been appreciated. What you have accomplished in the teaching profession is recorded for all time by the high standards that have been attained by the pupils who have had their educational background under your guidance.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature by many parents]\nThe Amulfield School was formed by the union of three gold mines and was a private institution with the managers forming the Board.\n\nI am writing the chairman for a statement which I shall forward to you in a few days.\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nEdith Bockus\nNoranda High School\nNoranda P.Q.\nFeb. 16, 1943.\n\nPupils from Miss Bockus' school at Amosfield have during the past three years written entrance examinations in this school.\n\nBeing responsible for the promotion of these pupils to Grade 8, I have examined their papers carefully each year and find that year after year they have been well prepared for the examinations.\n\nJudging from the papers which the pupils wrote I have come to the conclusion that Miss Bockus is thorough & competent. She has certainly shown herself to be most willing to help all as much as possible.\n\nLast year Grade 8 was taught in the Amosfield School for the first time. The result was a very laudable one.\n\nI would recommend Miss Bockus to any board which desires the services of a proven teacher.\nwho is keenly interested in doing her best for the classes in her charge.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.S. Fuggle M.A.\nSupervising Principal,\nNoranda High\n\nCopy\nP.2\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nMiss Edith Bockus has been employed as teacher for the past three years 1930-33 at the Mystic Elementary School.\n\nDuring that time her excellent system of teaching, her devotion to her work and her high moral character have done much to raise the standard of the school and to make for its success.\n\nThis is given as a guide to anyone seeking the services of a good capable and conscientious teacher who takes her work seriously and gives her best.\n\nM.H. Schoolcraft, Conn.\n\nCopy.\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI have known Edith Bocken personally for the past two years and have had the privilege of her cooperation and service in many branches of church activities.

Q. Hamilton\n\nCopy\nMr. B.F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept Minres & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn Aug 2nd I sent you an application for the School at File Hills, La'Appelle, stating I would forward a recommendation from the Chairman of my last school at Amosfield. Mr. Corlett's letter arrived just now so I am enclosing his report with a copy of one from my present minister.\n\nSincerely,\n\nEdith Bochus\nAugust 4, 1949.\n\nTo Whom It May Concern.\u2014Miss Edith Bockus has been known to me for about 15 years, starting from her engagement as School Teacher in the village of Arntfield Quebec. The school started as a one room establishment with Miss Bockus teaching all grades and subjects and its size varied with the fortunes of the nearby mines. At one time there were at least four teachers.\n\nMy connection with the school was as Mine Manager of the chief contributing mine and because of that position I shared the responsibility for the conduct of the school with the other Managers and representatives of the employees.\n\nThe record of Miss Bockus is impressive. She was held responsible by the committee for the teaching of the school and the administration. Apparently the system was that each assistant teacher was permitted to teach what she could teach best and Miss Bockus took the remaining subjects.\n\nThe school was a successful one and the graduates or those who moved from there to other schools were usually able to lead the classes in the next schools. One of her graduates, who took all her public school work from Miss Bockus and her first year high school, from her won the Governor Generals Medal for her matriculation work. Last winter five of her former pupils were students in this university.\n\nI am pleased to recommend Miss Bockus to any teaching job that she thinks that she can handle.\n\nA.V. Corlett\nProfessor of Mining Engineering.\nBedford United Church\nBedford Ave.\nAug 2 1949\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nThis is to certify that, as minister of my church United Church of which she is a member, I have known Miss Edith Evelyn Bockus for some time & have discovered her to be a person of high reputation & character & of good habits.\n\nCapable & experienced she should prove efficient in any task assigned to her.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.F.

My year is not completed until Sept. 30th, 1923, but according to your regulations and to facilitate your representative in obtaining a new teacher I send in my resignation in June, although a month's notice only is required. I have taught some of the ten teaching...\nmouths in this year so I should imagine the greater part of the two months salary should come to me.\n\nMy predecessor received her salary for the full quarter although she did not telegraph September but I did not arrive until October 1st whereas my successor is ready to start in September.

School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the school year dates from September first to June 30th. You were engaged at a salary of $800 a year, and during the last school year you were paid this amount, in four quarterly instalments of $200 each. There is, therefore, no balance of salary due you.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nP.W.R. Belford, Esq.,\nGarden River,\nOnt.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of yours of the 17th instant. I wish to also point out various things which apparently you have overlooked.\n\nFirst. I commenced at Garden River on Oct. 1st 1921 and taught until June 3rd 1923, thereby completing two years teaching at a salary of $800.00, making a total of $1600.00 which less one quarter salary, $66.66, namely $533.34 & have received $1400.00 only. I was not allowed to commence on Sept 1st 1921 as the preceding teacher did not complete her yearly service until Oct 1st 1921. This teacher was paid not only for the holidays in 1921 but also for Sept. although no school was held.\n\nSecondly. Your Agent at Saint Marie\nOur assurance was that I would receive my full proportion of salary for those holidays in the event of my resigning. I resigned with this assurance, and if this had not been so it would certainly have been worth my while to stay till Oct. 1st and receive a quarter's salary for a month work.\n\nThirdly, your Dept wrote me when I had almost decided to resign last year and told me they would be glad if I stayed for another year. Your agent also told me he hoped I could continue for another year. The Arch Bishop of Algoma said he would be very sorry if I should leave, and because of this I preferred a very much better position, not only in a monetary way, but in a city where there were a few conveniences and comforts, and possibly through my remaining here improve my wife's health.\nseriously. I would also point out my resignation made effective from Aug. 31, 1923. I repeat I am entitled to my proportion of salary for the months of July and August, 1923, and I would appreciate your favourable reconsideration of my claim; I do not wish to cause you any inconvenience, but the fact is self evident, I have done the work and wish my salary. I may also say if you can not give me satisfaction direct I will be compelled to take it up through other quarters.\n\nI am a returned soldier, and if you continue refusal of this, it will not coincide with your Dept policy toward us I hope.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

He is entitled to $720 for the period he taught and the above amount is due him to complete his salary.

In reply I beg to say that your letter of the 11th instant referred to your salary for the last school year, and in our reply we informed you that you had been paid the full salary for that period.\n\nYou were appointed teacher and began duties on October 1, 1921, at a salary of $800 per annum, based on ten teaching months in the year, or $80 per month. You taught 9 months from October 1, 1921, to June 30, 1922, for which you should receive 9 months' salary, or $720. We find that you were only paid $600 for this period, and there is, therefore, a balance due you of $120, a cheque for which amount will be sent you under separate cover.\n\nAs stated, you received your full yearly salary of $800 for the school year beginning September 1, 1922, and ending June 30, 1923, the date from which you resigned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It has been very helpful in my research.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJune 30th, 1929\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Stamp]\nI have been working at the school for five years now. I was in high school before that. Some people and friends of mine and I visited my parents in New York last July. The weather was very hot there. We had a good time and visited my position as teacher in the Anglican School at Garden River. But I came here and have been taking medical treatment. My eyes especially troubled me. My condition is now improved.\n\nWhile I was ill I could not give much attention to business of any kind. A short time ago I mailed my pass book.\nTo the Bank of Montreal South Marie out, but I noticed that they had not placed to my credit the $285.00 which was mailed to them last July. The manager of the Bank wrote me and told me that they had searched all their files and could not find it. He suggested that I write to you and ask you for a duplicate. Which I am now doing. I mailed all my cheques for the first year I was in that school to the same address and found it all right.\n\nWhile I was ill I came up here South allusion to business of any kind. Arthur L.

The Department is approving of the appointment of Miss Davies, to begin duties on September third, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nI would request that you give Miss Davies every assistance possible in her work at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Key,\nSuperintendent Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nYour pardon please for this letter.\nWe are in great difficulty here of a financial nature. I mentioned at the post office, that we were still on the look out for our cheque. The Postmaster informed me that it would be paid at the end of three months time. We will not need it then because we can't live without eating.\n\nWould there be any way you could arrange for me to get my cheque monthly? Really we are quite worried. We have used our savings in moving and getting settled. My son works in the saw mill boards here with us paying us $5.50 a week but the five of us could not live on that until Christmas. I never had any idea that I'd be paid different here from what I was at Oka.\nAllow me to thank you for granting the materials necessary to make our home more comfortable and our work in school easier. The well was sunk to a depth of 38 feet but the water is still bad. As soon as I have made a few repairs to the residence and school I am going to dig a well on my own. I'm of the opinion that I can get water nearer the surface.\n\nThe building has \"gone to seed\" pretty well but in course of time we hope to have the plaster patched, the windows putted, and the loose boards back in place. We enjoy home-making.\n\nThe children and people are very very agreeable and it's a pleasure to work with them. So unlike the Oka people.\n\nWe have a warp on my small foot loom for school window drapes. Six of the big girls are weaving. They enjoy it too. I taught a grade IX and X and like the work with the pupils of all grades. My percentage attendance last month was 82.7%, not bad.\n\nWhatever you can do will be very much appreciated.\n\nThank you again,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nOttawa,\nNovember 5, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to the non receipt of your October salary cheque. I regret very much the delay in issuing the cheques for the month of October, but they have now gone forward and yours has no doubt reached you by this time. The delay was due to two factors; first, the increase in the cost-of-living bonus and, second, the new deductions for income tax. These two changes involve a great deal of computation and, as a result, issue of the cheques was delayed. I am assured that there will be no further difficulty in this regard during the balance of the academic year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. A.E.

Davey,  \nDirector of Education,  \n400 Laurier Avenue West,  \nOttawa 4, Ont.\n\nJuly 23, 1967.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI taught in the Anglican Indian School at Garden River in the district of Algoma from Nov. 1, 1932 to June 30, 1935 a teaching period of 28 teaching months. I have applied for credit in the Teachers' Superannuation Fund of Ontario and am enclosing their reply. I have been unable to obtain the statement of teaching experience from the Department of Indian Affairs at Sault Ste. Marie or Sudbury. Send me such a statement if possible.\n\nAlso please inform me if I was a contributor to the Dominion Government and if I was not send me a statement outlining the reason for this. If I was a contributor will I be entitled to a pension or annuity from it? When would the pension start and what would be the amount?\n\nYours Truly,\n\nEsther Hardick nee Clement  \n(mrs. W. R. Hardick)\nRegistered July 10, 1969.\n\nMrs. Esther Hardick,\nThessalon, Ontario.\n\nDear Mrs. Hardick:\n\nWe have your application for annual allowance and we hope to have the computation of the amount of pension completed so that it will be presented to the Commission at their next meeting. In the meantime, I am returning your baptismal certificate to you by registered mail.\n\nWould you tell us whether or not you wish to obtain credit for your service at the Anglican Indian School. However, if this school came under the auspices of the Anglican Church, it is not possible to obtain credit. Would you tell us whether or not this was the case. If this school was under the jurisdiction of the Department of Indian Affairs would you send us a statement outlining the beginning and ending date of the service and also the actual teaching time. You should have been a contributor to the Dominion Government at that time but if you were not, would you also obtain a statement outlining the reason for this. I am enclosing a pamphlet regarding the payment along with an Application for Credit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Mrs. D. Stammers),\nBenefits Manager.\n\nDS:hb\n\nIndian Affairs.

The teacher was away for three days saying that she parents had both just arrived from up the lake. We thought they had been all summer fishing here with their children.\n\nAnd a further reason was the state of the walls in the school; the heavy wind had broken the plaster all around and that morning three pails full had to be removed. There had been the wall cracks and one well that patching the plaster is no use, it will all have to come down and be re-lathed, our men at work with matched lumber the lathe would be put in the church first in the end the cost would be in the neighborhood of $125.

The last time it was repaired was in 1894 when $100 was expended in sheeting the inside.\n\nI visited the school on two occasions and fully agree with Mr Inspector McCaig's remarks.\n\nIn the fall of '95 the Department authorized the expenditure of $1000 from the funds of the Batchewana and Garden River Bands for the erection of a schoolhouse for the Roman Catholics on the Reserve and they have not a very commodious building, while the Protestant children are still in the dilapidated old schoolhouse above referred to.\n\nI think that $700 would put up and equip a school suitable for the Protestant children and that such an amount could not be better expended.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I brought before the members and chief and sub chiefs, 20 of the former and one of the latter, of the necessity of having a new Protestant School built there. This was discussed by all but two, and they did not vote from the fact (believing they were too deaf to hear) The main reason made in opposing was that the school should not be too expensive. I also suggest that the timber required should be cut off the Reserve by the Indians who were to receive a fair price for the log measured, and the logs to be laid on the American side. This will I think save considerably as lumber is now very scarce here, and at a very high price. I also suggested that the school Room should be made to accommodate a teacher or two teachers.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Prices of material and labor have advanced considerably since then at the \"Soo\" and the tender recommended by Mr Agent Nicholls exceeds the amount appropriated by Order-in-Council by $675.00, $1100.00 being the amount originally provided.

The first clause calls for a brick chimney with three stories from the foundation. It then provides for an open fire place inside, not in school room. If the fire place be built it is absolutely necessary to have it more than half a brick thick so as to prevent carrying the fire from heat of fire place over into the school house. A third clause provides that the fire place shall be constructed behind the fire place.\n\nThere's another suggestion that I would make and that is that the interior of the building be fitted with rough lumber. The building in the school room especially will be scarcely strong enough to keep the flue from breaking without the lumber. The extra cost would not be more than $40.00 and I should strongly urge this to be done as well as building the thickness of wall of fire place which should also be protected by a screen around the front.\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs Ottawa\n\nIndian Affairs.

The fireplace should be built in the usual manner, that is, not less than one brick thick. The Specifications refer to the chimney only, as being half a brick thick.\n\n2. The cold air duct to the stove in the Schoolroom is constructed by boxing the joists from a register which should be placed under the stove to the outside wall, and continuing the same through and up the wall to the bottom of the window sill. The top of the duct is to be covered with wire netting.\n\n3. The Specifications provide for the walls to consist of studding 16 in. apart. On the outside rough boarding, tar paper and clap boards, on the inside lath and plaster, two coat work, except under the wainscoting where only one coat is to be placed, that is to say the wainscoting is placed in position when the walls have received only one coat. This is considered to be quite sufficient without the extra boarding which you mention, and necessary furring under the lath and plaster.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWm. L.

My intention is to make this place a model school both inside & out.\n\nWe are very much cramped for room, having to live in 3 small rooms upstairs and besides the doctors here say it is exceedingly hard on my wife's health when we run up & downstairs so much, and we must have a little built as a lean-to. I have a plan which I will like the Dept to sanction the old school which is still standing a mile from here, could be pulled down, so the material of it used...\nTo make us a kitchen, the only material we will require will be tar & lining paper, nails, & shingles; I am digging a well which will be inside this proposed kitchen, and as we will require a cellar to hold our winter supply of vegetables I propose to dig one under the kitchen in the opposite corner. It is absolutely necessary for us to have a cellar and also more room as we have a family, and unless we can have this improvement granted us it will be impossible for us to manage this winter, so trust although so late in the season that you will see your way to approving of this addition, as the Indians have approved this plan to me and if you will lend us a little assistance I shall set the work all done free of cost by the people, it will be necessary to lose no time as the winter commences early in this part of Algoma.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHenry F.

As a building it is of little value but there is a quantity of good material in it which would probably be worth ten or fifteen dollars.

The department has paid the accounts which aggregate $7.67 and the cheque therefor is being sent forward, but I have to inform you that in future when you desire to have expenditure incurred in connection with the school, you should write to Mr. Nichols explaining the matter and you should not proceed to incur any outlay before receiving authority from him.

It is regretted that it is now too late to provide such for the children.\n\nThe Department would like to know whether you held a Christmas tree and gave any prizes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLucius F. Hardyman, Esq.,\nTeacher-Anglican School,\nGarden River, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to refer to F.153806/5A. I am much pleased to know the Dept. takes a keen interest in this School; so I have, & will continue to do so, told the Indians so, because I feel that owning this Reserve being so\nclose to Sainte-Clotilde, that this school should be as good as we can make it.\n\nI give the pupils marks for all their lessons, also for 'prompt attendance' at the two sessions, & 'conduct,' & I gave in all 33 prizes to the 5 classes viz 4th Book, 3rd Book, 2nd Book, 1st Book, Primer, &c.\n\nMy average for last quarter was almost 20, only lacking 4 attendances, which was good as there only 32 on roll, only 40 children in the village; in this district of Algonquin, only 48 per cent of the white children are attending school.\nWhile giving out prizes again at Easter, I might mention I have to thank Mr. Meigh for most of my prizes this year, he has always been a great help to me here, so I am glad to report I have just had a phone put in here, which will be a great boon to our Indians when sick, as I give out\nmedicine from here, & look after the sick under Dr. M's Surgeon's directions, & I have always longed to have a phone, thanks to a friend, this want has been supplied. If you would care to have a copy of the marks of the children for the first term, I shall\nforward same, in case it might be improved.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nLucius F.

During this last summer Mr. Nichols came down here, & told me I was to have the school grounds levelled.\nand he instructed me to have the work done. He said Mr. L.A. Green, B.A. Lib. Inspector, had recommended this to the Dept., & he stated $835 was the amount allowed; I could not get the work completed & with your approval intend to complete the work & cover it with clear glass.\ntake to expend so\nlarge a sum with-\nout permission.\nTrusting this expla-\nnation will be\nsatisfactory to\nthe Department.\nI have the honor\nto be Sir,\nyour obedient servant,\nFrancis F.

I am sending you the file on which the plan of the school is and I would ask you to suggest how the chimney should be improved and whether any other means of ventilation could be provided, except by having the windows lower from the top.\nMay 26, 1917\n\nI have examined the plan of Redden River C.E. School, also the report letter regarding the boiler and chimney.\n\nThe easiest method of providing better air is by taking out the block from under the top brick and lowering same about two inches and firmly secure in place. If it is necessary to close the window and cut the concrete bricks and cement frame into third or even fourths of what it will both the cement fixed and partly back but not broken.\n\nRegarding the chimney, it will appear necessary to remove the portion above roof and rebuild in cement masonry. The chimney should also be raised at least six inches higher than it is now to provide a flue of 9\" diameter to still further increase height of chimney smoke pipe.\n\nWith fresh air admitted to the class room, and sufficient chimney to effect chimney to provide him with the accompanying benefits, they should have fair ventilation although the building itself is rather smaller than is usual for a number of that size [accommodating 70 children].\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.

If it is necessary to close the window, rods cut the correct length, and secured to frame with string or wire (to prevent loss of rod) will hold the sash tight closed and firmly lock both sashes.\n\nRegarding the chimney it will apparently be necessary to tear down the portion above roof and re-build in cement mortar. The chimney should also be increased in height to give better draught, also to provide a glazed 9\" drain tile to still further increase height of class room smoke flue.\n\nWith fresh air admitted to the class room, and sufficient draught in chimney to provide heat with the arrangement there, they should have fair ventilation, although the ventilating duct is rather smaller than is usual for a room of that size.

In the spring, a foot or so of water soaks into it, I well suspect then it dried either with stone or bricks, and cement floor, & ceiled in, and ventilated.\n\nThe roof in one two places leaks, & if not attended to the ceiling upstairs will fall to pieces, and the wood shed also leaks badly.\n\nI think there ought to be a second chimney built, because our chimney is not sufficient, and I cannot heat the upstairs.\n\nI have not asked for any improvement.\nThe Anglican School\n\nGarden River, Ont.\n\nTo the teacher's apartments since the addition was erected which is ten years ago, so I feel it imperative to do something in order to save expense both of the delays and than no place to keep vegetables or plants in our winter.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nLucius F.

You should state whether you consider these repairs necessary and, if so, you should give an estimate of the probable cost of having the work done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSmith Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of September 22nd No 153896/5 in reference to repairing the Garden River Anglican School, I beg to say that I consider that the repairs asked for are much needed. I had the Mr Phail & Wright Construction Co visit the building yesterday and I enclose you their Tender for the same. You will notice an item in their Tender as follows, rebuilding Fire place. The fire place that is there now cannot be used as it does not seem to draw whenever a fire is started it smokes so bad that the children cannot stay in the building. The new chimney is required so as to be able to heat the front Bedrooms in the building. The Basement as it is at present is of no use to Mr hardyman.\n\nThe present Chimney that is used for his Cook stove is in very bad shape it is cracked in several places and in danger of falling. The Roof is in need of repairs as it leaks in several places. The tender enclosed seems to be a big sum and I would humbly suggest that if you intend doing this work that it be given out by public tender as there are several Firms in the City that is not rushed with work at present and we might get it done for less than the above amount.\n\nAwaiting your further instructions,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

While at the Garden River Reserve we visited Mr. Hardyman at the protestant school, and I wish to draw attention to the needs at this school. Their supply of water is not satisfactory and a new well should be sunk outside of the building, the present one being in the basement. This simply involves the driving of a pipe and water will presumably be found at no great depth. A new pump should also be provided.\n\nThe school building is in need of painting and the interior of the building should be kalsomined. A hardwood floor should also be laid in the class-room.\n\nThe surrounding grounds are as usual, in excellent condition and a splendid object lesson for the Indians. Mr. Hardyman has quite a large lawn and I think he should be furnished with a lawn mower, and I would recommend that the agent be authorized to purchase one for him and to have the work above mentioned done.\n\nSgd.

The first item therefore should be reduced. The total amount of the account, taking this correction into consideration will amount to $133.65, as indicated. It will be necessary for the Department to be furnished with a receipt for the $6.00 charged for cartage, before this item can be allowed.\n\nYou should take this matter up with Mr. Sawyer without delay and submit an account from him showing prices in detail in the manner above indicated. When such an account is received, payment will be considered.\n\nYou should make report to the Department as to the number of coats of paint which were given the building. You should state whether the roof was stained and you should make a general report as to the manner in which the work was performed, stating whether it is satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, 11th September, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 7th instant, with which you forwarded an account from Mr. James Sawyer for painting, kalsomining, and decorating the Anglican School at Garden River; and in reply I beg to say that the Department regards the account as excessive. School buildings at other reserves have been painted both on the outside and inside with two coats of paint at a total cost of $125.00. This building was only kalsomined on the inside and, therefore, the cost should have been less. The prices charged by Mr. Sawyer for materials supplied are considered unreasonable. He will not be allowed the charge of $17.50 for board, nor will the Department pay the commission of 10% charged on cost of materials, cartage, board bill and wages. This charge is regarded as most unreasonable. The maximum rate of wages should not exceed .40 cents an hour. The charge in this account for the services of a painter amounts to $5.50 a day when the charge of commission is taken into consideration. The Department will not make payment at this rate. It is considered that if Mr. Sawyer receives payment at the following rates, he will be amply remunerated. I may say that the charges below mentioned are in excess of those which\n\nA. D.

S. G. of I. A.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th Inst re account for painting the Anglican School.\n\nI beg to say that I had a conference with Mr Sawyer and he insists that he only charged the regular prices for all the materials and labor. He also says that he or any of the Master Painters would not out of the City they invariably charge and collect 50\u00a2 an hour and Board and Lodging. In this case he went himself and took pains to have the work done right.\n\nIf the work was done by the yard it would cost within 17\u00a2 of the amount sent you.\n\nI thought it would be cheaper to have it done by commission and as he was there himself I felt confident he would do the right thing which he did.\n\nThe building was given 2 coats of paint on the outside and it required a large amount of paint on account of the building being badly weather beaten. This is not an ordinary school and dwelling. It is a school and dwelling combined with two lean to sheds a wood shed and two closets. The lean tos are connected with the house the woodshed and closets are separate. The inside of the school building was very much in need of painting and I had him paint it.\n\nThe windows in nearly every case had to be reglazed and in several cases he put in new glass. Inside the School building the plaster was badly broken and it took a lot of time to repair it before Kalsomining.\n\nI agreed to him having 10% commission if he would look after the job himself and work at it in place of sending men to do the work.\n\nI am enclosing you statement of cost of work by the yard at the regular prices and as I said before there is a difference of 17\u00a2\nOttawa, September 27th., 1915.\n\nWith cheque.\n\nSir,-\n\nReferring to your letter of the 20th instant, with enclosure relative to the painting of the Anglican Church at Garden River, I beg to transmit herewith cheque No. 3179 for $170.65 in payment of Mr. Sawyer's account. With reference to the amount at which payment has been made I beg to say that the Department has allowed the prices charged for materials and also payment at the rate of 50 cents an hour, for labour, but the charges for board and commission to the amount of $17.50 have been disallowed. The item of $6.00 for cartage has not been included but payment will be made when you send in a receipt from Mr. Sawyer covering the said amount, which receipt I may remind you was asked for in Official letter of the 11th instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

No wheel was sent with it, and consequently during the Winter Season especially it catches and I have to mount the roof, and besides the little helper through age, is not very safe, and requires attention, so I shall be much obliged if you get permission to have this attended to.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nFrancis F.

You will also be good enough to submit an estimate of the cost of repairing the belfry in order to make it safe.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D.

Garden River Anglican School. 160370-27F. Ontario\n\nBUILDING:- Walls and ceiling very dirty. Windows need repairing.\n\nFENCE:- Posts and barbed wire, Out of repair.\n\nResidence for Teacher.- In bad repair.\n\nI wish that the local agent would see that the necessary and long neglected repairs to building are made.\n\nA door from schoolhouse to schoolroom would be an untold blessing in winter. This could very easily be made from sitting room.\n\nMrs. Beatrice Stephenson.\n\nTeacher.\nOTTAWA, April 26th, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nThe teacher of the Garden River Anglican Day School in her annual report for the fiscal year ending March 31st, last, states as follows:\n\n\"The walls and ceiling of school building are very dirty and the windows need repairing. The fence is out of repair and the teacher's residence is in bad need of repair.\"\n\nThe teacher also requests that a door be made to allow entrance from the sitting room of the residence to the school, and states \"this would prove a blessing in winter\".\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report as to the repairs needed to school, teacher's residence and fence, and furnish an estimate of the cost of having the school room walls and ceiling cleaned, windows repaired and the necessary repairs made to the teacher's residence, the door suggested by the teacher put in, and the fence repaired.\n\nYou should furnish this information at your earliest convenience in order that if it is decided to have any work done, it can be performed during the coming summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th Ult No 13-2-5 in reference to the Garden River Anglican School. The Teacher complains about the Walls and Ceiling of the School no doubt the School and Teachers Quarters are in need of cleaning or rather Kalaminining, but I am of the opinion that the Teacher and her Husband could do a great deal to make the place look different to what it does, when Mr Hardyman was there the Anglican School and grounds was the beauty spot along the Trunk Road from the Sault to Thessalon, and he did not ask for any very great expense. The Fences were in good shape when the present Tenants took possession, The House needs Shingling and I was doing that last summer but when I got an estimate of the cost of doing the necessary repairs I knew it would not be any use to have it done then as it would cost nearly the price of a new building. In regard to the Door she wants if this were done it would spoil the building, I would not under any consideration recommend that this door be cut through, I cannot conceive what she wants a door there for, if it is not so she can have a better chance to watch her Husband who occasionally gets wrong in his mind. I admit the place wants repairing and cleaning and I estimate it would take from two to three hundred Dollars to put it in shape, I would also suggest that when the Building and place is put in repair that a new Tenant be also supplied in the person of a Qualified Teacher, I do not think that this School should be a refuge for retired English Church Clergymen or their Wives. The Scholars in this School has not had a chance to show what can be accomplished, Mr Hardyman was not a Teacher, and the present incumbent is worse, While Mrs MacNabb was teaching the Pupils showed what they could do if they had a chance there is more than English Church Catechism to be taught let the Church look after the religious instruction, and the Teacher learn them the three R's.\n\nI do feel keenly about this School and you may think I am putting it too strong when I say that Indian School matters should be taken out of the hands of the Clergy and be looked after by the Department through the Agent, then if the Agent does not do his duty replace him by a man that will, Education is what is wanted in the world today.\n\nHoping you will send me a good Qualified Teacher for this School after the Summer Holidays,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6127, File 389-5, part 2)\nOttawa, May 18, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the cleaning of the walls and ceiling of the Garden River Anglican Indian Day School and the shingling of the roof of the teacher's residence.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, the Department will be prepared to have the walls and ceiling of the school room kalsomined and cleaned but is not prepared, owing to lack of funds, in having the house re-shingled, except any temporary repairs made in order to prevent leakage.\n\nI will, therefore, be pleased if you will endeavour to obtain an estimate from a number of persons competent to do the work as to their charges for kalsomining the walls and ceiling and painting the woodwork in the interior of the school building. You should submit these prices for the consideration of the Department when you will receive further instructions regarding the carrying out of the work.\n\nAs you were advised by official letter of the 13th instant, the Department has communicated with His Lordship, Bishop Thornlee, with reference to securing another teacher to replace Mrs. Stephenson when the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

Time was when this was a model school and garden but that has passed.\n\nThe expenditure and effort under Mr. Hardyman are being lost.\n\nIt would be well to give the care of the whole lot over to some person who is physically able to look after it.\n\nBuilding - Is being occupied as a house and school. Needs renovation this summer. Walls should be tinted, wood should be repainted.\n\nTrees should be trimmed and the whole place made an example of neatness and care for the Reserve.

The School requires to be Shingled as the Roof is in bad shape. It will require about 16 Thousand shingles, I can get the Shingling done by Mr Gus Nolan of the Batchewana Band, as there are no carpenters in the Garden River Band. In regard to cutting the Door asked for by Mrs Stephenson it would spoil the School Room, I would not allow a Door to be put where she wants it.\n\nThe Fences could be repaired very easily. I will have that done myself as I can get 3 Or 4 of the boys to give me a hand at any time. As for the inside of the residence I think if there had been some Elbow Grease used hereto for the house would have been all right. I can get Mr Nolan to Kalsomine the place.\n\nAs for the windows I am continually having those windows repaired. If I am given the authority to purchase the Shingles and go ahead with said work I will have it done as Cheaply as it is possible.\n\nAwaiting your instructions,\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

You should obtain a good grade of clear cedar shingles. Before making the purchase you should obtain competitive prices from a number of dealers and purchase the quantity of shingles required from the dealer quoting the lowest price for the grade of shingles required. You should then arrange to have the work of putting on the shingles done by day labour.\n\nYou may also arrange to have the kalsomining done to the interior of the teacher's residence. You should purchase any material required after obtaining competitive prices.\n\nWhen the work is completed, you should forward properly receipted vouchers, in duplicate, covering the expenditure incurred, and you should attach a memorandum showing the firms asked to quote prices on the material required and the quotations received.\n\nThe Department will leave the matter of repairs to this building in your hands, and you should exercise close supervision over the work, and see that it is done as cheaply as possible and to your satisfaction. It is hoped that you will be able to have the work done during the present summer holidays.\n\nThe Department agrees with you that it will not be necessary to have a door cut between the school room and the teacher's residence.\n\nIt is noted that you will have the repairs required made to the fences.\n\nA.

It requires about 25 loads of filling to raise the ground around the building to allow the water to run off.\n\nThe above repairs would probably cost around $100.00. If the department wishes a more definite estimate I shall be glad to have a mason go down and look over the chimney and make a further report.\n\nMiss Johnston the teacher has also requested me, to ask the Department for eight single seats, No. 4 & 5 four of each size, as the ones the children are using are altogether too large for them.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant.\n\nActing Agent.\n\nJ.D.

You should purchase the paint and any other materials required, obtaining, if possible, competitive prices. You should see that a good grade of material is obtained. The school, sheds and outhouses should be given two coats of paint on the outside, and the interior of the schoolroom and porch one coat. The painting of the teacher's residence should also be carried out as mentioned in your detailed estimate, and all repairs as mentioned should also be completed. The Department will expect you to see that all work is carried out in a satisfactory manner.\n\nThis work should be carried out by day labour under the charge of a competent foreman, and you should keep proper time sheets of all labour employed. Should you require an advance to pay the labour, same will be sent you upon request. A supply of blank forms is enclosed herewith for the keeping of the necessary labour returns. You should see that these are signed in duplicate by the individual labourers employed and certified by yourself.\n\nIt is noted that you estimate the cost of the painting and repairs, etc., to be approximately $330, and this amount should not, if possible, be exceeded. You should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of all material.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

We are using our own linoleum in the bed rooms and halls.\n(4) To close holes in plaster around doors and windows and to fill small holes and large cracks in plaster.\n(5) The paint has fallen off the glass in most windows in both school and residence.\n(6) There is a lock on the front door of the school and the lock is broken. It must needs be a sturdy lock set for this.\n(7) One glass broken in window in girls' toilet.\n(8) The glass is broken in the cellar window and the seal is rotted so that new glass cannot be installed.\n(9) This lumber will be used for shelving, cupboards, and topping saw work in school.\n(10) For boys craft classes.\n(11) One piece of plaster has fallen off the ceiling upstairs. Would make a better job with lye rock than acid plaster.\n(12) For the four school windows, there are only two blinds and only one of them will roll. By using pulleys and such end I will have them unroll from the bottom upward.\n(13) Water barrel needed for rain water. The well water is too hard for washing or scrubbing.\n(14) For the residence, I will supply the posts and put them in myself.\n\nFor all the repairs above I will do the work if you supply the material requested.\n\n(15) See next page.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6127, File 389-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nThere will have to be a new well dug.\n\nThere is a well here and plenty of water in it which tests all right but does not taste right and when left standing overnight forms an oily scum on its surface and discolors the vessels in which it was standing. This water purely is not fit to enter the stomach. We are forced to carry drinking water for school and residence a distance of 3/4 of a mile.\n\nThe well water is so good for cooking, washing, scrubbing because it is too hard and when boiled it turns yellow.\n\nThis is a pipe well fitted with a pump. The pipe was pointed driven. It is Indiana clay, it is 14 or 16 feet deep.\n\nSome of the opinion that the well should be dug to a depth of 20 or 24 feet. By going deeper we would pass the strata of mud from where, I gather, we are now getting the water.\n\nTwo good men working for 5 days should dig the well. It should be fitted with cement tile about 24 inch diameter or large enough for a pail to enter it. Smaller tile could be used if the pump was re-installed. Some think the iron pipe should not be used but I see no reason why the pump and pipe could not be used as it is not from the pipe that we get the iron in the water.\n\nEvery school should have a good well as every child should be entitled to good drinking water.\n\nThank you for your attention,\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nOctober 16, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find Requisition received from Albert E. Smith, Teacher of the Garden River Reserve C.E. Indian Day School, for material required to make necessary repairs to the School and Residence.\n\nMr. Smith is prepared to do the work himself, provided he is supplied with the material requested.\n\nThe total cost of material required is approximately $55.55. As the repairs and improvements requested are all necessary, I recommend that the material be granted if possible.\n\nRegarding the well, everything Mr. Smith states in his enclosed letter is correct. The water from the well is not fit to wash or scrub with, nor for drinking. The previous teachers at this school have been single persons and, therefore, did not require as much water as Mr. Smith will need, as he is married and has a family. It was not such an inconvenience for them to get water from a distance. For this reason, nothing has been done about the well in the past but an effort should now be made to get more suitable water.\n\nI am of the opinion that the well should be driven deeper in an attempt to get better water. The approximate cost of material and labour to do so would be $50.00.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.P.G. Laurence\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nOctober 20, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 16th instant, you may expend an amount of $55.55 in the purchase of the materials shown on the attached list for making repairs at the Garden River C.E.

Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nDuring the two vacation months July and August it would be necessary that I obtain work in the Sault. Before seeking employment elsewhere I should like to know if your Department would consider retaining me here for July and August for the following reasons:\n\nFirst. The fence enclosing the school grounds here is in very bad shape. The wires are sagging and the posts need straightening. Some posts will have to be replaced. I could do this by getting my own cedar posts in the bush and borrowing a stretcher for the wire.\n\nSecond. The $30. which the Dept. allowed towards cleaning the grounds was well spent but the task was such a big one that there is still a great deal to be done yet, such as trimming of trees and small underbrushing. Then I want to prepare the ground all along the fence so as to be in a position to set out a hedge of cedar next spring. That is cedar along the back and ___ two sides but Locust across the front.\n\nThird. The front porch on the residence needs jacking up and the foundation replaced. The porch has sprung away from the house owing to the fact that in former years ice was allowed to gather on its roof.\n\nFourth. There are three woodsheds which all need repairs before winter sets in. The stable roof also needs some patching. Of course it has to be jacked up at one corner and plastered. I would like to whitewash the interior of the toilets and put a better urinal in the boys' toilet than the makeshift one I put in last fall.\nFifth. I had hopes of having the school building painted this summer. The walls are in a very poor condition. If that is to be done I should like to be here to see that it is well done. Before any painting could be done the whole surface would have to be gone over and loose boards nailed in place and then brushed with a stiff steel brush. I know what needs to be done and I can do it or see that it is done right. I want to take out the windows and fill in around them and putty around the glass not only the school windows but those of the residence. The windows in this building are very cold and I know the cause. I want to do as much of the inside painting as possible since I have to spend my time in the room I do not want to see a patchy job.\n\nSixth. When the school was moved four or five years ago to allow for the new highway it seems that the whole building was jacked because the walls have parted company at the corners. I have repaired the walls in three of the rooms but there is still the class-room and three rooms and the hall upstairs to do yet. I want to build a small bathroom upstairs using part of the hall-way for it. There is an old chimney upstairs which has been partly torn down. I have to finish taking it out before we can do very much fixing at the two front bedrooms. The base-board and quarter round will have to removed and plaster put in the space between walls and floor. The floors are very cold and that is the reason for it.\n\nSeventh. Two families are making additions and repairs to their homes this summer. I should like to lend them a hand. I have interested a great number of people in gardens. I would like to help them off and on. I am experimenting on the growing of sugar beets here also have a few apple and plum trees which I want to keep pruned. I can see that the Agricultural Society here is depending on me a great deal and that will take extra time this summer. I am trying to interest the young folks in softball. And I do not want our Young Peoples Club to go flat for two months.\n\nEighth. Take into consideration that the residence has seven rooms, the grounds cover almost one and a half acres and nothing has been done in the last 15 years to amount to anything until we came last fall.\nIf you wanted any information as to the work we have done here you might write to Rev.B.P.Fuller. He has been an interested spectator and a great help in our work here. If this extra work is not done this year it will spread over three or four years and I don't want to have too many outside interests next term because I will have four in the Entrance class and they will take a lot of time.\n\nBefore closing I should like to thank you for the appointment to Garden River. We all like it here very much. We like the pupils, people and the place. The agent, Mr. Laurence, has been very helpful and we appreciate it very much especially after having lived at Oka.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1943.\n\nMr. A.E. Smith, Teacher, C.E. Indian Day School,\nGarden River, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 1st instant, suggesting that payment be allowed you for the months of July and August in return for certain work that you could do on the reserve during that period. I regret that present regulations will not permit our approving this suggestion.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1943.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the teacher at the Garden River Anglican School, in which he states that the following additional improvements are required:\n\n1. Repairs to the fence enclosing the school grounds;\n2. Additional cleaning of the grounds;\n3. Repairs to the front porch on the residence;\n4. Three woodsheds need repairs, also the stable roof;\n5. Repairs to windows in order to keep out the cold;\n6. Repairs to classroom and three rooms and the hall upstairs.\n\nThe officials here feel that since Mr. Smith took charge of the school we have been reasonably generous in allowing expenditures for repairs and improvements to this building and it is rather disappointing to learn that so many additional repairs are apparently required. Mr. Smith suggested that we continue his salary for the months of July and August and that he would do a considerable amount of this work himself. However, I am advising him that present regulations do not permit such action.\nOn your next visit to the reserve you might again inspect this building and let me know what repairs you feel are urgently required at the present time. In the event of your recommending additional repairs, an estimate of the cost should be supplied.\n\nR.A.

I have gone over the buildings with Mr. Smith and find the repairs requested in his letter are needed. I estimate that $60.00 would cover the labour and $40.00 the material. If the Department approves the above work, Mr. Smith would prefer to have it done after school opens in the Autumn, as he would then be able to supervise it. Mr. Smith requests me to express his appreciation for the work already done.\n\nOn March 22nd last, I forwarded an estimate of the cost of painting both the inside and outside of this school. You advised me to bring the matter again to your attention about the first of June. Will you kindly advise me regarding this matter?\n\nR. P. G.

Marie, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 15th instant, with reference to the Garden River C.E. Day School. It is noted that the repairs mentioned in official letter of June 7 could be made for a total expenditure of $100.00 of which amount $40.00 would be for material and $60.00 for labour. The expenditure of $100.00 is authorized.\n\nAt the present time the Department is not in a position to authorize the expenditure that would be necessary for painting the exterior of the school and the inside of the classrooms. However, if our expenditures are not too heavy during the summer months, we might consider this matter early in the fall.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nGarden River, Ont.

Sept. 9, 1943,\n\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sirs,\n\nAbout this well at the school here.\n\nLast fall you gave $30 towards it. With this money we bought pipe and had two men drive the point down 24 feet. We got water but it was full of iron and oil. Then I dug and found a spring which we used all winter and well into the summer but then the spring dried up. I then tried the pump again but found that the point was broken as we got sand and silt in the water. I had a man help me raise the pipe and of course the point did not come. Then I dug again down a few feet farther in hopes that I would be lucky enough to strike another vein of water but did not succeed. We are now carrying water for half a mile.\n\nI shall, therefore, need a new point and two men for about three days to work in driving it for water. We need a pipe wrench to take the pump and pipes apart. The wrench will be kept here and will be the property of the school. I have had to buy one to replace one I borrowed and which I had taken away from me, so I am not borrowing again.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary that we have water here and good water too. Not only for the children and my own family but if the place was to take fire it would burn to the ground and there could be no insurance collected because of the lack of water.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlbert E. Smith.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nEnclosed herewith please find requisition for School Material required for the Garden River Anglican Day School.\n\nThe lumber and tools are required for the Manual training periods.\n\nThe Well point is needed for the well.\n\nKindly advise if it will be in order to hire two men for three days to work in driving the new well point for water as requested in Mr. Smith's letter attached herewith.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR.

For some time the Smiths, who occupy an upstairs apartment in the school, have been complaining of the roof leaking in a number of places. The present condition of this roof is such that further patching is of no value, as the number of leaks increases every time any weight is placed on the roof.\n\nA small addition to the school on the West side is being built by Smith. It is a closed-in porch approximately twelve feet square. I understand he is giving his labour gratis. The purpose of the porch is primarily to stop draughts, but also to provide additional space to the apartment.\n\nA price to reroof the school and the porch was obtained by Mr. Laurence from a local contractor, on a material-plus-labour basis, of $350 and I am of the opinion that approximately this amount will be required. I would recommend that authority be given to reroof this building.\n\nThis school also requires painting, but I consider that this might be done another year.\n\nW.S.

This year we will have 20 pupils which is two more than last year but the amount paid last year will be sufficient for this year.\n\nWe will serve it at the first recess so that they may have it with the vitamin biscuit.
