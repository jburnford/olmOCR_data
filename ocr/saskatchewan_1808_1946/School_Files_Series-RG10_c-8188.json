I am forwarding you the\nanswer, also certificate, which is renew-\nable should I wish to teach in New York\nState.\nI live half a mile from the school and have been staying here since I have been married, six years ago.

P.Q.\nOttawa, January 20, 1920.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th instant applying for a position as teacher upon the re-opening of the schools after the summer holidays, or about September 1st, 1920, and enclosing a certificate of your qualifications from the State of New York.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, with regard to the school at Temiskaming, to which it is presumed you refer, the Department has no knowledge at the present time that there will be a vacancy. Miss Delorme, who is at present teaching, has given no intimation that it is her intention to give up her duties. If, however, she should do so your application will receive consideration.\n\nThe Department is unable to tell you of what vacancies there may be for teachers in any of its Indian schools next September.

Mc Donald,\nAct'g Indian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 19, 1920.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant requesting to be informed on behalf of the teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School whether white children should be permitted to attend in the classroom with the Indian children and stating that there are a number of such children whose parents are anxious to have them taught English.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, provided these children will not interfere with the instruction being given the Indian children and that there is accommodation for them and the teacher will undertake the work, they may be permitted to attend. A fee at the rate of $1.00 per month for each child should be collected by you from the parents and forwarded to the Department. Books and stationery will be provided for the Indian children only. The parents of the white children who attend should provide the necessary school books and supplies for their own children.\n\nWith reference to the teacher's request mentioned in your letter of the 12th instant, to be permitted to teach on Saturdays for the remainder of the school term, in order that she may close school when the full number of school days have been taught, I beg to say that the Department cannot consent to this arrangement. It would not be fair to the children to compel them to attend school on Saturdays. The teacher should keep the school open during the regular hours only. You will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nD. A. McDonald, Esq.,\nActing Indian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nSir:\n\nEnclosed please find school report for the Temiskaming day school which I trust will be found in order.\n\nI beg also to be allowed to make a few recommendations regarding the conducting of this school which at the present time is not very satisfactory.\n\nI would suggest that the two months vacation be given in the winter instead of the summer say from the 21st of December till the first of February, and the school run continuously during the summer. A large number of the Indians of this district leave the village every fall and go into the bush for the winter, taking their families with them. This deprives the children of their education for that period and, by the time they get good and well started to school in the spring the school closes for the summer vacation and, after the school reopens they take another short course and then away for the winter.\n\nBy running the school continuously during the summer months the children would have a larger percentage of schooldays in the year and would have a much better opportunity of getting an education. There is quite a few pupils attending the school at present but they are mostly all white peoples children residing in close proximity to\nthe school.\n\nI would also recommend that some form of compulsory attendance be enforced as the Indians here are very lax in sending their children to school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nSir,\n\nOttawa, December 6, 1920.\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo enclosing your report on the Temiskaming Indian Day School for the month of November, last.\n\nRegarding your recommendation that this school be closed during the months of January and February for the annual vacation and conducted during the summer months when the Indians are back on the reserve I beg to say that the Department will approve of this being done. You may inform Miss Delorme, the teacher, that she is to take holidays during the above two months and be prepared to re-open the school on the first of March, next, and teach continuously during the summer.\n\nRegarding the white children who attend I beg to say that the Department consented to their doing so, provided they do not interfere with the instruction being given the Indian children and that there is accommodation for them and also that the teacher would undertake the work. A fee at the rate of $1.00 per month for each child was to be collected from the parents and forwarded to the Department. Books and stationery are only provided for the Indian children and the parents of the white children who attend are expected to provide the necessary school books and supplies for their own children. I should be pleased to hear whether any fees have been collected from the white parents by the late agent, the teacher or yourself and, if so, if you are aware what disposal was made of the money so collected.\n\nThe question of enforcing the regulations regarding compulsory attendance will receive consideration when the school re-opens after the first of March, next, provided the Indian parents do not see that their children attend regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Agents Office,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQue.\n\nDec. 9th, 1920\n\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 35-1-1 of the 6th inst., I beg to say that the instructions re the closing of the Indian School will be followed.\n\nRegarding the fees to be collected from the white children I may say that I have not as yet collected any myself, and I will inquire of Mr. McDonald the first time I see Him.\n\nI think that Miss Delorme collected some fees during the summer and I will inquire of her what disposition she made of them.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nAt a council meeting of the Temiskaming Band held on the 27th inst., the matter of the way in which the Temiskaming day school is conducted was discussed at some length.\n\nThere was 36 members present and 32 out of the 36 recommended a change of school teachers, as they claim the present teacher Miss Delarme is not giving the attention she should do to her duties, and they ask me to write to the Department and get them a new teacher.\n\nIt is reported to me that the teacher does not arrive at the school punctual, as she gets there any time between 9 and 10 o'clock in the forenoon, and since I have held the office of Agent the school has been closed at 3 o'clock every afternoon, and quite a few days the school teacher has not presented herself at the school house at all the children having had to return home.\n\nIt is hard to learn children to be punctual unless they are given an example by the teacher, and I believe it is required by the Department that the school be open from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m.\n\nI would also like to know if the parish priest has anything to do with the affairs of the Indian School.\n\nI advised the teacher of the Department's decision to close the school for the 2 months vacation in January & February on condition that the school be open during July and August, as per Letter No. 35-1-1 of the 6th ed. December but she informs me that she would not teach these two months.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would recommend that Miss Delarme be transferred to some other agency or that she be given to understand that the school hours are from 9 a.m. till 4 p.m. and every day as I would like to see the school brought to a higher state of efficiency.\n\nThere is also some French taught in the school which the Indians do not want as the majority of the scholars cannot read or write English yet.\n\nI regret to have to report this matter as I believe this state of affairs has been brought about by the indifference of the Agent in regard to the school. Referring to the disposition made of the fees collected from the white children, I took the matter up with Miss Delarme who promised to give me an account of the same at the end of the term, but she left without doing so.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Lewis\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, January 6, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nThe Department is informed that, at a council meeting of the Temiskaming Band, the matter of the way in which you conduct the Temiskaming Indian Day School was discussed. The Indians claim that you do not give the attention you should to your duties and request that the services of a new teacher be engaged. They state that you do not open the school punctually, arriving at the school in the morning any time between nine and ten o'clock, also that the school was closed at three o'clock every afternoon and that quite a few times you did not appear at the school-house at all and the children had to return home.\n\nThe Indians seem dissatisfied with your work and the attention you have been giving to your duties. It would, therefore, appear in the best interests of all concerned that you tender your resignation, as it will not be possible for you to render good services in future when it would appear that you have not the confidence of the Indian parents. I shall be pleased to hear from you at an early date in the matter.\n\nAuthority was granted last spring to permit the attendance of white children on payment of a fee at the rate of $1.00 per month for each child. It is understood that a portion of these fees were collected by you and I shall also be pleased to hear from you as to what disposition you made of the fees you collected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Margaret Delorme,\nLuskville,\nQue.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6110, file 333-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, January 6, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you inform the Department of the opinion arrived at by the members of the Temiskaming Band in council regarding the manner in which the day school is conducted by the present teacher, Miss Delorme, and request that the services of another teacher be engaged.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is taking this matter up with Miss Delorme and it is hoped that in the near future a decision will be arrived at regarding the continuing of her services and you will be advised in due time.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nOttawa, January 14, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to your letter of the 30th ultimo regarding the services of the teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School I beg to say that Miss Delorme, the teacher, called at the Department a few days ago regarding this matter. It has been decided to allow Miss Delorme to continue until the end of the present school year, namely,- June 30th, next, and the Department has no objection to the school re-opening as soon as the Indians have returned to the reserve.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nIndian Agents Office,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nP.Q.\n\nJanuary 24th, 1921\n\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from Miss M. Delorme of Luskville, teacher at the Temiskaming Indian day school, in which she enquires whether there are enough children for her to re-open the school on the first of February. She also informs me that the Department is anxious to have the school re-opened as soon as possible.\n\nAt the meeting of the band held at Christmas I notified the members of the Department's decision to close the school for the two months vacation in January and February, and keep it open in July and August, as per letter No. 35-1-1 of Dec. 6th, 1920, of which arrangement they were all well satisfied. Since then there have been two more families that have left for the bush and I doubt very much that were the school to re-open on the first of next month whether there would be more than 2 or 3 Indian pupils.\n\nI have advised Miss Delorme to that effect also adding that if the Department is desirous of re-opening the school with such a small attendance I have nothing to say in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam H.

Delorme, teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School, to re-open the school on the first of February, next.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, while the Department would like to see this school re-opened at the earliest date, it would be of very little use for the teacher to begin duties when only two or three children would attend. You are in the best position to judge as to when the school should re-open, taking into account the number of children that would be likely to attend, and, if you consider that it would be better to wait until the first of March, next, before the school is re-opened, this arrangement will meet with the approval of the Department. You may arrange with Miss Delorme to re-open the school as soon as a sufficient number of the Indians return and you may inform her accordingly. I shall be pleased to hear from you later as to the date on which the school re-opens.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWilliam H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nIndian Agents Office,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQue.,\nFebruary 2nd, 1921\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to letter No.35-1-1 of the 26th inst.\nI beg to inform the Dept. that Miss Delorme came up and opened the Temiskaming day school on the first of Feb., before I got back from Hunters Point, although I advised her by letter on the 19th of January that I did not think it advisable to re-open the school before the first of March. When I recommended that the school be closed for the months of Jan. and Feb., I did so in the best interest of the Indians as I did not think the available number of pupils left on the reserve warranted the expenditure of keeping the school open, and that more benefit would be derived by keeping the school open during July and August when all the Indians are at their homes.\n\nThere are now 4 Indian scholars if they all attend, and 2 or 3 white children. The teacher appears to think that the agent has no business interfering in the school affairs.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 5, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant informing the Department that Miss Delorme re-opened the Temiskaming Indian Day School at the beginning of the present month and that there is a very small attendance of Indian pupils.\n\nIn this connection I beg to say that Miss Delorme called at the Department and stated she was proceeding to Temiskaming. She was informed that the Department had no objection to her re-opening the school as soon as a sufficient number of Indian children returned, but that she was not to do so until you and herself were satisfied that there were enough children to warrant the school being re-opened. She stated that she intended visiting relatives until such time as she would re-open the school.\n\nAlthough there is a small attendance it might be as well to allow her to continue teaching, as it is understood that it is her intention to give up duties at the end of the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I regret to have to say that conditions have not improved any regarding the management of this school since I made a report concerning same on the 30th of December last.\n\nThere is altogether too much time lost by the teachers of this school, too many holidays for no apparent reason. Last winter I recommended that, in the interest of the children it would be better to take the two months vacation in January and February, and keep the school open all summer. The school was closed during January and the teacher should have stayed during July. Instead of that she closed the school on the 21st of June 9 days before the end of the month, now the children are running around forgetting what little they learnt during the Spring quarter and in the winter the majority of them will be away in the bush.\n\nRegarding Miss Delormes capabilities as a teacher I have nothing to say as I believe she is a first class teacher when she is at it, but the school is closed too many days when it should be open.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nI, Blanche Delorme, engage to teach at the North Temiskaming Indian Day School for ten months commencing the sixth day of September 1921.

September 1, 1921.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, applying for the appointment as teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School to succeed your sister.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will accept your services as teacher of this school. It is noted that you will be prepared to commence duties at that place on September 6th next. You will be allowed the same salary as your sister, namely, $600.00 per annum, which will be supplemented by the bonus provided by law. Until further notice the bonus due teachers of Indian day schools will be paid at the rate of $15.00 for each teaching month.\n\nLast year Mr. Agent Lewis recommended that the Temiskaming School be closed during the months of January and February for the annual vacation and conducted during the summer months when the Indians are back on the reserve.\n\nYour appointment as teacher at the Temiskaming Indian School is being made on the understanding that you will carry out the above arrangements.\n\nThe Department is advising Mr. Agent Lewis of your appointment and that the annual vacation will be taken during January and February next.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.

She will take charge of this school on September 6th, next.\n\nMiss Blanche Delorme's appointment is being made on the understanding that this school is to be closed during the months of January and February for the annual vacation and conducted during the summer months next year. This arrangement was recommended by you in your letter of November 30th, last.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Assistant Deputy and Secretary\n\nWilliam H.

Regarding the above matter I beg to report that there are at present 7 pupils attending school belonging to the band, 6 girls and 1 boy. This number is augmented by a number of children of Indian origin, who do not belong to the band, also 4 white children. The majority of the members of this band are new in the bush, and I am sure that after Christmas, the attendance of the members children will not average more than 3 or 4. I may also add that the Council of the band and the majority of the members are in favor of the 2 months vacation being taken in the winter time.\n\nI wish to place these facts before the Department before closing the school at the end of the month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

She was further informed that her appointment was made on the understanding that she would carry out the above arrangement.\n\nFrom the reports received, it is considered that there is not sufficient children in the vicinity of the school during the months of January and February to warrant the school being continued and that better results would be obtained by keeping the school open during the summer. The report now submitted by you confirms the Department in the above opinion, and this school is to remain closed during the months of January and February, next.\n\nIt is also noted that the Council of the Band and the majority of the members are in favour of the annual vacation being taken during the winter.\n\nIf this letter reaches you before Miss Delorme leaves for the Christmas holidays, you will be good enough to inform her of the Department's decision in the matter. Should she visit the Department during the holidays she will also be informed accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. H.

She was informed that it had been decided to keep the school closed during the above mentioned two months, unless the Indians returned from the bush and there would be a sufficient number of children to warrant the school being opened at an earlier date.\n\nMiss Delorme's address is Luskville, Que., and, when in your discretion, you consider there are sufficient children to re-open the school, you should communicate with her, and she will be prepared to return to Temiskaming and re-open the school. She would like to start work about the first of February, which would allow her to take the month of August as summer holidays, as she does not wish to teach continuously during the summer months.\n\nThis matter will be left in your hands, and if the Indians return sooner than expected, you can let Miss Delorme know so that she can start work any time in February. If, however, sufficient children do not return until the first of March, the school should not be re-opened before that date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that the teacher of the Temiskaming Indian day school, Miss Blanche Delorme, has been absent from the school since the 7th inst., for no apparent reason, and without permission. On the 6th inst., a holiday was given to the children, owing to the fact that the schoolhouse was required for a special meeting of the Temiskaming band, made necessary by a visit to North Temiskaming, of Mr. J.D. Chene, the Departmental Engineer, but the school was to open again on the 7th. Since that time however it has been closed.\n\nThis teacher's predecessor, her sister, had a fashion of closing the school whenever she thought that she needed a holiday, and the present teacher is commencing the same system. The Indians are making complaints to me daily about the school being closed for no reason, and claim it is no use sending their children to school as they don't learn anything. There are a few mild cases of influenza among the white people in the village, but not among the Indians and the village school has been open continuously.\n\nI would be pleased if the Department will advise Miss Delorme to be more diligent in the discharge of her duties, as it is apparent that she has no interest in her work, and the children are not making any progress under her tuition.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nA.F.

We understand that since that date school has not been open. The Indians are making complaints about the frequent closing of the school for no apparent reason.\n\nIt is also reported that the children are not making any progress in their studies, and that you take little or no interest in the work.\n\nThe Department has decided that it is advisable, when you have completed the present school year, that a change of teacher be made. Your services will, therefore, not be required after that time. We desire to obtain the services of a more fully qualified teacher for the important work at Temiskaming. We are informing Mr. Agent Lewis accordingly.\n\nIt is expected that during the remainder of your engagement as teacher of this school you will have the school in operation each regular teaching day, and you should not close it for any purpose without first receiving the permission of your local Indian Agent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

It is considered, in the interest of the work, that it would be advisable to obtain the services of a more fully qualified and efficient teacher at the end of the present school year.\n\nAs it would be difficult to obtain the services of another teacher at the present time, it is hoped that Miss Delorme will remain and complete the present school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I had given her the necessary instructions as to the best way to get there, also secured a suitable place for her to board.\n\nIn reference to the Long Point summer school, as there are quite a number of Indian children still attending school, I have advised Mrs. Amesse to keep the school open till the end of September, as instructed in official letter No.35-4-1 of the 13th of May last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

In connection with this school I have been requested by the teacher Miss Honan to ascertain if the Department will furnish her with an assistant during the 4 summer months of May and June, and September and October. She gives as her reason for asking for assistance that there are 5 or 6 more children that will attain school age this spring, and owing to the progress made by the pupils during the past two years, there are now too many classes for her to attend to as she desires. It is anticipated that there will be 40 scholars attending this school during the summer months and the teacher would like to have an assistant to teach standards 1 and 2.\n\nKindly advise me what to do in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H.

The attendance at this school has increased considerably since Miss Honan's appointment and I note that you anticipate an attendance of 40 during the summer months. However, before intelligent consideration can be given to this request that a second teacher be appointed, I should be pleased to learn what classroom facilities could be arranged for the extra class and if more seating accommodation will be required. You might also intimate whether or not Miss Honan or yourself could nominate a second teacher for this summer activity.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H.

During my visit she did not nor has ever made any reference to an increase in her salary. I am pleased to be able to report to the Department that Miss Honan is an excellent teacher who takes great interest in her work, and the scholars have made very marked progress since she took over this school.\n\nIf however the Department provided her with an assistant, which would necessarily reduce the work she would be called upon to perform, I consider that she has no cause to complain of her present salary, but if she would carry on alone as before, I would be pleased to recommend and think she deserves an increase.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D.

There are 24 desks each of which seats two children. The school building is large enough for the two classes without any overcrowding, but the only drawback would be in the fact that the two classes would have to be conducted in the same room, as the school-house is in one apartment. To overcome this it would be necessary to construct an addition to the school as the present building is not suitable to partition off into two rooms. In reference to the nomination of a second teacher I beg to say that there are two or three teachers here that have previously taught in Indian summer schools that would be able to undertake this work.\n\nI would consider that the best plan would be to give Miss Honan an increase in salary as recommended to the Department in my letter of the 5th inst., and let her carry on alone this year, and if the present high attendance continues, consideration could be given to the enlargement of the school building at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.T.

She will be granted an increase of $50 per annum from that date, which will make her salary at the rate of $700 per annum, payment of which will be based on the ten teaching months in the year. Besides salary, she will also receive any bonus provided by law. It is hoped that, in view of this increase, Miss Honan will undertake to carry on the work at this school without the assistance of another teacher. You will be good enough to inform her of the increase in salary allowed her from the 1st instant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H.

McLean\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to ask you if our children can go to North Temiskaming Indian day school, we have been living here 18 years when our children were small. The Indians told us to send them to the Indian school last September 2 or 3 of them kicked about the white children & had them stop going to school. I asked the teacher if she would take more children and she told me if the band paid them in she would teach them. I asked the chief of the band and they say they never had a vote to put them out. We live about 200 yards from school the children never went to any other school are advanced in English it is about 2 miles to the other schools & they teach only French. They have taken in white children that don't belong to the place still after saying they didn't want white children the chief of the Band told us to write and ask you & not bother with the Chief.\n\nThe Aggrieved Mr. Cooper\nI told me to write he can't see why our white child can't go to school as well as the other as we are far from another school. Will you kindly answer and let us know so hope the children can go to school as we have small children & no other school near.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs Pascal Carriere\nOttawa, February 12th, 1926.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant, requesting that authority be granted to permit your children to attend the Indian day school at Temiskaming.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we are requesting Mr. Agent Caza to furnish a report regarding your request. I would inform you that, at a meeting held by the Temiskaming Band, the Indians decided that white children should not be allowed to attend their school. In this connection I would point out that this Department is not responsible for the providing of educational facilities for the children of white parents. If, however, the Agent and Teacher recommend that your children be granted authority to continue their attendance, favourable consideration would be given to your request. When we have the Agent's report you will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMrs. Pascal Carrier,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQue.\nOttawa, February 12th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of September 4th, last, in which you were requested to discuss with the teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School the question of allowing the children of a white man named Pascal Carriere attend that school. The Department is now in receipt of a communication from Mrs. Carriere stating that her family have resided for a period of eighteen years within a distance of about 200 yards from the school, and that, as it is about 2 miles to the nearest white school, she wishes authority to have her children admitted to the Indian school. In this connection, it is noted that at a meeting of the Band it was decided not to accept white children into their school.\n\nPlease discuss with the teacher the matter of allowing the children of Mrs. Carriere to attend the Indian school, and make a recommendation to the Department as to whether you and the teacher would approve of their being allowed to attend or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nZ. Casa, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQue.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your communication to me per Mr. Caza, Agent at Cassel Carriere children and to submit to you the following report:\n\n1) I have no objection to their admission to the school provided the Indians have none.\n\n2) Very few Indians are in favour of my teaching them as the parents are very much disliked by the band.\n\n3) I foresee considerable friction should the Dept. grant an unconditional permit to the children.\n\n4) In my humble opinion, the best solution of the problem would be to refer it to the chief and the councilors.\n\nNorth Temiskaming\nFeb 16, 1926\nPersonally, I dislike the family very much, but consider the children's British rights to an education if their admittance could be agreeably arranged with the local authorities.\n\nHoping this is satisfactory,\n\nI remain\n\nYour Respectfully,\n\nCatherine Moran\nOttawa, February 20th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nWith further reference to the request which has been made by Mrs. Pascal Carriere for permission for her children to attend the Temiskaming Indian Day School, I have to request that you will place this matter before the Band in Council at the earliest opportunity and obtain a resolution stating definitely whether they approve of these children being granted permission to attend or not. If permission is granted by the Band, the amount of fees, if any, that would be charged for the tuition of these children should be stated in the resolution.\n\nI would point out that this Department is not responsible for the providing of educational facilities for the children of white parents, but we will be guided in the matter by the decision of the Band in Council.\n\nPlease give this matter your early attention in order that the question as to whether these children will be admitted or not can be finally decided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nZ. Casa, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming,\nQue.\nSir,\n\nIn reply to official letter of Feb. the 12th (no35-1-1) I beg to say that Mrs. Carriere is telling the truth and I see no reasons why her children should not allowed to attend the Indian School. Miss Honan the school teacher has no objection to accept them, but she does not like to do so against the will of the Indians. It is for this reason that the joint recommendation asked in official letter no 35-1-1 of Sept. 4th was not sent.\n\nThe Chief has lately accepted to school the child of a white man. I asked him how he could take upon himself the responsibility to take that child while they Band had decided not to take any and that they refused to accept Mrs. Carriere's children.\n\nHe answered, Well, I don't think Mrs. Carriere has ever asked permission. The Indians are not very serious. The movement against white children was made by Willie Peison and the Chief and I believe that the majority of the Indians would now be in favour of the Carriere children being allowed to their school and I would be pleased if the Department will give authority to that effect.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nZ Caza\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, February 24th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, with further reference to the request made by Mrs. Pascal Carriere for permission for her children to attend the Temiskaming Indian Day School. Your letter has crossed in the mail our communication of the 20th instant. It is noted that the teacher and yourself have no objection to accepting these children, but that the teacher does not like to do so against the wish of the Indians.\n\nBefore finally deciding this matter, you should carry out the instructions contained in our letter of the 20th instant, and obtain a resolution from the Band in Council at the earliest opportunity stating definitely whether they approve of these children being granted permission to attend or not. When we receive this resolution of the Band, we will then be in a position to deal with Mrs. Carriere's request.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nZ.

I beg to inform the Department that at a meeting of the Temiskaming band, the Chief and 22 members being present.\n\nOn a proposition to admit Pascal Carriere's children to ###### the Temiskaming Indian Day School, a vote was taken 12 members were against and 4 members in favour, the other members would not vote. Last year Mrs. Carriere said to somebody that she had much trouble to keep her children clean because the Indian children were lousy. Some Indians were informed of that, and it is the cause of ### all the trouble. If the vote had been secret, I have good reasons to believe that the vote would have been different.\n\nI may add that the Chief voted against the proposition.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

As a result of the vote taken, the Department cannot approve of their admission at the present time. You will be good enough to inform all parties concerned accordingly.

Last March when I had Spanish...\nInfluenza and was hanging between life and death for five days, the state of the roads made it impossible for either doctor or nurse to get here. Even my sister from Kaili bury, seventeen miles from here, could not come in.\n\nI expect that you will receive an official visit from Father Train in the near future. If you would be so kind as to discuss this matter with him, he would probably know of a position that would suit my sister and me.\n\nHoping that my resignation will not inconvenience you in the least, and thanking you for past favours,\n\nI remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nCatherine Moran.\nOttawa, May 16th, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, informing the Department that it is your intention to give up duties as teacher at the Temiskaming Indian Day School at the end of the present school year, viz. June 30th, next. In reply I beg to say that the Department regrets that you have found it necessary to discontinue teaching at this school, and your resignation is accepted from the date above mentioned.\n\nRelative to your request to obtain a position as teacher in a school nearer to railway facilities, I beg to say that at the present time we are not aware as to what vacancies there will be for teachers for the next school year. We will discuss this matter with Father Evain on the occasion of his next visit to the Department.

No mention was made in his letter as to the rate of salary you were to receive. The Department replied to Agent Gaze, approving of your appointment, with salary at the rate of $85 per teaching month, and he was requested to inform you accordingly.

Miss Provencher appears to be under a misapprehension as to the amount of salary she was to receive for her services. She states that she understood she was to be paid $90 per teaching month. In this connection I would refer you to your letter dated August 5, 1929, stating that you had received her application and that both the parish priest and yourself strongly recommended her appointment. The Department informed you in reply that approval was granted for her appointment and that the salary allowed would be at the rate of $85 per teaching month, and you were requested to inform her accordingly. In the correspondence exchanged with you there was no question raised regarding payment of salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will inform the Department whether you gave Miss Provencher to understand at any time that she was to receive salary at the rate of $90 per teaching month. The Department considers that, as she has only a third class diploma, the salary allowed her compares more than favourably with that paid teachers in neighbouring white schools having the same qualifications. You might also state if she has handed you her resignation as requested by official letter of the 30th ultimo.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

Well, I shall try to explain once more. From August to October I had an impression of $95.00. From October to Easter I had the impression of $55.00 with a big raise at the end. From Easter till now I have the impression that someone played a trick on me and I'm trying...\nto find out who it is.\n\nIf it is unsafe to accept my word as boldly as I accepted that of Mr. Caza for $5 per teaching month, I beg you write to him. I'm sure he is honest and he will tell you the truth.\n\nIf there were a mistake, I don't know why I should be made to suffer for it. I'm sure I've done my duty the year round. I refused Sebastopol School where $9 was offered me because I was already engaged to teach here for the same amount.\n\nNow I feel that you understand the impression. I believe that you are just and instead of working against me you will help me because you know now that I am right.\n\nI will discontinue teaching here simply to give someone else a chance. Otherwise I like it fine.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nEugenie Kronencker (signature)\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is possible also that Miss Provencher who has the same diploma as her friend Miss Charbonneau was expecting to get the same salary as her. Miss Charbonneau had three years experience and she had none.

I beg to inform the Department that since I am back from my last visit to Ottawa, I have met Miss Honan the school teacher. She does not seem to care very much about her position but she says that it is up to the Indians to decide if they want a nun to teach or not and if an election was held and the Indians would vote for a nun, she would resign without any hard feeling. I mentioned the fact to the Department that Miss Honan was giving a bad direction to the Indians. They have been getting here, artificial teeth, glasses, medical care, food supplies, hay for their horses and cattle, seed grain and seed potatoes, foot-wear and clothing. They have been getting all this when their white neighbours have to do without it and a large number would need it more than the Indians because they are almost starving. When the Indians are treated this way, they should be told that they are not well treated.\n\nI also met Sister Superior and she could send a Sister having a Quebec First Class Diploma and about ten years experience, her native language is English and this is important for there is very little English taught in this school.\n\nI knew it is the desire of the Department to get a teacher with a Second Class Diploma. If the one the Superior offers is not satisfactory for this year, I could ask the Superior General in Ottawa to visit the Department and make other arrangements.\n\nI informed Miss Honan that I was sending my report to the Department and that teachers were not elected by the Indians who knew very little about education. As I have already mentioned to the Department, Miss Honan has been getting her pension for many years.\n\nA.F.

The Department must have by this time my letter of the 27th inst., I find it strange on the part of Miss Honan to act as she does. The question of having the Nuns here was decided once after an understanding with the Department, with the Sisters, with the Parish Priest and Miss Honan herself who had decided to give up teaching. As the Municipalit\u00e9 of Notre Dame du Nord could not get ready in time to receive the Nuns this same year, arrangements were made for Miss Honan to teach another year and it seems that she made up her mind now to keep her position as long as possible.\n\nAs Rev. Father Lagrevel is saying, it seems that Miss Honan should not complain for she has been teaching for many years and getting her pension at the same time. I believe she is taking a risk and it is the reason why I mentioned the fact to her as I have said in my last letter.\n\nLast year the Chief came in my office in very bad humour, the teacher was just after telling his wife that the Indians should be paid in cash for what work we get them to do instead of relief. The Chief who is one of the three or four Indians who are trying to help themselves knows how hard it is to get the Indians to do any work. I had been told several times that if the Indians did not do any better the teacher was partly to blame for it but I never paid any attention to it before.\n\nIt is true that the majority of the Indians are not in favour of having a Nun to take charge of their school for the reason that their children would not get as many presents as they are getting from the teacher; this is the principle reason they are giving. I believe that Miss Honan is getting a petition signed by the Indians to be sent to the Department.\n\nRev. Father Lagrevel as well as myself is in favour of having a Nun to replace Miss Honan.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Burgess,\nFort Coulonge, Que.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just received a letter from the Indian Dept. informing me that consideration is being given to the engagement of a new man for the Indian School and they asked me to ask you to use your influence with the Dept. to prevent the engagement of the man as they had refused once before and were not satisfied with him.\n\nThe question in a nutshell is this: the Nuns are teaching a mile from the school and won't continue teaching the French School unless they get the Indian School, so it is really to help out the French people that the Agent is trying to have the man engaged. I hardly think that is fair.\nconsidering the opposition of the Indians,\nI know it is useless for me to write.\nMr. Beloe as well as all the French people here are big staunch supporters and\nthe poor Indians have no votes.\nI have given nine years' service\nand the Indians are satisfied to have\nmy services retained for the ensuing\nyear.\nHoping that you and your family\nare in the best of health and that\nI am not intruding too much on\nyour kindness.\n\nI am assured\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nC. Konan\nIndian Reserve\nNotre Dame du Nord\nQue...\nJune 5th, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of letter dated the 29th ultimo from Miss C. Honan, addressed to yourself with reference to the prospect of the engagement of a Grey Nun for the Indian school at Notre Dame du Nord, Que.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that such a proposal has been made from time to time but no such change has yet been decided upon. I may say that we are securing some further information in connection with this matter to enable the Department to determine whether such a change would be in the interests of the Indian school.\n\nYou may assure Miss Honan that the representations contained in her letter will be given every consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nHon. George Bryson,\nFort Coulonge,\nQue.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6110, file 333-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDr. McGill.\n\nFor some time, consideration has been given to a change in the teaching services in the Indian day school on Temiskaming Reserve, No. 19, located at the head of Lake Temiskaming, in the Province of Quebec. At the present time this school is taught by a lay teacher, Miss Catherine Honan, who has been in our employ for a considerable time. It is considered that it would be in the interests of the work to place the teaching services under the control of the Grey Nuns, who have offered to provide a Reverend Sister having the necessary qualifications. There is an enrolment of 45 children, and the average attendance during the last fiscal year was 30.\n\nMiss Honan, who is an elderly woman, is popular with the Indians, as she is in the habit of presenting gifts to the children. The Agent states that she has been advising the Indians they are not receiving proper treatment in the way of relief supplies and also in other matters. Both the local parish priest and Indian Agent recommend that the services of Miss Honan be dispensed with and that arrangements be made with the Grey Nuns to supply a qualified teacher.\n\nThe Chief of the Band visited the Department yesterday and protested against any change being made, as he states the Band are in favour of retaining Miss Honan's services. The Agent states that the Indians are influenced by the gifts which their children receive from the teacher, and that her advice to the Indians is undermining his influence.\n\nThe question of engaging the services of a Sister of the Grey Nuns has been deferred for two years, owing to the fact that the Order did not have proper living accommodation, but arrangements are now complete for the housing of the Order in Temiskaming. On reserves where we employ Nuns as teachers, there has been marked improvement in the work in the school, in the homes and in the cleanliness and betterment of the Indians. I have taken this matter up with the Agent, and I am of opinion that a change should be made in the teaching services and that the Order of the Grey Nuns should be requested to supply a qualified teacher for the coming school year, beginning September first, next, and should be pleased to have your instructions in the matter.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6110, file 333-1, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, June 12, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo, regarding a change in the teaching services at the Temiskaming Indian Day School for the coming academic year.\n\nThe matter of having this school placed under the charge of the Nuns has been given consideration, and it has been decided to make no change at the present time. If Miss Honan desires to continue teaching during next year, the Department will approve of her re-appointment, with salary at the same rate as she is at present receiving. You may therefore inform all interested parties accordingly. Please see Miss Honan as soon as possible and ascertain from her if she will carry on teaching duties for the next school year, beginning on or about September first, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nZ. Caza, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord,\nP. Q.\nSir,\n\nReferring to official letter No. 35-1-X informing me that the Department has decided not to make any change in the services at the Temiskaming Indian Day School for the coming year, I beg to say that this confirms the report brought here by the chief last week.\n\nAfter the conversation I had with the Department on this subject and official letter No. 35-1-X of May 27th, I am left with the impression that the facts have not been made clear to the Department, and I feel it is my duty to try and make things as clear as possible to the Department.\n\nI wish to say a word about the Chief's visit to Ottawa. The last time I visited the Department, I mentioned the fact that the Chief was anxious to go to Ottawa to discuss certain matters with the Department, and asked how it could be done, so that his expenses would be paid. I thought it would be necessary to have a meeting of the band to approve of this trip, or to delegate him to go to Ottawa. I was told by the Department that the Chief was not needed in Ottawa. Furthermore, I was told that not long before the Chief had been returned, and had to pay his own expenses, because he had made a trip to Ottawa without authority.\n\nNaturally, I brought this news to the band, who had no reason to believe that I would make a false report. I have never tried by any means to stop the Chief from going to Ottawa, and I had no reason to do so.\n\nWhen Dr. Wall visited my agency, he made a report against Chief Wabie because he had criticised the vaccination of Indians. Dr. Wall offered to report him to the Deputy Minister if he was causing any trouble but I excused the Chief, whom I thought did not know the extent of his criticism.\n\nLater on, the Chief had some trouble with Indians, and came and handed me his resignation. I encouraged the Chief, and told him to do his best and not mind the talking of others, and to remain chief of the band. I believe this proves that I have always treated the chief with kindness, and that I have nothing against him.\nOn the other hand, I very often had to soothe his nerves, for he is very nervous and excitable. He wants to rush every sick Indian to the hospital. Many times I have heard the Indians say, the Chief is going to take so-and-so to the hospital, in spite of the agent or the doctor.\n\nOn one of these occasions, Dr. Beausejour was treating a young Indian for Pneumonia. The Indians came running to me, saying this young man was dying, and that the Chief was going to send him to the hospital if I did not.\n\nI found it necessary to call Dr. Beausejour, and have him visit this young man. To his surprise, he found the patient resting comfortably. And neither he nor his father had thought of the hospital.\n\nNaturally, the attitude of the Chief leads me to believe, that possibly, he has exaggerated the feelings of the Indians; as regards a Rev. Sister teaching.\n\nThere may be one or two exceptions, one of these is George Polson, the son of a white man. His mother brought him to the reserve, later marrying a white woman, so that his son was accepted by the band. Lately, some Indians reported him to the department, even his father-in-law who has been chief of the band was telling me that by rights he should not be a member.\n\nThere would be more joy if this man was put out of the band, than if the teacher was nominated. This man is pretty wicked, and among others the Chief fears him very much.\n\nMiss Honan whose principal occupation has been to keep the good favors of the Indians, thought he was a good member to be looked after, and is treating him very well. She bought a cow for him, and placed his little girl in a convent. So that, in working for the teacher, he is working for himself. I see no other that would try and cause trouble.\n\nMiss Honan was telling me, that if the Department engaged a Nun, the Indians would not send their children to school. This pretention is ridiculous and at the same time, a challenge to the Department.\n\nWe have on this reserve, about one hundred Indians who are getting relief at the rate of $6,000.00 at least, a year. Not one family has been able to live without assistance. Would it not be ridiculous for these Indians to talk about mutiny. I am sure they do not think of that, although it would please the teacher, and everything would go on just as well without Miss Honan here.\n\nMiss Honan has in her mind that the Indians should be their own boss, and always have the right to choose their own teacher. She wants the Indians\nto be children when it is a question of work, or relief, but men when it comes to fighting her case. Miss Honan told the Priest and myself, that it was not a question of the position or the money, but she is fighting for the principal, that, the Indians have the right to choose their own teacher. I answered that I had been Indian Agent for eight years, and that the Department had never asked me to consult the band for the nomination of the teacher, but had always asked for a recommendation from the Parish Priest, or Missionary. I was not asked this time either, but thought it would be more charitable to see Miss Honan. Seeing that she does not need the position or the money, and that she has to make a false declaration every time she endorses her superannuation check, as she has to certify that she has not been teaching since receiving her pension.\n\nI am under the impression that she is exposing herself to some trouble.\n\nAs I stated before, when in Ottawa, I mentioned the fact that the Chief wished to go to Ottawa, and it was not approved by the Department. I wish to add, that not very long before this trip, at a meeting of the Temiskaming Band, he urged the Indians to send him to Ottawa to discuss certain matters with the Department. But not one showed himself in favor of his going. So that his trip was made without any authority whatever. And it was a surprise to many, when on his return he mentioned the fact that his expenses had been paid. As far as the teacher is concerned it would only been a matter of a few hours to call a meeting of the band to approve of his trip if they were in favor of it.\n\nAs the Rev. Father Lagrevel informed me he would visit the Department shortly, I thought I had better wait before announcing the decision of the Department to Miss Honan.\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, June 23, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, regarding a change in teaching services at the Temiskaming Indian Day School for the coming academic year. In reply I have to inform you that the Department is not prepared to make any change in the existing arrangements at the present time, and you should inform Miss Henan in accordance with the decision contained in official letter to you of the 12th instant. I may add that the visit of Chief Wabie had no bearing on the decision to carry on the existing arrangements for teaching services at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L.

They compelled poor half-clad Indian children to attend church a mile away from their homes on days that a dog shouldn't be put out, and the children came home often with marks on them from blows given by the teacher. And if there will be a change in a teacher we would like very much to get a normal trained teacher of mature years or one with a widowed mother who could live with her. I would appreciate it very much if the answer to this letter be sent to me, as so far I have never seen an answer to a letter of mine.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Sister Jean, of the Grey Nuns, is doing real good work with the Indians, and has had also successful results with Indian women, whom she has been receiving on Saturdays, training them in sewing, remodelling old clothing. Such missionary work is doing a lot of good and brings about better understanding of what the Department is doing for the Indians.

Our extended experience as iron founders for over thirty years enables us to surpass all competitors in the quality and finish of our castings; they are a special feature in our desks.\n\nWoods, as generally furnished, are Ash, rubbed and varnished; other woods, such as Ash and Walnut, Cherry and Maple, can be furnished if required, at extra prices. They are attached to irons by a tongued and grooved joint in addition to screws\u2014the strongest fastening known.\n\nThe Backs and Seats have solid glued and dove-tailed joints, making them as strong as if cut out of one piece of wood, and are properly curved to enforce a correct position on the part of the pupil.\n\nSeats fold, to permit of sweeping between.

To my knowledge, Mr. McCarragher was quite faithful in conducting the class and no serious complaint had been made against him. Nevertheless, since his departure complaints have been made and reasons have been alleged why the parents did not send their children to school. It is certain that the school was poorly attended out of from 40 to 50 children of school age one could hardly find more than 10 or 15 who went there. Our Indians, who had this school conducted by the sisters some years ago, and who remember and still see the good, that they derived from them desire to have the sisters again and\nand, with this object, they have earnestly asked your honour the favour of using part of the money that they have on deposit in Ottawa, to build a house for these men, who, at the same time, would attend to their sick and would be able, for that purpose, to keep two or three beds at their disposal. This would be by far the best use the Indians could make of their money for the future of their children.\n\n(Sgd) Isidore Evans O.M.S.\nMissionary\nOTTAWA, 2nd May, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Father Ewaim, missionary at North Temiscamingue, asks that permission be given the Indians to use a portion of their funds to build a house for the accommodation of the nuns who are to take charge of their school, and which would also furnish accommodation for a certain number of sick Indians.\n\nThe question of building a hospital at N. Temiscamingue was before the Department last when year, when it was decided that it could not see its way clear to sanction the necessary expenditure. The nuns are now to be placed in charge of the school and they want a home.\n\nThe Temiscamingue Indians have about $14,000.00 to their credit and it would take about $1,000.00 to put up a suitable building. A Resolution for this purpose was passed by the Band in April 1903 and the same reasons for not giving it now hold good as were in force then.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Two of these are attending to the household affairs of the Church, one is expected to come in as teacher for the reserve and one as a nurse for the Indians and adjoining settlers. The Band is very desirous of making this grant.\n\nThe Chief after conversation with yourself is inclined to think that the Band would recognize that for it as a municipal organization to make a grant in this way might be injudicious.\n\nBut a residence for a teacher is an urgent necessity and the Chief submits that the Band should put up a teacher's residence to be owned by itself, which, so far as it conveniently can, may be used by the nun who is going to assume the duties of school teacher and any associates of hers that may choose to occupy it with her.\n\nHe considers, however, that it should be clearly understood that this house is for the purposes of a school teacher and for any such school teacher as may from time to time be appointed.\n\nHe feels sure of the concurrence of the Band in this project.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Supt.

The policy of the Department is to furnish quarters for school teachers in districts where it is difficult for them to obtain proper accommodation.

Pontiac, P.Q., 25 November 1904\n\nTo the Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMr. John King chief of the Indians of North Temiscamingue Reserve tells me that at the request of the Indians of this Reserve you have consented to build a convent for the nuns teaching Indian children here and that you ask me to draw a plan for this projected convent. Therefore, at the request of the chief, send you, here enclosed, a combined plan of a school and convent. The actual school is an old building which need to be removed besides having the inconvenience of being situated on low land, far away from the projected convent, which must necessarily be built close to the church and would be in a more central place for all Indian children if it was built near the church. For all these reasons I thought it was better to include the school in the convent building.\n\nYou will see also that I have provided for two class rooms in the convent. The nuns tell me that\njust now the daily average attendance at the school is from 35 to 40 children and that they expect to have an average attendance of 50 children in the spring when all the Indians will be back from the bush. You understand that 50 children in one class is rather too much for one class. The number of children might yet increase later on.\n\nMoreover we are going to organize a School Municipality here for white people and, if possible, would like to unite with Indian Department to have only one school for white and Indian children which would be far cheaper and better for both parties.\n\nI wish therefore to know if the Department could not grant us a certain return of money, and with that money and money voted by the school Municipality of North Temiscamingue or subscription made amongst white people we would build the school and conduct according to the included plan or any plan suggested by the Department; at the conditions however that if later on the school was not found satisfactory to Indians and that Indians for good reason were willing to have a separate school for themselves we would guarantee to refund all the money voted by the Indian Department for the school and cement which would remain then the property of the School Municipality of North Temiscamingue.\nThus the money granted by the Department would be well secured and we could have a first class school which would be all at the advantage of young Indian children who can but gain to be in contact with white children. Another advantage would be to have two classes in the same school which would permit to divide children according to their capacities and give them consequently a better chance to make good progress.\n\nI hope therefore that these propositions will be acceptable to the Department so much the more as Indians are in favor of it.\n\nI am just here mentioning an idea which might be modified more or less later on. I would like to know what are the intentions of the Department regarding this important matter. A thing that is certain is that Indians are well satisfied with the nuns and that since the nuns are in charge of the school the children have attended the school most regularly and have made greater progress than ever since the school exist here.\n\nIt is urgently desired that this state of affairs continue and for that we must provide a home for the teaching nuns.\n\nHoping that you will take this affair into serious consideration and that I will have the pleasure to hear soon from you.\n\nI remain Your most sincerely,\n\nA.

Father Laniel of North Temiscamingue submits plans of a projected school and convent to be erected at that place. The Department has declined to accede to the wishes of the Indians to grant $1000.00 from their capital funds for building a nunnery on their reserve, but Mr Agent Burwash was informed that if the application took the form of a suitable residence for the teacher, it might be considered. The plan submitted provides for two new class-rooms in the convent building. You will see that it is the intention of the nuns to take white pupils and have a graded school. The last quarterly return showed an enrollment of 49 Indians with an average attendance of 22. It would be no disadvantage to the Indians to mingle with the white pupils and having two class-rooms would also be for their benefit.\n\nFather Laniel states that if the proposed school is found unsatisfactory to the Indians, the Church would guarantee to refund all the money contributed by the Band towards this building, which will be the property of the proposed School Municipality of N.

The settlers at that school section on both side of the river are presently few; the pupils of the tribe are the big majority. Nevertheless, the contribution would be equal; the public interest of the place would require a building of a value of about $4000. Such a plan has to provide for the lodgment of the teachers and for two separate classes for the elementary and for the superior teaching. The share required from the tribe would be $2000. for the building, the present annual salary of the teacher after the teaching.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The settlers would contribute the other $200.00 for the building, the other half of the cost for the entertaining of the school and a mensual rate of taxation according to the number of their pupils.\n\nIf the number of the Indian pupils show an increase over the actual number, an extra contribution for each new pupil based on the actual average cost of each pupil, would be called upon.\n\nShould a disagreement occur between the two parties in the proposed contract and the grievances after an attempt be found sufficient for its annulment, the trustees for the settlers' school section would return the money contributed by the tribe for the building of the school and the purchase of the ground.\n\nThe Council of administration for the execution of the contract would be represented by the chief of the Council of the tribe, and by the president of the trustees for the settlers and would be presided by the Superior Oblate Father.\n\nPraying you to take this proposed agreement into your consideration and to recommend it to the Council of the tribe.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6110, file 333-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 19th December, 1904\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr Bourbonnais, M.P., writes on behalf of the settlers of North Temiscamingue who are anxious to have a combined school for Indian and white children to be placed under the charge of the nuns who are now teaching there. If the Department approves of this scheme, it would be necessary to have new school quarters as the present building, which is only 18 by 20 ft., is too small to accommodate all the Indian children who should attend. The return for Sept. quarter shows an enrollment of 49 children with an average attendance of 38, which must have overtaxed the seating capacity of the school. The proposition submitted by Mr Bourbonnais calls for a contribution of $2000.00 from the Temiscamingue Band, which is double the amount asked by the priest for this purpose. The Band voted $1000.00 for a suitable dwelling for their teacher and this is quite as much as their funds will stand. They have not voted this money as a contribution to a nunnery, or a combined schoolhouse and residence for the nuns, and if such a building is put up, the present schoolhouse will be left on their hands.\n\nThe $300.00 already contributed by the Government towards the salary of a teacher should be sufficient if there was a combined school as the white settlers should make up the difference. As a usual\nthing the Indians are not in favor of having their children educated at white schools or in conjunction with whites, and they have not so far intimated their desire to do so in this case. I see no objection to the children being educated together, but a joint ownership of the building would likely cause trouble, as the Indians would contribute most of the money and have the least to say in its management.\n\nAs the matter now stands, the proposition before the Department is for the Indians to take $1000.00 from their capital, which is only about $13,000.00 for the erection of a teacher's residence. The Department votes $300.00 for a salary and the Indians pay for the maintenance of the school. It seems to me that this proposition is more in the interests of the Church and the white settlers than the Indians.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nChurch should be asked to be liberal. It is advised that the proposition be forwarded to the Provincial Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th instant submitting a proposition from the settlers of North Temiscamingue to have a combined school for Indian and white children under the charge of the nuns who are now teaching there; and in reply I beg to say that the scheme proposed is one which cannot at present be favorably considered by the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nA.

The capital funds of this band amounted to $14,512 on June 30, last.\n\nLast year the resident missionary applied for a grant of $1,000 from the Band's funds for the erection of a teacher's residence, to be expended by the Oblate Fathers, on the condition that they build a suitable residence for the nuns who are now teaching the Indian children upon the reserve. This application was not approved of by the Department, and they have put it in this form, apparently to overcome the difficulty.\n\nI think before dealing with this matter the Agent should be asked to describe the kind of building proposed to be erected, with a rough estimate of the cost.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This estimate is for a balloon frame, for I do not care for a log building as tamarack or spruce logs after being flattened and while drying will crack clear through to the centre from each side sufficient to let the wind pass through.\n\nI would suggest for the outside of building that there be one ply of rough lumber then felt paper and then clapboarded; for the inside one ply of rough lumber then felt paper again then dressed lumber.

The work is well done and the material supplied fair with a few exceptions.\n\nThe drop siding is rather rough and knotty some which are dead and showing through the paint. The interior has been oiled one coat instead of being painted three coats of lead and oil as specified. It will be necessary to give the interior walls two additional coats of oil to satisfactorily complete and this should be done during the Easter holidays to prevent interference with the school which is now open.\n\nA small portable platform for teachers' use has been put in instead of the stationary one extending entirely across the room as shown on the plan, as the teacher preferred the smaller one.\n\nThe porch entrance, and steps leading thereto, are of rough planking instead of matched flooring which, however, answers the purpose equally as well and the difference in cost is immaterial.\n\nThe W.Cs. erected in rear of the school are substantially built and the price charged is reasonable. The school lot should be fenced also a division fence put up dividing the ward so as to separate the entrance to W.Cs. as both are built under one roof, the doors being within\na few feet of each other without any screen or divided approach to the entrance.\n\nThe school required six additional seats, five ordinary and one back seat only, one dozen ink wells for the desks now in use and a globe for illustrating the maps, etc.\n\nThe Agent informed me that the necessary papers assigning the occupants rights and improvements made on the school site to the Department had been signed and forwarded some months ago and as these have apparently miscarried other papers will be executed if sent to the Agent.\n\nI would recommend that the Contractor be paid the amount of his contract and extra for the W.Cs., less one hundred dollars to be retained until the completion of the oiling of interior walls and ceilings, when the balance should be paid him.\n\nArchitect.\n\nFeb 11th\n\nIndian Affairs.

If the exterior only is painted it would cost, together with the little repairs that are needed to the woodwork, about $50.00. If the interior is painted as well it would cost around $80.00 or $95.00, but tenders could be called from the members of the band, and maybe it could be done cheaper. As the surface to be covered is quite a size, the cost of the paint would be the biggest item.\n\nThere also needs to be provided 6 new window blinds, as these in use have done service since the schoolhouse was erected, and are now in a dilapidated condition.\n\nKindly advise me if the Department would authorize any expenditure for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H.

I regret to say that this work cost $13.00 more than my estimate of $85.00; this was caused by my underestimation of the amount of materials that would be needed also to there being considerable repainting needed on the windows. A considerable time has elapsed since this schoolhouse was painted; it took a good deal more paint than I had expected.\n\nThe interior was painted a pale green color, trimmed white, the exterior white, trimmed dark green, and the foundation sheeting from the ground about 3 feet up dark brown.\n\nI had some difficulty getting tenders for this material, as there was not much in stock in the local stores, and I preferred to purchase locally for the reason that I could get it as required, and not have any left over after the work was completed.

(RG 10, Volume 6110, file 333-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, November 24, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 22nd instant, I have to say that you may incur an expenditure not exceeding the sum of $5 in the purchase of supplies for a treat at Christmas to the pupils of each of the Indian day schools in the Temiskaming Agency, viz., Temiskaming, Brennan Lake, Hunter's Point and Long Point.\n\nAfter the purchase has been made, you should forward an itemized account, in triplicate, covering the expenditure incurred for each of the above schools separately.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nZ. Caze, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNotre Dame du Nord,\nP.Q.\nSir:\n\nI inspected the North Temiskaming agency on the 7th-9th instant and beg to submit the following report.\n\nI visited the Timiskaming Day School and found conditions very satisfactory. The average attendance is 30 with 40 pupils on the roll. The teacher has excellent discipline in the classroom. The pupils look robust and tidy. They are given Cod Liver Oil daily during the winter months and have all been vaccinated. The agent reports that very good progress is being made by the pupils at this school.\n\nThe school buildings are in good repair with the exception of the closets. The boys' and girls' closets are in the same small building, separated only by a single board partition. I found the boys' side in a filthy unsanitary condition, a menace to health. There should be a new closet built with two seats and placed on another location at some distance from the other for the girls' use. I recommend that this be done. The present arrangement is not good.\n\nThos. McGookin.\nInspector.\nOttawa, November 28, 1932.\n\nSir:\n\nMr. Inspector McGookin, in a report on his recent visit to the Temiskaming Indian Day School, has drawn attention to the condition of the boys' and girls' closets. He states these closets are in the same building, separated only by a single board petition, and that the boys' side is in a filthy, unsanitary condition.\n\nIf weather conditions permit, you should have these toilets cleaned and placed in a sanitary condition. You should have this work carried out as soon as possible, forwarding an account, in triplicate, properly certified, covering the cost, which should be kept as low as possible. It may be possible for you to arrange to have Indians on the relief list do this work without expense to the Department.\n\nThe Inspector has recommended that two separate toilets be built next Spring, on another site, one for the boys and one for the girls. You might draw this matter to the attention of the Department early next Spring, stating the type of toilet you would recommend be erected and the approximate cost of the material and labour. We will have no funds this year to build new toilets.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nZ.

General Manager.\nNotre Dame du Nord Que, Aug, 24,1935\n\nSir\n\nI beg to inform the Department that a new roof is needed to the school house of the Temiskaming band. This was made nearly thirty years ago and is getting in a pretty bad condition. I believed it could be repaired in the few places that it leaks but the shingle is getting so bad that it would not be safe to leave it another year.\n\nI have seen Mr. A. Robert, a contractor who has the contract to put a roof on a school that is being built here at Notre Dame du Nord.\n\nMr. Robert would be willing to put a roof of sheet iron (tole economie) on the Indian school house for $152.30. This would be put over the shingle, that would be according to Mr. Robert a protection for the sheet iron.\n\nMuch of this sheet iron is used around here for roofing and gives good satisfaction. I would be pleased to know if the Department will give authority to this expenditure.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.F. MacKenzie Esq.\nSecretary.\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may arrange to have the roof repaired, keeping the cost as low as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nZ.

Please communicate with the freight agent at that point and have him notify you when the desks arrive. You should then arrange to accept delivery and have the desks placed in the school.\n\nIt has also been decided to allow the sum of $6.00 a month for the period November 1st, 1935, to March 31st, 1936, in order that a midday lunch may be served to the pupils of the Temiskaming Day School.

Before accepting the shipment from the Railroad Company it is your duty to assure yourself that all articles enumerated on the bill of lading are included in the shipment and in good condition. To protect yourself against loss or damage in transit, check the shipment carefully with your bill of lading, noting the number of crates or packages and their contents. Any parts broken by the Railroad Company will be duplicated free of charge by us on the following conditions only:\n\nFirst\u2014The consignee must not give the Railroad Company a clear receipt for the complete shipment if there is any shortage, breakage or damage of any kind. In the event there is any shortage, or if any part of the shipment is damaged, the consignee can give a receipt for the goods if the railroad agent will make a notation on the freight bill indicating the amount of the shortage or the extent and the nature of the damage. This freight bill must be mailed to us.\n\nIf the breakage or damage is concealed and not discovered until the goods are unpacked, notify the Agent of the Railroad Company by letter or telephone to call immediately and examine the shipment. The carrier is equally responsible for \"Concealed Damage\" as for visible damage and when notified as suggested it places the burden of proof upon the carrier. When you have given the Railroad Company notice in the manner suggested, mail us your bill of lading and paid freight bill.\n\nSecond\u2014When there is shortage, breakage or damage in an express shipment, request your Express Agent to furnish you receipt showing the condition in which the shipment was delivered to you.\n\nThird\u2014When you report shortage or breakage to us, enumerate fully and describe clearly the parts you desire replaced. In ordering standards for School Desks specify size and whether right or left, which is always determined as you sit at the desk. It is well to supplement your order by mentioning the pattern mark, as will find on the inside of several styles of desks; be sure to specify the style for which the parts are desired, particularly if wooden parts are being ordered. Care in making your order clear and complete will permit us to give you immediate service.\n\nFourth\u2014All claims for shortage, breakage or damage must be made within Thirty Days and you must provide us with the necessary papers to enable us to file claim against the Railroad or Express Company, as explained in Paragraphs No. 1 and No. 2. Otherwise claim will not be allowed.\n\nFifth\u2014We are not responsible for parts broken through carelessness of drayman hauling the goods or your workmen in assembling and installing.\n\nSTORAGE\n\nThe desks manufactured under this contract were constructed from thoroughly air seasoned and properly kiln-dried material and were in perfect condition when shipment left our factory. This does not mean that parts will remain perfect regardless of local atmospheric conditions. Under no condition store this furniture even temporarily in a damp room or basement nor in a partly completed structure where building material, such as plaster, calcimine, paint, etc., may be thrown over the crates. Store in a dry, well ventilated room of normal uniform temperature. The crates containing woods should rest on their ends and all crates and boxes be elevated above floor a few inches to allow free air circulation under and around them.\n\nCLEANING AND POLISHING\n\nDo not attempt to clean or polish the woodwork with linseed oil, turpentine, undiluted benzine, gasoline, alcohol, or anything of that kind. These materials are varnish solvents which soften the varnish and spoil the finish; nor do we recommend any one of the many furniture polishes on the market. The following is a very good cleaner and polish, the constituents of which can usually be obtained in any paint or drug store for a few cents:\n\nRubbing Oil.\n8 parts BOILING WATER.\n1 part Benzine.\nMix thoroughly before using.\n\nMoisten a rag with this solution, apply sparingly to the surface and immediately rub dry with a clean dry cloth. Cheesecloth is recommended. The most effective result is obtained through the rubbing, not through excessive use of the solution.\n\nN. B.\u2014We maintain a SERVICE DEPARTMENT for the purpose of giving our customers all possible information and rendering any service to insure the proper installation and care of our products. If you have any difficulty in the installation and desire further information, your request will receive immediate attention. In writing please refer to the order number you will find stamped on the invoice and other papers.\n\nGlobe Furniture Company Limited\nWaterloo, Ontario\n\nForm 218-5m-M.P.C.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The children are clean and neat in appearance. Due to army clothing being received, the teacher has, more than ever, tried to show the pupils how to make good use of all those things by making them over. No sewing machine is available except an old one which was borrowed two or three times from an Indian family. I recommend that one sewing machine be supplied to the teacher and kept in teacher's quarters, so that instructions can be given in making over old clothing received, to pupils and parents.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nAugust 3, 1948\n\nFile No. 35-1-5\n\nTo The Department's Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Temiskaming Indian Day School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 12-415\n\nSHIP TO: The Teacher, Temiskaming Indian Day School, New Liskeard, Ont.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\nNOTE.\u2014Requisition for non-consumable equipment, state if New Issue or Replacement.\n\n\"consumable equipment and supplies use columns 1 and 2.\"\n\n| Quantity | Quantity on hand (1) | Quantity per month (2) | Unit Price | TOTAL |\n|----------|---------------------|------------------------|------------|-------|\n| 1        |                     |                        |            |       |\n\n1 Singer sewing machine No. 187-S-8, mission finish.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

Moreover, it is much too narrow and I do not think we could use it as school room next winter.\n\nI did not report on it lately because Mr. Thibault, former inspector of reserves, for the Province of Quebec, had told me that the Department was aware of the present conditions and that it was first on the list to be reconstructed after the war.\n\nRobert Lamorte - Indian Agent.\nOttawa, November 20, 1946.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have received your report of October 26 concerning the Temiskaming Indian Day School.

Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the Contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classify the work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the Contractor shall fail so to do or fail at any time to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour wages according to the rates set forth in the schedule or fixed thereafter by the Minister of Labour hereunder regarding over-time and classification, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister of Finance and the Receiver General to levy and deduct the amount thereof from any money owing by the Government to the Contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the Contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the Contractor, and the Contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid.\n\n(3) For the protection of the workmen employed, the Contractor shall post and keep posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the contract is being executed, occupied or frequented by the workmen, the Schedule inserted in this contract, also the preceding paragraph (2) and any decision of the Minister of Labour made thereafter.\n\n(4) The Contractor shall keep proper books and records showing the names, trades, addresses of all workmen in his employ and the wages paid to each for time worked by such workmen, and the manner or documents containing such records shall be open for inspection by the Fair Wage Officers of the Government at any time it may be convenient to the Minister of Labour to have the same inspected.\n\n(5) The Contractor shall not be entitled to payment of any money which would otherwise be payable under the terms of the contract in respect of work and labour performed in the execution of the contract unless and until he shall have filed with the Minister in support of his claim for payment a statement attested by statutory declaration, showing: (1) the rates of wages and hours of labour of the various classes of workmen employed in the execution of the contract; (2) whether any wages in respect of the said work and labour remain in arrear; and (3) that all the labour conditions of the contract have been duly complied with; nor in the event of notice from the Minister of Labour of claims for wages, until the same are adjusted. The Contractor shall be liable to such notice from the Minister for further detailed information and evidence as the Minister may deem necessary in order to satisfy him that the conditions herein contained to secure the payment of fair wages have been complied with, and that the workmen so employed as aforesaid upon the portion of the work in respect of which payment is demanded have been paid in full.\n\n(6) In case of default being made in payment of any money owing in respect of wages of any workmen employed on the said work and if a claim therefor is filed in the office of the Minister and proof thereof satisfactory to the Minister is furnished, the said Minister may deduct such claim out of the money, at any time payable to His Majesty under said contract and the amounts so paid shall be deemed payment due to the Contractor.\n\n(7) These conditions shall extend and apply to moneys payable for the use or hire of horses or teams, and the persons entitled to payment for the use or hire of horses or teams shall have the like rights in respect of moneys so owing them as the workmen have in respect of wages.\n\n(8) With a view to the avoidance of any abuses which might arise from the subletting of contracts it shall be understood that subletting, other than in cases such as may be customary in the trade, without the consent of the Minister, unless the approval of the Minister is obtained; subcontractors shall be bound in all cases to comply with the conditions of the main contract, and the main contractor shall be held responsible for strict adherence to all contract conditions on the part of subcontractor; the contract shall not, nor shall any portion thereof be transferred without the written consent of the Minister; no portion of the work to be performed shall be done at the homes of the workmen.\n\n(9) All workmen employed upon the work comprehended in and to be executed pursuant to the said contract shall be residents of Canada, unless the Minister is of opinion that Canadian labour is not available or that other special circumstances exist which render it contrary to the public interest to enforce this provision.\n\nA.

The Contractor gave the contract to a man who own a bull dozer for the excavation of the school cellar, unfortunately he nearly lost the bull dozer in the mud, consequently on account of the late season I was forced to choose another site, 700 feet from the first site on the same side which was found solid.\n\nOn account of that change the Department will have to face the expenses for the work done by the bull dozer on the first site, which represent an amount of $50.00.\n\nJ.R.

No. [illegible] you say in reply to my letter of the 25th ultimo, that I asked the Department to contribute $100.00 from the capital funds of the North Temiscamingue Indians in order to assist in building a convent in the reserve here. I must tell you that I was much surprised in reading that answer since, in so far as I recollect, I did not mention a word of what you say in your reply to my letter. What I said is this: Mr. John King has informed me that the Department was willing to build a convent for the teaching nun. I have since seen Mr. John King, chief of the reserve, and shown him your letter. He then told me I authorize you to make use of my name to say that the Indians in one of their meetings had decided to grant $100.00 out of their capital funds to help in erecting a convent on the reserve for the teaching nun. This resolution of the Indians was sent down to the Department and that not being able to have any satisfactory answer from the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6111, file 333-8, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nNorth Temiscamingue,\n\nHe then went down to Ottawa where he met Mr. Frank Reddley in presence of Mr. Adam Burwash, Indian agent, here.\n\nIt is then that Mr. Reddley said to the chief that the Department could not make a grant as asked for by the Indians but that the Department would build a residence for the teacher at the condition that the building would be the property of the Department. Mr. John King then answered that this was all right and he came back under the impression that it was the intention of the Department to build the convent. These are the facts as told me by the chief.\n\nNow in my first letter I made to the Department some propositions which I thought, and even think now, were for the greatest advantage of Indian children. The chief here approved also my plans but you say that the Department is not favorable to these propositions; for what reason? I do not know. But I do not insist on these propositions, although I would like to come to some understanding with the Department to that effect, if it were possible at all. What I wish to insist upon and what the Indians intend to insist upon is that a suitable residence should be built for the teachers.\n\nThe Indians have asked to have the nuns to teach their children here. They are well satisfied with the nuns and are ready to do their utmost to keep them and for that\nNorth Temiscamingue,\n\nThey want that they should be built for they cannot keep the mine unless they give them a residence.\n\nI therefore would like to know what is the intention of the Department in this regard. The Department is telling Indians funds to dispose of it for their greatest advantage. What better use could be made of these funds than to promote the education and instruction of Indian children?\n\nIn waiting for an answer I remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.

It should be as near to the road and the school as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

This is the proposition which was submitted by the missionary and Mr Bourbonnais, M.P., who were informed that it could not be favorably considered by the Department at present.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers wish to build a convent in which they will make provision for two class rooms using this $1000 for the purpose, as well as such funds as they can collect from the white settlers and carry on a joint school for the education of white and Indian children. The Indians have apparently been talked into giving their consent to this scheme which as I before stated, is more in the interests of the Church and the white settlers than the Indians.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Temiscamingue, P.Q.\nNorth Temiscamingue, 3rd February 1905\n\nTo the Secretary Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have received your letter of the 27th December No. 152209\u2014-5 for which I thank you very much.\n\nIn reply I must tell you that for the present time the Sisters are teaching the Indian children in this reserve. The Indians are well pleased with them and intend to keep them. It was for this purpose that they voted the sum of $100.00 from their capital funds in order to help in erecting here a residence for the Sisters. They did not need a residence for any other teacher nor did they intend to vote any sum of money for a residence for any other teacher but the Sisters. Now they understand very well that the sum of $100.00 will not be sufficient for erecting a suitable residence for the Sisters and for this reason they have passed a resolution in their last council, every one present being in favor of the resolution, to the effect that the $100.00 be given to the Oblate Fathers who would bind themselves to furnish the additional sum of\nNorth Temiscamingue,\n\nmoney necessary for putting up the residence for the Sister who would then be the owner of the residence but with the obligation of refunding the $1000 if further in the Sister was not required any more as teacher of the Indian schools. Thus, as you see, the Indians would be supplying a suitable residence for the Sister as long as they will teach their children and if later in the service of the Sister were not required any more they would have back their money and could keep it or build a residence for another teacher. This agreement is all at the advantage of the Indians and I am not surprised to see that they are all in favor of it.\n\nNow, as we would need to prepare this winter for building, I would like to know what should be done to put to effect this resolution of the Indians of North Temiscamingue. If you could draw a deed and send it to me I would be ready to sign it as I am authorized to do so.\n\nA quick answer would oblige very much.\n\nYour truly,\nA. Daniel\n\nIndian Affairs.

Our reason for accepting the offer of the Oblate Fathers was on the condition that in the event of the Sisters ceasing to be teachers for our children or other dissatisfaction on the part of the majority of the Band. The said sum of $1000 be refunded to the funds of the Band. We considered that we were safe in accepting the agreement from the Oblate Fathers as we run no risk of losing our money or the value of it, whereas if we expended the same money on a residence for any teachers they might choose.\nTheir own residence.\n\nOur resolution may be wanting in something, please let us know so that we may amend the resolution and obtain our earnest desire, the Oblate Fathers are willing to furnish the additional means of erecting a suitable residence for the Sisters.\n\nYou may not have full explanations or I venture to give them.

In reply I beg to say that the Department still adheres to its decision regarding the manner in which this money is to be expended.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

This house is 13' x 16' and is built of squared logs with mortised corners, and is a solid building. After it would be moved it would require some renovating on the interior, which would cost about $35.00, making a total of $135.00. With this outlay a first class house would be provided for the teacher.\n\nI am of the opinion that it would be better to purchase this house than to rent it, as the present location of the house is not very satisfactory, and if it was moved close to the school it would be much more suitable, and in a short time the rent would amount to the total cost of the house.\n\nKindly advise me what to do in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.H.

The Department will pay the owner the sum of $75.00 to cover the cost of the house, and will pay the sum of $25.00 to have the same moved onto the school grounds and a new foundation put under it.\n\nIt is noted that some renovating will be required to the interior, and the Department will approve of an expenditure not exceeding approximately $35.00 to have this work done.\n\nIt is presumed that there is sufficient space on the school grounds for the house, and that, by purchasing the same and having it moved there, it will be more satisfactory than paying rent.\n\nYou should forward a certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the amount to be paid the owner for the house, and, when it has been moved to the school grounds and the interior fitted up, you should also forward a properly certified voucher, in duplicate, covering the cost of this work.\n\nThis matter should receive your immediate attention in order that this house will be ready for occupation by the teacher when the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.\n\nIt will, no doubt, be necessary to purchase a small quantity of furniture, a stove, etc., and I shall be pleased if you will furnish a list of the supplies of this nature which you consider necessary for the use of the teacher, and, if possible, an estimate of the cost of the same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nFather Ewain, when in Ottawa today, strongly urged that an addition be provided for the teacher's residence at the Temiskaming Day School.\n\nOct-6/22\n\nR.J.F.\nNorth Temiskaming\nOct. 3, 1922\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the school supplies shipped by Dom Express on Sept. 16 have not yet reached New Liskeard and I am held-up in my school work through lack of them. When I opened school there was practically no chalk on hand; I scoured all available chalk but the large quantity is exhausted now and I find myself in the predicament of trying to teach 47 pupils without any chalk.\n\nI also recommend to your kind consideration the fact that my residence is 16 x 17 and altogether too small for...\na bedroom and living room. Mr. Lewis says he is waiting for permission from the Dept. before building an addition to it.\n\nI would like very much to have it built during October as it would be too unhealthy to spend the winter in such a small apartment.\n\nHoping you will give your immediate attention to this matter and thanking you in advance,\n\nYours Truly,\nCatherine Moran\nOttawa, October 6, 1922.\n\nMadam:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 3rd instant, I beg to inform you that the supplies for the Temiskaming Indian Day School were shipped from the Government Stationery Office here, by express, on September 21st, last, addressed to you at New Liskeard. We hope they reached this point and were taken by you from the express office before the recent disastrous loss to that town. If not, they are no doubt destroyed and, if you will let us know immediately, we will duplicate the order.\n\nRegarding the addition to the residence, I beg to say that we will await a report from Mr. Agent Lewis as to what he would advise being done in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMiss Catherine Homan,\nTeacher, Indian Day School,\nNorth Temiskaming, Que.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6111, file 333-8, part 1)\nOttawa, October 6, 1922.\n\nSir:-\n\nA communication has been received from Miss Catherine Honan, Teacher of the North Temiskaming Indian Day School, in which she requests that an addition be built to the house which was purchased and moved to the school grounds for a teacher's residence. She states that the house, which is only 16' x 17', is altogether too small for bedroom and living-room.\n\nI would be pleased if you would state what it would cost to build an addition of the size required to this house, also if this work could be performed this fall. Will you also state the size and type of addition that you would recommend.\n\nI might add that Father Evin visited the Department today and strongly urged that this addition be built, to provide accommodation for the teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. H. Lewis, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNorth Temiskaming, P. Q.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of official letter No.35-1-8 of the 6th inst., having reference to the teachers residence at North Temiskaming.\n\nIn reply to same I beg to say that the house is a little on the small side for 2 compartments. When I purchased this building I was under the impression that it would be lots large enough for one person, and that it would be easily heated, and comfortable in the winter time, but the teacher seems to prefer a larger building with two rooms.\n\nRegarding the cost of building an addition to this building I am of the opinion that it take about $200.00 for labor paint and materials, to erect an addition and put it in the same condition as the present structure. The sum of $100.00 that was paid for the house that was moved on to the school grounds did not near represent the actual value of this building as the materials in it would cost more than that.\n\nIn reference to the size and type of the proposed addition I beg to say that I would recommend a lean to building 16' x 16', and the work could be commenced at any time now. I am enclosing a diagram showing the shape of the present building and what I consider would be the best kind of an addition to make to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.D.

You may, therefore, arrange to have this addition put up.\n\nIn the purchase of any material you should first obtain competitive prices, and the purchase should be made from the firms quoting the lowest price.\n\nYou should also keep proper time sheets, in duplicate, for the labour employed.\n\nProperly certified vouchers, in duplicate, should be forwarded covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the material and for the labour. No unnecessary expense should be incurred, and the cost should be kept down to the lowest possible point.\n\nA lean-to building of the size recommended by you is approved. The total cost should not exceed your estimate viz: $200.00.\n\nThis matter should receive your immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. H.

At present they are simply intolerable.\n\nMy house roof leaks like a sieve; I have no outdoor shelter of any kind to store my provisions, I have always had to keep them in our bed-room\u2014a most unsanitary expedient. I have been at my wits' end to obtain wood although I cannot be accused of being extravagant. I work abroad dinner at school from Dec. till the end of May in order to economize the precious fuel. During that period there never was fire in my house from 7 A.M. till 4 P.M. on school days. And yet I could not be decently supplied.\n\nShould the Dept. be disposed to improve living conditions here, please advise me of any vacant Indian school having good accommodation for a teacher and my much obliged\u2014Yours Truly,\n\nC.

This house, which is an annex to the school building, was put up last fall, and our Agent informed us at that time that a good building had been erected, and that you stated it was very comfortable and satisfactory. We are, however, taking this matter up with the Agent and requesting him to have repairs made during the present summer.\n\nRegarding the fuel, I beg to say that we are instructing Mr. Agent Lewis to arrange to have an ample supply of wood delivered for both the school and teacher's quarters, and he will, no doubt, attend to this matter and have a sufficient quantity on hand for next winter's use.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will state definitely whether it is your intention to return and teach next year. We have no vacancy at the present time to which you could be transferred.\n\nThe quarterly school return forms asked for have been sent under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 20, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 17th instant, I beg to say that you may incur an expenditure of approximately $9.00 in having any plastering required carried out at the residence of the teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School. Please arrange to have this work done as soon as possible, in order that the residence will be in a serviceable condition before the school re-opens after the present summer holidays.

Q.\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform the Department that the stove bought last year for the school teacher of the Temiskaming Indian School does not give very good satisfaction; it is a new style of a stove that would probably give better satisfaction with coal. Mr. Wilfrid Perron has a good heavy stove for the price of $50.00, the stove now in use was paid $42.25 and Mr. Perron would allow $40.00 for it as he has a chance to sell it to another person.\n\nI would be pleased to know if the Department will authorize this exchange.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nOttawa, August 30, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th instant, relative to the stove which was supplied last year for the use of the teacher of the Temiskaming Indian Day School, and recommending that this stove be exchanged for a more suitable one.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange with Mr. Perron to supply the stove mentioned by you at the price of $50, provided he will take the present stove as part payment and allow the sum of $40 therefor. You may, therefore, arrange to have the new stove obtained and set up ready for use.\n\nPlease forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, in favour of Mr. Perron for the amount of the difference in price between the new stove and that of the old stove.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

JOHN G. ANDERSON\n\nCochrane\nCHAPLEAU, ONT.\n\nMarch 13th, 1914\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOne of the Indian missions I visited last summer was Kasawaukopy, which is about two miles north-east of the Bell River Crossing of the Grand Trunk Transcontinental. I arranged for the erection of a building which will serve the purposes of a church and school. I have a young man in view for this mission, and intend to send him out as soon as the season opens in May. There are quite a number of children who have never had the advantages of a school, and I am anxious to make a beginning. I suppose I can look to the Department for the usual school grant as soon as we can begin work.\n\nThere is no material in hand, and as there are very few opportunities of sending anything out, I would like to forward some books to Mr. Cartlidge when he proceeds to this mission. I would be very grateful if the Department would supply these necessaries. If so, would you please send me some requisition forms so that I could arrange with Mr. Cartlidge for the material needed.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Moosonee\nMarch 19th, 1914.\n\nDear Bishop Anderson -\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant in reference to the establishment of a school at Nassanip.\n\nIn view of the remoteness of this location I should like to have further particulars in regard to the conditions and as to the likelihood of the success of a day school.\n\nBe good enough to let me know approximately the number of children there are in the locality and whether the Indians are permanently established there so that the children might take advantage of a school the year round or whether they go with their parents on the hunt.\n\nIn the meantime there will be no objection to having your requisition made out and I am enclosing herewith a couple of blank forms for this purpose.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

Anderson\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nI have yours of the 19th inst., asking for further information regarding the need of a day-school at Moosonee.\n\nI took a census of the population during my visit last summer, and found 30 families or 144 souls. There are about 90 adults and fully 30 children of school age. Four of these families are Roman Catholics. Here is therefore much need for a school, and when I mentioned the matter to Indians, they seemed delighted at the thought of having a teacher and school. They have an idea of the advantages of a school, because the men voyage for supplies to Rupert's House, where, as you know, we have a fairly good school. Several couples of Rupert's House school are at Moosonee. The Indians are hunters and scatter in all directions with their families for the winter. However, there are always several families who winter at the post.\n\nIt would be chiefly a summer school, but even that means a great deal. I imagine, however, that with a resident missionary, school could be carried on in the winter as well.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJohn G. Anderson\nOttawa, April 17, 1914.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo I beg to say that the Department approves of the establishment of a summer school at Waswanipi and will allow a grant of $50.00 a month to the missionary teacher while the school is in operation. The salary will begin from the date on which the school is opened and payment will be made on the receipt of the usual quarterly returns, blank forms for which will be sent you.\n\nThe question of supplies for the school will be dealt with in another communication.\n\nI have the honour to be, Right Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

The only place available for school purposes was an old log house, fifteen feet square, placed at my disposal by the H.B.C. management, and I learnt later that several people had died in the past, of consumption, in this same building.\n\nFor the last three summers I have obtained (with great difficulty), the use of a framed building, 25 feet by 15 feet, and which is often used as a store room and bunk house. It is a dark building, has\nno arrangement for ventilation, has a leaky roof,\nand at present I can get no promise of the use\nof this building after this month.\n\nIn 1915 the average daily attendance was 21.40.\nIn 1916 the average daily attendance was 23.20.\nFor the present year the daily average is a little\nhigher than thirty. A building 25' x 15' is\nfar too small for any teacher to be successful in\ncarrying out his work.\n\nI think you will agree that it is impossible to\nteach the rules for the preservation of health to Indians,\nwhen the place in which they are taught is unsanitary.\n\nIn Ontario when I had the privilege of teaching one\nof the Indian schools for several years, the school\nbuildings are erected, kept in order, and fully equipped\nby the Department, and the same conditions exist in\nManitoba where many of the schools have not such a\nhigh daily average as this school.\n\nWaswanipi lies at a disadvantage in being two\nhundred miles from the railway (e.g., Rps), but I find that\na school thirty feet by twenty-five, which will meet\nall the requirements of the Department can be\nbuilt for eight hundred dollars ($800).\n\nIf the school work here is to be successful, and\nis going to make any good impression upon the\nIndians, such a building as I have mentioned\nis necessary, and must be speedily erected.\n\nI trust that this letter will receive your prompt and favourable attention.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarry Cartilage.\n\n(Signer)\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\nJOHN G. ANDERSON\nBISHOP\n\nCOCHRANE, ONT.\n\nApril 15th, 1917\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI herewith enclose a letter from Mr. Cartledge, teacher of the Waswanipi School, which I can heartily endorse, as I saw this summer the conditions under which he carries on the school.\n\nI also enclose receipt for payment of something to sweeping the school and another for express charges on school material from Cochrane to Moosonee, which is the route to Waswanipi.\n\nUnder separate cover I forward the school returns for the summer's work up until the time the Indians left for their winter homes.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\n* Only $2.00 of this amount is for the school material.

It is true that he arrived late in June, but he was ready to leave here on May 25th due to the extremely late season, the ice being delayed until the first week of June. He kept the school open until about Sept. 1st.\n\nThe Indians and their families departed for their winter hunting-grounds.

Iserhoff operated the Waswanipi Seasonal School during the past summer. A cheque for $225.00 is being forwarded to him.\n\nThe manner in which Mr. Iserhoff prepared the return and the comments he made regarding the work indicate very clearly that his own education is very limited. Especially in a crisis like the one we are passing through at present I feel that we are not justified in expending public funds to pay salary to anyone in charge of a school who possesses such limited capabilities.\n\nWe are not prepared to consider re-appointing Mr. Iserhoff next year and, unless a more highly qualified teacher can be secured, the school will have to remain closed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRt. Rev. J. G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nCochrane, Ont.\nDiocese of Moosonee\n\n35-13-1\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to yours of the 24th inst., I note what you say regarding his qualifications of Mr. S. H. Dethloff as teacher. I may say that I saw his return and was convinced myself at the manner in which he had prepared them. He knows better and can do better, as his letters in previous years show. He is an earnest Christian with extended knowledge and good judgment, and makes a valuable missionary.\n\nIt is difficult to get anybody to go to that distant station for 8 months. The travelling expenses of Mr. Dethloff for return journey this last summer cost $5.75 and his board and lodging $8.75, a total of $14.50. Compare that with your cheque, Mr. Dethloff can do it, because he has retired on pension from the H. B. Co., whose demands he was as Book Manager for many years at Warkentin Falls and Ojibway (directly a good recommendation), and also because he loves the Indians through their language and does this work for missionary reasons. I have seen him at work in the school and can say without hesitation that he does as well as anyone with a B.A. and better than the preparation of his return. You certainly must help the school even with 60 pupils in his care.\n\nThe cheque for $25 should go to the Royal Bank Co. at Montreal, where our bankers. I have already paid him for his mission work.

Lariviere, Agent for the Abitibi Agency, visited the Department recently and expressed the opinion that it would be in the best interests of the Waswanipi Band to appoint a female teacher who could also act as a field matron by visiting the homes and encouraging the Indian mothers to keep their houses clean and giving them other useful advice.\n\nThis appears to be a practical suggestion and the Department would like to try it for the summer of 1941. Would it be possible for you to secure a female teacher with the qualifications mentioned above? If so, we are prepared to consider a salary of $65.00 a month for the three-month period. Mr. Lariviere advised us that he could arrange to have the teacher taken in by plane at a cost of $22.00 each way. Of course the teacher would have to pay this amount herself but the $10.00 a month extra salary that we are promising would cover most of this.\n\nI should appreciate hearing from you as soon as possible.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt. Rev. J.G. Anderson,\nBishop of Moosonee,\nCochrane, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Mr. Holly:\n\nYour proposal to appoint a female teacher (who would also act as field mission) for the Moosonee Residential School, would be well worth trying. So far I have been unable to contact one.\n\nThere might be difficulty in getting accommodation for her. The H.B.C. residence is a small one and the present Post Manager has a family of 3 children and a maid. If she were in a house with 2 small bedrooms upstairs and one downstairs besides kitchen, dining and living room. The older children are a boy and girl. We have a Mission House which will be occupied by Mr. Dechertoff whom I will have to send in any case to hold the daily services for the Indians in their own language. Therefore Mr. Dechertoff boarded with the H.B.C. as his daughter reads the wife of the Manager, who has been transferred elsewhere. I imagine the female teacher will be able to get meals at the H.B.C. house. I don't know how an English speaking teacher will manage in writing letters to give advice.

Rev. J.G. Anderson, he is not sure of being able to locate a suitable person, failing this, I suggest no one be sent this season, in turn we could probably issue these Indians with a fair quantity of soap, lime, as a sort of preventive measure against an epidemic breaking out.\n\nThese Indians have been asked to consider camping on new grounds this summer as protection, no reply has reached this office yet as to if they will do so.\n\nIn the event this allowance as replacement is granted, these supplies could go in with Indians requested to call here to take in clothing.\n\nSchedule for visiting this point has been suggested to be on about July 1st., with improved precautions, a doctor visiting, probably this might be sufficient for this season, seen Mr. Isadoff will going in same as in the past although not for the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Kitchen has a house, during summer months put up a tent alongside for his use during summer, he consider this house suitable for the purpose in mind.\n\nAt Waswanipi the Indians do live in tents, I am of the opinion regardless if the Indians do live in houses or tents, the question of visiting their homes is important, keeping in mind at this point the Department had to face heavy expenditures in connection with epidemics, some form of prevention should go into practice, the use of a suitable teacher to act as a field matron should give satisfactory results, also to assist these Indians in view to educate them along the line suggested in my Memorandum dated January 24, when in Ottawa, if a suitable person or the question of accommodation cannot be arranged, I feel I must return to my suggestion in letter dated March 1, by adding to this extra time when visiting this Band with a doctor, we will at least do something for them and all concerned.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHerve Lapierre,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nApril 1, 1941.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 11th ultimo and previous correspondence in connection with the employment of a teacher for Waswanipi for the summer of 1941.\n\nThis Branch is still of the opinion that it would be very desirable to experiment for one year with a female teacher who could carry out the duties mentioned in my letter of January 28. If it is not possible to secure a female teacher I believe that we would not be justified in re-opening this school during the coming summer.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

He advises that Mr. Sam Iserhoff has been conducting a school at Waswanipi during the past summer. A review of our files shows that the last correspondence we had with the late Bishop of Moosonee was in April, 1941, and since that time we have had no information regarding the Waswanipi Seasonal School. If this school has been in operation and you consider that Iserhoff is entitled to pay for his services, you should have the usual return forwarded.\n\nThe attached account has also been received.

R. Iseroff, went to Waswanipi during summer 1942 and 1943, I understood from him, on the request of late Archbishop Anderson and at the expense of Diocese of Moosonee, as a missionary, I am aware that he held regularly gatherings for the children and during evenings held regular church services.\n\nDuring winter 1941 the late Archbishop Anderson informed that he had failed to secure a suitable person to continue with school work, since it was understood that this school was not in operation, I feel if it had been the intentions of the late Archbishop Anderson to demand aid he would have done so for summer 1942 now why claim for 1943, during inspections during summers 1942 and 1943, it was taken for granted the gatherings of the children as held, were entirely for a religious purpose, so no inquiries, or visit were made when in that area, the only person aware of what was done is Mr. Iseroff, as already stated he informed his work was at the expense of Diocese of Moosonee.\n\nI feel if an allowance is granted for school teaching during August 1943, it leaves the door open for further claims, that is 1942 and 1943, Mr. Iseroff spent at Waswanipi during these summers about 3 months, each year. In 1941 Mr. Iseroff was considered unfit and unable to carry on with school work as desired by the Department, no doubt this was acknowledged or recognized by late Archbishop Anderson, so I feel that it is difficult under circumstances to recommend payment.\n\nLooking over Day School Return for August 1943, it is evident the interest taken by the Indians is just about nil, as regard sending the children to the school, if we consider that a return is presented only for month of August, that sometime after the death of Archbishop Anderson, the administration in some ways overlooked the arrangements as regard taking care of Mr. Iseroff's work as a missionary and they appear to have had the intention to take care under school at the expense of this Branch.\n\nover ..........\nAt Waswanipi on general welfare, as you know we have organized these Indians, under the Sewing Club Plan, provided a very complete medical service, a nurse spent best part of summer 1942 with these Indians, all this without any assistance from any outside persons, we have had good success, if we consider thereturn presented for 1943 - August -, I do not see that on general welfare the claim for teaching has much value.\n\nIn order to retain the good will of all concerned, I recommend that Rev. M.R. Clarke, be granted as settlement of all claims to-date 1 month salary for Mr. Iseroff.\n\nP.S.

We have also decided to pay the account of $12.32. However, we cannot do so at the present time, as the account has not been receipted.

Isenoff, Esq., Waswanipi.\n\nSeptember 10, 1944\n\nIn reply your demand as per memo attached to return, I have compared names of children with our records, it appears all the children are listed, those with 'circle' black pencil, I have no record of. I understand the Summer Day School at Waswanipi, at one time it had been decided that unless a qualified teacher was sent in, it would be considered non-operating. Listing of children appears to have been done by Indian girl Eva Grant, it will be noted the attendance total number of days absent equal about 30%, which further support that this school should be non-operating.\n\nAs regard claim for $15.00 for washing school room, I consider this charge as not warranted, when visiting Waswanipi I have noticed Indian women and girls washing the church which is used for the mission, etc., I feel the least the Indians can do is to wash the church free of charge, even if used for other purposes, at other points Indians were told, those receiving rations particularly them should do this kind work, that is wash the schools.\n\nConsidering representations in connection with this school last season, refer to yours No. 35-13-1 dated September 27th, 1943, I feel a very generous allowance would be salary for one month only, with official notice that other arrangements should be made, if any allowances are expected for 1945.\n\nH. Lamiviere - Indian Agent.\nTo the Indian Affairs Branch, Dept. of M. & R., Ottawa, Ont.\n\nSchool - Report\n\nAs regard Waswanipi, if it is the intention to allow that point to operate, under the guidance of Mr. Sam Iseroff, I am against it, for immediate by themselves they are doing well on the SEWING CLUB SET UP and like elsewhere as soon the war is over, they are kept in mind and suggestions will be made, for immediate with the SEWING CLUB AND GARDENS, they have sufficient to keep themselves occupied, I would have no objections to allow Mr. Sam Iseroff a certain allowance, to supervise THE SEWING CLUB AND GARDENS; the school itself under him equals to NIL.\n\nH. Lariviere,\nIndian Agent.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nIn a letter dated June 12, 1945, on File 44-1-1, Rev. J. S. Ford, Assistant Treasurer, Diocese of Moosonee, St. Paul's Church, South Porcupine, advised the Department as follows:\n\nWaswanipi - Teacher - Mr. S. R. ISERHOFF\n\nSalary $100.00 a month plus bonus\n\nSchool to be open four (4) months\nJuly 3rd, 1945.\n\nR.A. Hoey, Esq.,\nActing Director,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have just returned from my first Missionary trip to Waswanip\u00e9 and Mistassine in Northern Quebec, and I thought I should write to you while the observations I wish to make are fresh in my mind.\n\nIn the first place, I am sorry to say that the school supplies which I ordered when I was in Ottawa more than two months ago had not arrived in time. I wrote to Mr. Phelan, who told me that the printers were behindhand, but that the supplies would be shipped as soon as possible. In the meantime, the teachers are on the spot and would do their best. I think I told you last year that at the two Missions I mentioned there are nearly a thousand Indians, very simple decent people, for whom comparatively little has been done in the educational way.\nDear Mr. Phelan,\n\nI enclose the report of Capt. E. L. Grey who was our missionary preacher at Waswanipi this year. He is very careful and pains-taking man who has set a new standard for us. He has just gone to college for the winter and will go back there next spring.\n\nI want to speak to someone this winter about the need of proper school buildings. I do not think that it should be used as a school indefinitely. It deserves repair and cleaning every year and last year Mr. La Riviere agreed that there should be a proper building.\n\nI hope that you will see that this report goes to the proper quarter.\n\nYours faithfully,\nRobert J. Renison,\nBishop of Moosonee.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE:\n\nProposed Indian Day School at Mistassini\n\nOn November 16 the Right Reverend Robert J. Renison, M.A., D.D., Lord Bishop of Moose Cree, visited this office to discuss educational plans in the Diocese of Moose Cree. When informed that the Department was prepared to build an Indian Day School at Waswanipi, he informed us that he felt there was a more urgent need for a permanent day school at Mistassini. Not only are there more Indians at this latter point but they are a more stable group and a day school would have a better chance of success.\n\nAs a result of the meeting, the following decisions were reached:\n\n1. That an educational survey be conducted by the Department as soon as possible to decide the location of this school.\n\n2. That His Lordship be informed as soon as the necessary monies have been made available for this purpose.\n\n3. That a decision be deferred until the Spring as to whether the Department will be able to build this school or whether it will be necessary to appeal to the Church of England to have it constructed (as was the case at Fort McPherson).\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE\n\nOn February 15th, 1947, Mr. Indian Agent Lariviere visited this office and the following proposals were made concerning the provision of Indian Day Schools at Mistassini and Waswasinipi.\n\nThe sum of $8,000 has been provided in the 1947-48 estimates for the construction of an Indian Day School at Waswasinipi. In view of the isolated position of both these schools it will not be possible to construct a frame building but it will be necessary to put up log buildings. It is further recommended that in view of the fire hazard which exists in these localities, that separate buildings be constructed for the teacherage and the school.\n\nWe therefore plan to proceed as follows with the expenditure of the $8,000 provided in the estimates:\n\n(a) During the following summer logs will be cut by the Indians and hauled into position at Waswasinipi so that a start can be made in the construction of this school in the summer of 1948.\n\n(b) During the following summer logs will be cut by the Indians and hauled into position at Mistassini so that a start can be made in the construction of this school in the summer of 1948.\n\n(c) That a supply of school books be sent in to Mr. Lariviere for use in these schools.\n(d) A supply of sporting goods be sent into Mr. Lariviere for use in these schools.\n\nBernard F.

If you do not mind my saying so, I think he should have the highest rate possible, because besides being an Indian missionary, he is a graduate in Arts and has just received a degree of Bachelor of Education at the University of Alberta. He only heard a few weeks ago. He has also a Senior Teaching Certificate.\n\nI hope to visit Fort George School and Whale River in the Diocese of the Arctic, whose Bishop has been ill.

He submitted to this office the attached requisition.\n\nTo my knowledge at Waswanipi, there is no children that could stand over Grade 2, I think at this school grades does not matter much, the main point is to attract them to attend the school, with a new school building, no doubt they would attend better and so on, as it is there now, it is not possible for these children to attend school after August, more it is not possible for the teacher to remain there much longer after that time, on account living quarters, which are unsuitable.\n\nItem 25 Lbs. Col. Wool, this should definitely cancelled, we are providing a certain quantity through WELFARE, balance I feel should be reduced to items needed to teach in Grade 1 & 2 and articles required by teacher, more there is no suitable set up at this point at present to store surplus on school material.\n\nWhatever you will decide on shipping should directed as follows:\n\nTo The Teacher,\nWaswanipi Indian Summer Day School\nc/o Arthur Fecteau,\nAir Transport\nSenneterre, Que.\n\nRev. de Pendleton suggested that if interested on Home Economics, his wife would be interested at nothing less than $75.00 per month, personally I am not interested for this year on expanding, first we must have facilities next make sure that the staff going in is suitable.\n\nH. Lariviere - Supt.

Stephenson from Trinity College, Toronto, to take charge this summer. He will fly in from Senneterre about June 1st. He will be there until the end of September.\n\nGeneral: I would like to tell you something about the financial of these schools, from our point of view. We are very grateful for the grants to the teachers. In the past, while they have not covered expenses, they have been reasonably adequate. But now, as you know, the cost of living in the north is very high. These students are putting themselves through college. I have found this year that I must guarantee to every man his travelling expenses both ways and $120. a month, as in the case of Mr. Ball, and we must advance their travelling expenses. These men vary in calibre but considering the character of the appointments I would be very glad if you would make the grants as high as possible, otherwise we may not be able to get men for another year and I am sure that until a permanent school is justified the present method is reasonably successful.\nMay 28, 1946.\n\nNaswanipi Indian Day School.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nThe Department has approved the appointment of the following teachers at this school during this summer:\n\n(1) Mr. B.

I intend to enroll in Osgood Hall law school this fall.\n\nMy experiences as a teacher are various. I was an instructor in the R.C.A.F. for five and a half years and in that time taught air force history and discipline. After my discharge from the air force, my interests led me to the Panama region where I had an opportunity to see at first hand the effects of education on these primitive people. (Darwin Indian)\n\nWhen I returned to Toronto I enquired about possibilities of teaching among our own Indians. In this way I became affiliated with Frontier College. Last Summer I spent as a teacher with Frontier College at Atikokan Ontario, where I came into contact with the Indians of that area.\n\nI was very pleased when Mr Walsh indicated there might be a spot for me in your summer employment scheme, because it will give me an opportunity to learn what they can teach me and teach them what I know. I am firmly convinced that education is more than half the need of our so called primitive peoples of today.\n\nI am enclosing two letters of reference and my application. I will be glad to hear from you again and I hope my application meets with your approval.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thompson, has applied to you for a position as teacher in one of your summer schools for Indians. I am writing to recommend him. During this last winter he was associated with me in a research and I found that he exercised good intelligence, initiative and judgment in the tasks to which I entrusted him. He is keenly interested in the work. He has already had experience in teaching in the bush, of which he has probably told you.\n\nIf there is a vacancy for him and if you find his credentials satisfactory, I recommend that his application be given sympathetic consideration.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

Carpenter,\nLecturer in Anthropology.\nColonel Neary:\n\nMr. Arnold will not be able to accept the position of teacher at the Waswanipe Seasonal School this summer.

Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Col. Neary,\n\nIn reply to your letter of April 22nd, I am sending you a list of the various Mission Schools and the names of the men whom I would like to place there, with a reason for the choice.\n\n1. Pickle Crow - I regret to say that Mr. Bridle, who is a very able man will be leaving the Central Patricia District about the middle of June. He has done a remarkable work and has united the Indians, under difficult circumstances. He has promised to remain long enough to establish the new man.\n\nI have decided to let you place a man this year, to give his whole time, to the Indian School.\n\nI have written to Mr. Phillip Belyea, P. O. Box 44, Sackville, New Brunswick. He particularly requests, that he should be allowed to go to Pickle Crow, as he knows the district and taught for two years in the Sioux Lookout School.\n\nHe will be available from May 11th, to September the 24th.\n\nI forgot to say, that Mr. Bridle is leaving an old car, which he used last year, to transport the children.\n\n2. & 3. Fort Hope & Lansdowne - Mr. Robert Ross of Huron College was at Fort Hope last year and he wants to return. I suggest, that he be allowed to do so. He will be free on May 21st, and will spend three months. You can write to him at Huron College, London, Ontario.\n\nI would like Michael Hankinson, B.A. of St. John's College, Winnipeg to go to Lansdowne. There is a large band of Indians there.\nCol. B. F. Neary 2 - April 26th, 1949.\n\nThe college closes early and he will be free after the first of May.\nHis address is,- St. John's College, Broadway & Hargrave, Winnipeg, Manitoba.\n\n4. Collins - For this place, which is on the railroad line, I would suggest Charles Griggs of St. John's College, Winnipeg. He also will be free after the first of May.\n\nI would suggest that these two young men, who are free so early, should be asked to go and report at Nakina, Ontario, from which place, they will fly in. The missionary there, will take care of them.\n\n5. & 6. Mistassini - This is our most important mission and has great possibilities. In one of your letters, you told me that, it might be possible to begin an all-year-round school there, next Fall.\n\nI have William Thompson in mind. I am ordaining him, this Spring, as a deacon, but I want him for the Summer, under the care of an experienced missionary. In the meantime, I would like to send two young men from Trinity College, Toronto, Mr. J. Schaster, B.A. and Mr. Thomas H. Meikle, B.A. They are great friends and served together in the R.C.A.F. For that reason, I have chosen them for this place.\n\nYou probably know that they will have to fly in to Mistassini from Rouvraie, Quebec,- The Mount Laurier Aviation Company.\n\nI had hoped, that the school and residence would be finished. I did not see it last year.\nCol. B. F. Neary - 3.\n\n7 & 8 Waswanipi - I am sorry to say that R. F. Stephenson will not be able to go this year. He is pledged to take a Summer Course with the R.C.A.F., with a view to training for the Chaplain Service.\n\nI would like you to choose two men to go there, although, I am sorry for Miss Gull.\n\nYou mentioned Mr. J. K. Arnold of Carleton College. His address is 229 Frank Street, Ottawa.\n\nMr. G. W. Thompson also sounds promising. I will leave these two for you, to decide.\n\nThe time is short.\n\nI would be very grateful if you would let me know at once, whether this list is satisfactory to you. Some of the men are waiting for definite word, as to when and where they shall go.\n\nIn my trip this year, I expect to see every one of them at work.\n\nI expect to leave from Pickle Crow and cover the whole of my district, including Fort George, Whale River and the Belcher Islands, within six weeks.\n\nI suppose you do not want to send anyone with me.\n\nIn the past, I have had to give very minute instructions to the various men, as to how to reach their posts. As in most places, they will be using our churches as schools.\n\nWe expect these men, to take an interest in the religious life of the community.\n\nJust as soon as I hear from you, I will write to each post, notifying the Hudson's Bay Company or the missionary, when the teachers will arrive.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRobert J. Renison\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6111, file 334-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nMay 9, 1949.\n\nRight Reverend R. J. Benson, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopsteep, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Benson:\n\nBy now, you will have received copies of all\nthe letters sent to the teachers nominated by you on April 26.\nI have followed your nominations throughout with the exception\nof the school at Waswanipi. Mr. Arnold has not been doing\ntoo well in his French classes and does not wish to leave Ottawa\nthis summer. It will be necessary for him to take special tuition\nand he is not prepared to go to Waswanipi.\n\nFortunately, I had received an application from\nanother young anthropology student and I believe a friend of\nMr. Thompson, who will be the second teacher at Waswanipi.\nThis is Mr. C. H. Brown, 37 years of age, Church of England\nand a graduate of Dalhousie University. He was recommended by\nProfessor McIlwraith of the University of Toronto and is a\nveteran of six years in the Royal Canadian Navy.\n\nI sent him a telegram on Saturday and presume that\nhe will accept this position.\n\nI was pleased to hear from you by telephone and\nhope that transportation arrangements can be settled, to the\nbenefit of everyone concerned.\n\nTo conclude, teachers have been appointed therefore\nto all these schools and the only one now in doubt is Mr. Brown\nfor Waswanipi. His address, incidentally, is 27 Linden Street,\nToronto, Ontario. I will let you know immediately I hear from him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nColonel Bernard F. Neary,\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI wish to thank you for your co-operation with regard to financing the student teachers who are going North this summer. I have written complete instructions to each one of them with the exception of the two men whom you will choose for Waswanapi. I will be very glad if you would send me their names as soon as possible so that I can write to them personally. With regard to them reaching Waswanapi they should go by C.N. Railway to Senneterre, P.Q. It can be reached either from Toronto or Montreal. They will have to wait an opportunity for flying in to Waswanapi - it takes about one hour - and if they take a regular plane which has other freight it only costs about $40.00 each.\n\nI have asked each one of the students to let me know if they need money for travelling, which I will send to them. I think the arrangements which we agreed upon when I telephoned you will be satisfactory as I will see every one of the men between June 15th, and July 30th.\n\nI would suggest that you have their first cheques sent to me which I can deliver to them in person. I can let you know before the end of the summer the length of each man's service. It will be a great help if you could send the cheques not later than June 10th, to this address.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRJR/G\nMay 14, 1949.\n\nRight Rev. R.J. Renison, M.A., D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 9th, and wish to advise that the address of the two teachers for this school are as follows:\n\n(1) Mr. C.H. Brown, 27 Linden Street, Toronto, Ont.,\n(2) Mr. G.W. Thomson, 47 Ellerslie Ave., Willowdale, Ontario.\n\nI have yet to hear from Mr. Brown confirming his appointment but expect to within the next two or three days.\n\nAs soon as you advise us which of the students will need money for travelling, we will arrange to send their cheques to you as requested.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard P. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nBFN/HM\n27 Linden Street,\nToronto.\nMay 12, 1949.\n\nCol. B. F. Neary,\nSupt. of Education,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nThank you for your letter of May 7th.\n\nI confess that I should have greatly preferred Pekan-\njicum or Deer Lake, for these appear to me to form more interest-\ning fields from an anthropological point of view; however, if\nthey are not available, I accept your offer of Waswanipi with\nthanks.\n\nHaving finished my last examination, I am at your\ndisposal. I wonder if you could give me an approximate idea\nof the date when this school opens?\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. H. Brown,\n27 Linden Street,\nToronto.\nMay 20, 1949.\n\nMr. G. H. Brown,\n27 Linden Street,\nToronto Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Brown:\n\nI have for answer your letter of May 12 and feel that you will be able to learn as much from an anthropological point of view at Waswanipi as at Pekangakwa, or Deer Lake.\n\nThe school at Waswanipi is reached by proceeding on the Canadian National Railway to Senneterre, P.Q. There, you will have to await an opportunity for flying to Waswanipi, which takes about one hour and by regular plane will cost you about $40.00 each.\n\nI would suggest that Mr. Thompson and yourself go to the school together as this will help on the transportation costs. I believe Bishop Renison will be writing to you concerning the travelling expenses.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard A. Henry,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nCopy sent to Bishop Renison\nand to Mr. Lariviere\nMay 26, 1949.\n\nRight Reverend R.J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of May 20 and appreciate the trouble to which you have gone in listing all the teachers.\n\nI will arrange to send the first cheques for Messrs. Schaffter and Meikle in care of you, so that the necessary arrangements can be made concerning their salary cheques.\n\nI regret very much that I will not be able to have Major Clark accompany you on your projected trip. We are having an educational survey made of the Abitibi superintendency and Mr. Doucet, Major Clark and a provincial school inspector will be visiting the various reserves of the Abitibi district in July. As for accompanying you myself, there is nothing I would like better, especially when I look at the pile of unanswered letters on my desk. However, someone has to be here to answer the letters and I am afraid that I am doomed to such a fate this summer. In conclusion, may I again thank you for your assistance in filling these seasonal schools this summer.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nD.\nCOPY\n\nDIOCESE OF MOOSONEE\nRt. Rev. Robert J.

Of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Colonel Neary,\n\nI have just returned from London and Toronto where I met some of the students who are going north. Schaffter and Meikle met me in Toronto and I have arranged for them to go to Montreal to meet the manager of the Mistassini Hudson's Bay Co. store. I have heard that the old Hudson's Bay house is still habitable and will give them shelter. I have authorized them to purchase whatever is necessary for their trip. Any house equipment the mission will pay for. Other things like personal luxuries they can pay for themselves. I have advanced each of them $100 and have given them an order on the Mont Laurier Aviation Co. at Roberval for return plane fare. They are both keen and competent and will leave early next week. I have also written to Mr. C.H. Brown and Mr. G.W. Thomson who live near Toronto and instructed them to travel to Senneterre. I have given them an order for a plane fare to Waswanapi. So far these are the only men for whom I have advanced money and I am sure that there will be no difficulty. I will either send the bills to you or have them pay me. I would much rather not have to take their cheques myself so that there will be no money transaction between us. If I have made any mistake in assuming that Mr. Brown has accepted you can let me know. I expect to begin my air journey about June 15th at Central Patricia, going down the Albany River, visiting about 6 posts and then around James Bay from Atawapiscut to Whale River and perhaps the Belcher Island then I will go Overland to Mistassini and Waswanapi, ending the journey at Val D'Or. It will be nearly 4,000 miles. I wish you could have sent one of your men with me, or come yourself.\n\nYours faithfully,\nSgd. Robert Moosonee.\n\nOver.\n\nD.\n| Name            | Address                          | Date Available | Post       |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------|------------|\n| Philip Belyea   | P.O.

All his men have arrived but he wants to place Mr. Griggs at Lansdowne House, which needs an experienced man. Mr. Griggs is older and more competent than Mr. Hankinson, therefore I have authorized the exchange. Mr. Hankinson will go to Collins and Mr. Griggs has already gone to Lansdowne.\n\nI have written to the two men for Waswanipi and I told them (Mr. Brown and Mr. Thomson) that if they needed travelling expenses, in advance, I would send it to them. I have not yet finally heard from them. I hope that all the other men are now securely placed for the summer.\n\nI am leaving here on June 11th, and I expect to be away for nearly two months.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Neither the school building nor the teachers' house has been finished yet, but should be so soon, providing some paint, which is on order, arrives.\n\nWe are using the church for a temporary school and, since it leaks considerably, especially during heavy rains\u2014and these have occurred daily, except Sunday, since I have been here\u2014we are operating under difficulties. Yesterday afternoon, for instance, I was obliged to give the children a holiday, while this afternoon we were interrupted at three by a heavy shower.\n\nThe children retain little of what they have learned in previous years, and I am attempting now to get them back into the knowledge of the alphabet and simple arithmetic. We are short in supplies, using mostly stock left over from previous years. As far as crayons are concerned or teaching aids for the very young children, we have nothing. It may be, however, that some of\nmuch needed articles are included in a shipment now in Amos, awaiting delivery here.\n\nI hope this will elucidate my position.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nC. H.

He is very keenly interested in Indian work and regards these seasonal schools as a great opportunity for his Anthropology students to get a first-hand background of our natives. I note that you are pleased with the building and recommend it for the four missions at James Bay.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER FROM BISHOP RENISON TO THE SUPERINTENDENT OF EDUCATION - DATED AUGUST 1, 1949.\n\n(Original on file 478-1)\n\n\"WASWANAPI\n\nThis is a place that is growing. I found Mr. C.H. Brown of Toronto, who is doing a splendid job. He is an anthropologist and when I arrived there I found that G.W. Thomson of Toronto had not come - for what reason I do not know. I am very glad however because Kathleen Gull, who worked last year, has been acting as his interpreter and kindergarten teacher. I believe that Mr. Lariviere has recommended that she be paid for her services. She is a very attractive girl and very intelligent. Between them they have settled into the new school which is built of logs and is a credit to the department. That is the type of school that I should like to see built at the four Indian Missions on James Bay. The Hudson's Bay Co. are building a new post, there are over 300 Indians there. Mr. Brown had also moved into the teachers new residence. He is the first one to have that privilege. Altogether I was very pleased with Waswanipi and I wish to congratulate Mr. Lariviere on his enterprise.\n\nBy the way, I loaned Mr. Brown $50.00 for his travelling expenses which he promptly returned to me on my arrival.\"\n\n(Sgd.)

I understand that this is for the months of the church at Waswanipi. On checking up my records, I find that no payment was made from any records. I find that no payment was made from my records, though I received payment in the year 1936 for rent of church and parsonage, which June records will show.\n\nAfter checking up on this above, I looked into the records concerning the new schools and paid payment for rent of janitor paid to Dec. 31st on the basis excepting the case of the Anglican Church Orphan School. In both cases, the payment was made on Nov. 15th. Your records will show that this school has been carried on continuously since 1936, and have received cheques for the teachers' salary for 1936, 1937 and 1938 and 1939.\n\nI shall be glad to have your cheque in payment of rent and janitor in the Waswanipi school for 1938 and for the Anglican Church Orphan School for 1936-37-38-39, etc., $10 per month in each case.\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Renison, M.A., D.D., Lord Bishop of Moose Cree, visited the office and requested the payment of a small rental sum for the Anglican Churches and buildings which are being used as day schools in his Diocese. These include the following:\n\n- EASTMAIN (72-3-5)\n- OLD FACTORY RIVER (72-7-5)\n- MISTASSINI (22-2-5) 35-12-5\n- WASWANIFI (35-13-5)\n- LANSDOWNE HOUSE (144-3-5)\n- FORT HOPE (44-5-5)\n\nClosed 41-42\nOpen 43-44\nClosed 45-46\n\nBernard F.

(RG 10, Volume 6111, file 334-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 2, 1946.\n\nWaswanipi Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nFurther to our recent conversation, we have checked our files concerning the rental paid for the Anglican Church used as a seasonal day school for Indian education. I find that an amount of $5.00 per month was allowed as rental for each month that this school was in operation. I further discovered that janitor's fees to the amount of $3.00 per academic month were allowed.\n\nThe authority for the payment of both these amounts is our letter 44-9-5 of June 21, 1924. Would you please arrange to have accounts to the above amounts forwarded to Mr. Indian Agent Lariviere for next summer's school term.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend R. J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\nThe most hopeful thing which I learned from our interview was the promise to build a school and residence at Mistasini this is the largest place and I hope will be merely the beginning. If I can have a definite assurance that this can be undertaken next summer before April 1st, we can undertake plans. I would prefer that the Department erected the buildings but if necessary I would be willing to try to have it done by private contract which could use local labour. The next year we should do the same at Waswanipi. As a matter of fact, we have two buildings there one is the Church which needs restoration as it has been used for a school for twenty five years. There is a residence for the teacher or Missionary which needs an expenditure of $500. to put it in repair. I would be willing to give this building to the Department for a school and summer residence for the Teacher if they would undertake to have it restored. The upstairs could be made into an apartment and the downstairs would make a fairly good school.\n\n(Signed) Robert J.

To supervise the job, probably it would be much\nbetter to have a \" boss \", as a sort of super and checker, this \" boss \"\nwe better pay separately, a good man no objection to $ 4.00 per day.\n\nFor taking down, will fix the price when at\nWaswanipi, willing to pay a good price for a quick job and a good job.\n\nSawing pit saws, a good number of logs, will have\nto be made into boards, they can organize themselves for this also, they\nwill need a new saw pit, this new saw pit, I think they should put it put\nnear the river, about where they are getting water, near the Indian camp,\nso they won't have to carry the logs too far, at Mistassini we are paying\nthe Indians, $ .40 cts., for one cut, on a 16 Ft. log, although price\nof goods is less at Waswanipi, willing to pay same price. Suggest you\norder \" powder \" and \" line \" for sawing, they should have three pit saws\nat Waswanipi.\n\nThis work, although the Indians are hard up,\nshould take care of all the able bodied men, if added to this the Nursing\nStation, there is going be enough work for all the men, the others\ntaking care of gardens, etc., with transport work, they better get busy\non the whole thing as they come in this spring.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nD.H.

Q.\n\nSchools in Abitibi Indian Agency\n\nWe have received a copy of your letter to Mr. Sheffield, minute to this office. We are glad to see that you are getting preliminary plans ready for the construction of the schools that we discussed during your recent visit.\n\nWe have recently written to Bishop Renison concerning teachers for these schools. We have also forwarded the school supplies, as discussed with you previously. Bishop Renison has two buildings at Waswanipi, one a church and the other a residence for the teacher or missionary. This latter building needs an expenditure of $500.00 to put it in repair. He is willing to give this building to the Department for a school and summer residence for the teacher, if we would undertake to have it restored.\n\nDo you feel that the Department should offer to buy this residence from Bishop Renison? Do you think that we can make any good use of it in your present plans for this area?\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 27, 1947.\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI regret that I was unable to tell you personally of the progress that has been made with regard to schools for Waswanipi and Mistassini. However, I welcomed the opportunity to discuss the situation with Archdeacon Cook and feel certain that he has given you the latest information.\n\nMr. Lariviere has already arranged with Mr. Sheffield, the manager of the Hudson's Bay Post at Waswanipi, to have the logs for the school cut, piled and peeled. Archdeacon Cook agreed that Mr. Lariviere had made a good point when he recommended that we should not use the logs cut and hauled, free, by the Indians for the purpose of building a church. We certainly do appreciate your offer of these logs but it was felt that there might be some objection on the part of these Indians if the logs were used for building a school and teacher's residence.\n\nAs it is, we will be able to cut logs this year, both at Mistassini and Waswanipi, and erect the schools during the next summer. This will give us two schools completed by 1948.\n\nAs you are aware, the Indians are hard up in the Waswanipi area particularly and by paying them for getting out the logs, etc., we will provide them with funds to purchase supplies rather than by giving them direct relief.\n\nArchdeacon Cook mentioned the need for a school at Old Factory River and Mr. Conn, our Fur Supervisor, has also\n\nRight Rev. R. J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\ndiscussed the situation with me. I hope to have an opportunity of going into this problem with you on your next trip to Ottawa.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, March 27, 1947.\n\nMr. H. Lariviere, Indian Agent,\nA.M.O.S., P.Q.\n\nSchools in Abitibi Indian Agency\n\nWe have received a copy of your letter to Mr. Sheffield, minutes to this office. We are glad to see that you are getting preliminary plans ready for the construction of the schools that we discussed during your recent visit.\n\nWe have recently written to Bishop Renison concerning teachers for these schools. We have also forwarded the school supplies, as discussed with you previously. Bishop Renison has two buildings at Wassanipi, one a church and the other a residence for the teacher or missionary. This latter building needs an expenditure of $500.00 to put it in repair. He is willing to give this building to the Department for a school and summer residence for the teacher, if we would undertake to have it restored.\n\nDo you feel that the Department should offer to buy this residence from Bishop Renison? Do you think that we can make any good use of it in your present plans for this area?\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAbitibi Indian Agency\nAmos, Que.\nMarch 30th, 1947\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nYour No. 35-134 (WT)\nMarch 27th, 1947\n\nIn reply, the offer of Bishop Rennison is no doubt very generous, however I do not see that the house in question could be taken over to advantage, built on the Company's land, put up likely by the Indians - labor free - for the Mission, present location poor subject to spring floods, site very bad for flies, condition, it is a large house for our need, new foundation required, very likely also floor, windows and doors in bad shape, the whole building need to be re-inforced, habitable yet but many would not care to do so.\n\nThe building has a value, to be pulled apart, the salvaged lumber, considering it is in a remote area, although all hand made, boards are fair to very good and serviceable.\n\nI suggested last year to Rev. Grey, they should pull it part and rebuild, with logs, foundation and walls, they would have sufficient lumber to complete and make a good house, he informed he would suggest it to the Bishop.\n\nOn school set up, I feel the teachers must be provided like the nurses with own residence entirely owned by the Department, to put up new school, we have a good site on new clearing, in any event we need protection in case of storms and fires.\n\nThis summer the Mission will need the residence offered, for the Company cannot accommodate any one, for any length of time, after the Nursing Station is up, if the Bishop still wish to dispose of their house, we should take over pull apart and put up the teachers residence this year, but to do this it means starting the Indians pulling it down immediately in spring, so we won't run into heavy cost and be left by fall with a house partly taken down, in any event for our use that building for lumber is worth to us $400.00 and we will pay to have it taken down.\n\nI feel Bishop Rennison will be better off, by following my suggestion, rebuild a new house on a new site for the Mission.\n\nPlease advise at an early date, so that I can readjust if necessary and get Indians started on it, before our men go in to do the Nursing Station and at the same time they could supervise the pulling apart and salvaging the lumber.\n\nH. Lariviere - Indian Agent.\nOttawa, April 5, 1947.\n\nWaswanipi Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nIn a December letter to me you mentioned a residence for the teacher or missionary at Waswanipi. Your letter states as follows:\n\n\"I would be willing to give this building to the Department for a school and summer residence for the teacher if they would undertake to have it restored. The upstairs could be made into an apartment and the downstairs would make a fairly good school.\"\n\nWe wrote to Mr. Lariviere concerning this house and he advises that he would recommend, in view of its age, if you still wish to sell it to the Department, it should be pulled down and the lumber used in rebuilding a new house near the day school site.\n\nCould you please advise me what your plans are concerning this building, now that we are proceeding with the construction of the day school. I believe Mr. Lariviere would want to use the new building as a teacher's residence.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend R. J. Renison, D.D.,\nLord Bishop of Moosonee,\nBishopstope, Porcupine Highway,\nSchumacher, Ontario.\nApril 11th, 1847\n\nRe Waswanipi Day School\n\nDear Col. Henry,\n\nI have just received your letter about my offer about the Waswanipi Residence. I had been sure that you were ready to build a school. Now that I know that you are to build a school, I think that the mission house had better be left alone for the present. It can be repaired and may serve for a while as the residence for our missionary during the summer.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRobert Moosonee.\nOttawa, April 14, 1947.\n\nWaswanipi Indian Day School\n\nDear Bishop Renison:\n\nI have your letters of April 9 and 11. I will pass the information about the Waswanipi Mission House along to our Indian Agent.\n\nI enclose 15 blank application forms, as requested in your letter of April 11.\n\nI regret that I was unable to see you on your recent visit to Ottawa but hope that I will meet you again in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRight Reverend R. J.

Lariviere, Indian Agent,\nAmos, Que.\n\nWaswanipi Indian Day School\n\nFurther to our recent correspondence concerning the above school, I have now received a letter from Bishop Renison, in which he states as follows:\n\n\"I have just received your letter regarding my offer about the Waswanipi Residence. That was before I was sure that you were really going to build a school. Now that I know that you are to build a school, I think that the Mission House had better be left alone for the present.

Mr. de Pendleton wrote to the Agency, on my return from Mistassini, I found his letter, demanding to hire Kathleen Gull, as a sort of \"2nd teacher\", I advised him I was not favouring the idea, because Kathleen although when she wanted she was capable, but usually was extremely stubborn and as a whole not dependable and for this year I would not consider it.\n\n2.- On my arrival at Waswanipi, her father Johnny Gull, approached me within a few minutes, as to who was going to pay Kathleen for teaching, I investigated this matter. Rev. de Pendleton had been using her in the school, as \"2nd Teacher\", during ANNUAL VISIT, I checked further on this, visited the school, every day, I found that Kathleen was doing very well, as regard pay for her work, after \"testing for T.B.\" and so on the usual routine, we found it necessary to send Kathleen for x-ray to La Tuque, she had almost starved to death the winter previous, in any event Johnny Gull, was destitute, his wife is feeble minded, his boy Angus, is an invalid, he looks after his aged mother and father, since Kathleen has returned from Chapleau School, she has been more or less in his hands, \"ours\" has she is not wanted by the Indians, as a wife, considering she cannot do much on the \"trapping end of it\". During ANNUAL VISIT, when adjusting this family, I informed Johnny, that aid to Kathleen, instead being direct relief, it would be like for the men, \"worked relief\" based, worked days, they objected in a way, I informed them when possible a woman like a man if in need of aid, he should work for it, and this year it was the case with Kathleen, they agreed to this.\n\n.............\nSo Kathleen was seen and told that her aid would be made up with work return, like other Indians working for aid, she accepted that.\n\n3.- I informed Mr. de Pendleton, assuming that Kathleen had not been in need of relief and aid, it would have been impossible to adjust this, except by submitting a request on the Department subject to approval, for it was against all regulations to hire TEACHERS without their approval.\n\n4.- Kathleen in the school, was explaining in Indian to the children, and interpreting for Mr. de Pendleton, she was doing a good job and this Rev. de Pendleton, was also doing a very good job, considering the fact he had put in a lot of time to get the garden up to a point like never before, I felt all concerned would be satisfied and the good work would be maintained.\n\nThis allowance, works out to WORKED RELIEF, instead of direct relief, which would have been necessary, had she not done this work. I warned Rev. de Pendleton, Indians don't usually accept that and it is against the established routine to settle \"relief matters\" along these lines.\n\nMr. de Pendleton done a good job at Waswanipi, the best since Rev. Rutledge was there years ago, his ways of doing things are inclined to cause difficulties, on minor matters, but he has had no experience with Indians and routine established prior to this year, however he made up a great deal by his good work, not only in the school, gardens and so on.\n\nTeaching school to Indian children and getting them to do garden work, unless they can understand what it is all about, very little good can be expected. Kathleen Gull was used by him to complete and I am satisfied to say, he got results, considering I authorized for Kathleen Gull, on \"worked relief\" basis.\n\nH. Lariviere - Indian Agent.\nDecember 30th, 1947\n\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nRe: Waswanipi New School\n\nI would appreciate authority to purchase material required to complete this school and make arrangements for men to go in and do this work in spring 1948, as regard men if it can be arranged I would send men to Mistassini last trip in spring on ice, and after they have completed this job, that the same men go in to Waswanipi and complete.\n\nMaterial required, is mainly windows and doors, also outside sheeting for the school itself, last summer I figured this out, for this building 20 x 40', it would be cheaper to use white asbestos shingles, fireproof and they don't require painting, as regard residence, finish outside exactly like the \"Nursing Station\" plain peeled logs and painted.\n\nArticles for use in school such as blackboards, desks, and chairs, I presume these could be ordered now for spring delivery, I feel folding chairs would be best for immediate considering freight by air, desks probably we could get these made locally with plywood for shipping purposes being light.\n\nAs much as possible I would like to be in a position to arrange in advance for these supplies in view to take advantage of combined trips, for sick Indians if we have to make them from now until break up.\n\nAs regard Teachers residence I presume it is the intention to supply them with, an outfit like we do for the nurses, cooking stove, beds, cooking utensils and sundry items strictly needed, a table - likely home made - a few chairs.\n\nH.

I doubt very much that one supplier in particular can supply our requirement; we have to look around and usually get from here and there whatever is required; stocks are not complete with any one single dealer. On this I will advise you by early next week.\n\nAs regard furnishings required for teachers, attached hereto requisition, for the school and the residence, which I think can be secured outside profitably. As regard residence, it is a matter of furnishing like we did for the NURSING STATION, strict necessary articles, for cooking and for two persons, this is procurable to advantage on selection with Hudson's Bay Company, at Senneterre or Oskelaneo, on articles missing probably Amos, the same equipment as for nurses is costing about $1500.00, a few chairs, window shades, pots, utensils dishes, securing quotation on this is next best thing to impossible, on NURSING STATIONS I had to go around and gather these goods and could not complete the first year, add to this estimate air transportation about $50.00. Table in this case will be made on ground.\n\nThis school and Mistassini, with teachers residences, is expected without furnishings to come up to estimate as understood with Mr. B.F. Neary last year, both when completed about $15,000 / $16,000, about 60/80% of cost is a matter of relief \"worked relief\" by Indians, regardless if the school is done or not they must be aided,\n\nH.

The Departmental Purchasing Agent wishes you to obtain prices f.o.b.

Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nPP/HM.\nDear Sir,\n\nBishop Benson informed me before I was to come in here that a new residence for the teacher would be provided, also a school building.\n\nBut on my arrival here I find that neither have been built. The old mission house has had the majority of its roofing blown off. The door sills have warped and in places there are spaces three inches wide, thus flies etc., cannot be successfully got rid of. The stove upon which cooking is done is useless, the doors have rusted mostly off, likewise the stove-pipes. It can be used for nothing but scrap.\n\nUnder these circumstances I feel that it is extremely unfair to ask any sane and human person to try and attempt, and at the same time teach school. The church in which school is taught is rapidly approaching a state of disrepair also.\n\nThus I write to you at this\ntime and request advice as to my next course of action. If anything can be done I would also like to submit a request that it be done quickly. Because at the present time the H.B.C. Post can look after me for fifty (50) dollars a month which will leave me no money saved at all. Also the Post cannot guarantee me board and room for any longer than two weeks.\n\nI hope, sir, that I shall hear from you in the near future,\n\nSincerely Yours,\n\nP. F. Stephenson\n(Clerk & Missionary).\nTo The Indian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. B.F. Neary, Supt. of Education\n\nAttached hereto original letter from Mr. B.J. Stephenson Teacher at Waswanipi, I was at Waswanipi, seen Mr. Stephenson, I understand from him, that Bishop Rennison had made him the proposition to go in, with the understanding that the Teacher's residence was ready for occupation also the new school.\n\nI informed Mr. Stephenson, that no doubt the residence and the new school would be completed as soon as possible, but for immediate I could not say when, in any event I would forward his letter on to you, he informed he was writing to Bishop Rennison, but stated that probably he would get no satisfaction as he understood Bishop Rennison this summer was going to England, and just about leaving.\n\nAs stated before, the conditions at the \"Mission\" for a person live in are not acceptable to most persons, refer to his letter.\n\nI will be leaving for Mistassini and Oskelaneo on about June 8th. from Amos, may I suggest that you write direct to Mr. Stephenson mailing copy to this office.\n\nWe have two men completing the Nursing Station at Waswanipi, and if the school cannot be completed this year, these men should be ready to come out about end of June, in any event very early in July.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We are asking Mr. Lariviere to order a new stove for you immediately. This stove can be set up in your quarters and can be used in the new teacher's residence when it is completed. We are also asking him to order sufficient netting for you to cover the windows.\n\nI understand that Mr. Lariviere is leaving for Mistassini and that he hopes to see you in the near future.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nBernard F.

Laviviere,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\nAmos, P.Q.\n\nPlease find attached a copy of a letter which I have sent to Mr. Stephenson of Wassanipi.\n\nWould you please obtain for him a stove and pipes, not to exceed in cost $90.00, and also the netting required for the windows.\n\nI sincerely regret the delay over the purchase of the windows, shingles, etc., but our Departmental Purchasing Agent is simply swamped with purchase orders. Unfortunately, you did not list details as to sizes, etc., in your order, and this made it difficult for him to obtain prices.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDear Archdeacon Clarke:\n\nWe have your letter of June 20th with reference to the situation at Waswanipi.\n\nOwing to circumstances over which we have no control, there has been considerable difficulty and delay in securing the materials required for the erection of the building at Waswanipi. As a consequence, the building was not ready for occupation when Mr. Stephenson arrived.\n\nWe have already heard from Agent Lariviere and for your information I enclose copy of a letter sent to Mr. Stephenson on June 12th.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Lapiviere - Supt. Ind. Agency\n\nP.S. Men will go in to Obedjiwan, and work up to freeze up, about middle October or end of that month depending, this will allow completing and using early in summer 1949.\n| Description                  | Quantity | Unit Price | Total   |\n|------------------------------|----------|------------|---------|\n| our invoice no 3458          |          |            |         |\n| feuilles tuyau 6\" \u00e0 27 cents | 10       | 27 cents   | 270     |\n| elbow 6\"                     | 1        |            | 58      |\n| feuilles tuyau 7\" \u00e0 28 cents | 10       | 28 cents   | 280     |\n| elbow 7\"                     | 1        |            | 38      |\n| poele \u00e0 bois 28\"             | 1        |            | 22.95   |\n| poele \u00e0 bois 24\"             | 1        |            | 19.00   |\n\nTotal: 48.21\nCONNAISSANCEMENT DIRECT\u2014ORIGINAL\u2014NON NEGOCIABLE.\n\nNo. du Consignateur\n\nNo. de l'Agent\n\nRE\u00c7U, sujet aux classifications et tarifs en vigueur \u00e0 la date de l'\u00e9mission de ce connaissancement original,\n\n\u00e0 le 30 juil 1948\n\nde\n\net apparemment en bon \u00e9tat, sauf constatations contraires sur ce connaissance (le contenu et l'\u00e9tat du contenu des colis \u00e9tant inconnus) les marchandises ci-dessous d\u00e9crites et marqu\u00e9es, consign\u00e9es et destin\u00e9es tel qu'indiqu\u00e9 plus bas, lesquelles la dite Compagnie s'engage \u00e0 transporter \u00e0 telle destination \u00e0 leur point de livraison ordinaire, si telle destination est sur son parcours, sinon, \u00e0 les livrer \u00e0 un point de livraison sur le m\u00eame parcours vers cette destination.

From green bush about 150'.\n\nFront of school, there is 6 windows on north side, same as front.\n\nAll hand work, except what could not be done locally.\n\nOur fenced land, school, nursing station, cleared partly under cultivation over 9 acres. I estimate we will be able to allow the school about 2 acres for school garden.\n\nOwing to cost as at present, the school buildings and others, have no finished ceiling.\n\nTo complete the school and teachers residence, there is about 1 month's work, a good carpenter, details and painting.\n\nThe unfenced area, ready for cultivation, new land about 15 acres, outside of camping ground, and other lands that could be cultivated, needles to say owing to cost of supplies at Waswanipi I am much interested that Teachers get on with the \"school garden\" during summer months.\n\nH.

A little school opened for five or six months during the temperate season, would produce excellent results amongst the children of these fine Indians. The future generation would nor longer be the same. It would be necessary to live really twenty years in the midst of the Indians to find the extraordinary results and to truly understand how enlightened is the policy which the Department has followed with regard to education amongst the Indians. It is by education and by education alone that good citizens can be made. It is by inculcating in those of tender age by continued education, highest principles and instructing them in the two supreme principles of good and evil that they will be made men and not otherwise.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\nArmand Tessier,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 16, 1918.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your letter of the 27th of August, last, in regard to the establishment of a school for the Indians at Weymontachingue I beg to say that the Department is not prepared to establish a school for these Indians at the present time, as the funds at its disposal are very limited.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nArmand Tessier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPointe Bleue, Que.\nManiwaki, Que., 13th February 1925\n\nTo D. McLean, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Indians of Wemuntashig are desirous to obtain the services of two teachers for next spring; one for classroom activity and the other for field matron's duties in the Indian homes. But they ask for a summer school for the months of June, July, August and September. Their intention too is to learn French language.\n\nI hope, Sir, your Department will comply with that laudable desire and will grant the two teachers to the poor Indians.\n\nYour servant in X\n\nRev. Joseph Gu\u00e9rard O.M.I.\nOttawa, February 27th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, requesting that a summer school be conducted this coming summer at Weymontaching for the benefit of the Indian children at that point.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, after considering this request, the Department regrets that owing to the funds at our disposal being limited it will not be possible at the present time to provide the expenditure required in conducting a school at this point next summer. The last census taken shows that there is only a total of 89 Indians at Weymontaching, and it is, therefore, doubtful if there would be a sufficient number of Indian children available to make the work a success.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

MacKenzie, Secretary, Dept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have before me your letter February 24th, 1925 No. 69-2-1.\n\nI read: \"The last census taken shows that there is only a total of 87 Indians at Weymonta-Ching, and it is, therefore, doubtful if there would be a sufficient number of Indian children available to make the work a success.\"\n\nI beg to say that last year there were 35 children from 4 to 15 years at Weymonta-Ching. Moreover in our Indian schools there are not only children of school age who attend classes, but even married people are glad to be taught. It is this that we have seen the whole summer at Obedjiwan.\n\nYour Say: \"...the Department regret that owing to the funds at our disposal being limited it will not be possible at the present time to provide the expenditure required in...\"\nLes Missionnaires Oblats\nde Marie Immacul\u00e9e.\n\nManiwaki, Que., 192\n\nconducting a school at this point next summer.\"\n\nSir, when I have requested a school for Chedjiwan, one gave me the same argument; how were the persons of your Department were so kind and obliging they granted the school for this notice \"that many Indian schools which are on the list are not opened and operate.\" I suppose it is the same thing this year. Two years ago the new school at Chedjiwan could not be opened.\n\nYou know Sir, Weymontacking is on the Canadian National Rly, the Indians of that Port are in great need of education and lots of instruction in order not to be deceived and cheated by many of those who trade with them, and have no conscience.\n\nMy arguments give you, I believe, a full conviction, and the request deserves reconsideration.\n\nYour obedient Servant in X\n\nRev.

In reply I have to inform you that these summer schools are more or less unsuccessful, and the Department, in view of the pressing need for economy, cannot give favourable consideration to commencing activities unless their usefulness is assured. You might intimate where it was proposed to hold the school and what arrangements could be made for seating accommodation and for the engagement of a teacher.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

If they are teachable and desire taught, they will benefit and profit by that School.\n\nAlways your obedient servant in X\n\nRev. J. E. Guimard O.M.I.\nManiwaki, Que.\nMarch 25, 1925.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Parker,\n\nI should be grateful if you would let me have your advice in connection with the request of the Rev. Father Guinard for a summer school at Weymont. I understand that you are familiar with conditions in that area. All the information I have is on this file.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6111, file 335-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nSchools Branch.\n\nWith reference to the request by Rev. Jos. E. Guinard for a summer school at Weymontachi, I beg to say that I consider the Reverend Father's request a reasonable one. These Indians, who are now coming in contact with civilization, have never had any opportunity for education. They are, as yet, quite unfit to conduct their affairs with unscrupulous whites and each year makes the demand for such fitness more evident.\n\nI know the Reverend Guinard personally having come in contact with him as a missionary to the Indians for the past fifteen years. He has laboured hard and asked little or nothing from outside sources. I am quite satisfied that for any grant given he will see that full value is rendered.\n\nI think the figure quoted as to number of Indians (89) is quite wrong. To my knowledge there are over one hundred there.\n\nAs regards accommodation, there is a large house on the reserve that, I think, would be available and if the school proves successful after due trial, we could probably buy the building at a reasonable figure.\n\nAs so little is spent on these Northern Quebec Indians, I am personally most anxious to see some start made in the way of education and know of no better start than the plan suggested by the Reverend Father.\nI will be visiting the reserve this summer and will be pleased to report on the matter at that time if a start has been made. In the meantime I would recommend that Reverend Guinard's request be given favourable consideration and that he be advised to go ahead.\n\nI do not think that school furniture need be provided at this time. A start could be made with temporary equipment, if teachers, books and stationery are provided.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, April 1st, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, referring further to your request for the establishment of a summer school for the benefit of the Indian children at Weymontaching.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that after further consideration it has been decided to comply with your request, and the Department will approve of this school being conducted during the months of June, July, August and September, next, provided the Indians remain at Weymontaching during that period. We will allow a total salary at the rate of $90 per month each for the services of a teacher and a field matron. You should endeavour to secure suitable persons for these positions. The teacher should have sufficient qualifications and experience to do satisfactory work. The person selected as field matron should have a knowledge of the simpler drugs and the treatment of minor ailments. You should submit in due time for the approval of the Department the names, qualifications and experience of the persons whom you recommend be appointed as teacher and field matron for this summer school.\n\nWe note that there is a large house which you can obtain for the purpose of carrying on the classroom work. The Department is not prepared to incur any expenses other than the payment of the teacher's and field matron's salary and the providing of the necessary school books, scribblers, pencils, etc. The continuing of the work in future will depend upon the success which is met with during the coming summer. If, after due trial, it is found that it is of benefit to the Indian children, consideration could then be given to authorizing a larger expenditure in providing for the education of these children.\n\nPlease nominate suitable incumbents for the summer school work at this point at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nManiwaki, Que., April 21st 1925\n\nJ. D. McLean, but Deputy and Sec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 14th inst. I am very thankful that your Department comply with my request in approving a summer school at Weymontaching. Certainly I will endeavour to secure suitable persons for the two positions, and for the good of the Indians.\n\nIf I understand well your letter, the salary for each teacher will be $90 per month.\n\nI suppose the teachers of the summer school at Shedjivan will have the same salary; last year the field matron got only $65 per month. Please let me know it.\n\nAs soon as possible I will let you know the names, qualifications, and experience of the four teachers for Shedjivan and Weymontaching.\n\nYour servant in X\n\nRev. J.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, regarding teachers for the summer schools at Weymontaching and Obedjiwan.\n\nIn reply I beg to say we note that you will nominate in due time a teacher and matron for each of these points. The salary allowed at Obedjiwan will be the same as provided last year, viz., $90 per month for a teacher and $65 per month for a matron. As the provision for the increase in salaries is limited, it will not be possible to allow the matron an increase and grant her salary at the same rate as has been promised in the case of the matron at Weymontaching. If possible, the teachers should be secured and all arrangements completed to open both these schools on or about June 1st, next.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I teach them how to keep their houses clean and I make them clean them in the spring when they come home from the bush, and I did not want them to put up tents this summer for the good reason that they have better chance to learn how to keep house when they live in it, of course it saves them work to be outside well I believe it is something worth on the hygienic part.\n\nWhen they came home in the spring every one of them was sick some in very bad shape, so I had to attend to them every day going in every house trying to help them the best I could, always busy even on Sunday.\n\nBesides they increase on the way of economy made them save their money by telling them to buy just what they want for food and clothes, some of them had money for all summer.\nTheir potatoes are good from the seed the government send them. I showed them how to cut their seeds and plant them. That is not for everyone; some are old enough to know how to plant them, and you will be surprised about what they can do with sewing new clothes, and mending old things, etc. Of course there is certainly lots to do yet. Before they will be perfect with some of them.\n\nIf you don't believe in those few remarks I invite them some of you to pay a visit on the reserve and ask any of the Indians what I did there is only them that can tell. I did too much for the salary this year. I suppose it is too much to ask you the same salary at the year before. I was much disappointed when I was notified of the $5.00 dollar salary. I hope you will pay attention to my demands. As we are leaving soon will you please send my two last payments Aug & Sept so to Miss Gladys Diamond the other teacher as soon as possible, you will oblige very much.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss E. N. Adoni\n\n[Stamp]\nOttawa, September 21, 1927.\n\nMadam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, reporting on your activities as assistant teacher and matron at the Weymontaching Indian Summer School.

This I understand was set in the past as May 15 for Sanmaur, Que. This date simply means these Indians don't stay in the bush for the spring hunt and trapping. I suggest the date be fixed as June 1 instead. This should give them sufficient time to trap muskrats and make a few dollars.\n\nIf you approve to fix the opening date on June 1, I would appreciate being informed at your earliest convenience, to notify them of this change.\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of December 30 in connection with the opening dates of the seasonal schools that are annually in operation in your Agency.

Teacher has $90. per month, and the second has $70. per month. If not possible to raise up the wages of the second to $80. Then why not to put the salary of the 1st. to $85. and to give $75. to the second one. It is because, the second one has an educational work as important as the 1st. one. And so Mr. Larivi\u00e8re himself thinks too.\n\nAt the present, the difference per month between the two is $20. it seems that $10. per month's difference should be enough.\n\nThe best, necessary, is that the salary of the second one should be $60. per month and to leave to the 1st. one the same: $90.\n\nI remain, your all faithful,\n\nEd.

If the teachers follow out these instructions, their salaries will be paid promptly.

By doing so, the teachers were occasioned extra work and considerable trouble.

It was no negligence from their part, but simply because Mr. Lariviere had forbidden them to send them to Ottawa and had to be sent to him only.\n\nYour remark about visitors and so on demands explanation. Personally, I have been always opposed to board and accommodate visitors. I have always told the teachers not to ask for visits from their relatives or strangers. And I continue the same. But the complaint that you have from Mr. Lariviere is certainly not accurate, untrue for the most part of it.\n\nNothing is true for Jemmontaching and Obedjowan. The teachers are not caused with considerable trouble, on account of visits.\n\nThe teachers are giving more than that they are supposed to give. According to Mr. Lariviere, they are free each Saturday and each Sunday, they could even get out of the reserve during these two days per week. They have always and still they do devoted themselves these days as well as during the rest of the week.\n\nUntil now, and I wish to continue, I have never said nothing about that man: Mr. Lariviere. But if it comes necessary that you shall have explanation, then, I will prefer to go and have a talk with you.\n\nMr. Lariviere is putting \"sticks the more he can\". Please, do not render the life too severe for these teachers, devoting themselves away from civilization. Some liberty should be given them.\n\nI remain, Sir, your all faithful,\n\nEd.

From the information supplied by yourself on this form, it is noted that you estimate the total of your income for the calendar year 1945 will be in excess of $660. In that event it will be necessary for you to complete TD 1 form. I enclose this particular form, in duplicate, and you should also forward, in duplicate, a cost-of-living bonus form. I trust that you will complete these forms and return them immediately.\n\nA supply of the forms required for reporting the attendance of the children at school is going forward under separate cover.\n\nWith reference to your claim for over-deduction during the year 1943, I presume that you have submitted the request to the Inspector of Income Tax.

Homes are better kept and cleaner.\n\nHowever, hunting and trapping is getting harder every-year for this band; trapping grounds are covered with lumber operations and Club owners.

Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, addressed to Mr. Sutherland of this Department, regarding the appointment of teachers for the Indian summer schools at Manouan, Weymontaching and Obedjiwan.\n\nIt is noted that you have re-engaged the same teachers as were employed at these schools last summer, and the Department will approve of their re-engagement, as follows:\n\nManouan:\nMiss Ursule Boredeau ... Teacher,\nMiss Philomene Drolet ... Asst. Teacher & Matron.\n\nWeymontaching:\nMiss Beatrice Foy ... Teacher,\nMiss Wilhelmine ... Asst. Teacher & Matron.\n\nObedjiwan:\nMiss Germaine Cote ... Teacher,\nMiss Juliette Lafrance ... Asst. Teacher & Matron.\n\nSalary at the rate of $90 per teaching month will be allowed to the teacher in charge and $65 per month to the assistant teacher and matron, less 10 percent, in each case, during the summer months of 1933.\n\nThe teacher at each school should prepare the usual returns showing attendance, days' taught, etc., stating thereon their post office addresses, and forward same to the Department at the end of each month, in order that payment of salary due can be made. The assistant teacher and matron should also prepare a brief statement showing the work performed each month. On the first returns forwarded, the teachers should state definitely the date on which they began duties, and when submitting the final returns they should also state the date upon which the school closed. These summer schools should reopen on the first of June, next, and remain in operation until the end of September, following. I would request that you advise the teachers accordingly and arrange with them to commence duties on or about the date mentioned.\n\nIt is hoped there will be a regular attendance of the Indian children and that the teachers will meet with success in the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Railway Station, and the old school\nhouse to be moved further east in order\nthat the children will not have so far to go\nto school.\n\nThere are more children living near the west\nend and east end of the Island. They have about three\nmiles to walk, about one mile distance from\nthe present school, both ways where there are\nfew children living.\n\nDue to the condition of the muddy roads, and\ndeep snow in the winter time, few children are able\nto get to school. Nearly all the children are between the\nages from six to thirteen and they are not strong\nenough to stand the cold weather in the winter time or\nwalk through a deep snow and muddy road three miles\ndaily.\n\nThe school is not large enough to accommodate all the children\nif they all went. There are more than thirty children living just\naround the west end of the Island. I think more children\nwould attend school if the school was near by. Many\nchildren stay home on account of the distance they have to\nand bad roads. It is alright for the teacher as long as\nshe boards near the schoolhouse. We would like to have\nnew schoolhouse built.\n\nHoping to hear your reply at\n\nYours Truly,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. John Peters,\nCornwall Island, Ont.\nOttawa, November 21, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from John Peters, Cornwall Island, regarding the educational facilities provided on that reserve. He requests that a new school-house be built near the O. N. Y. Railway station and that the present school-house be moved further east, in order that the children will not have to travel so far going to and coming from school. He says that the most of the children live near the west and east ends of the island, and it is too far during the cold weather for them to walk to the present school, and as a consequence many of the children stay home on account of the distance they have to go.\n\nIn a letter dated the 10th of March, 1915, you brought this matter to the attention of the Department, and in reply you were informed that, as you intended shortly thereafter to visit the Department, this matter would be discussed with you then.\n\nThere is no record on file as to your further views on the matter, and I have now to request you be good enough to look into this question and give your views fully regarding the need of another school located at the west end of the island and the present school nearer the east end.

I also left with him a list of children of school age, but for some reason my suggestion as to the erection of a second school was not carried out.\n\nMy contention in this matter has always been that two schools were necessary in the interest of proper education; as the present school is situated in the centre of the island and the larger number of children live mostly at the eastern and western ends of the island, it seemed to me proper to have two schools.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Only one new building will be erected this year, and this matter was discussed with you during a visit made by you to the Department. The matter of deciding on which end of the island this school should be erected was left to you.\n\nWe are now ready to proceed with the plans, and it will be necessary to definitely decide where this building is to be erected and to secure the necessary site. I shall, therefore, be pleased if you will state at which end of the island you would advise the first school to be built. If possible, you should also secure at least an acre of ground which should be level and well drained. You will be good enough to arrange for the obtaining of the site as soon as possible, and give us particulars regarding the same. If it is necessary to purchase the ground, it should be secured as cheaply as possible and should be as central to the needs of the locality as can be obtained.\n\nI shall be glad if you will state the number of pupils for which the school should be built and also whether you would advise that living quarters for a teacher be included, either in the building or in an annex thereto. An early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. R. Taillon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, Que.\nSir,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 8th instant relative to the proposed erection of a new school on Cornwall Isle. I beg to inform you that I have today endeavored to secure a suitable location at the west end of the island, and after sending the greater part of the day there, I am unable to report any progress, except that one Thomas Colwell will let us know definitely on Thursday next whether we can have an acre of his land for school purposes or not. Failing this, I think we will be obliged to erect the school at the eastern section.\n\nThe school, whether built at the east or west of the island, will require a seating capacity of about 35 children; it would, I think be advisable to either have living quarters in the school or an annex thereof, as it may be difficult to secure suitable accommodation for a teacher.\n\nUpon receiving definite information on Thursday next, I shall immediately inform you of the result.\n\nEnclosed you will find vouchers covering cost of transportation to and from Cornwall Island.\n\nJ.

It is noted that you are unable to get any land at the western end of the island and recommend that we expropriate one acre for the purpose.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that we do not desire to take this action in obtaining a site. As the Indians apparently are not anxious to give a site at the western end, you should proceed to procure one acre at the eastern end of the island, and we can erect the first school in that section.\n\nIt is thought that when the Indians see the new school on the eastern end finished, they will then agree to provide the site necessary for the school at the western end of the island.\n\nYou will please arrange for the securing of the site at the eastern end and have the transaction completed as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Day offers one acre of his land free of any charge but the farm is practically three farms from the centre; by placing the school on Day's land there would be about a mile and one half to the centre of the Island and one mile to the foot; I have tried to place it as near the centre of the eastern part as possible.\n\nPossibly if some one were to come from your Department a better location could be secured.\n\nJ.D.

I wish to assure you that this Department appreciates the situation in which you are placed, and I am of the opinion that the proposed building operations may have to be postponed until next year.\n\nI should be pleased to have your recommendation concerning such postponement. What effect would this have on the attitude of the reactionary element on the Island and elsewhere on the St. Regis Reserve? If we fail to erect a school at this time, would our efforts to enforce attendance at the schools of the agency during the past year be wasted?\n\nThe other option open to this Department is to secure the necessary site by using the Statute in our Act - (Sec. II-A). You might discuss this with Mr. Robertson and give us your opinion as to the best course of action.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nF. E.

If this is not practicable, we would be very grateful, if you would provide some conveyance to make the children to the public school, located and now in operation at the west end of the island.\n\nTrusting this matter will receive your prompt and careful attention,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6111, file 338-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nSir,\n\nWhile visiting Cornwall Island a short time ago, some of the Indians living at the east end of the island and who have children within school age, were interested in schooling for their children.\n\nI was asked to take this matter up with the Department, making request that a school be constructed at the east end of the island. As you may recall, this matter was taken up with you different times in the past few years, but for certain reasons, a school building was not built.\n\nTo satisfy myself and to determine just how the Indians at the east end of the island felt towards this school question, on August, 11th instant, accompanied by Elijah Benedict of Cornwall Island, we visited every dwelling at the east end of the island, and had the parents who had children, sign the enclosed petition.\n\nAll parents who had children appeared to be interested, and signed the petition, with the exception of one, Mitchell Hopps, and who not altogether refused, but requested some little time to think the matter over.\n\nThis is encouraging to me. Two or three years ago, most of the Indians at the east end of the island, were adverse to school activities.\n\nNo doubt a school cannot be built this year, but the building of a school at this point on the reserve, should be made a sure move next year.\n\nAs noted in the petition, that if a school could not be provided for, that arrangements for transportation of the children to the school at the west end, is petitioned for.\n\nI talked this matter over with Mr. Louis Benedict, of the island, that is with respect to charges per day for conveying the children. Mr. Benedict said that he would be willing to undertake the job, and considered it worth $2.25 per day, for two trips, morning and afternoon. The mileage per day would be about fifteen or sixteen miles.\n\nI would like to hear from you as soon as convenient in this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.J.

F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nW. A. MacGibbon, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSt. Regis, P.Q.\nSir,\n\nI desire to call your attention to the very great need of a school at the Eastern end of Cornwall Island. The old school at the Centre of the Island was condemned some few years ago. Immediately a new school was built at the West end, where the school premises cost $200 each, so the children at West end may cross the bridge over St. Lawrence river & attend the school on the Main land. The children however at the Eastern end of the Island have no such privilege, yet up to date no school or means has been provided for these young people, so that they are growing up in ignorance without even a rudimentary knowledge of the English language, which is a very serious handicap to them. Cornwall being a factory town just across the river offers a fine opportunity for work, but they don't want them if they cannot speak English.\n\nI sincerely hope this matter may receive your serious attention & if it is not possible to build a school just now, a suitable house might be rented & fitted up at small cost. If this is not practicable then possibly a conveyance might be procured to convey the most needy children to the school at the Westend. It is a serious situation which I hope this Department may soon be able to remedy.\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The present school is situated at the west end of the island\u2014a distance of approximately five miles from where the Indians at the east end of the island reside. The Indians are anxious that their children have the advantage of an education. The local Indian Agent, officers of this Department who have visited the reserve and the Indian parents have strongly urged the establishment of day school facilities for the children residing on the east end of the Cornwall Island Reserve.\n\nFunds to provide for the erection of a school building and for payment of teacher's salary are available in our Estimates for the current fiscal year.\nCertified to be a true copy of a Minute of a Meeting of the Committee of the Privy Council, approved by His Excellency the Governor General on the 14th June, 1935.\n\nThe Committee of the Privy Council have had before them a report, dated 7th June, 1935, from the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, recommending the establishment of an Indian day school, under Section 9 (a) of the Indian Act, to provide educational facilities for the benefit of the Indian children residing on the east end of the Cornwall Island Reserve (No.59) in that part of the St. Regis agency located in the Province of Ontario.

Frank Leaf, Councillor, of Cornwall Island East was asked if he knew of dances being held. He admitted that he had been at a dance at the school but that as far as he knew everything was orderly and he saw no drinking. Councillor John J. Peters remarked that dances had been held in the Cornwall Island West school, but that so far as he knew everything had been quiet and sociable.\n\nI am of the teachers version of this matter which will be reported under separate cover.\n\nD.

It appears that this developed into impromptu dances, and on occasion a bingo game was held. Mr. Chisholm advises me that up until January 28th, those concerts etc. were always of an orderly nature and were enjoyed by all. On the evening of January 28th, some Indians from the American side of St. Regis village, according to report, showed up at the school and had liquor with them. Mr. Chisholm advises that he immediately stopped the concert and closed the school.\n\nI have been asked by Mr. Chisholm to enclose a letter in which he explains the whole circumstances. He advises that those concerts etc. will be discontinued, unless held with the permission of the Department.\n\nI also spoke with Miss Peters, teacher of Cornwall Island west Indian day school. Last fall Miss Peters asked me if I thought it would be permissible to use the school for the organizing of a young peoples skating club. I advised her I thought it would be all right as long as they done no damage and kept the school clean.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 15th instant with reference to entertainments that have been held in the Cornwall Island East and Cornwall Island West Indian Day Schools.\n\nThe Department has no special objection to allowing concerts to be held in these schools. It is felt, however, that such concerts should be arranged and should be under the direction of the teacher.\n\nHowever, we do not consider it advisable to allow dances to be held at the schools as it is often extremely difficult to keep these under proper control.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

This is due chiefly to an influx of families from the eastern section of the reserve. The men find it more convenient to reach their daily work in Massena and Cornwall when residing near the highway which passes near the West End school. Rather than build a temporary addition to the West End school, it is suggested that all of the pupils in the Senior Grades be transported to the East End School. Mr. Chisholm concurs in this solution of a temporary overcrowding in the West End school.\n\nC.F. Matthews\nInspector of Schools.\nOttawa, July 9, 1942.\n\nMr. D. P.

The teachers were able to get to their schools so that Eastern School was closed one day, Central one day and Mission two days. The reports of the teachers for December show that there are a considerable number of pupils suffering from colds and at Eastern School, a number were absent from skin diseases, a condition that has been hard to clean up at this school. Cod Liver Oil was delivered to the schools in late November and teachers instructed to see that the children received the same. During December there was a considerable falling off in the attendance of Indian pupils to the Shannonville and Milltown white schools, due to inclement weather and sickness.\n\nA.D. Moore,\nIndian Agent.\nQuarterly Report\nSt. Regis Indian Agency\n\nSchools:\n\nBelow is the percentage of attendance of our schools during the quarter under review:\n\n| School                        | December | November | October |\n|-------------------------------|----------|----------|---------|\n| Cornwall Ild. W. School        | 58.7     | 81.6     | 77.8    |\n| Cornwall W.                   | 61.1     | 88       | 88      |\n| Village School - Senior       | 71.6     | 88.1     | 87.8    |\n| - Junior                      | 67.3     | 94.2     | 91      |\n| Chenail School                | 60       | 94       | 90.9    |\n| Chetlain                      | 23       | 94.2     | 92      |\n| St. Regis Island              | 76.6     | 67.5     | 77.09   |\n\nIt will be noted in some cases very low average for December. This is due to the flu epidemic mostly. In general it can be said that attendance at the various schools has maintained a high level. Such a high percentage is particularly noteworthy at the Chetlain school where it was difficult to get the boys to school. The reverse is now the case as far as the boys are concerned. With the exception of the Cornwall Island East school no manual training is carried on. The village boys get the benefit of some training along this line when such is possible with the time at the disposal of the local constable. With only one man now stationed here less time can be devoted to such work among the boys. Due to the poor freezing of the St. Lawrence this winter it has not been possible during December to get to St. Regis Island School. Too conditions are such that it is not safe to walk nor can a boat be used. Only emergency trips are made by the Indian residents of the island.\n\nIn general the children on the whole appear to be well-behaved and industrious. There is very little incentive for those children in our Quebec schools to devote much energy to studies after they reach the age of 15 as the prospect of being able to attend a high school is no better than in past years. The hard period to keep those children at school is between the age of 15 and 16. The boys in particular just won't exert themselves too much after 15. This situation is most unfortunate as they have just reached a point in life when they should be capable of absorbing some knowledge. I feel though that if we could give them the kind of training they would like at this period we would be well repaid and would not have any attendance problem on our hands to contend with.\n\nT.L. Bonnah,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nAs advised on this date, arrangements have been completed to have Mr. Chisholm take over the Manual Training Instructor's work in September.

We had previously planned to send Mr. Ryan to the Pic Indian Day School last August. However, he could not accept this position, due to the fact that the school is in such an isolated area as to prevent the purchase of fresh milk for his baby. We are thoroughly aware of the situation and are keeping him in mind for a possible transfer elsewhere. To date there have been no resignations from Roman Catholic teachers in Ontario or in Quebec.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSept. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRECORDS:\n\nPlease place this copy on\n\nCORNWALL ISLAND EAST - 1\nIndian Affairs Branch, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nActing on the complaint of Angus Lazore, Indian of Cornwall Island Reserve, Constable Brown, R.C.M.P., and the undersigned visited Cornwall Island East School on the 7th instant to discuss the matter with the teacher, Mr. Ryan. It was alleged by Mr. Lazore that the teacher had used his fists to punish his daughter, Evelyn Lazore.\n\nI might say that very little was accomplished through our investigation apart from the fact that the pupil stuck her tongue out at the teacher. We endeavoured to leave the impression with Mr. Ryan that corporal punishment should be administered only when necessary and then only in accordance with the law. I might add there does not appear to be very much order in the class and while there is a marked improvement over a few months ago, the teacher concerned is too nervous a type to deal with our Indians. He appears to be eager enough to learn the various angles connected with the teaching profession and he is apparently working hard enough but I fear he is losing prestige amongst the people.\n\n[Signature]\nH.

Apparently Mr. Ryan had had some sort of seizure in a street car at Cornwall upon which Major Pendegast was riding.\n\nI contacted Major Pendegast (Government phone 6732) and he told me the following story:\n\n\"That on Saturday at approximately noon he was talking with an Indian on the St. Regis Reserve when a stranger came up to him and asked a series of disjointed and queer questions. The Indian said; \"That man's crazy\" and then told the Major that the stranger was Mr. Ryan, the teacher at the Cornwall Island East School. Major Pendegast then left the Indian and started to walk towards the street car. He noticed Mr. Ryan ahead of him jumping in a series of gazelle-like leaps towards the car. On the car Mr. Ryan sat by himself and after a short interval began shaking his head with his fists and rocking back and forth. He kept tearing at his clothes and muttering to himself. Although he was creating a considerable disturbance, no one on the street car made any effort to interfere with him, as he seemed rather dangerous.\n\nMajor Pendegast then saw him leave the car and bound into the post office in a somewhat similar manner, to that in which he had entered the street car.\"\n\nMajor Pendegast, while not wishing to appear a busybody, gave this statement voluntarily and recommended that action be taken to have Mr. Ryan medically examined. Major Pendegast is willing to submit a signed statement concerning the above incident, if such is necessary.\nMay 6, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nCHIEF TREASURY OFFICER\n\nRe: Cornwall Island East Indian Day School No. 336,\n\nMr. Dennis Ryan, the teacher at the above Indian Day School, will relinquish his duties and no salary should be paid to him after June 10, 1948.\n\nFor Deputy Minister.\nDear Miss Searson:\n\nYou will recall our previous correspondence concerning the new Indian Day School at Chenail.\n\nMr. Bonnah was in the office yesterday and advised me that he will also have a vacancy at the Cornwall Island East School. As this is closer to Cornwall and has good transportation facilities, we decided to advise you of this vacancy also, in the event that it would suit your requirements better than the Chenail School.\n\nOur new salary schedule has been approved and we can now offer you a higher rate than previously. If you wish details concerning the Cornwall Island School, I would suggest that you write directly to Mr. Bonnah.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMiss M.B.
