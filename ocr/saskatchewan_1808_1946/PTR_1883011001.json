It is not much to be regretted, for several reasons, that an investigation before a coroner's jury did not take place. Whilst there may be no suspicion or imputation of unlawful acts, or of wilful neglect on the part of any one causing death, yet we think there were in this case sufficient circumstances which called for investigation. In the other provinces of the Dominion, in all cases, where death has been caused by accidents from machinery, in steam mills, manufactories, steamboats or railroads, an investigatory coroner's jury has been held without fail, for the purpose of satisfying the public mind, of clearing or incriminating as the case may be, the conduct of others, and for the satisfaction of the relatives and friends of the deceased. In the North West Territories the law on this subject is as follows:\n\n\"Except as hereinafter provided, no person shall be charged with the body of any deceased person, by any coroner, unless it has been made to appear to such coroner, that it is necessary to believe the deceased was killed by the manner or by culpable or negligent conduct, either of himself or of others, under such circumstances as would constitute murder and not through mere accident or mischance.\"\n\nThere can be no doubt that the power of the Coroner to direct such an investigation. In this case there would seem to be circumstances which peculiarly called for the exercise of this power. A man employed in the mill, of no previous experience, as far as is known, in mill machinery, whose duties it does not appear to have been to have had charge of the belting, up to the time the belt was broken, has been loosened from a wheel, for another purpose, and is directed by the miller, who has long experience in such matters, to adjust the belting. He attempts to do so, and proceeds to a platform for that purpose, and whilst the mill's back is turned, the unfortunate man is caught in the machinery, nobody knows exactly how, but it is supposed his clothes were caught in a cogwheel close by, and he is crushed to death.\n\nThe miller gave an evasive statement, not altogether wholly, maybe, to the Coroner, said that the deceased attempted to adjust the belt from the wrong side of the wheel, against repeated warnings, which he had given him to that effect. Thus imputing negligence on the part of the man whose lips are sealed by death. Subsequent enquiry has elicited the fact that there is a difference of opinion upon this point. Some say that he went to the side of the wheel where there was a sort of a platform, and that if he was on the wrong side, then the platform must also be on the wrong side; again, others say that he went up on the right side by which access could be had to the wheel.\n\nWhatever story may be correct and at present we pass no opinion upon the subject, sufficient is known to show that there was abundant need for an investigation, whatever may have been the result. It is but fair to state, that the Chief Factor of the Hudson Bay Company, Hon. Lawrence Clarke, Esq., and Col. Richardson, who happened to be in town, immediately after the occurrence of his office as Superintendent, Macarthur holds the position of coroner in the North West Territories, and expressed his willingness to investigate the matter, if arrangements were made for it, as required. Col. Richardson said that as far as the internal evidence produced before him went, he did not consider it necessary that a coroner turn up before he left Edmonton. Allow me to state it was perfectly ready to hold an inquiry, and so the matter rested. It appears to be the impression amongst some, that it was unnecessary, in order to have a coroner's inquest held, that a coroner turn up before he left Edmonton. Allow me to state it was perfectly ready to hold an inquiry, and so the matter rested.\n\nDesire to return sincere thanks to their customers for their kind patronage during the past year, and trust by energetic push and constant application to business to still merit a like continuance of you kind favors during the present year.\n\nSTEWARD AND WOOTTON,\n\nGENERAL MERCHANTS.\n\nALWAYS BUY FOR CASH,\n\nAND GET FULL VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY.\n\nFresh Groceries,\nTeas,\nSugar,\nO'Gillie's Hungarian Patent Process Flour,\nPrince Albert XXXX Flour,\nEvaporated Peaches,\nEvaporated Apples,\nDried Apples,\nNew Raisins,\nNew Currants,\nCalifornia Fruits,\nGray's Celebrated Scotch Jams,\nGranulated Syrup in kegs and tins,\nCanned Meats,\nCanned Fish,\nCanned Soups,\nSugar-Cured Hams,\nSugar-Cured Bacon,\nCross & Blackwell Pickles,\nHorsemeat Sauce,\nYorkshire Edish,\nSpices, etc., etc.\n\nBiscuits,\nCandies,\nDry Goods,\nClothing,\nBoots, Shoes,\nFURS:\nSets Blk.

The following is the programme, each doing their part very creditably:\u2014 Opening hymn\u2014\"All hail the power of Jesus' name.\" Prayer. A little song by the pastor. Recitation by James Eby. \"Wreck of the 'Temeraire' sung by the children. \"Jewels\" recitation by Clara Pride. \"Be gentle,\" recitation by John Turner. \"Who will bear the showery load?\" singing by Miss Anna Cass. \"Recitation by Miss Anna Cass. \"Recitation by Miss Anna Cass. \"The snail and the cricket.\" Song by James and Willie Willis. \"Over the snow.\" Recitation by Alice Sinclair. \"The little lamb.\" Song by Anna Cass. \"Pilgrims of the night.\" Recitation by Robert Martin. \"Speech by little Mary Hamilton.\" Speech by little Mary Hamilton. \"Speech by little Mary Hamilton.\"\n\nLONGEST.\n\nWe had the pleasure of a conversation with old Mr. George McKay the other day, and while talking about his age, he said that he had just about completed his 90th year\u2014to-day or tomorrow. Mr. McKay undoubtedly the oldest settler on the Red River, having come to this country in 1823, when he was only 16 years of age, and been here ever since. His remains are the only history of this country are very interesting. He has lived through many changes, and his body, as we purpose spending an hour so with him tomorrow day in order to get a few facts regarding the early history of this country in its earlier days. We can imagine the old gentleman telling us of the adventures that took place, and how he will live to see more of them. On the morning of our visit to him, he was engaged in writing on a piece of paper, which he had placed on a table below, whilst his pipe was out, and his eyes and ears are fine and sharp. He seems to be in good health, and there is no suspicion of form or wrapping, and yet he and the doctor feel the cold air of the North-west, and the people of the present generation say to themselves, \"How can the old gentleman stand such things?\"\n\nThe goods of Mr. T.
