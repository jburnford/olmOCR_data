The result of the proceedings directed at the proprietors since the opposition was raised will not cause the delay. There can be no excuse for the delay, no matter how much might be said in its favor. In this matter, as in all others, our people, who waited upon His Honor, had the assurance from his own lips that it was by the advice of his legal advisers or of himself that he had delayed so long. We hope this may prove a caution to some of our community to abstain from rushing into conclusions formed on insufficient data, and to give more thought to matters of importance. Everything considered, perhaps this necessary delay may have been ordered for the best; as we will now have an excuse for not rushing into matters which might originally have been made things done in too great a hurry. We have every hope that the present session of the North-West Assembly will see the incorporation of Prince Albert, and that we shall see a situation that will be the talk of the people themselves should we fail speedily to secure municipal organization. There can be no doubt that municipal organization is needed by a very large majority of our community, although unhappily there has been a good deal of difference of opinion with regard to the details, whether as to whether each constituency should be represented by a vote of the whole municipality, or each by separate wards. That the latter plan is from every point of view the fair way seems obvious to anyone who has given the question any attention during the period having elapsed between the last election and the present one. It is evident that the question is being discussed, and that three wards, against one in the extreme west, and one at the extreme east, are ample sufficient for the interests of those between them. The question has been brought up by time and reflection been made apparent to most of those who were once against themselves to the councils of a far-travelled friend, who has visited us abroad, and who has heard of progress and enlightenment, which in his days gone by guided their free-booting Highland ancestors, the law of might being the law of right, or to quote the poet Wordsworth:\n\nFor why? Because the good old rule beareth them: the simple plan:\nThat they should take who have the power,\nAnd keep them who can keep.\n\nAnd they should keep who can.\n\nIf things proceed as favorably as we expect, it is high time for our prospective wardens to begin shaping their respective electoral districts with regard to the policy they intend to impose upon candidates for municipal office unless they propose to postpone their action until such time as they elect others unconditionally and then condemn their course. It may be premature to forecast a policy, but speaking generally we would advise\n\nSHANNON & McLEOD\n\nNOTICE.\n\nHaving a large payment to meet on THE 1ST OF AUG.
