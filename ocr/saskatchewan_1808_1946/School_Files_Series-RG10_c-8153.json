Re last paragraph, page 2, and first paragraph on page 3:\n\nIt is regretted that the Church of England sees fit to adopt the attitude expressed in paragraphs mentioned. Each disputed case has been considered on its merits and it is understood that the decision given was in accordance with departmental interpretation of Section 117.\n\n2. It would appear that the cases mentioned in the last three paragraphs of page 3, also the information contained on page 4 as well as the top portion of page 5 have been reviewed in this letter for the purpose of directing attention to the paragraph marked \"Note\" on page 5.\n\nIt would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to carry out the procedure requested without the fullest cooperation of the Churches. Otherwise the only possible action that an Indian Superintendent can take is to accept the parent's statement regarding his religion and the school in which he wishes his child placed.\n\n3. In paragraph 6 on page 3 and in some other places in the communication, there is reference to the delay in dealing with correspondence and making decisions.\n\nReligious cases cannot be settled quickly. Complete information must be obtained from field officers, and the interchange of correspondence in order to obtain the very definite information required causes a considerable time lag. In addition, during the period about which the complaint is particularly made, the Education Division staff was depleted owing to resignations and has only been brought to full strength during the past few weeks. As a result, it was physically impossible to give immediate attention to the large volume of correspondence which the Education Division receives daily.\n\n4. Paragraph 4 or letter of February 7, 1952, mentioned on page 4 presumably refers to the request of the Church of England for the Department to purchase the present Fort George Church of England Residential School and enlarge its accommodation. This cannot be definitely considered until the church of England is able to produce satisfactory title to the land on which the present school is situated. It is our understanding that the church of England is now negotiating with the Quebec Provincial Government with a view to obtaining a proper title.\n5. Paragraph 5 of page 4 refers to an interview that Canon Cook had with the Minister. In regard to this interview Canon Cook states that Mr. Harris assured him that in such cases \"the final decision rested with the Director or the Minister\".\n\nSince the new Indian Act was issued in September, 1951, there have been placed before the branch approximately 57 so-called religious cases. Some of these have been requests for placing children of Roman Catholic antecedents in Protestant schools and others have been requests to transfer children of Protestant antecedents to Roman Catholic schools. With the exception of two cases, which will be dealt with later in this memorandum, none of the other religious cases have been decided by the Director or other official of the Indian Affairs Branch. The information in each case has been submitted for direction and instructions issued have been followed.\n\n6. The latter part of page 5 refers to the case of the James children.\n\nThis family is from the Stikine Agency in the Province of British Columbia and both parents are living. The father requested by application the admission of his children, Albert age 7, Jimmy age 12 and Paddy age 10, to the Carcross Church of England Residential School. On the application form the religion was not mentioned, but a separate statement attached to the forms read as follows: \"I do fully understand that this is a Protestant school and not a Roman Catholic.\" He made no further commitment regarding his religious denomination, other than the statement mentioned.\n\nSuperintendent Clark stated that it is his understanding that the family is of the Roman Catholic faith. However, Mr. Clark recommended the admission of the children to the Carcross School. The decision made in this particular instance was as follows: \"Applicant being Roman Catholic, children should attend Roman Catholic school\". Instructions were issued accordingly but the Church of England was advised that these children could remain in the Carcross School until the end of the academic year, namely June 30, 1952, and per capita grant would be allowed for them to that date, in order that their academic work might not suffer any interference. At the end of June, the Carcross School has been directed to return the children to their parents.\n\n7. At the bottom of page 6 the case of \"Kenneth Johnson\" is mentioned. The application for this boy was forwarded to the Department by Superintendent Meek. The application form stated that the boy's religion is Roman Catholic and no reason was given for wishing him admitted to the Carcross School, which is conducted under Church of England auspices. Consequently, Superintendent Meek was written in the manner mentioned in the last paragraph on page 6. The letter mentions that no grant is being allowed for him. This is correct because the circumstances were different. While the correspondence regarding his admission was proceeding the boy was not in the school and consequently the Church of England was not expending any funds on his behalf. It was for this reason that no grant was allowed. This is a different case from the James children, who were in the school while the correspondence regarding\ntheir admission was being considered and, of course, were being maintained during that period by the school. This is one of the cases referred to in paragraph 5.\n\n8. Re: Clyde Blackjack - The first information that the Branch received regarding this boy was contained in a letter from Bishop Goudert (R.C. Bishop of the Yukon), dated January 30, 1952. In this letter Bishop Goudert states that this boy is an orphan. The Bishop further stated that he was well acquainted with the whole family - that all had joined the Catholic Church nearly 10 years previously - that two of the other children in the family had attended the Grouard (R.C.) Residential School - that the father had died some years previously and that the mother, together with four of her other children, was in the Cassell Hospital and as a result of the mother's condition, the Bishop stated that the boy Clyde was being neglected, and he therefore requested that Clyde be placed in the Lower Post Residential School. One sentence in Bishop Goudert's letter read as follows: \"I was amazed to hear that Agent Meek, far from showing any interest in the educational welfare of the boy, looked for every possible excuse to discourage the local Missionary, Father Turenne, to have the boy admitted to the Lower Post School\".\n\nIn view of the information contained in Bishop Goudert's letter, Superintendent Meek was written on February 7th and informed of the contents of Bishop Goudert's letter. He was instructed to have the boy placed in the Lower Post School, provided the boy was physically fit.\n\nSubsequently, we received a letter from Superintendent Meek, stating that one of the boy's brothers thought he should be placed in the Carcross School. However, we felt that the information contained in Bishop Goudert's letter, as quoted above, definitely indicated that the religion of this boy should be considered as Roman Catholic. Later, Mr. Meek forwarded to us an application form signed by his brother, Roddy Blackjack. This form stated that the boy's religion was Roman Catholic.\n\nYou will note that the action in connection with this boy was taken previous to Archdeacon Clough's interview with the mother in the Charles Cassell Indian Hospital. It is noted that Archdeacon Clough states that the religion of the mother is recorded in the Charles Cassell Indian Hospital as Roman Catholic. This is the second of the cases mentioned in paragraph 5.\n\n9. Re Dreaer children mentioned at the bottom of page 9, the information we received regarding this family from the Indian Superintendent was to the effect that the family resided in the Meadow Lake Agency and that both parents were living. The application forms which were forwarded and approved by the Indian Agent stated that their religion was Roman Catholic, although the parents applied for their admission to the Lac la Ronge Church of England Residential School. The ruling given in this case was as follows: \"Applicant being Roman Catholic, children should attend Roman Catholic school.\" However, as the children had been placed in the Lac la Ronge School without our authority and in order that we would not interfere with their academic year, it was\ndecided to allow them to remain in that school to the end of\nthe current academic year, June 30, 1952, and pay the usual per\ncapita grant for their maintenance. Instructions were also\nissued to have them discharged from the Lac la Monge School at\nthe end of June this year and returned to their parents.\n\n10. At the bottom of page 9 and the top of page 10, there\nis a reference to Anna and Dora Heather (Heather) who, it is stated,\nare members of the Church of England, but the father placed them\nin the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nThe applications for these children were very carefully\nconsidered and the ruling made was as follows: \"Except if the\nmother is of the Roman Catholic faith, the children who, it is\nassumed, are of the same religion as their father, should attend a\nProtestant school.\" Subsequently it was ascertained that the mother\nis a Protestant and consequently instructions were issued to the\neffect that the Department was not prepared to approve their admis-\nsion to the Onion Lake R.C. School but in order not to interfere\nwith their academic work they could remain in the school until the\nend of the current academic year, namely June 30, 1952, at which\ntime they should be returned to their parents.\n\nJames Bay (page 10)\n\nThis refers to the admission of George and Bertie Andrew\nWesley to the Albany R.C. Residential School.\n\nAt the time the application forms were received last fall,\nthe forms stated that these children were Roman Catholic and their\napplication for admission to the Albany School was signed by the\nfather and approved by Superintendent Allan. As the application\nforms appeared to be in order, their admission to the Albany School\nwas approved.\n\nAt the end of March, Bishop Clarke advised the Superintendent\nof Education that these children were members of the Church of\nEngland. Indian Superintendent Allan was immediately written in\nregard to the matter but there has been considerable delay in re-\nceiving his reply as he stated he could not obtain access to the\nChurch records owing to the absence of Bishop Clarke. Recently we\nreceived complete information regarding these children and a memo-\nrandum regarding the matter is going forward to the Deputy Minister's\noffice for decision.\n\n12. Old Sun School - pages 10, 11, 12, and 13 refer to\nrequests for transfer of certain pupils from the Old Sun (C. of E.)\nResidential School to the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School -\nboth of which are located in the Blackfoot Indian Agency in the\nProvince of Alberta.\nMayfield children -\n\nPhyllis,\nBert Nelson,\nWalter.\n\nThe first two mentioned children attended the Old Sun Residential School until June 30, 1951. As far as we know, Walter had not attended any school.\n\nThe information we received was as follows:\n\n\"The father is deceased and the mother is responsible for her children. Mrs. Mayfield has taken out a statutory declaration stating that she has been baptized a Catholic and is a member of the Roman Catholic church and that she wants her children to be placed in the Roman Catholic Residential School.\"\n\nIn making the above statement, she requested the transfer of Phyllis and Bert Nelson from the Old Sun's to the Crowfoot School and the admission of Walter, who had not previously attended school, to the Crowfoot School. The decision in this instance was as follows: \"The Mother being the responsible parent, is Roman Catholic and the children should attend Roman Catholic school.\n\nYellowhorse children -\n\nDavid,\nPercy,\nMarie,\nSilvia.\n\nAll of these children had been in the Old Sun's School until June 30, 1951, but the following information was received from the Indian Superintendent:\n\n\"The Yellowhorse family is from the Blackfoot Indian Agency and both parents are living. The father has taken out a statutory declaration stating that he has severed any connection with the Anglican Church and that after the transfer of his children to the Roman Catholic School he will have no further connection with the Anglican faith. He further stated that he had been baptized a Catholic and is a member of the Roman Catholic Church and he requested the transfer of these children to the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School.\"\n\nThe decision in this case was as follows:\n\n\"In view of the father's declaration, the children should attend the Crowfoot R.C. School\".\n\nThe information contained at the top of page 12, to the effect that these children are now in the Old Sun's School, is in accordance with instructions given from this office, that in order that there might be no undue interference with their academic work they could remain in the Old Sun's C.E. School to the end of the academic year, June 30, 1952, and that per capita grant would be allowed Old Sun's School for them.\nRoyal children -\n\nFloyd,\nRomana,\nFrancis.\n\nThe two first mentioned children were enrolled at the Old Sun's School to June 30, 1951. They did not return to this school when it re-opened on September 1, 1951, but instead enrolled at the Crowfoot Residential School on October 10, 1951. The information that we received is as follows:\n\n\"The father is deceased and the mother is responsible for her children. Mrs. Alfreda Royal has taken out a statutory declaration stating that she has been baptized a Catholic and is a member of the Roman Catholic faith. The mother requests the transfer of Floyd and Romana from the Old Sun's School to the Crowfoot School and the admission of Francis (who has not previously attended school) to the Crowfoot School\".\n\nThe decision in this case was as follows:\n\n\"The mother being the responsible parent, is Roman Catholic and children should attend R.C. School\".\n\nAs these children had not returned to the Old Sun's School on September 1, 1951, but enrolled in the Crowfoot School and were still in that school at the time the above-mentioned decision was given, there was no necessity to return them to the Old Sun's School.\n\nWolfchild -\n\nEdward.\n\nThis boy was in the Old Sun's School to June 30, 1951, having been placed in that school on October 1, 1947.\n\nAt the time of his son's admission to the Old Sun's School he indicated that his religious denomination was Church of England. In a declaration dated July 31, 1951, the father stated that he had never been an adherent of, nor had anything to do with the Anglican Church and consequently requested the transfer of his son, Eddie, from the Old Sun's C.E. Residential School to the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nThe decision in this case was as follows:\n\n\"In view of father's declaration, boy should attend the R. C. School.\"\n\nAs Edward Wolfchild did not return to the Old Sun's School at the start of the 1951-52 academic year, he was not returned to that school but has remained in the Crowfoot Residential School.\nTurning Robe\n\nGeorge\n\nThe information received about this case was as follows:\n\n\"Father has taken out a statutory declaration stating that he has no connection with the Anglican Church and has completely severed connections with it and has become an adherent of the Roman Catholic Church. He has had his children baptized in the Roman Catholic faith. There is one son, George, 10, attending the Old Sun's School and the father requests the transfer of the boy to the Crowfoot School.\"\n\nThe decision in this case was as follows:\n\n\"In view of father's declaration, boy should attend the Crowfoot School\".\n\nHowever, as he had returned to the Old Sun's School at the start of the 1951-52 academic year, he is being allowed to remain in that school to the end of June, 1952, in order that his academic work may suffer no interference. The Old Sun's School is drawing the usual per capita grant for him.\n\nIn the last paragraph on page 13 and the top paragraph on page 14, reference is made to official letter of February 29, 1952. The date on the letter, namely February 29, was the date the letter was prepared in the Education Division. Ordinarily, such letter would not reach the Director's office until the following morning at the latest and no statement of policy could be made until the Director had signed the letter.\n\nWith reference to the section on page 14 referring to special grants, it is felt that it would give a more complete picture if consideration were given to the entire amount of government funds that were expended at church-owned residential schools, during the fiscal years mentioned on page 14. With the above in mind, the following statement is submitted:\n### Fiscal Year 1948-49\n\n| Church of England | Repairs and Improvements | New Construction | TOTAL |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| No. of Schools:   |                          |                  |       |\n| 6                 | $5,142.72                | $111,638.36 (Wabasca) | $128,838.73 |\n| Pupilage:         | 325                      | 12,057.65 (Carcross) |       |\n\n#### Roman Catholic:\n\n| No. of Schools: | Repairs and Improvements | New Construction | TOTAL |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| 19               | $42,659.00               | -                | $42,659.00 |\n| Pupilage:        | 2,135                    |                  |       |\n\n### Fiscal Year 1949-50\n\n| Church of England | Repairs and Improvements | New Construction | TOTAL |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| No. of Schools:   |                          |                  |       |\n| 5                 | $3,451.00                | $90,480.10 (Wabasca) | $96,058.43 |\n| Pupilage:         | 290                      | 5,578.33 (Carcross) |       |\n\n#### Roman Catholic:\n\n| No. of Schools: | Repairs and Improvements | New Construction | TOTAL |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| 18               | $55,870.00               | -                | $55,870.00 |\n| Pupilage:        | 1,955                    |                  |       |\n\n### Fiscal Year 1950-51\n\n| Church of England | Repairs and Improvements | New Construction | TOTAL |\n|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| No. of Schools:   |                          |                  |       |\n| 5                 | $1,866.00                | $6,651.99 (Wabasca) | $8,517.99 |\n| Pupilage:         | 290                      |                  |       |\n\n#### Roman Catholic:\n\n| No. of Schools: | Repairs and Improvements | New Construction | TOTAL |\n|-----------------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|\n| 17               | $39,844.00               | $4,996.55        | $34,840.55 |\n| Pupilage:        | 1,995                    |                  |       |\n\n### SUMMARY:\n\n| Church of England | 1948-49 | 1949-50 | 1950-51 | TOTAL |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|\n|                   | $128,838.73 | $99,689.43 | $8,517.99 | $237,045.75 |\n\n| Roman Catholic    | 1948-49 | 1949-50 | 1950-51 | TOTAL |\n|-------------------|---------|---------|---------|-------|\n|                   | $42,659.00 | $55,870.00 | $34,840.55 | $133,369.55 |\nWith reference to the third last paragraph on page 14, which mentions a letter of August, 1950, the following is a copy of the reply sent to Canon Cook at that time:\n\n\"August 29th, 1950.\n\n\"Rev. Canon H. G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration, M.S.C.C.,\n102 Bank Street, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nRe: Your File Est-51-52\n\nI desire to refer to your letters of July 12th and August 15th with reference to special grants for equipment and repairs to the Church-owned Schools as recorded on page M-48 of the \"Public Accounts of Canada 1949\".\n\nIn your letter you compare the average expenditure by the number of schools concerned. It is felt that a fairer comparison is on the per capita basis. The authorized pupilage at the 19 Church-owned Roman Catholic Schools is 2135. The expenditure for the fiscal year 1948-49 was $42,659.01. This makes an average expenditure per pupil of $19.98.\n\nThe authorized pupilage at the 6 Church-owned Church of England Schools is 325. The expenditure was $5,142.70. This makes an average expenditure per pupil of $15.82.\n\nI might also point out that during the fiscal year 1948-49 (see page M-46) there was the following expenditure at the Church of England Schools:\n\n| School     | Expenditure |\n|------------|-------------|\n| Wabasca    | $111,638.36 |\n| Carcross   | $12,057.65  |\n\n$123,696.01\n\nThere was no corresponding expenditure at any of the Roman Catholic Church-owned schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\"\nTop of page 7  Re: Carcross Residential School\n\nRe: Jerry Johnson -\n\nThis boy was admitted to the Carcross Residential School on September 1, 1950. The application form stated that his religion was Roman Catholic and attached to it was a statement from the father expressing a desire to have his son, Jerry, attend the Carcross School.\n\nThe application form should have been questioned at that time but reference to our file indicates that such action was not taken, but that his admission was approved in a letter dated December 27, 1950, signed by the previous Superintendent of Education.\n\nPage 10 - Dillon Children\n\nApplication forms were received for the admission of three children,\n\nMary, age 7,\nJames Roy, age 9, and\nRose, age 11,\n\nto the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School. The application forms stated their religious denomination to be Anglican. The following ruling was made:\n\n\"Except if the mother is of the Roman Catholic faith, the children, who are presumably of the same religion as their father, should attend Protestant School\".\n\nAs the correspondence stated that the mother was Anglican, Superintendent Davis was advised that the children could remain in the Onion Lake R.C. School to June 30, 1952, in order that there might be no interference with their education, but that they must be discharged from the Onion Lake R.C. School on June 30, 1952.\nMEMORANDUM FOR:\n\nMAJOR MACKAY\n\nThe Minister met Most Reverend Dr. Barfoot on Monday June 23rd and at a discussion of the brief attached to Right Reverend Robert Jefferson's letter dated June 13th. Following the interview the Minister promised:\n\nA. A full answer as to the cases.\n\nB. A summary of capital and maintenance expenditures since the war.\n\nWould you please have a draft letter prepared for the Minister's signature and submit the text to me.\n\nThe Minister also made the statement that he would try to provide more space at Fort George next year.\n\nLaval Fortier.\nJuly 2, 1952.\n\nRe: Problem of Admittance to Residential Schools of Indian Children of uncertain religious affiliation.\n\n1. Jimmie James,\n   Paddy James,\n   Albert Paul James.\n\nThis family is from the Stikine Agency, in the Province of British Columbia, and the application forms requested that the three children be admitted to the Carcross (C.E.) Residential School.\n\nThe religion of the children was not mentioned on the form but a statement attached to the form and signed by the father read as follows: \"I do fully understand that this is a Protestant school and not a Roman Catholic\".\n\nSuperintendent Clark was written regarding the religion of the children and he replied that the family is of the Roman Catholic faith.\n\nConsequently, it was decided that these children should attend a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices.\n\n2. Kenneth Johnson\n\nThis boy comes from the Stikine Agency, British Columbia, and application was made for his admission to the Carcross (C.E.) Residential School.\n\nThe application form was signed by the father and stated that the religion of the boy was Roman Catholic. Attached to the application form was a statement from the father.\nreading as follows:\n\n\"I hereby state that I wish the under-named child to enter Carcross Residential School for term commencing September 4th, 1951. I do fully understand that this is a Protestant school and not Roman Catholic\".\n\nAs the application form stated that the boy's religion was Roman Catholic, his admission to the Carcross (C.E.) School was refused.\n\n3. George Dreafer,\n   John James Dreafer\n\nThis family comes from the Meadow Lake Agency in the Province of Saskatchewan, and both parents are stated to be living.\n\nThe application forms stated that the religion was Roman Catholic and the forms were signed by the father.\n\nAttached to the forms was a letter signed by the mother, expressing her desire to have the boys admitted to the Las la Range (C.E.) Residential School.\n\nIt was ruled that the applicant being Roman Catholic, the children should attend a Roman Catholic school.\n\nIn view of recent representations in regard to the above children, the Indian Superintendent has been written for additional information.\n4. Annie Heathen (or Heather)\nDora\n\nThis family is from the Meadow Lake Agency in the Province of Saskatchewan and both parents are stated to be living.\n\nThe application forms stated that their religion is Anglican but the father signed the application forms, requesting their admission to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nThe Department refused to approve their admission to the Onion Lake R.C. School as their religion is stated to be Anglican.\n\n5. George Wesley\nBertie Andrew Wesley\n\nThis family is from the James Bay Agency.\n\nWhen the application forms were received, the religion of the children was stated to be Roman Catholic and the forms were signed by the father. The application forms were approved by the local Indian Superintendent and as the forms appeared to be in order the Department approved their admission to the Albany R.C. Residential School.\n\nSubsequently we received a protest against their admission to the school mentioned, from the Right Reverend Neville Clarke, Suffragan Bishop of Moose Cree.\n\nOn receipt of this protest, Indian Superintendent Allan was again written and we have been informed that Wesley and his present wife were married in the Anglican Church at Moose Factory on November 22, 1943.\n\nIn view of this additional information it was ruled that these children should be considered as Anglicans and consequently should discontinue attending the Albany (R.C.) Residential School.\n6. Phyllis Mayfield,\n   Bert Nelson Mayfield,\n   Walter Mayfield\n\nThis family is from the Blackfoot Agency,\nProvince of Alberta.\n\nThe first two mentioned children attended the\nOld Sun (C.E.) Residential School until June 30, 1951. As\nfar as the Department is aware, Walter had not attended\nany school.\n\nThe application forms for their admission to\nthe Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School were signed by their\nmother and the Indian Superintendent advised the Department\nthat the father was deceased and the mother is responsible\nfor the children.\n\nAttached to the application forms was a\nstatutory declaration signed by the mother, stating that she\nhas been baptized a Catholic, is a member of the Roman Catholic\nChurch and wants her children placed in the Crowfoot Residen-\ntial School.\n\nFrom the information just mentioned, it was\nconsidered that the mother is the responsible parent and\nthat as she states she is Roman Catholic the children should\nattend the Roman Catholic School.\n\n7. David Yellowhouse\n   Percy \"\n   Marie \"\n   Sylvia \"\n\nThis family is from the Blackfoot Agency,\nProvince of Alberta. All of the children mentioned above\nhad attended the Old Sun (C.E.) Residential School to\nJune 30, 1951.\n\nApplications were received for the transfer\nof these children from the Old Sun (C.E.) Residential School\nto the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School.\nThe father signed the application forms and also sent to the Department a statutory declaration stating that he had severed any connection with the Anglican Church. He further stated that he had been baptized a Catholic and is a member of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIt was ruled that in view of the father's declaration the children should attend the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School.\n\n8. Floyd Royal,\nRomana Royal,\nFrancis Royal\n\nThis family is from the Blackfoot Agency, Province of Alberta. The two first mentioned children were enrolled at the old Sun (C.E.) Residential school to June 30, 1951. They did not return to this school when it re-opened on September 1, 1951.\n\nSubsequently, the Department received applications for their admission to the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School. The application forms were signed by the mother as the father is deceased.\n\nThe mother also forwarded a statutory declaration stating that she had been baptized a Catholic and is a member of the Roman Catholic faith. She requested the transfer of Floyd and Romana from the Old Sun School to the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School and the admission of Francis (who had not previously attended school) to the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nIt was ruled that as the mother is the responsible parent and states that she is a Roman Catholic, the children should attend the Crowfoot (R.C.) School.\n9. Edward Wolfchild\n\nThis family is from the Blackfoot Agency in the Province of Alberta.\n\nThis boy was in the Old Sun (C.E.) School to June 30, 1951. Both parents are stated to be living.\n\nThe application for his admission to the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School was signed by his father. A declaration was attached from the father stating that he had never been an adherent of, nor had anything to do with the Anglican Church and consequently requested the transfer of his son from the Old Sun (C.E.) Residential School to the Crowfoot (R.C.) Residential School.\n\nIn view of the father's declaration it was ruled that the boy should attend the Crowfoot School.\n\n10. George Turning Robe\n\nThis family is from the Blackfoot Agency, Province of Alberta.\n\nThis boy had attended the Old Sun (C.E.) Residential School to June 30, 1951.\n\nAn application form, signed by the father, was received and this form stated the religion to be Roman Catholic. Attached to the application form was a statutory declaration from the father saying that he had completely severed connections with the Anglican Church and had become an adherent of the Roman Catholic Church. He further stated that he had his children baptized in the Roman Catholic faith and requested the transfer of his son George to the Crowfoot (R.C.) School.\n\nIn view of the father's declaration it was ruled that the boy should attend the Crowfoot School.\n11. Mary Dillon\nJames Roy Dillon\nRose Dillon\n\nThis family is from the Meadow Lake Agency, in the Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nApplications were received for the admission of these three children to the Onion Lake R.C. Residential School.\n\nThe application forms were signed by the father and stated the religion to be Anglican.\n\nWhen these applications were received, further inquiries were made and the Department was informed by the Indian Superintendent that the family is either Anglican or Pagan.\n\nIn view of the information just mentioned, it was ruled that the Department could not approve the admission of these children to the Onion Lake R.C. School.\n\n12. Clyde Blackjack\n\nThis boy is an orphan, both parents being dead. The first information that we received regarding him was contained in a letter from Bishop Coudert (R.C. Bishop of Yukon). He stated that the Blackjack family had joined the Catholic Church nearly 10 years previously and that two of the other children in the family had attended the Grouard (R.C.) Residential School. Bishop Coudert requested that Clyde be placed in the Lower Post (R.C.) Residential School.\n\nThe information contained in Bishop Coudert's letter was forwarded to the Indian Superintendent, Mr. Meek, and he subsequently wrote to the effect that one of the boy's brothers thought Clyde should be placed in the Carcross (C.R.) Residential School. Later, Mr. Meek forwarded to us an application form signed by his brother Roddy Blackjack. This stated that the boy's religion was Roman Catholic.\n\nThe Department approved the boy's admission to the Lower Post (R.C.) Residential School.\n## Statement Re: Church Owned Residential Schools\n\n| Year    | Pupilage | Expenditures for Repairs & Equipment | Capital Expenditures |\n|---------|----------|-------------------------------------|----------------------|\n| **1946-47** |          |                                     |                      |\n| C. of E.

Kenneth Johnson\n\nThe application form for this boy was not submitted to your office.\n\nI enclose for your information the correspondence regarding the application.\n\nYou will note that the declaration signed by the father reads as follows, \"I do fully understand that this is a Protestant school and not a Roman Catholic\".\n\nFrom the above statement it is reasonable to presume that the father is a Roman Catholic. I felt that this was a similar case to the James children upon whom you had made a ruling and consequently Superintendent Meek was advised that the Department was not prepared to approve the admission of Kenneth Johnson to the Carcross C.E. Residential School.\n\nFor your information I enclose the correspondence regarding the Johnson boy marked \"A\" and the James children marked \"B\".\n9. Edward Wolfchild\n\nI enclose the correspondence regarding the request for the admission of six children to the Crowfoot Residential School.\n\nThe correspondence which refers particularly to Edward Wolfchild is marked \"C\". You will note that when this boy was placed in the Old Sun's C.E. Residential School on October 1, 1947 his religious denomination was stated to be Church of England.\n\nHowever, the Statutory Declaration made on July 31, 1951 states that the father of Edward Wolfchild has been raised in the Roman Catholic faith (see paragraph 2 of Statutory Declaration).\n\nII. Mary Dillon\nJames Roy Dillon\nRose Dillon\n\nI enclose the correspondence with reference to the above children and marked \"D\". You will note particularly Indian Superintendent Davis' letter of February 5, 1952. Paragraph two reads:\n\n\"With regard to the Dillons, Mrs. Dillon was Mary Ann Kuyuckooses of Loon Lake. Her grandfather is pagan, her mother is deceased and she herself is either Anglican or pagan. We cannot locate a copy of their marriage registration\".\n\nOn reviewing the correspondence I find that the term \"either Anglican or pagan\" referred only to the mother.

To date such a memorandum has not reached my office.\n\nI would particularly appreciate having further information and figures on the information you quoted regarding the special grant to Church-owned Schools. I have gone over my figures time and time again with the information that I have and I still come to the conclusion that Indian Affairs Branch gave to the Roman Catholic Church-owned Schools a grant far greater in proportion than that received by Church of England Church-owned Schools. I have taken the pupilage of the respective Schools receiving such grants and divided it into the total amount of the grants given the respective denominational schools and my figures still do not reconcile with your statement that the proportion was just about even.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHenry F.

Wright, D.D.,\nBishop of Algoma,\nBishopsgate,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ontario.\n\nDear Bishop Wright:\n\nI received your letter of October 11, advising me that the following motion had been passed at a recent meeting of the House of Bishops of the Church of England in Canada:\n\n\"That this House of Bishops requests the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration that section 117 of the Indian Act be amended to its original form, in which the consent of both parents be required when enrolling children in Indian Schools.\"\n\nSection 16 of the former Indian Act read as follows:\n\nSubsection 1 - \"Every Indian child between the full ages of seven and sixteen years who is physically able shall attend each day, industrial or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General (Minister) for the full periods during which such school is open each year; provided that where it has been made to appear to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General (Minister) that it would be detrimental to any particular Indian child to have it discharged from school on obtaining the full age of sixteen years, the Superintendent General (Minister) may direct that such child be detained...\"\nat school, for such further period as may seem to be advisable, but not beyond the full age of eighteen years, and in such case the provisions of this section with respect to truancy shall apply to such child and its parents, guardians or persons with whom such child resides during such further period of school attendance.\"\n\nSubsection 2 - \"Such school shall be the nearest available school of the kind required, and no Protestant child shall be assigned to a Roman Catholic school or a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no Roman Catholic child shall be assigned to a Protestant school or a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nSection 116 of Bill 297, which was subsequently withdrawn, read as follows:\n\n\"Every Indian child who is required to attend school shall attend such school as the Minister may designate, but no child who is in the care or legal custody of, or whose parent or guardian is a Protestant, shall be assigned to a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices, and no child who is in the care or legal custody of, or whose parent or guardian is a Roman Catholic, shall be assigned to a school conducted under Protestant auspices.\"\n\nSection 117 of the Indian Act, Chapter 39, Statutes of Canada, 1875, reads:\n\n\"Every Indian child who is required to attend school shall attend such school as the Minister may designate, but no child whose parent is a Protestant shall be assigned to a school conducted under Roman Catholic auspices and no child whose parent is a Roman Catholic shall be assigned to a school conducted under Protestant auspices, except by written direction of the parent.\"\nYou will note that none of the clauses cited above mention that the consent of both parents is required when enrolling children in Indian schools. As a result, I am at a loss to understand exactly what you mean when you request \"that section 117 of the Indian Act be amended to its original form, in which the consent of both parents be required when enrolling children in Indian schools\".\n\nOur files have been checked very carefully and the only previous representation that we have been able to locate from the Church of England in Canada was contained in a letter dated September 28, 1930, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPP/EM\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 26, 1932.\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nRight Reverend William L.

In this connection, may I refer you to Mr. Davey's letter of October 31st addressed to Reverend Canon Cook, a copy of which was sent to your office.\n\nAttached for your information is a copy of a letter sent by Canon Cook to the various Bishops throughout Canada.\n\n(sgd) Philip Phelan\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nOctober 31st, 1952.\n\nReverend Canon H.G. Cook, D.D.,\nSuperintendent,\nThe Indian School Administration,\nM. S. C. C.,\n102 Bank Street,\nOttawa 4, Ontario.\n\nDear Canon Cook:\n\nWith reference to our telephone conversation this morning, I am forwarding herewith copies of our salary schedule. You will note that teachers are placed in one of four classifications, Grade I, Grade II, Grade III and Grade IV. Teachers with no certification are rated as Grade I; teachers with Second Class Certificates are rated as Grade II; teachers with First Class Certificates are rated as Grade III; and specialists such as primary teachers, who are specially qualified and devote at least half of the teaching time to the work in which they have had special training, are classified as Grade IV.\n\nIn general, the classification of Welfare Teacher is restricted to those schools which are located in the far north and where service is expected for twelve months of the year. We have very few of this classification, and I feel that it would be well if those to whom you are sending this information were warned that the classification is given only under very special circumstances, and after a very careful review by the department of all circumstances.\n\nA maximum of five years of credit may be given for previous experience in placing teachers on the salary scale, except where the teacher is simply being transferred from one Indian school to another. However, if there is any break in service and the teacher has more than five years' experience, the teacher stands as having five years of experience only, and is placed on the salary schedule at the sixth period.\n\nAs you are aware, teachers employed in day schools operating for the full academic year of ten months, may be classified for superannuation purposes as Civil Servants,\nproviding they meet the qualifications, one of which is two years of satisfactory service with this department. Such a classification carries with it all the benefits of the Federal Civil Service Superannuation scheme. Immediately on appointment, however, teachers contribute to the pension fund in accordance with the provisions of the Act which apply to Civil Servants. If they make application and are accepted as Civil Servants for the purposes of superannuation, their pension contributions are transferred to their credit under this scheme. If they leave the service before they are pensionable, all their contributions are returned to them.\n\nI think it would be well if you would tell the Bishops that the department welcomes the nomination of qualified teachers from the Churches but the actual appointment is made by the department. However, the department usually accepts the nomination, providing the teacher is qualified and there are no other grounds for anticipating that the appointment would not be satisfactory. The department, of course, has full control of all teachers employed in our day schools and may dismiss a teacher without reference to the nominating authority.\n\nThe policy outlined in the preceding paragraph has been in general practice for a number of years, and I merely mention it so that there shall be no misunderstanding.\n\nAs you know, there is at present a very acute shortage of teachers throughout Canada. A recent editorial in the \"Ottawa Citizen\" gave the number as 10,000. This is somewhat in excess of what is usually quoted, but there is no doubt that the shortage runs in the thousands. Because of this, the department must be in a position to engage teachers without delay and is not obligated to wait for the nomination of the Bishop if a suitable applicant is available. I am asking the Regional Supervisors to inform the Bishops of vacancies as soon as possible, and it would be helpful if the Bishops could submit the names of applicants immediately they are known without waiting for vacancies to occur. The department begins advertising in April for teachers for the term commencing September.\n\nI wish to thank you for your very kind offer to solicit the support of the Bishops of the Anglican Church in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"R. F. Davey\"\n\nR.F. Davey,\nAsst. Superintendent of Education\nNovember 12th, 1952.\n\nTo: Mr. R.S. Davis,\n    Mr. J.P.B. Ostrander,\n    Mr. G.H. Gooderham\n    Mr. H.G.

However I respectfully bring this matter to your attention in the hope that you will see fit to encourage school teachers of our denomination more seriously to consider the possibilities of service, to the Indian peoples and their Church, offered by Indian Affairs Branch through its plan for staffing Indian Day Schools.\n\nOver the last month or six weeks in speaking with a number of Agency Superintendents and Regional Inspectors of Indian Schools I was surprised to learn that, without exception, each lamented the fact that too few non-Roman teachers (and particularly Anglican teachers) were offering themselves as teachers for Indian Day Schools. Apparently this unhappy situation exists largely for three reasons: (1) Anglican teachers do not know that such positions are available, and/or (2) the Bishops of our Church do not realize they have the privilege of nominating candidates to fill teaching vacancies in Indian Day Schools where the majority of pupils are Anglican, and/or (3) Knowing of their privilege the Bishop is unfamiliar with the procedure which Indian Affairs Branch has to follow in sanctioning appointments to such vacancies.\n\nThe following quotations, taken from a recently received letter from Mr. R.F. Davey, Assistant Superintendent of Education for Indian Affairs, are of interest and explain the attached salary schedule.\n\n\"The Education Division of Indian Affairs Branch welcomes the nomination of qualified teachers from the Churches but the actual appointment is made by...\"\nthe department. However, the department usually accepts the nomination, providing the teacher is qualified and there are no other grounds for anticipating that the appointment would not be satisfactory.

Rev. Harold E. Sexton, D.D.,\nArchbishop of British Columbia,\n912, Vancouver Street,\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nDear Archbishop Sexton,\n\nAs you are aware, four vacancies were created by the resignation of teachers from the Alert Bay Indian Day School. Mr. Parminter, our new Inspector, has four teachers in view for these positions and I would appreciate your approval of these applicants. The problem of securing fully qualified teachers is indeed serious and we consider ourselves fortunate in having trained personnel available for Alert Bay. We would prefer to place in Church of England schools teachers of that denomination but have received few applications from Anglicans. It is my hope that the following applicants will receive your nomination:\n\nMrs. Beryl Gilbert has a permanent second class certificate and has had seven years teaching experience in Alberta. She is a sincere and evidently capable person, is a member of the United Church and recommended by Dr. Bunt.\n\nMrs. Clare Pearson is a widow, belonging to the Church of England, and has a second class teaching certificate. This teacher has taught for fourteen years, has attended several Summer School sessions, and was recommended for Alert Bay by the Department at Ottawa.\n\nMrs. Constance Culver is English by birth and a member of the United Church. She also has fourteen years experience, has attended Summer Sessions and has given good service in other Indian Schools in British Columbia.\n\nMrs. Alice M. Cline is also a widow who belongs to the United Church. She has four years teaching experience and comes highly recommended by Dr. King, the former Chief Inspector of Schools for the province of British Columbia.\nFor the Turnour Island School, I would appreciate your nomination of Mrs. Winnifred McLeod, a Presbyterian, with a second class certificate, who has an excellent record both as a teacher and as a citizen. She is married to a Naval veteran from First World War who is now on burnt-out pension.\n\nI do hope that all the above applicants meet with your approval and would greatly appreciate an early reply from you to this effect.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nBISHOP'S CLOSE\n906 Vancouver Street\nVictoria, British Columbia.\n\n25th August, 1952.\n\nDear Mr. Arneil,\n\nThank you for your letter of August 22nd. I am greatly disturbed that you propose to appoint only one Anglican teacher to the Alert Bay Indian Day School, partly because (it seems to me) that responsible Anglican leaders have not been made aware of the needs. It was not until my recent visit to Alert Bay, and your subsequent call upon me, that I knew of the exact position. I am sorry that I cannot acquiesce in your recommendations, except in the case of Mrs. Clare Pearson, whom I would gladly nominate. It seems to me that Anglican teachers would be forthcoming, if the need were made known. In days gone by, it was my custom to call for applicants through our Cathedral Leaflet, and by letters to the Clergy, and I would gladly follow this procedure in the future when given adequate notice of vacancies. All the Archbishops and Bishops of Canada will be meeting next week in London, Ontario, and I hope you will not object to your letter being included in our discussions.\n\nBelieve me to be,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR\n\nIn a telephone conversation with the Minister this morning he requested me to locate letters dated May 4, 1940, and November 22, 1945, addressed to Right Reverend J. Lefthouse, D.D., Bishop of Keewatin.\n\nWe have not been able to locate any letter dated May 4, 1940, but Bishop Lefthouse may have intended to refer to a letter dated May 6, 1940.\n\nI attach a copy of the latter letter, also a copy of a letter dated November 22, 1945.\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\n[Handwritten note:]\nThese letters are on #10 Roy School\nOn page 17 of SATURDAY NIGHT for November 29, 1952, the following appeared:\n\nAnglicans were early in the field of education with residential schools for the Indians. They built and equipped several. Today they have thirteen across Canada with an enrolment of nearly 2,000 and a list of some hundreds waiting for the Government to build new schools to replace the three burnt down in the last fifteen years. On several reserves where the Indians can stay all the year round they operate day schools which have carried promising pupils into High School and matriculation. Increased assistance from the Dominion Government has brightened the picture during the last ten years.\n\nArticle was written by Bishop Hallam.\nIn his letter Canon Cook states there are 17 Roman Catholic Church-owned Residential Schools. The Public Accounts 1951 Page c.c. lists 17 Roman Catholic Schools for which expenditures were made for repairs and equipment. It will be noted that the Fort George R.C. School is not included in this list as no expenditures for repairs and equipment for this school were made during that year. There were actually 18 Church-owned Roman Catholic schools in operation during 1950-51.\n\nDuring 1950-51 there were expenditures made for six Church-owned Church of England schools. These are the five schools listed in Public Accounts 1951, page c.c. 17 plus Wabasca C.E. school which became Government-owned in March 1952. This school was not listed in Public Accounts 1951 as no expenditures were made for repairs to and purchase of equipment for the Church-owned buildings at this school.\nIn his letter Canon Cook states there are 17 Roman Catholic Church-owned Residential Schools.

This school was not listed in Public Accounts 1951 as no expenditures were made for repairs to and purchase of equipment for the Church-owned buildings at this school.\nBy Order in Council P.C. 1655 dated March 21, 1952, the Department was authorized to purchase for Indian school purposes the land and the Wabasca C.E. School buildings thereon. In March 1952 a payment of $6,170 was made to the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.\n\nWith the payment of this account the school became Government-owned.\n\nFor the fiscal year 1952-53 Treasury officials have allowed the payment of all accounts for this school to be charged against Government-owned residential schools appropriation. Prior to April 1, 1952 expenditures for repairs and new equipment for this school were charged to Church-owned residential school appropriations.\n\nIn 1949-50, Public Accounts 1950, page cc20 expenditures for repairs and new equipment for this school were listed under the heading dealing with expenditures for Church-owned schools.\n\nDuring 1949-50, the Department was completing the construction of a dormitory block for which the expenditure was $90,480.10, Public Accounts 1950 page c.c.16. In 1948-49 the Department spent $111,638.36 for this building, Public Accounts 1949 page M46.\n\nAlthough there is no expenditure shown under the heading dealing with repairs and equipment in the Public Accounts 1951 for the Wabasca C.E. Residential School, Treasury reports indicate that $470.55 was spent for a watchman and vocational training teacher; $1,133.48 repairs to equipment and $52.47 for sundries. As the Public Accounts 1951 deals with expenditures for equipment and repairs to buildings, the above-mentioned expenditures could not be included under this heading.\nSince the Wabasca C.E.

F. Barfoot, M.A., D.D.,\nPrimate of All Canada,\nThe Church of England in Canada,\n10029 - 103rd Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\n\nDear Archbishop Barfoot,\n\nI have received your letter of October 7th in which you bring to my attention a report regarding the replacement of the Guy (Sturgeon Landing) Indian Residential School which was recently destroyed by fire. In this regard I wish to say that no consideration can be given to the replacement of this school for the R.C. children at The Pas or elsewhere before a complete school survey is made of the situation.\n\nThere were in excess of 100 children attending the Guy School at the time of the fire, 65 of whom have been moved to temporary Roman Catholic Church-owned quarters at The Pas. The remaining children have been returned to their respective reserves in the hope that accommodation will be found for them in day schools or existing residential schools.\n\nThe department is providing temporary makeshift classroom accommodation at The Pas for the 65 children mentioned. This, together with the dormitory and other space made available by the Roman Catholic Mission, should meet the immediate needs of this group until such time as a complete survey of the whole area, formerly served by the Guy School, and surrounding territory can be made. The arrangements being made should not in any sense be regarded as replacement of the Guy School. The construction of a residential school would cost over half a million dollars and I wish to inform you that no provision has been made in the 1953-54 estimates nor in the 1954-55 estimates for the replacement of this school.\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch have made no comment in response to the charge of favouritism made at the General Synod of the Church of England. It is not the policy of the Branch to do so as the records with respect to expenditures and the reasons for making such expenditures are available at any time, and the Branch officials know that the Minister will make any necessary policy announcements.\n\nWith regard to the matter of high schools mentioned in the article to which you have referred, I may say that it is not the policy of this Department to build high schools. In 1948 and 1949, representations were made to the Department by the Oblate Order to purchase their Lebret Scholasticate at Lebret, Saskatchewan, for use as a departmental technical high school. This the Department refused to do on the grounds that it was contrary to policy to establish high schools, our policy being to encourage and assist Indian children to attend Provincial high schools. As you know, the Department provides the fullest opportunity for Indian children to complete entrance to high school. In addition to this, however, assistance is extended to Indian children who show aptitude and have the recommendation of the teacher in charge of the school and the school inspector to attend high school and, in some cases, university, where the results indicate that this should be done. Indian parents in a position to do so, however, are expected to meet part of the costs involved.\n\nAt a few centres, children are housed at residential schools in order that they can attend the local high school. In a few of our residential schools, high school grades are taught where the local high school is not in a position, because of lack of accommodation, to accept Indian pupils or arrangements for their attendance at high school cannot be made because of other circumstances.\n\nThe Mackay Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on March 19, 1933. The authorized enrolment at the time was 60. Following the fire, the Church of England requested from time to time that consideration be given to replacing the school. We have no record of the department having made any commitment in this regard. It is our intention however, in view of your representations, to carry out a complete school survey in order to determine the school needs of the area formerly served by the Mackay School.\nI should like, at this time, to assure you that, difficult as the problem has been and continues to be, the Indian Affairs Branch endeavours to deal with the provision of residential school accommodation as fairly as possible considering the need and all the other circumstances involved in making decisions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.E. Harris\nOttawa, November 26, 1958.\n\nThe Most Reverend W.F. Barfoot, M.A., D.D.,\nPrimate of All Canada,\nThe Church of England in Canada,\n103rd Street,\nEDMONTON, Alberta.\n\nDear Archbishop Barfoot:\n\nI have received your letter of October 7th, in which you bring to my attention a report regarding the replacement of the Guy (Sturgeon Landing) Indian Residential School which was recently destroyed by fire. In this regard I wish to say that no consideration can be given to the replacement of this school for the R.C. children at The Pas or elsewhere before a complete school survey is made of the situation.\n\nThere were in excess of 100 children attending the Guy School at the time of the fire, 65 of whom have been moved to temporary Roman Catholic Church-owned quarters at The Pas. The remaining children have been returned to their respective reserves in the hope that accommodation will be found for them in day schools or existing residential schools.\n\nThe department intends to provide temporary makeshift classroom accommodation at The Pas for the 65 children mentioned. This, together with the dormitory and other space made available by the Roman Catholic Mission, should meet the needs of this group until such time as a complete survey of the whole area, formerly served by the Guy School, and surrounding territory can be made. The arrangements being made should not in any sense be regarded as replacement of the Guy School. The construction of a residential school would cost over half a million dollars and I wish to inform you that no provision has been made in the 1953-54 estimates for the replacement of this school.\nThe officials of the Indian Affairs Branch have made no comment in response to the charge of favouritism made at the General Synod of the Church of England. It is not the policy of the Branch to do so as the records with respect to expenditures and the reasons for making such expenditures are available at any time, and the Branch knows that the Minister will make any necessary policy announcements.\n\nWith regard to the matter of high schools mentioned in the article to which you have referred, I may say that it is not the policy of this department to build high schools. In 1948 and 1949, representations were made to the department by the Oblate Order to purchase their Lebret Scholasticate at Lebret, Saskatchewan, for use as a departmental technical high school. This the department refused to do on the grounds that it was contrary to policy to establish high schools, our policy being to encourage and assist Indian children to attend Provincial high schools. As you know, the department provides the fullest opportunity for Indian children to complete entrance to high school. In addition to this, however, assistance is extended to Indian children who show aptitude and have the recommendation of the teacher in charge of the school and the school inspector to attend high school and, in some cases, university, where the results indicate that this should be done. Indian parents in a position to do so, however, are expected to meet part of the costs involved.\n\nAt a few centres, children are housed at residential schools in order that they can attend the local high school. In a few of our residential schools, high school grades are taught where the local high school is not in a position, because of lack of accommodation, to accept Indian pupils or arrangements for their attendance at high school cannot be made because of other circumstances.\n\nThe Mackay Indian Residential School was destroyed by fire on March 19, 1935. The authorized enrolment at the time was 80. Following the fire, the Church of England requested from time to time that consideration be given to replacing the school. We have no record of the department having made any commitment in this regard. It is our intention however, in view of the representations made, to carry out a complete school survey in order to determine the school needs of the area formerly served by the Mackay School.\nInformation listing the expenditures on Indian Education by years for the period 1945-1951, together with the position with respect to classroom accommodation, is being prepared and will be forwarded to you at an early date.\n\nI should like, at this time, to assure you that, difficult as the problem has been and continues to be, the Indian Affairs Branch endeavours to deal with the provision of residential school accommodation as fairly as possible considering the need and all the other circumstances involved in making decisions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nH.G. Harris\nMEMORANDUM FOR:\n\nMAJOR MACKAY\n\nI am sending you herewith the Minister's file dealing with the Guy and Mackay Residential Schools.\n\nWith regard to the second draft letter prepared for the Primate of the Church of England dated October 24th, I would personally suggest that the last sentence of the first paragraph be deleted and the following substituted:\n\n\"In this regard I wish to say that no consideration can be given to the replacement of this school for the R.C. children at The Pas or elsewhere before a complete school survey is made of the situation\".\n\nWith reference to the first paragraph on page 2 the two last sentences could be deleted and replaced by the following:\n\n\"The construction of a residential school would cost over half a million dollars and I wish to inform you that no provision has been made in this year's estimates for the replacement of this school\".\n\nAs the Bishops who have written concerning the Guy school have all made reference to the reconstruction of the Mackay school and, as I understand that all the necessary information concerning the Mackay school is available, I would suggest, and the Minister has agreed, that this question be dealt with in the reply to Most Reverend Barfoot.\nWould you please have the necessary draft prepared and submitted as soon as possible returning the Minister's file with the suggested reply.\n\nLaval Fortier.\n\nEnc.\nDec. 10th, 1952.\n\nHon. W. E. Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship & Immigration\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI am most grateful for your letter of December 5th, together with a copy of your letter to the Primate. I realize only too well the great difficulties you must face in all decisions with regard to Indian Schools and it is something to be thankful for, that your Department is so anxious to see that our Indian Children receive the best Education possible.\n\nI feel sure that the survey of the school problem in Northern Manitoba will be a great help. I should point out, that at the present time there is no Anglican Residential School in Manitoba and the children from the territory previously covered by the McKay School and Elkhorn School are taken to Prince Albert. This school has already five hundred children and cannot possibly take in more and therefore there are many Anglican Children in the northern part of the province who receive very little schooling at all.\n\nMy immediate concern is the problem of the Children on The Pas Reservation. For some years there has been the promise of a new Day School as the present one-room school is completely inadequate for those now attending and in discussing the matter on my last visit there a few weeks ago, I was informed that there are about seventy-five children unable to attend school because of lack of accommodation. The plan, I understand, is to build a four-room school on the Reserve and I think that all the details in connection with this building have already been dealt with by the Indian Department but there has been no authority given to proceed with the project.\nI expect to be in Ottawa during the last week in January as I have to meet with the Principal Chaplains of the Armed Forces. I would very much like, at that time, to be able to have a short interview with you in order that I may be able to pay my respects to you and perhaps at the same time discuss with you the problems that we are faced with in Northern Manitoba.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Ivor Brandon)\nBishop of Brandon\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DIRECTOR\n\nRe: Letter dated December 10, 1952, addressed to The Minister by Right Reverend I. A. Norris, D.D., Bishop of Brandon.\n\nParagraph 3 of the above letter reads as follows:\n\n\"My immediate concern is the problem of the children on The Pas reservation.

However, the number of children who might attend if adequate day school facilities were available are as follows:\n\nNumber at present attending Pas Day School ........ 33\n\nNumber from Pas Reserve enrolled at the Lac la Ronge Residential School and who could attend a day school on their own reserve ............ 44\n\nNumber of Protestant children at present attending an R.C.

It is possible that increased day school accommodation on the other reserves mentioned above would reduce the number from those reserves at present attending the Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nWith reference to an educational survey in this Agency this Spring, I suggest the following comprise the committee:\n\n1. Regional Supervisor Davis,\n2. Indian Superintendent Law,\n3. Mr. G. H. Marcoux, Regional Inspector of Indian Schools,\n4. Mrs. A. Oddson, Manitoba Social Worker.\n5. Bishop Norris' nominee.\n\nMessrs. Davis, Law and Marcoux will be familiar with the reserves and the educational facilities available. Mrs. Oddson would be in a position to give some assistance regarding the probable number of children whose home conditions are unsuitable and who require institutional care.\nAs you will note, the previous part of this memorandum refers particularly to The Pas Agency. However, you also forwarded to me a copy of a letter dated December 6th from Right Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D., Bishop of Kenora. His communication evidently refers to the Nelson River Agency, and I will submit a separate memorandum on this letter.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nI desire to refer to letter dated December 10, 1952, addressed to the Minister by Right Reverend I. A. Norris, D.D., Bishop of Brandon.\n\nEarly in the spring it is our intention to arrange for a survey of Northern Manitoba to determine the additional educational facilities that should be provided for Indian children residing in that area.\n\nWith reference to the third paragraph of Bishop Norris' letter I may say that the 1949 census shows that there are 922 adherents of the Church of England in The Pas Agency out of a total number of 2477.\n\nThe 1949 census also indicates that the number of children between 7 and 16 in The Pas Agency was 628, and this would indicate that the approximate number of Church of England children in the agency is 249.\n\nAccording to our records there are 150 children enrolled in day schools in The Pas Agency where the teacher is a member of the Church of England. In addition, there are 87 children from this agency enrolled at the Lac la Ronge C.E. Residential School. This makes a total of 237 who are receiving educational advantages.\n\nForty-four (44) of the children from The Pas Agency enrolled at the Lac la Ronge Residential School come from The Pas Reserve. At the present time there is an enrolment of 33 attending the day school on The Pas Reserve and Regional Supervisor Davis reports that there are 22 children on The Pas Reserve not attending school owing to lack of accommodation.\nMr. Davis recommends the erection of a four-room day school on The Pas Reserve, which would accommodate the 55 children mentioned in the preceding paragraph, together with the 44 children who are now enrolled at the Lac la Ronge Residential School.\n\nFunds are provided in the current year's appropriation for the erection of a 3-room school on this reserve, but for various reasons no action has been taken to proceed with the construction of the school. In view of the information now available it is our intention to give immediate consideration to the erection of a 4-room day school on The Pas Reserve.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, November 23, 1945.\n\nMy dear Bishop Lofthouse:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of November 16th, in which you discuss the desirability of establishing an Indian Residential School north of Pas Pas, Manitoba, in the vicinity of the Hudson's Bay Railway.\n\nYou will be interested to learn that this matter has been carefully and sympathetically reviewed during the last year by the officials of this branch and by Foster Alderwood, General Secretary of the M.S.C.C. For a time, it appeared that certain buildings transferred to this department by the military authorities and part of which are now being used as a hospital for the treatment of Indians, would be suitable for Residential School purposes. A closer inspection, however, disclosed the unsuitability of these particular buildings, with the result that no action looking toward their reconstruction has taken place.\n\nIt is true that we are likely to have in the estimates of the coming fiscal year a substantial sum for the construction of school buildings. I am not at all sure, however, at this date that the building materials and the labour necessary to proceed with this program in any satisfactory sense will be available. I can only assure you at this time that we shall be glad to keep the claims of this particular group of Indians on whose behalf you have written constantly in mind, with the object of providing them with educational facilities just as soon as circumstances will permit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Right Reverend J. Lofthouse, D.D.,\nDirector.\nThe Director,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nHon. & dear Sir:-\n\nI have before me a letter dated May 4, 1940, written to me by T. R. L. MacInnes, at that time Secretary of the Indian Affairs Branch, in reply to our oft repeated appeal for an Indian Residential School in the vicinity of the Hudson Bay Railway, in the area between Thicket Portage and Gillam, to serve the Indians in the Hudson Bay district.\n\nIn the above-mentioned letter regrets were expressed that owing to the then war conditions the building programme of the Department was almost completely suspended. The letter closes as follows:\n\n\"I desire to assure you, however, that we shall be glad to file Your Lordship's letter for future reference and carefully review the claim of these Indians for a residential school when the funds at our disposal justify us in taking such action.\"\n\nIt has recently come to our notice that an appropriation of $12,000,000 has been proposed for expansion of services for Indians, and it is understood that a considerable portion of that sum is intended for necessary buildings as part of the re-construction programme of the Government. In view of this proposed expansion I would plead that on behalf of the many Indians in the Hudson Bay area consideration be given to the provision of a Residential School such as would serve the cause of education for the Indian children in the vast area from the west shore of Hudson Bay and inland.\n\nMy latest figures disclose the following Anglican people at the centres listed:\n\n| Location                  | Number |\n|---------------------------|--------|\n| Split Lake                | 450    |\n| York Factory and Shammattawa | 447    |\n| Severn                    | 125    |\n| Churchill                 | 206    |\n| Gillam & district         | 400    |\n| **Total**                 | **1628** |\nThese figures do not include the Cree Indians of the extensive Big Trout Lake Mission where we have approximately 1,100 such Indians who are all members of the Anglican Church. By accurate count there were 1,059 in the year 1939, and to that figure must be added the natural increase, hence our present estimate. The children of this area are too far away to be served by a school in the vicinity of the Hudson Bay Railway, as they are also too far away from the Residential School at Sioux Lookout.\n\nIt is difficult to secure accurate figures of the number of children of school age in the area covered by the afore-noted figures, but our estimate is that there are fully 500 such. By exact count there are at York Factory and Shammattawa alone a total of 134 children of school age for whom no education is available. We have a Day School at York Factory, but for the past three years it has not been possible, in spite of much effort, to secure a teacher, owing to the remote location and the general shortage of teachers. Archdeacon Faries who has been missionary in charge at York Factory, and who has intimate knowledge of the whole area herein mentioned, has been with me at Kenora for three days. I have conferred with him with reference to the above figures, and the need for educational advance.\n\nWe have been quite aware of the difficulties during the years of war, for we too have shared in them. For many years we of the Church of England have ministered to the loyal and devoted native peoples of the north, where for the Crees and Chipewyan Indians very limited educational facilities have been provided, particularly since the loss by fire of the Indian Residential School at The Pas in the year 1933.\n\nMay I respectfully plead that consideration be given, and if possible, definite action taken to provide a Residential School which would serve these worthy native people who have many times on my visits to them, expressed desire for such a school.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\nJ.

A number of our children are now recruited for the School at Prince Albert, which is unreasonably distant, and has a serious effect upon the family life of our Indian people. I trust that the survey, which it is proposed shall be made, will take into consideration this problem of the removal of our children for the greater part of the year to such a distance as deprives them of any contact with their home and parents.\n\nAssuring you of my deep appreciation of the difficulties in the matter of Indian education and welfare,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(signed) J.

I appreciated having it very much.\n\nHowever the figures given on the sheet \"Statement re: Church Owned Residential Schools\" confuses me somewhat and I would appreciate knowing why the \"Capital Expenditure\" has anything to do with the Special Grant to Church owned schools. Money spent on new buildings is money spent on institutions which would remain \"government owned\" and therefore affects the grant to Church owned schools not at all.\n\nI presume that the \"capital expenditures\" recorded under 1948-49 and 1949-50 for C. of E. schools refers to the cost of the new Wabasca School. I understand that from 1949 on the Roman Church had three new schools constructed for them (Lower Post; Hay Lakes and Seven Islands) One wonders how three large institutions could be constructed for an outlay of less than $150,000.00\n\nA clarification of the figures would be appreciated as they are bewildering to Archbishop Barfoot as well as this Administration.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nHenry G. Cook,\nSuperintendent.\nAnglicans Find Ottawa Improves Indian Policy\n\nA favorable change in the federal government's policy toward Indians and Eskimos was indicated in a report issued by the Anglican church administration of the Anglican church, according to Rev. Trevor Jones, who read the report at the Anglican Synod at St. James Parish Hall yesterday.\n\nThe report said that the government had approved for the construction of a residential school for Anglicans near Carcross, Yukon Territory, at a cost of $250,000, and for additions to schools at Bishop Horne School, Moose Factory, and Clithero, Alberta, both at substantial cost.\n\nPreviously, said Mr. Jones, the government's attitude had been that they weren't interested in the Indians and Eskimos because they were dying from tuberculosis. They demonstrated this attitude by not hospitalizing Indians and Eskimos with tuberculosis.\n\nThe change of heart was further demonstrated by the government's increased interest in the welfare and maintaining of the schools, Mr. Jones said.\nboth of the Church and of Indian Affairs Branch. It would be of considerable help to the Church and the Indians alike if allowance could be made in the 1954 - 1955 Estimates for Indian Affairs Branch to assume responsibility of hiring and paying satisfactory teachers for all the Anglican Residential Schools as of September 1, 1954.\n\nYour early consideration of this proposition would be appreciated.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nL. A. Dixon.\nGeneral Secretary.\nMissionary Society of the Church of England in Canada\n\nThe Church House\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\n14th September, 1953.\n\nThe Honourable Walter Harris,\nMinister of Citizenship and Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Harris:\n\nEach year the Indian School Administration of our Missionary Society has found it increasingly difficult to staff, with satisfactory teachers, the classrooms in its residential schools. One of the main difficulties is that the Administration is unable to offer to teachers a salary even approximating that offered by Municipal School Boards, and by Indian Affairs Branch, Educational Division. The per capita grants, as they now exist, are not sufficiently large to allow any further increase in any residential school staff category.\n\nIt must be stated also that our greatest competitor for the services of teachers interested in Indian pupils is Indian Affairs Branch itself. With its system of classroom inspectors and its ability to pay high salaries for teachers, Indian Affairs has been able to entice away from our classrooms a goodly number of former residential school classroom personnel.\n\nAnother factor involved is in the field of superannuation benefits. The Church has been unable, on financial grounds, to establish a staff workers' pension plan. Neither are the years of service of a teacher in a residential school classroom recognized by Provincial Teachers' Organizations. These two factors militate strongly against our success in gaining the services of competent teachers.\n\nAt Alert Bay, the Mohawk Institute, and Moose Factory the plan of having Indian Affairs Branch find and pay the classroom workers has worked out very well indeed - to the satisfaction\nOTTAWA, September 18, 1953.\n\nRev. Canon L.A. Dixon, M.A., D.D.,\nThe Church House,\n604 Jarvis Street,\nToronto 5, Ontario.\n\nDear Doctor Dixon:\n\nI received your letter of September 14th, suggesting that the estimates for 1954-55 be prepared on the basis of the Government paying the salaries of all teachers in Anglican Indian Residential Schools, as of September 1, 1954. This is a matter that is under active consideration at the present time, and I am glad to have an expression of your views.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.E.

The Indians at Poplar River, Norway House, and Crop Lake are all adherents of the Methodist Church.\nMemo. To Mr. Sutherland, D.S.\n\nToronto, Oct. 17, 1891\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th inst. on the subject of the payment of a minimum annual salary of $300 per annum to the teachers of Methodist day schools in Manitoba and the North-West Territories.\n\nIn answer I may inform you that owing to the representations of the Rev. John W. Douglas who recently visited Ottawa, and who appears to have fully explained the position of\nMemo. The teachers of Methodist Indian schools as compared with those of Roman Catholic and Anglican schools, the Sect General has decided to pay the teachers of Methodist schools a guaranteed salary of $300 per annum.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJean obseruant\nWith reference to the payment of salaries of school teachers in West Territories and Manitoba I have the honour to state that owing to the difficulty experienced by the then Indian Commissioner to clearly distinguish in all cases as to what should be considered as aid in the augmentation of salaries it was considered that less injustice would be done if all were placed upon an equal footing and receive the minimum salary of $300. This was done with respect to all denominations except the Methodists.\n\nAs I look upon it that no difference exists between their teachers and those now receiving the minimum salary I would recommend that this body be treated as the rest, and instead of the per capita grant being paid as is now done, they receive the $300. salary as in cases.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Deputy of the Supt. General of Indian Affairs. Your obedient servant,\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., relative to the decision of the Board of Trade, to pay the Reverend Methodist Superintendent in Manitoba or the N.W.Territories a minimum salary of $300 a year each, and in regard thereto to inform you that it is understood that the Superintendent for the schools in Manitoba or the N.W.Territories will not be overpaid or underpaid.\nToronto, 20th Oct. 1871.\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th inst., No. 83,348, stating that the Superintendent General has decided to pay the teachers of the Methodist Indian schools a guaranteed salary of $300 per annum as is done in the case of teachers of Roman Catholic and Anglican schools.

Griffith\n\nAsks for increase of salary to teachers at Oka and (1)\n\nCaytonawaga - wants depth moved pay $200 each - also church for the use -\n\nAlso asks for departmental aid to advancing pupils say $50 per year to enable them to be promoted to the higher grades -\n\nSeals for repairs\nOttawa, September 27th, 1904.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nWill you please let me have a report at once on the nature of the schools at Oka and Caughnawaga, the salaries paid the teachers and by whom.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, 28th September, 1904.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of yesterday's date I beg to say that there are two schools at Oka, conducted by the Methodist Church, one called the Oka Village and the other the Oka Country. The Department contributed last year $125.00 towards the salary of the teacher of the first school and $100.00 towards the second.\n\nProvision is made in the current year's Estimates for an increase of $25.00 to the Oka Country School, making the Department's contribution to each school for this year $125.00. The enrolment at the Oka Village School for last year was 21 with an average attendance of 12; at the Oka Country School the enrolment was 21 with an average attendance of 8.\n\nWith regard to the school conducted by the Methodists at the Caughnawaga Reserve called the Caughnawaga Mission, I beg to say that the Department has hitherto contributed $125.00 towards the teacher's salary, but in this year's Estimates a sum of $250.00 is voted for this purpose. The enrolment at this school for last year was 42 with an average attendance of 15.\n\nThere are two other schools on the Caughnawaga Reserve under the auspices of the Roman Catholics, one for boys and the other for girls: the boys' school having an enrolment of 117 last year with an average attendance of 40. The Principal of the boys' school was paid $450.00 and his Assistant $300.00. The girls' school had an enrolment\nenrolment of 79 for last year with an average of 44. $300.00 was paid to the Principal and $200.00 to her Assistant. The salaries of both these teachers have been increased this year by $50.00.\n\nWith regard to the two Oka Schools and the Mission School at Caughnawaga I may say that these schools are managed entirely by the Methodists. They appoint the teachers and pay the salaries. The Department's contributions being sent to the Missionary Society, and I understand that they supplement the amount granted by the Department in each case.\n\nThe salaries for the Catholic Schools at Caughnawaga are paid direct to the teachers by the Department.\n\nMartin Breton\nOttawa, September 27th, 1904.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nWill you please let me know if there are some accounts for repairs to the school at Caughnawaga still unpaid and if so why are they not attended to?\n\nD. S.G. I. A.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Sept 28th 1904\n\nAccountant\n\nThere does not appear to be any accounts unpaid that have been received in connection with the repairs to Oka or Caughnawaga Schools. Repairs have been authorized in connection with the Oka School but the accounts have not been received yet.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nMatters discussed with Rev. Dr. Sutherland.\n\nBuilding at Chilliwack.\u2014This is not suitable at present for the Principal's residence but the office should be there.\n\nProvision should be made for the 100 pupils for which accommodation is provided.\n\nCowichan\u2014\n\nLand is an important question there. See if the Quamichan Reserve is large enough for the band. (This may have to stand until Dr. Sutherland visits B.C. in May).\n\nMorley\u2014Increased room and increased per capita.\n\nNorway House\n\nThe same.\n\nRed Deer\n\nGod's Lake\n\nBrandon\u2014Department should provide transport to school for all alike.\n\nMuncey\u2014Per capita grant not sufficient.\n\nCaughnawage and Oka Schools\u2014The question is submitted whether the Gov't. should not take them over.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRegarding matters discussed with the Rev.\n\nDr. Sutherland:\n\nCoqualeetza Home:\n\nDr. Sutherland has applied for a grant of $1,500 to assist in erecting a residence for the Principal at Coqualeetza Home. While the matter had the question in debate, the Church authorities proceeded with the building and before long I presume it will be erected and ready for occupation. When this occurs no doubt we will be approached as regards the proposed grant and the matter may then be decided. My own view is that the grant should be made, there will be sufficient funds in the British Columbia vote to make the expenditure without any special appropriation. So pupils at $130 is now the per capita grant for this school, an ample one I think, and it is doubtful whether it should be increased. This school stands at the head of the list for pupilage. The highest number of pupils at any Industrial school is 50.\n\nRed Deer:\n\nThe Department granted $500 for a team of horses and extra implements for this school to give the Principal additional outfit for Spring work. He applied through the Commissioner's office for residences for the teachers, and hospital accommodation. The requisition did not contain sufficient information and the expenditure has been referred back to the Indian Commissioner.\n\nMuncey: Mount Elgin Institute.\n\nThe claim is made that the per capita grant is not sufficient at this school. The recent audit of the books at the Shingwauk Home has shown that the grant is not sufficient there and probably the same state of affairs exists at Muncey, but I understand they have a larger deficit at Muncey than they had at Mount Elgin. We have\n\nOTTAWA, May 17th\u2014-1904.\nhave promised to liquidate the deficit at Shingwauk Home and I think we should do something also for the Mount Elgin Institute. The question of increasing the per capita grant for the Ontario Schools has not been considered yet, but I think we should consent our officers at Mount Elgin to audit the books and ascertain the amount of the deficit up to the 30th. of June, 1904.\n\nBRANDON:\nAs regards transport of pupils: that is a matter that might be very well be left for the present until the whole school question is gone into. Such questions will all have to be dealt with in the re-arrangement.\n\nMorley: McDougall Orphanage.\nThe McDougall Orphanage is on the boarding school list and receives a grant of 40 pupils at $72. The question of providing an additional accommodation and increasing the grant should be held in abeyance and this school should be considered as a factor in the general re-consideration of the school policy.\n\nNorway House:\nIn December of 1900 Dr. Sutherland brought up the question of additional accommodation at Norway House. The needs of the case seem to be a larger room for teaching. The Commissioner says \"The boarding school is too small to allow for any kind of a room for school purposes: it should be more properly called a boarding house than a boarding school.\" Dr. Sutherland urged that the $3,000 which we gave to assist in the erection of the school should not be considered a limit, but since then he has not pressed the point in official correspondence although he has evidently brought it up in conversation. This, with the other matters that I have mentioned, might be fairly held over for our consideration with the general school policy.\n\nAccountant.\nFrank Pedley, Esq.,\nOttawa.\n\nMy Dear Mr Pedley,\n\nI hope the Department has been able to do something in connection with the various matters about which we conversed when I was last in Ottawa in company with Mr N.W.Rowell. Permit me to recapitulate in a few sentences the points in which we are the most deeply concerned.\n\n1. Coqualeetza Institute.- A grant of $1500 to cover material for a dwelling for the Principal. This matter is not only very necessary but very urgent.\n\n2. Morley.- The enlargement of the Boarding school which has not nearly sufficient accommodation for the pupils on the Stony Reserve who desire admission. You will remember that in regard to Boarding schools we urged the importance and necessity of an increased per capita grant, bringing the amount up to at least $100 per annum. This would apply to both Morley and Norway House.\n\n3.- An increased per capita grant for the Muncy Institute. It is only by dealing very heavily in live stock (a somewhat risky experiment) that the Principal has been able to make ends meet. It is not desirable that he should be under this necessity; and you will\nI readily admit that at the present time $60 is entirely insufficient to maintain such an institution.\n\nI also brought before you and the Superintendent General the question of expense in bringing in pupils to the Red Deer Institute. When this question was referred to the Department in connection with the Brandon Institute, it was decided that the expense of bringing in the pupils would be met by the Department, and their expense home again by the Institute. I was quite under the impression that the same rule applied to Red Deer, and it was only within that last year that I learned that such was not the case. This is a reasonable request, and I hope that it will be conceded.\n\nI would be glad to learn at your earliest convenience what has been done in these various cases.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Sutherland\nOttawa, August 20th, 1904.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland,\n\nWith reference to your favour of the 23rd ultimo I beg to say that pressure of business has prevented my dealing with it but it is not under consideration and I hope to be able to advise you in a few days as to the subject matter thereof.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nReverend A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission,\nToronto, Ontario.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Sup't, General of I.A.\n\nWith reference to the application of the Rev. Dr. Griffith of Montreal referred to in your memo hereunder for aid to the extent of $50.00 per annum to advanced pupils to enable them to the higher grades, I beg to say, first: that there are no funds specially provided for this purpose; second: that similar applications have been refused and in this connection I may refer you to the case of John Angus, late of the Shingwauk Home and to the son of L.F. Jackson of Caughnawaga both of whom applied for a grant to continue their education. Jackson is sending his boy to a Catholic College and is paying his tuition himself. Third: Indian pupils have been assisted in obtaining a higher education than our schools afford by the tribe or band to which they belong as in the instance of Mr. Green, lately of this Department, who was allowed $50.00 a year while attending McGill by the Six Nations tribe and $50.00 which was contributed by the New England Company to complete his studies. Other Indian boys have been assisted by way of a loan but the Department has hitherto made no contribution outright for this purpose.\n\nI am of opinion that it would be an incentive to Indian pupils if a limited number of scholarships were provided by the Department tenable, say, for three years. Even if this proposition were favorably considered the question of how these scholarships were to be awarded would have to be settled. The custom in vogue in white schools is to bestow them upon the most successful pupils after competitive examinations. We have four industrial schools in Ontario and if one scholarship to each school were allowed it would be encouragement to the school and the pupils.\n\nMr. Delisle, teacher of the Caughnawaga Boys' School, discussed this matter and he was of opinion that if his school was granted a scholarship it would be productive of good results.\n\nWhile in Caughnawaga the other day the Rev. Mr. Oke\nMr. Oke broached this matter wishing to know if there was any prospect of obtaining a grant to assist his niece who is a graduate of the Mount Elgin Institute to take up typewriting and shorthand with a view to passing the Civil Service examination and securing employment in the Department. I told Mr. Oke that we had no funds for the purpose and that the Department made no such grants. He said he was coming to Ottawa with Dr. Griffiths and I have no doubt that it is this particular case which has induced Dr. Griffiths to make the application.\n\n[Signature]\nThe Methodist Church.\nMISSIONARY DEPARTMENT.\n\nDictated - Dr. S.

T. Ferrier,\nPrincipal, Industrial school,\nBrandon, Man.\nMemorandum for file:\n\nWhen Rev. Mr. Ferrier was here a few days ago he brought to my attention the following matters:\n\nMuncey Reserve.\n\nHe states the Church has paid the deficit and does not ask the Department to pay this. He would like $100.00 per pupil.\n\nWould like Coqualia and Quamichan given day schools.\n\nWould like an increase in the pupilage at the Girls' Home, Port Simpson, to 45.\n\nWhen the vouchers for the water system are received he would like these given favourable consideration.\n\nHe would like us to look into the question of paying these on the basis of the new type of school, - the teacher $500.00 and nurse $500.00 without rations, they to be qualified as deaconess and nurse.\nThe Red Deer school\u2014instructions have been issued to dismiss non-treaty Indians. He asks for a grant to the hospital at Norway House, and the payment of $300.00 for horses at Brandon school.\nOttawa, July 5, 1910.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to request that you will kindly advise this Department as to whom all cheques for teachers' salaries as well as the per capita grants to boarding and industrial schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church are in future to be made payable. The quarterly school returns from the teachers and principals for the quarter ended the 30th ultimo are now being received and the Department would like to have the above information at your earliest convenience, so that the cheques may be issued in payment of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nThe General Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your favor of the 5th instant #83343 in reference to the party to whom Cheques for teachers' salaries shall be made payable in future, and in reply would say that for the past four years the late Dr. Sutherland, while General Secretary of the Missionary Society, was not one of the Treasurers. Notice of that was not sent to the Department because all over our work ministers and others desired to make remittances payable to him. We had no difficulty with any of these Cheques when depositing them to the credit of the Missionary Society in our own Bank.

In all cases where we have a missionary teacher doing missionary work as well as teaching the school, the salary for teaching has been fixed at $400, and the places where this is the case are these written in red ink. In all other cases the work is only that of a teacher.\n\nOur General Board has taken the position that all these salaries should be paid in full by the Department. This list does not vary much from the amounts paid last year, and I trust that the Department will be able to make out the cheque in harmony with this basis.\n\nThe question arose at our General Board meeting that in a few of the schools it appeared impossible, or at least impracticable, to keep the school open for the full number of teaching days, yet in all such cases where the person was engaged exclusively for teaching, the Board was of the opinion that the Department should pay this amount in full. Our Mission Board has to pay it or we would not be able to get teachers.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa with Dr. Shore in the near future, when we will discuss this matter with the Department.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nNovember 26th, 1912.\n| School                  | Salary asked | Salary now paid | Remarks                      |\n|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|\n| Nelson House            | $400.00      | $300.00         | Recommended                  |\n| Oxford House            | 400.00       | 500.00          | No action                    |\n| Norway House            | 500.00       | 300.00          | Recommended at $400.00       |\n| Cross Lake              | 500.00       | 400.00          | Recommended                  |\n| Berens River            | 600.00       | 500.00          | Recom. to a competent teacher no action |\n| Fisher River            | 500.00       | 500.00          |                               |\n| God's Lake              | 600.00       | 300.00          | Closed                       |\n| Poplar River            | 400.00       | 300.00          | Salary of $500. now offered Summer school, no action. |\n| Bloodvein (for 6 mos.)  | 250.00       |                 |                              |\n| Battle River            | 500.00       | 500.00          | No action                    |\n| Goodfish Lake           | 400.00       | 400.00          | Closed                       |\n| Whitefish Lake          | 500.00       | 300.00          | Closed                       |\n| Koksilah                | 400.00       | 300.00          | Recommended                  |\n| Wyah                    | 600.00       | 600.00          | No action                    |\n| Clo-oose                | 400.00       | 400.00          | \"                            |\n| Nanaimo                 | 400.00       | 400.00          | \"                            |\n| Cape Mudge              | 400.00       | 300.00          | Recommended                  |\n| Port Simpson            | 720.00       | 400.00          | Salary of $600. recommended  |\n| Asst. teacher, Port Simpson | 200.00    |                 |                              |\n| Skidegate               | 500.00       | 500.00          | No action                    |\n| Kitselas                | 400.00       | 300.00          | Stands as at present         |\n| Port Essington          | 500.00       | 400.00          | Recommended                  |\n| Kitzegukla              | 400.00       | 300.00          | Stand as at present          |\n| Kispiax                 | 400.00       | 400.00          | No action                    |\n| Hartley Bay             | 400.00       | 400.00          | \"                            |\n| Kitamaat                | 400.00       | 400.00          | \"                            |\n| Bella Bella             | 500.00       | 400.00          | Recommended                  |\n| Bella Coola             | 500.00       | 400.00          | \"                            |\n| China Hat               | 400.00       | (300.00)        | No action                    |\nMEMORANDUM:\u2014\n\nMr. Pedley.\n\nRev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Schools, in a letter dated November 26th, last, beneath, submits a statement showing the amounts voted by the General Board of Missions of his church to be paid to teachers of Indian day schools west of the Great Lakes and states that the Board is of opinion that the Department should pay the respective amounts in full.\n\nI have examined the list and find that we are now paying the salary agreed upon by the church at the following schools:\u2014 Oxford House, Fisher River, Battle River (Samson's Day School), Wyah, Glo-oose, Nanaimo, Skidegate, Kishpiax, Hartley Bay and Kitamaat.\n\nAt China Hat we are allowing $200.00 for the wife of the teacher for field matron work, which makes the total allowance at this school more than that asked for. The above mentioned schools need not, therefore, be taken into consideration.\n\nThe Goodfish Lake, Whitefish Lake and God's Lake schools\nschools are now closed and may also be dropped from the list.\n\nThe Bloodvein School is conducted only in the summer months and the Department has paid at the rate of $50.00 per month, which is all that the church asks for.\n\nAt the following schools the average attendance is not such as to warrant the Department in paying any larger salary than is now being allowed:- viz.- Kitsegukla and Kitselas. At the first mentioned place I may say that the trouble is owing to the fact that the Indians are divided, a number residing in the new village and a number in the old. The school is situated in the new village and until such time as the Indians are induced to move there is little prospect of bettering the attendance. At the present time there is a recommendation that a school should be established in the old village, but the Department has not as yet had an opportunity to give it consideration. At Kitselas the attendance is too small to warrant the increase asked.\n\nAt the Port Simpson School the church has agreed to pay two salaries of $720.00 and $200.00 per annum. Here the boarding school pupils attend the day school; for the tuition of the boarding school pupils the Department, of course\ncourse, is not responsible. We are now paying $400.00 for the day school teacher and I think the average attendance of day school pupils would justify us in increasing it to at least $600.00 per annum.\n\nThe reports on the work of the teachers at Bella Bella, Bella Coola and Port Essington are such that I think the Department would be justified in granting the increase asked for, viz.- from $400.00 to $500.00 per annum. The same may be said of Cape Mudge and Koksilah, where the increase asked for is from $300.00 to $400.00.\n\nThe teacher at the Poplar River School for various reasons has not been a success and I do not think under present conditions that we should make any increase in the grant, but the Department has already offered $500.00 for a competent teacher.\n\nI would recommend the increase to $600.00 at Berens River to a competent teacher and also the increase asked for at Cross Lake.\n\nAt Norway House the church has promised a salary of $500.00 and, although the average attendance for the past year has been rather small, only eight, I think we should make the amount there at least $400.00.\n\nThere is a good attendance at Nelson House and the\nthe increase from $300.00 to $400.00 might be allowed.\n\nI attach herewith a statement showing the salaries now paid and amounts asked for and indicating action I recommend taking.\nOttawa, January 16, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 26th of November with which you enclose a statement showing the amount of salary voted by the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church to the teachers of Indian day schools west of the Great Lakes and ask that the Department pay the full amount of salary promised. I beg to say that the Department has decided to meet your wishes in respect to the schools at Nelson House, Cross Lake, Berens River, Koksilah, Cape Mudge, Bella Bella and Bella Coola.\n\nAt Berens River the Department will only pay a salary of $600.00 to a competent, qualified teacher.\n\nA salary of $500.00 has already been offered to a competent teacher at Poplar River.\n\nThe request for increases at Kitselas and Kitsegukla is not allowed, as the attendance is not such as to warrant any larger salary than the Department has been paying in the past.\n\nI would point out to you that while the Board has only allowed $400.00 at Oxford House the Department has been and is paying $500.00 at this point, which is sent to the Missionary Society.\n\nAt China Hat the wife of the teacher is allowed $200.00 as field matron, making a total payment of $500.00, and at Portage la Prairie the Department is prepared to pay a salary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nsalary of $500.00. The Church, of course, is responsible for the tuition of the children attending the boarding school. So far as the day school work is concerned there is no need for more than one teacher.\n\nThe schools at Goodfish Lake, Whitefish Lake and God's Lake are closed; therefore, no action is being taken in these three cases.\n\nAt the other schools referred to the Department is now paying the sum asked for by the Missionary Society.\n\nAt Norway House the Department is prepared to make an increase from $300.00 to $400.00, which is considered fair as the number of pupils in attendance is small.\n\nThese increases will take effect from the first of the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

While Mrs. Lowes remains as teacher of this school, the Department will allow a salary at the rate of $600.00 per annum.\n\nWith reference to the Nut Lake Day School, I beg to say that Walter Challis began duties at this school on June 24, 1914, and taught until September 30th.

He will no doubt let you have his opinion immediately on his return.\n\nTrusting this delay will not greatly inconvenience you, I remain\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nStenographer.\nApril 25th, 1919.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn disbursing the $60,000 that is at the disposal of the Methodist Church for plant, was it your thought that any of it should be used for any of our large building schemes? As you will remember our pre-war program comprehended a boarding school at Morley, for which $25,000 had been voted; a boy's school at Port Simpson for which I believe provision of $25,000 was also made; a large industrial school at Hazelton; and the pulling down of the north end of the Brandon Institute and rebuilding the full length of the front part of the building making it three-storey high. Is it your intention that we should consider any of these schemes, or spending any portion of it towards aiding the change from Red Deer to Edmonton?\n\nOver and above these our present needs are as follows:\n\n1 - Boys' play room and work shop, at Muncey.\n2 - Barn, root house, stable, and work shop, at Norway House.\n3 - Cottage for carpenter, ice house, refrigerator, work shop, coal shed, and silo, at Brandon.\n4 - Cottage for children, work shop, school room, at Coqualeetza.\n5 - Day schools on reserves, Oxford House, Cross Lake, Chemong, etc.\n\nYou will see that the needs of Muncey, Norway House, Brandon, and Coqualeetza, and day schools, would take up all of the $60,000 and leave the larger schemes untouched. If the total appropriation is available for the smaller amounts needed at our institutes, it will just about cover the cost of the same. If, however, one of the larger schemes has to be taken into consideration we must greatly curtail the program of present needs. You will notice that I have mentioned nothing in connection with Red Deer, for it is not our purpose to do more than keep that property in a state of repair for a year or more.\n\nYou had better send your reply to Brandon.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C.

A workshop is also needed where the boys can be taught carpentry, blacksmithing and wherein all needed repairs to the farm machinery and other repairs generally can be made. There are no outbuildings at present at this school.\n\nAt the Brandon Industrial School a residence for the carpenter instructor is required as there is no accommodation for one. An ice house for the storage of the season's supply of ice and a refrigerator for the proper care of meat and other perishable supplies is urgently needed. There is no accommodation for the storing of fuel and a new coal shed is required for this purpose. They have a large farm at this school and a large number of stock and a silo is required to store the ensilage for the winter's feed for the stock.\n\nAt the Coqualeetza Institute it is intended to erect a building for the teaching of domestic science and to include a class-room. The older girls will live in residence in this building under the care of a competent matron and teacher and will be taught all branches of domestic science and general housekeeping. A workshop is also required for the teaching of trades for the boys and to provide equipment for the making of needed repairs to farm machinery, etc.\n\nNew Day School buildings are required at Oxford House and Cross Lake. There is a large number of children at these points and the work at present is being carried on in log buildings which are inadequate for the purpose.\n\nThe present facilities at Chemong are quite inadequate.

Mr. Ferrier's recent visit to the Department I went carefully over with him the salary schedule for the teachers in the Methodist Indian day schools. The attached list shows the salary in each case. The only increases are as follows: Rossville from $600.00 to $650.00; Morley from $600.00 to $750.00; Cape Mudge from $600.00 to $650.00; Port Simpson, teacher from $800.00 to $900.00, assistant teacher from $600.00 to $650.00; Skidegate, teacher from $720.00 to $900.00, and Bella Bella from $600.00 to $650.00. Mr. Ferrier requested these increases on account of having obtained new teachers with higher qualifications.\n\nI submit this list for your approval, and would beg to request that the salary as stated be provided in each case from September 1st, last, the date on which the schools re-opened after the summer holidays and the new teachers began duties.\n\n[Signature]\n\nAppr.\n\n[Signature]\nList of Schools, Teachers and Salaries under the care of the Methodist Church west of the lakes.\n\n| Location       | Teacher Name          | Salary   |\n|----------------|-----------------------|----------|\n| Norway House   | Mr. Honer             | $600.00  |\n| Cross Lake     | Miss Hughes           | $750.00  |\n| Oxford House   | Miss Zella Richardson | $800.00  |\n| Berens River   | Mr. Donnah            | $1600.00 |\n| Bisher River   | Mrs. Donnah           |          |\n| Island Lake    | Mr. Henderson         | $600.00  |\n| Nelson House   | Miss Isabelle Clarke  | $800.00  |\n| Poplar River   | Joseph Hope           | $600.00  |\n| Bloodvein      |                       | $600.00  |\n| Moose Woods    |                       | $600.00  |\n| Morley         |                       | $750.00  |\n| Battle River   | Miss Ida Fairservice  | $700.00  |\n| Duffield       | Fred.

T. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools.\n\nI have marked in pencil the increase in salaries over that paid for the previous year. I may say that in the case where an increase is asked Mr. Ferrier has explained that the teachers devote all their time to school work, while in the case where no increase is asked, besides duties as teacher, they also perform missionary labours on the reserve and the church in that case provides a residence and makes up the balance in salary to $1000.00.\n\nI have checked this list over with Mr. Ferrier and would recommend that the salaries asked for be allowed for the present school year. In most cases he has obtained qualified teachers, or teachers having had experience in Indian work. I shall be pleased to know whether the salaries as asked for are to be allowed, in order that, if so, the salaries for the September quarter can be paid at these rates. The quarterly returns are now coming in.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, October 12, 1920.\nApril 26th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nRelative to the bonus of $20.00 per capita, for the present fiscal year only, to augment the regular per capita grant provided for the Indian Residential Schools, a sum sufficient for the purpose was included in the Department's estimate for submission to Parliament at the present Session, and it may be assumed that the necessary appropriation for the purpose will be approved.\n\nI would suggest that the payment of this bonus be made quarterly, on receipt of the usual returns of attendance, and that in calculating the amount due each quarter, the bonus be treated as an increased per capita grant and paid on the average attendance as shown by the returns, in the same manner as the regular per capita grant. This will simplify our book-keeping and accounting.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state whether you desire that the cheques in payment of this bonus be sent your Church Treasurer each quarter or whether the amount of the bonus due be sent to the Principals of the individual schools, under the auspices of your church.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state your wishes in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent, Methodist Indian Schools,\nBRANDON, MAN.\nApril 28th, 1921\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn regard to the extra $20.00 per capita grant for pupils in our Residential Schools, would you kindly have the amount included in the regular quarterly cheque which is sent to the Mission Rooms, Toronto. This will apply to all the Residential Schools under the management of the Methodist Church, and also to Kitamaat under the Woman's Missionary Society.\n\nI take this opportunity, on behalf of the Methodist Church, to express our thanks to the Department for this extra grant, which will certainly come at an opportune time.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. Ferrier\nDear Sir;-\n\nWould it be possible for you to arrange for a delegation, representing the Methodist Church, to interview the Honorable Charles Stewart, Minister of the Interior, relative to having placed in the estimates a sufficient amount to complete the buildings on the Edmonton Indian Reserve, and also provide buildings for an Industrial School at Port Simpson and possibly an Orphanage at some place to be determined?\n\nWe are very much disappointed that the buildings at Edmonton have not been completed as yet, and are very anxious that the necessary appropriations for the work to which I have referred should be passed at the next session of the Legislature.\n\nIf you could arrange for a hearing for us about the 25th or 26th of January, it would be very satisfactory.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nVery faithfully yours,\n\nDuncan G. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nJanuary 11th, 1922.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant in which you ask me to arrange an interview with the Hon. Charles Stewart, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for a delegation representing the Methodist Church on or about January 25th or 26th. As the Minister is now absent in the West, and as I am not aware when he will return to Ottawa and be able to grant an interview such as this, it is impossible for me to fix any date at the present time. I shall, however, be very pleased to keep the matter in mind and I shall take the earliest opportunity of making arrangements such as you desire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Mr. Stewart, say, any time between Monday the 6th and Thursday the 9th of February, it would be satisfactory to me and those who will be associated with me in the interview with the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nIt would greatly oblige me if you could let me know as early as possible whether you can arrange an interview at that time.\n\nAwaiting your reply,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

The secretary informs me, however, that we might make arrangements for an interview on Monday morning the 6th February. If in the meantime there is any change in the Minister's plans I shall at once advise you by wire.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. C. H.

We hope that this policy will be continued, as it will avoid the necessity at certain times of the year, when our receipts from the churches are very meagre, of our borrowing money from the Bank, for which, of course, we are obliged to pay interest.\n\nI note that the advances to which I have referred as having been paid in March came to hand toward the end of the quarter. If they were paid nearer the beginning of the quarter, it would save us any outlay for interest on borrowed money.\n\nHoping that this matter will have the favorable consideration of the Department,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, April 24th, 1923.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to making advances on grants to Indian Residential Schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to make advances to your schools each quarter, on receipt of a formal application at the beginning of the quarter stating the names of the schools for which advances are required and the amount of the advance which you desire allowed to each school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

There are many children in this part of British Columbia and our small schools at Port Simpson and Kitimat are wholly inadequate to meet the needs.\n\nA dam to conserve and insure domestic water supply for the Port Simpson School is urgently required. I believe an appropriation of $1,000 will meet the expenses in this connection.\nCOQUALEETZA:\n\nThe Principal has given a very extended list of needs. I might indicate a dwelling house for the farm instructor, sufficient cement to extend the front concrete fence to the full length of the main building, a hog pen and hen house, playground equipment ($300), covered play-sheds on account of the rainy season, also greenhouse, gymnasium, general repairs to the Principal's residence and some smaller items. However, I think that if you make us a grant of $8,000 for the coming year, it will be all that we should expect in the next Budget for this Institution.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy on file\nEDMONTON:\n\nWe need an Implement Shed, Chicken house also Cement and Lumber for general repairs. The woodwork on the buildings should all have a coat of paint outside. We would need wire and posts for about 150 rods of fencing. We need gravel for walks around the main building. This has to be brought in in carlots.\n\n[Signature]\n\nCopy on file\nBRANDON:\n\nHalf a mile of fence is required right through the southern half section of the farm on the main highway. The north side has a good wire fence with a caragana hedge growing on each side of the page wire. The south side is practically without a fence at the present time and is very much in need of it. This and general repairs will require an outlay of about $4,000.\n\n[Signature]\nNORWAY HOUSE:\n\nPainting material, sufficient to paint the main building inside and outside, is required, also Alabastine for all plastered inside work. Eave troughing is needed for barn, henhouse, cold storage and carpenter shop, also conductors from the eaves of the main building into the drain or cistern. These have never been provided.\n\nA new Generator for the Electric Plant is required. The one now in use is worn out and was originally installed just for the main building. Now that all the outbuildings are connected, it would not do to attempt repairing it, as it is too small.\n\nThe Steam Plumbing is in need of general refitting inasmuch as the pipe is rusted out in many places.\n\nLumber is needed for the horse stalls and walls of cold storage plant.\n\nThe Principal has been clearing and breaking a lot of new land on the island, for which we have spent some hundreds of dollars and we would like a grant of $500 to assist in this work.\n\nA considerable amount of cement is required to replace that which was broken around the building and in the basement for the laying of drain tile to drain the foundation of the building.\n\nThe total cost will be at least $5,000.\n\nThe present building is filled to its full capacity and we have a waiting list of some 25 or 30 pupils. It is very necessary that our accommodation be increased to at least 140 or 150 pupils. This can be done for an outlay of about $40,000.\n\nYou will remember, in an interview last June, I brought before you the scheme that was on foot to erect a monument to the memory of the Rev. James Evans, our first missionary at Norway House. You kindly assured me that $1000 would be granted by the Department towards a $10,000 proposition.\nMT. ELGIN INSTITUTE:\n\nThe urgent need is a Refrigerator Plant, which should include an ice house and cold storage. The two combined will cost about $1,500. Plans and specifications can be submitted in due time.\n\nCopy on file\nThe United Church of Canada\nRev. T.

Powell, (Mrs. N. A. Powell), of 167 College Street. Mrs. Powell died on December 5th, and on December 9th, at a meeting specially called, our new Treasurers were appointed.\n\nThe Executive appointed Mercy E. McCulloch, (Mrs. E. A. McCulloch), as Treasurer, and myself, (Miss) Eva Smith as Associate Treasurer. Mrs. McCulloch and I have talked things over, and as her home is on St. Clair Avenue, some distance from the office, we have decided that mail shall be addressed to the office, as this will avoid much delay.\n\nMay I ask therefore that the cheques in payment of the grants for the Indian Work under our care, be addressed to Mrs. McCulloch at 411 Wesley Building, 299 Queen Street West, Toronto 2, instead of to Mrs. N. A. Powell, 167 College Street, Toronto.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this matter, I am,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nEva Smith\nAssociate Treasurer.\nDear Sir;-\n\nI write today to suggest that it might be well, after the close of the present fiscal year on the 31st of March next, to make a slight change in the policy pursued by the Department of Indian Affairs in the payment of certain teachers of Indian Schools in which the Missionary Society of the former Methodist Church is especially interested. The changes I have in mind would apply only to the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and to only a few cases in these Provinces.\n\nIn certain places we have Missionary Teachers, i.e., teachers who have charge of the Day Schools and also conduct religious services among the people. This is the case at -\n\nGeorgina Island,\nChristian Island,\nGibson,\nMoraviantown, and\nAlderville,\n\nin the Province of Ontario. In regard to these places we think it would be advisable, after the 31st of March next, to send the money for their salaries to the Treasurer of the Missionary Society in the City of Toronto.\n\nTeachers of the following schools in the Province of Quebec, - where we have the privilege of nominating the teachers - we think should be paid direct by the Department, and not have the money for their salaries come through our Treasurer. They are:\n\nOka Village school.\nOka Country school.\n\nTrusting you will find it satisfactory to act on our suggestions in regard to the cases named above,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 8, 1926.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you request that after April 1st next the salaries paid the teachers at the -\n\nGeorgina Island,\nChristian Island,\nGibson,\nMoraviantown, and\nAlderville\n\nday schools be sent direct to the Treasurer of the Missionary Society in Toronto. Your request in this regard will be complied with. I have also noted that salaries for the teachers of the Oka Village and Oka country schools should be sent direct to themselves after April 1st.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

INDIAN SCHOOLS AND MISSION PREMISES IN ONTARIO.\n\nOn the 2nd April, 1883, I sent a communication in reply to two letters received from the Department in which I set forth our views in regard to the Industrial Institution at Muncey, and also in regard to our ordinary Indian Schools. If the Superintendent General will kindly refer to that communication he will be in possession of the points we wish to present, so far as schools in Ontario are concerned.\n\nIn regard to sites for Mission premises on the different Reserves, we have frequently a good deal of trouble with the Indians, growing out of the fact that we have no legal or formal claim to any particular quantity of land. Sooner or later some grievance is sure to crop up, and some Indian will complain that we are occupying more ground than we are entitled to. We desire very much that this unsatisfactory condition of affairs should be ended, and we ask, therefore, that on all Reserves on which we have established missions there should be a distinct understanding reached between the Missionary Society, the resident Indian Agent and the Indian Department, in which the amount of land to be occupied for mission purpose should be clearly defined. Secondly, that the Department should give us a title of occupation (so long as we continue our mission work), protecting us alike from complaints of individual Indians, and also from trespass either by individuals or by the Band. This last request is owing to the fact that in some cases,-Cape Croker, for example,-the Indians have erected some of their own buildings upon land that was set apart for the use of the mission. Thirdly, if for any reason we should deem it expedient to withdraw from any particular Reserve, we desire either that the Department will take our buildings at a price to be fixed by arbitration, or else that we shall have a right to sell the buildings to any other purchaser who may offer to buy them.\n\nII. SCHOOLS, &c., IN THE NORTHWEST TERRITORIES.\n\nIn regard to ordinary Indian Schools in the Northwest I beg to refer the Superintendent General to a communication of mine dated July 30th, 1883, in which the various points are presented in detail.\n\nFor the efficient carrying out of educational work among the Indians, we think it most important that provision should be made for Boarding Schools, and also for Industrial Institutions, where the children can be kept for a series of years away from the influences which surround them on the Reserves, and we call especial attention to the needs of the Indians in the following locations:\nlst, Lake Winnipeg. For more than forty years we have been carry-\ning on educational and missionary work among the Bands around this\nlake, and to the north and east; but nothing has yet been done tow-\nard supplying either a boarding school or an industrial institution.\nWe think that the work we have done among the Indians of that re-\ngion entitles us to the consideration of the government. 2ndly,\nBattle River. At the last session of Parliament the sum of $10,000\nwas voted for an Industrial Institution at Battle River, but so far\nas we are informed nothing further has been done. The amount voted\nis entirely inadequate for an efficient institution, and is in sug-\ngestive contrast with the amounts expended on the institutions\nplaced in charge of other religious bodies. 3rdly, the Worley Re-\nserve. The Superintendent General is doubtless aware that an Or-\nphanage and Training School have been established by the Missionary\nSociety. Repeated applications have been made to the Government\nfor buildings and a grant towards maintenance. Hitherto the first\npart of the request has been refused, while in regard to the second\nan annual grant of $700 has been made for the past two years, and\nrecently a communication from the Department stated that Parliament\nwould be asked during the present session to grant an amount equal\nto $60 for each pupil in the Institution. There are very strong\nreasons why this institution should be enlarged in its scope, and\nmade similar to those at Battleford, High River, Indian Head and\nQu'Appelle, and the reasons which have led the Government to give\nsuch liberal support to these latter institutions apply with equal\nif not greater force in the case of Worley.\n\nIn regard to sites for mission premises our request is that in\nall cases they be excluded from the Reserves, so that we may obtain\nan absolute title to the property.\n\nIII. SCHOOLS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nWhat has been said about schools in the Northwest territories\nwill apply, to some extent at least, to schools in British Colum-\nbia; but in regard to Industrial or Boarding Schools I would say\nthat we regard an institution of the kind, located in the neighbor-\nhood of Chilliwack in the valley of the Fraser, an urgent necessi-\nty. It has been rumored that the Government have in contemplation\nthe establishment of two institutions, one on Vancouver Island and\nthe other on the mainland, but that the latter is not to be located\nin the valley of the Fraser. I sincerely hope that this will not\nbe the final decision of the Department, and that in the establish-\nment and management of these schools, the work which has been done\namong the Indians by our Missionary Society will receive practical\nrecognition. In this connection we beg to call attention to the\nneeds of the Indians in the northern part of the province, where\nnothing has been done by the Government in the way of education,\nexcept in certain small grants made to particular mission schools.\nIt is of great importance that some more advanced work be done in\nthat region, especially on the line of industrial pursuits. In\nthis connection I beg to mention the case of the Indian Girls' Home\nat Port Simpson, which has hitherto been supported exclusively by\nthe voluntary gifts of Christian people. I think this institution\nis fairly entitled to consideration by the government, and I hope\nthat when the nature of the enterprise is understood, a grant will\nbe made towards its maintenance.\n\nAny further information I can give touching any of the forego-\ning points will be cheerfully furnished in a personal interview.\n\nYours Faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. Butterland\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo Deputy Minister\n\nOttawa, 6 March 1888\n\nI beg to state that the suggestions submitted to the Department by Dr. Macdonald in his letter of the 2nd April 1883 in regard to Industrial Schools & Day Schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Society in Ontario are as follows:\n\nIndustrial Schools\n1. Increase the number of pupils who may attend from 50 to say 100 & make such provision in the matter of school rooms &c as may admit of classification of pupils under two separate teachers. Give prizes for proficiency in the various branches.\n\n2. Fix the time of residence at five years for girls & six years for boys & make attendance for this term compulsory.\n\n3. When boys have completed the term & learned...\nlearned a trade, give them money certificates but help to start in business, such as a good set of tools & a small stock of material. If they have learned farming, give them land of their own on the reserve to which they belong & advance a good oxen some implements to be repaid out of annuities.\n\n4. Increase the number of trades taught at the institutions & make provision for the sale of surplus manufactured stock.\n\n5. Goods are often purchased from the Industrial Institutions by Indians who give orders on their annuities in part, but in paying annuities these orders are sometimes neglected by Agents and the money goes to independent traders who hold similar orders. Agents should\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo:\n\nOttawa, 188\n\nI should be instructed to honor all proper orders held by the Governors against amnesties.\n\nDay Schools\n\n1. Let the Indians be required to keep School Houses in a state of thorough repair.\n\n2. Let Agents be instructed to insist upon the regular attendance of all children of school age.\n\n3. Let examinations be held at regular intervals by qualified persons appointed for the purpose; let certificates of honor be given for punctual attendance & good conduct; & prizes for proficiency in studies.\n\n4. Increase salaries of teachers so as to secure a higher grade of qualification & more efficient service.\n\nShould these suggestions meet with the\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\nOttawa\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026188\n\nThe approval of the Department to Mary Society may be prepared to meet its proposition of the advance in balance in the case of schools under its control.\n\nTo the above communication the Dept sent the following reply on the 27th July 1886:\n\nThe Dept has no objection to the standard of education being raised at these institutions & the pupils passing a matriculation examination.\n\n4.

The Superintendent has no objection to their receiving a further certificate which upon the provisions of the Act 27 Vic Cap 27 Section 16 being also compelled must provide suitable means for Enfranchisement.\n\nIn his letter of the 30th July 1883 Mr. Macdonald makes the following suggestions in regard to Indian schools in the N.W.O. viz:\n\n1. That on notifying the Board from time to time of our readiness to send a teacher to any Indian Reserve where school accommodation has not yet been provided he Board cause a suitable school house to be erected & also a house for the teacher; the intention being to send out named teachers only.\n\n2. That above requisites other than necessary.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo ...........................................\n\nOttawa, ........................................... 188\n\nnecessary furniture such as desks, stove etc be provided by the Mississagi Society.\n\n3 - That the salary for a properly qualified male teacher be $650.00 per annum this being in our judgment the minimum for which a qualified teacher can be obtained.\n\n4 - That $500.00 of this amount be paid by the Indian Department, the remaining $150.00 to be paid by the Mississagi Society on condition that the teacher be allowed to conduct religious services on the Sabbath.\n\n5 - When, in the opinion of the Dept, deemed advisable that a school be opened on a given Reserve timely notice be given to the Mississagi Society & if the Society be not prepared within months to send a suitable teacher the place shall be filled in such manner as\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\n\nTo\u2014\n\nOttawa, 188\n\nAs the Dept may determine,\nin all other respects these schools shall be under the general regulations prescribed by the Department.\n\nOn the 11th August '85 a copy of the above suggestions were sent to Lord Denman for report and on the 24th Dec of the same year Lord Denman gave his views on the question of improving the Indian Schools in the Territories stating that he could not see his way clear to endorse those parts of the suggestions contained in Mr. Macdonald's letter on behalf of the Church Missionary Dept which if acted upon would create a monopoly in favor of one denomination over another.

With reference to the points respecting schools enumerated in the Superintendent General's memorandum attached hereto which formed subjects of discussion between the Minister and the Rev. Dr. Luthardt, Honorary Secretary of the Missionary Department of the Methodist Church of Canada, the undersigned lays it down that the following among others will form matters for consideration in connection with the whole school question.\n\nTo the Honorable Thomas White\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nquestion which it is proposed to be reconsidered and remodelled at as early a date as circumstances will admit of, namely:\n\n1. Admission to higher schools to be the reward for proficiency in common schools.\n\n2. A fixed curriculum at the higher schools.\n\n3. Prizes in schools.\n\n4. The enlargement of the Mount Elgin Institution.\n\n5. The length of tuition which should be afforded the boys and girls at the Industrial Institutions.\n\n6. Encouragement to be extended to pupils who have acquired at an Industrial Institution a knowledge of trades, to follow the same.\n\n7. Salaries of teachers; the latter to be properly certified.\n\n8. The cost of the erection of school buildings in the North West Territories and elsewhere.\nAs regards other matters referred to in the attached memorandum, the Indian Agent at Stratford will be requested to endeavor to induce the Indians to obtain such articles as the Grand Trunk Institution can supply from that institution instead of buying the same from merchants and traders.\n\n2. As regards the establishment of an Industrial school on Lake Winnipeg, the northern part of which Dr. Luthardt states has always been under Methodist control, the undersigned begs to report that in his opinion it would be preferable to establish an Industrial Institution about the centre of the said Lake somewhere in the vicinity of Berens River, as it would be more convenient for all the Reserves than were an Institution placed at\n\n8.\nthe Northern part of the lake.\n\n3. As regards the suggested enlargement of the Norley Orphanage, the undersigned begs to state that this Institution is solely established for the benefit of orphan children belonging to the Story Board, whose Reserve is situated at Norleyville. The Department has already increased the Grant to this Institution from \u00a330 to \u00a360 per capita for the board, lodging and tuition of the pupils thereof.\n\nIt is, of course, not necessary considering that the Orphanage is only intended for one Board of Indians that it should be of as large dimensions as the Industrial Institutions at High River, Grindell and Battleford. A moderate Grant towards the enlargement to some extent of this Orphanage might\nmight perhaps be made; but the undersigned has no doubt that if this is entertained, an application from the St. Albert Institution will likewise be received for similar assistance; the latter Institution being conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church and receiving a contribution from the Department at the same per capita rate as the Rocky Mountain.\n\n4. As respects the exclusion of Mission premises belonging to the Methodist Church from Indian Reserves in the North West Territories, the undersigned begs to report that steps were taken last season to have the Mission Premises belonging to the above Church which are situated on the Reserves at Rocky and at Wolf Creek in the Peace Hills excluded therefrom.\nthey having been occupied by the Methodist Church Missionaries before the tracts within which they are situated were constituted Indian Reserves. There is also a piece of land (with buildings thereon it is presumed) belonging to the Methodist Church situated on another Reserve in the Peace Hills; but the land thus occupied is situated so far from the boundary of the Reserve that it was not considered advisable to make a surrender thereof made by the Indians or to allow a patent to issue for the same. The Department has always held that when lands so occupied are situated in the heart of an Indian Reserve or anywhere but near the boundary, expropriation should not be allowed, as, for obvious reasons, it might thereto prove very inconvenient and annoy land\nso situated as proprietors; but,\nat the same time, the\nDepartment never interferes\nwith the occupation by\nmissionaries of such lands,\nas are fair and proper for\nthem to occupy, within\nan Indian Reserve, so long\nas they pursue mission work\non the Reserve, and this\nprinciple is applied to all\nlands taken up by missionary\nbodies after a tract has\nbeen constituted a Reserve\nwhether such lands are\nsituated within the\nReserve or on the boundary\nthereof.\n\n5. As regards assistance\nbeing given to the training\nschool for girls at Fort\nSimpson at which Dr.\nSutherland says there\nare some twenty in attendance,\nthe undersigned begs to\nreport that the Department\nalready assists to the\nextent of $150 per annum\nfor the girls' school at the\nabove\n\n7.\nabout point, and it gives assistance to the extent of $300 per annum to the boys' school at Port Simpson. Of the grant to the girls' school were doubled, the undersigned does not consider that it would be too liberal a donation from the Department.\n\n6. As respects the proposal that the Methodist school buildings on Indian Reserve should be repaired by the Indians, the undersigned is of the opinion that this would be but fair, as the children of the Indians occupy the buildings and any wear and tear is occasioned by such occupancy.\n\n7. With respect to Dr. Sutherland's complaint that the Agent of the shipwreck of Langton some two or three years ago refused to confirm the subscriptions made by the Indians to the...\nMethodist Missions, the undersigned begs to remind the Superintendent General that a change of the Agent has been made recently, Mr. Allen having been appointed to replace Mr. Conaway, the late Agent, who resigned.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs.\nTo\n\nThe Hon. Clifford Sifton,\nMinister of the Interior, &c.\n\nHon. Sir:\n\nWe, a deputation of the Special Committee of the British Columbia Conference of the Methodist Church, are much gratified that the opportunity is afforded us by your presence in our Province of the present meeting to offer a few facts bearing upon the relation of the Methodist Church to the work of Instruction which is being prosecuted by the Indian Department among the Indians of British Columbia.\n\nWe may remind you that the solicitude of the Methodist Church on behalf of the aborigines of our country has been evinced by its earnest efforts for their evangelization and instruction from the earliest period of its missionary operations to the present. We have now no less than thirteen (13) of the Ministers of the British Columbia Conference engaged in this work; assisted by thirty-eight (38) teachers, lay-agents and other helpers, who have many thousands of Indians under their care. The assistance which we have received from the Indian Department in our educational work among the Indians, has been very much less than has been afforded other denominations in proportion to the work which we and they respectively have been doing. We are happy to state that since the advent to power of the Government of which you are a member, some improvement has taken place in this respect. We shall ask your attention to the appended Statistical Tables which have been compiled for our present\npurposes from the last published Blue Book of the Department, viz: for the year 1896. From these it will be seen that whilst the Roman Catholic Church has four Industrial Institutes with 215 pupils, one Boarding School with 75 pupils, and two Day Schools with 40 pupils\u2014making an aggregate of 330 pupils for which they receive from the Indian Department $29,000.\n\nOur Church has one Industrial Institute with 98 pupils, one Boarding School with 25 pupils, and nine Day Schools with 352 pupils\u2014making an aggregate of 475 pupils, towards which work we receive only $5,800. A comparison of the assistance bestowed upon schools under the care of the Church of England constitutes a less glaring illustration of the discrimination against the Methodist Church of which we complain which has marked the action of the Indian Department in the past. It is, however, worthy of attention. Reference to the accompanying tables will show that for the two Industrial Schools of 57 pupils, three Boarding Schools with 60 pupils, and eight Day Schools with 292 pupils\u2014total pupils 415, the Church of England receives $15,050. Besides the nine Day Schools with 352 pupils reported in the Blue Book for eight of which assistance is received, the Methodist Church is carrying on four schools with 125 pupils, upon which no need of recognition is bestowed by the Department.\n\nNot only in the matter of maintenance has our Church been discriminated against, but in that of establishment and equipment as well. In the face of the liberality which has marked the treatment of other denominations in this matter, we cannot point to one Institute under our care in British Columbia which has been established wholly by\nGovernment. Towards the establishment of our one Institute, which in grounds, buildings and equipment cost in the neighborhood of $30,000, the Department contributed $5,000.\n\nYou will understand that it is impossible for us to feel that good citizens as we are, and laboring earnestly as we do, for the uplifting into civilization and good citizenship of the wards of the Government, we have deserved only the scant assistance which has been bestowed upon us as compared with the large liberality bestowed upon the work of rival denominations.\n\nIn defense of this policy of unequal distribution of the Government funds, it cannot be urged that the territory and school population over which the Methodist Church carries on its operations are comparatively circumscribed and its constituency limited. The fact is that outside the provision which is now made for the instruction of Indian children by the Government and the Missionary Society together about one thousand (1,000) children within the area of our Church's operations are as yet utterly unprovided for educationally.\n\nNeither can it be objected that the quality or degree of instruction afforded by the Methodist Church is inferior to that provided by other denominations. Were any disposed to question the correctness of our statement on this point, our reply is that we court and challenge investigation by a competent and impartial inspector.\n\nWhat we desire therefore, is that we receive as a Church such assistance as shall enable us to\nextend our work. Let aid be afforded us according to the work we do. Place us on terms of equality in the matter of Industrial Institutes with other denominations in proportion to the children we are seeking to educate. This would mean, as the foregoing facts will show, that we should have at least three additional Institutes. Let these be placed at points mutually agreed upon by the Department and the authorities of our Church, adjacent to those school populations which are as yet practically uncared for. It would mean also that aid should be given in support of those Day Schools which have hitherto been unassisted by the Department.\n\nWe do not wish to be tedious, but we think that attention ought to be called to the fact that in all the ten Agencies of the Department in this Province, not one is presided over by an Agent who belongs to the Methodist Church. We are made sometimes painfully to feel that a certain kind of influence is used against us by agents who are not in sympathy with our denominational teachings and methods, and this too within the legitimate sphere of our denominational operations. The influences may be said to be within the personal rights of the agent. As in the matter of support for our schools so also in this matter of agents of our own Church, all that we ask is that we be granted our full share of funds and representation; nothing more, nothing less.\n\nIn conclusion, allow us to say that we have the utmost confidence that in making these representations, which cannot be gainsayed but are confirmed by the Department's own records of the past, we shall have your sympathy as far as it can have a basis in righteousness, and not only your persona\nsympathy but that also of every Minister associated with you in the government of our country, in whom we see a most gratifying disposition to treat impartially and upon their merits, all classes of our population, and all causes which come under the wide range of your administration.\n\nWe have the honor to remain, Sir,\n\non behalf of the Committee,\n\nYour most respectful and obedient Servants.\n\n[Signature]\nPresident.\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary.\n**TABULATED STATEMENT OF INDIAN INDUSTRIAL SCHOOLS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA**\n\n| Place               | Number | Num. paid for | Government Grant |\n|---------------------|--------|---------------|------------------|\n|                     | Boys   | Girls         | Total            |\n| **Roman Catholic**  |        |               |                  |\n| Kamloops            | 25     | 26            | 51               | $6500             |\n| Kootenay            | 27     | 29            | 56               | 6500              |\n| Kuper Island        | 38     | 21            | 59               | 6500              |\n| Williams Lake       | 24     | 26            | 52               | 6500              |\n| **Totals**          | 111    | 104           | 215              | 20000             |\n| **Church of England** |      |               |                  |\n| Alert Bay           | 20     | 20            | 35               | 4550              |\n| Metlakatla          | (Boys) |               |                  |\n|                     | 51     | 6             | 57               | 5500              |\n| **Totals**          | 51     | 6             | 57               | 6050              |\n| **Methodist**       |        |               |                  |\n| Chilliwack          | 55     | 45            | 98               | 17                | 2210              |\n**TABULATED STATEMENT OF INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS IN BRITISH COLUMBIA**\n\n| Attendance | Num. paid | Gov't. |\n|------------|-----------|--------|\n|            | Boys      | Girls  | Total | for. | Grant |\n| Roman Catholic |           |        |       |      |       |\n| 1 St. Mary's Mission | 31 | 42 | 73 | 40 | 2400 |\n| Church of England |           |        |       |      |       |\n| 1 Girls Home |           |        |       |      |       |\n| Alert Bay | 14 | 14 | 600 |\n| 1 Metlakahtla |           |        |       |      |       |\n| Girls Home | 25 | 2500 |\n| 1 Yale-Girls | 27 | 27 | 25 | 1500 |\n| Totals | 27 | 41 | 64 | 4600 |\n| Methodist |           |        |       |      |       |\n| 1 Port Simpson | 25 | 25 | 20 | 1200 |\n### Tabulated Statement of Indian Day Schools in British Columbia\n\n| Denomination | No. Place or Name | Numbers Reported | Gov't. |\n|---------------|-------------------|------------------|--------|\n|               |                   | Boys | Girls | Total | Grant |\n| Roman Catholic | Giant             | 15   | 11    | 26    | $300   |\n|               | (Haines Is'd.)    |      |       |       |        |\n|               | Squashes          | 11   | 12    | 23    | $300   |\n| **Totals**    |                   | **26**| **25**| **49**| **$600** |\n\n| Church of England | Alyush | 12 | 18 | 25 | $300 |\n|                   | Nimkish |     |     |     | $300 |\n|                   | (Alert Bay) |     |     |     | $300 |\n|                   | Gwayamsins | 34 | 18 | 52 | $300 |\n|                   | Hazelton | 16 | 21 | 37 | $300 |\n|                   | Kincolith | 15 | 15 | 26 | $300 |\n|                   | Kitkahtia | 27 | 18 | 45 | $300 |\n|                   | Massett | 26 | 26 | 52 | $300 |\n|                   | Metlakatla | 6 | 26 | 32 | $300 |\n| **Totals**        |         | **134**| **158**| **292**| **$2400** |\n\n| Methodist | Bella Bella | 25 | 21 | 44 | $300 |\n|           | Cape Mudge | 10 | 19 | 29 | $300 |\n|           | Kishpax | 14 | 16 | 30 | $300 |\n|           | Lakalasp | 21 | 12 | 33 | $300 |\n|           | Nenimo | 11 | 15 | 26 | $300 |\n|           | Pt.

Since that time some of the grievances have been removed, at least in part, and we feel assured that a friendly conference touching unsettled points will lead to a complete understanding, and the removal of any grounds of complaint that may yet exist. We deem it necessary, however, to repeat some things that were said in the former Memorandum, so that the present Government may see that we have not complained without cause, and our present requests merit favorable consideration.\n\nIt is well known to the Government that the Methodist Church has always taken a deep interest in the welfare of the Indians of this Dominion, as shown by its large annual expenditure on mission work among them. It has been glad to co-operate with the Government in promoting the Education of Indian youth, and is in hearty sympathy with the policy of gathering Indians boys and girls into Boarding Schools and Industrial Institutes, being convinced that this course will yield\nmore satisfactory results than the old system of day schools on the Reserves.\n\nIn Ontario, so far as Institute work is concerned, matters are now in a fairly satisfactory shape. The new building at Muncey supplies a long-felt want, putting us in a position to do still more effective work than in the past; and as the Department has authorized the admission of one hundred pupils, there are now as many in attendance as the dormitories will properly accommodate. But even on this basis it is impossible to receive all the Indian youth who desire admission, and this circumstance suggests the desirability of additional provision in the form of local boarding schools, where the younger children might be taught and trained till they were of proper age to enter the Muncey Institute. This suggestion is emphasized by the unsatisfactory results of the present day-school system. It seems to be impossible to secure in the day-school on an Indian Reserve anything like a regular attendance, and in many schools the average attendance does not justify the annual expenditure. It is our conviction that a limited number of boarding schools placed at a distance from the Reserves, would provide in the best way for the educational needs of the Indian children, and that the present day-schools might be closed. An exception might be made in the case of bands where the number of children of school age is large, or where the Indians are willing to pay the teacher out of their own funds. Should the suggestion respecting boarding schools commend itself to the Department, we will be prepared to co-operate most heartily in regard to those Reserves where\nwe have established missions, and those schools over which we have control.\n\nIn Manitoba, the necessities of the case have been to some extent met by the erection of the new Institute building at Brandon. When occupied to its full capacity it will provide for some time for the industrial training of those Indians bands included in the missions of the Methodist Church around Lake Winnipeg, and to the North and East, and recent correspondence from some of the missions indicate that it can be filled in the near future, as some difficulties in the way of obtaining pupils have been mainly overcome. It is our earnest desire that no time be lost in securing additional pupils, and that as soon as seventy-five or upwards are in attendance, the control of the Institute be given, as promised, to the Methodist Church on the usual per capita basis. The present system, which makes the Principal virtually a subordinate, renders efficient administration difficult, if not impossible, and we deem it essential that when the control of the Institute is given to the Methodist Church, all appointments and dismissals should be in the power of the Principal, subject to the approval of the Board of Missions. In no other way can he maintain proper control of the employees.\n\nIn a letter from the General Secretary of Missions to the Deputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs, it was stated that the Missionary Society would be willing to assume the support of the Institution on a per capita basis of $110 for eighty pupils with the understanding\n1. That we be allowed to increase the number of pupils as soon as possible to one hundred.\n\n2. That the buildings already authorized by the Department be completed.\n\n3. That some additional requisites in the way of live stock and implements be provided.\n\n4. That the Department make provision, in the near future, for a dairying industry in connection with the Institute; that is, provide the necessary building, plant and cows.\n\nTurning now to British Columbia and the North-West Territories, an examination of the Departmental Report for 1895 reveals not only serious inequalities as between the different denominations, but what appears to be a marked discrimination against the Methodist Church. A careful summary gave the following results for the year ending June 30th, 1895:\n\nOne undenominational Institute, with 31 pupils on the roll, average attendance 16, was voted $5,640, or a per capita of $131 for 43 pupils.\n\nFour Roman Catholic Institutes, with 151 on the roll and 139 average attendance, were voted $18,200, or a per capita of $130 for 140 pupils; and one Roman Catholic Boarding School, with 63 on the roll and 55 average attendance, was voted $2,400, or $80 per capita for 40 pupils. Total for five Institutions, $20,600.\n\nOne Episcopalian Institute, with 19 on the roll and 12 average attendance, was voted $4,550, or $130 per capita for 35 pupils.\nAnd one Episcopalian Boarding School with 25 on the roll and 20 average attendance, was voted $1,500, or $60 per capita for 25 pupils. Total for two Institutions $6,050.\n\nOne Methodist Institute, with 97 on the roll, 76 average attendance, was voted $2,210, or $130 per capita for 17 pupils; and one Methodist Boarding School with 32 on the roll and 17 average attendance, was voted $1,200, or $60 per capita for 20 pupils.\n\nPutting these figures in another form we find that in the case of the Episcopalian schools provision was made for 50 per cent in excess of the average attendance; in the undenominational Institute for 169 per cent in excess; in the Roman Catholic Schools for 5 per cent less than the average attendance; and in the Methodist Schools for 150 per cent less. At the Chilliwack Institute the average attendance in 1895 was 76 and although earnest requests were made for a per capita grant for at least 50 pupils, the actual grant was for 17 only. Since the time referred to the inequality complained of has been remedied in part,\u2014that is a grant is now made for 50 pupils; but in the application of the grant 50 children are selected by name; and when one of these dies or is removed from the school, the Department claims the right to deduct that proportion of the grant, although many other children are known to be in the Institute for whom no grant is made. In addition to all this we understand that the cost of buildings for the Institutes controlled by the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches was provided from public funds, but the Methodists were compelled to provide their own sites and buildings at a cost of over $25,000,\nless $5000 received from the Indian Department in aid of the Institute building at Chilliwack.\n\nIn presenting these contrasts we wish it to be distinctly understood that we do not complain of the amounts paid to other denominations, provided they are doing the work and keeping the schools up to the standard of efficiency required by the Government. But if, as we are given to understand, it is the policy of the Government to accept the co-operation of the churches in the work of educating and civilizing the Indians, we submit that there should be a nearer approach to equality in the dealings of the Government with the churches, and that we should no longer be subject to the discrimination so apparent in the past.\n\nIn Manitoba and the North-West the figures are equally striking. A summary taken as before from the Blue Book, shows the following results for 1895:\n\nFor three Roman Catholic Institutes, with 451 pupils on the rolls, average attendance 381, there was an aggregate vote of $50,300, actual payments, as Auditor-General's Report, $62,451. For seven Boarding Schools controlled by the same Church, with 195 on the rolls, average attendance 165, the aggregate vote was $12,216; actual payments, $11,681. Total amount voted, $62,516; total paid, $74,132.\n\nFor three Church of England Institutes, with 300 on the rolls, average attendance 260, there would have been a vote, on the assumed per capita, of about $33,600; but the actual expenditure seems to have been over $57,000, all expenses, in some instances,\nbeing met by the Government. For nine Boarding Schools under the control of the same Church, with 239 on the rolls, average attendance 181, the vote stood at $14,688, the actual expenditure at $13,648. Total assumed vote, $48,488; total expended, $70,748.\n\nFor one Presbyterian Institute, with 137 on the rolls, average attendance 110, there was a vote of $19,500; actually expended, $17,630. For five Boarding Schools, with 136 on the rolls, the vote was $7,200; actual expenditure $4,786. Total vote, $26,700; total expended, $22,416.\n\nFor two Methodist Institutes, with 110 on the rolls, average attendance 69, there was an assumed vote of say, $14,000; actual expenditure, $13,787. In the case of Brandon, all expenses have been met hitherto by the Government. For one Methodist Boarding School, with 37 on the roll, average attendance 22, there was a vote of $2,448; actual expenditure $1,680. Total vote, $16,448; total expenditure, $15,467.\n\nSince the foregoing figures were prepared the situation has changed a good deal. The Department has authorized an increase of pupils at Brandon, erected a dwelling for the Principal, and some other buildings for industrial purposes. At Red Deer provision is to be made for 89 pupils, with necessary enlargement of existing building, or erection of others. Provision is also being made, as we are informed, for the enlargement of the building at Morley, and the erection of outbuildings. When these undertakings are fully carried out our needs in regard to industrial training in\nManitoba and the Territories will be met to a considerable extent, but the question of Boarding schools at certain points will still remain, and for this we ask the favorable consideration of the Government.\n\nTaking the whole Dominion, according to the Blue Book of 1895, the Roman Catholic Church controlled 17 Industrial Institutes and Boarding Schools, with Government appropriations aggregating $87,800, and an expenditure of $104,531. The Episcopal Church had 15 Institutes and Boarding Schools, for which the provision amounted to $59,538, and the expenditure to some $77,800. The Presbyterian Church, with but little mission work among the Indians, had 6 Institutes and Boarding Schools, with an appropriation of $26,700, and expenditure of $22,416; while the Methodist Church, the largest Protestant body in the Dominion, had but 6 Institutes and Boarding Schools, with a grant of $24,958, and an expenditure of $23,630. If this marked difference were the result of lack of enterprise on our part, in the work of Indian education we would have no ground of complaint; but since we are expending annually, from our own funds, a large amount of money in this work, and have urged upon the Government many times, during the last ten or twelve years, the removal of the disabilities under which we labor, it must be apparent that the responsibility does not rest with us.\n\nThe Government cannot fail to be aware of the fact that Christian missions are a most potent factor in the civilization of the Indian tribes. It is due to this influence, more than any other\nthat tribal wars have ceased, and that those Indians who are under\nthe care of the missionaries are obedient to the laws and are firm\nfriends of the Government. We call attention to the fact that during\nthe troubles with the Indians in the North-West, not a single\nIndian connected with our missions was implicated in the revolt.\nIt is also well known that the firm attitude of Chief Pakan and\nhis people at Whitefish Lake contributed more than anything else\nto prevent a general uprising among the Crees.\n\nIn Indian mission work some of the churches have been much\nmore active than others, and this has given them a \"sphere of influence\" that places them in a better position than others to aid\nthe Government in its civilizing and educating work. In making appropriations to schools and institutes, we think the expenditure\nof the churches should be taken into account on the principle of\n\"helping those who help themselves.\" Unfortunately some of the\nchurches do not publish an annual report of agents employed and\nmoney spent on Indian missions, and we are therefore without accurate information on which to base a comparison. Suffice it to\nsay, however, that the Methodist Church is spending over $40,000\nannually on its Indian missions, over and above the grants from the\nGovernment in aid of schools; and that in our Indian schools in\nOntario and Quebec, we pay in every instance, one-half of the\nteacher's salary,\u2014something which is not done, so far as the Blue\nBooks show, by any other Church.\n\nAccording to the last census 28,199 Indians are classed as\n\"Protestants.\" We have no statistics showing the relative numbers\nclaimed by other Protestant Churches, but we claim that probably not less than 16,000 are under the care of missionaries of the Methodist Church; and this fact is sufficient of itself to show how utterly inadequate is the provision, in the matter of Boarding Schools and Institutes, for the children of Methodist Indians who ought to have the advantages of such training.\n\nTurning now to another aspect of the question, we find that the total number of pupils enrolled in Institutes and schools of all kinds (boarding and day) in 1894, was 7,052, and that the Government appropriations amounted to $223,834, or an average per capita of $31.74. Distributing the pupils among the various churches as per returns, we find that the actual per capita grant to the various denominations was as follows:\u2014 Roman Catholic, $34.43; Episcopalian $29.75; Methodist, $17.49; Presbyterian, $84.40.\n\nAverages like the above are not relied upon as an accurate presentation of the case, as one Church at least does only Institute and Boarding School work, and the per capita grant in consequence appears abnormally large. But the figures are introduced for the purpose of showing that whatever basis of computation is adopted, the Methodist Church, in regard to grants, is placed at a disadvantage.\nThe points on which we desire the favorable consideration of the Government are the following:\n\nONTARIO\n\n1. The opening of several Boarding Schools, apart from the Reserves, and the closing of ordinary day schools.\n\n2. In the meantime let all churches be treated alike in regard to existing Day Schools. That is, require all churches to pay fifty per cent of the teachers' salaries, as is now done by the Methodist Church, or else relieve us of that burden.\n\n3. The disposition to be made of the old building at Muncey. At present it is useless, but with a very moderate expenditure it could be made to answer a number of useful purposes. Full information and sketch plan will shortly be furnished.\n\n4. A modification of the method of computing attendance at Muncey and other Institutes. That is, when an authorized pupil leaves the Institute, for any reason during the year, let the Principal have authority to put another in his place, whose attendance shall be credited in the returns.\n\nMANITOBA\n\n1. In regard to Brandon Institute, the more pressing needs have already been indicated, and need not be repeated.\n\n2. Provision for two or three Boarding Schools should be made, which might take the place of certain day schools now conducted on our missions.\nNORTH WEST TERRITORIES.\n\n1. The completion of the promised enlargements at Red Deer as speedily as possible, and additional pupils secured.\n\n2. Enlargement of McDougall Orphanage as provided for, and recoup Missionary Society for expenditure on school house and laundry. When Orphanage is enlarged the two day schools on Morley Reserve to be closed.\n\n3. Provision for Boarding schools at certain points, and the closing of certain day schools.\n\nNOTE - Should a policy of this kind be favored by the Government, we deem it important that all young children should be sent to the Boarding Schools, and that admission to the Institutes should be conditioned upon ability to pass such examinations as the Department might prescribe. We also deem it important that all Indian children should be subject to a medical examination, and that no child infected with any serious disease should be admitted to either Boarding school or Institute.\n\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nAt the Coqualeetza Institute a per capita grant is now made for 50 pupils. The actual attendance is over 90. It is possible that some of these are not legitimate claimants, having white fathers still living; but we submit that a grant should be made for each bona fide Indian child actually in residence in Institute.\n\n2. The entire cost of the site and buildings at Coqualeetza\nwas met by the Missionary Society, with the exception of $5000.00 granted by Parliament. In the case of the Roman Catholic Churches, Institute buildings and equipment have been provided from public funds, and there seems to be no good reason why an invidious distinction should be made in the case of the Methodist Church. We submit, therefore, that the Missionary Society should be recouped for its expenditure on site and buildings at Coqualeetza, and the ownership of the property assumed by the Government. Additional land is greatly needed at this Institute, and we strongly urge the purchase of not less than 50 acres more within easy reach of the Institute.\n\n3. Provision for an Industrial school on the Upper Skeena. This we regard as an urgent need for the Indians of that part of the interior. A quarter section of good land has already been secured, part of which has been cleared, and two small buildings erected thereon. Our proposal is that the Government acquire this site and make provision for the necessary buildings and equipment. The cost need not be large, as a building of the plainest description will suffice; and with abundance of fish in the River, and vegetables raised on the land, the cost of maintenance might be kept at a minimum.\n\n4. We again request that provision be made by per capita grant, for 30 pupils in the Girls' Boarding School at Port Simpson instead of 20 as at present; and that a similar grant be made for boys in the Boys' Home at the same place.\n5. Boarding Schools are very much needed by us at Bella Bella Kitamaat, and Queen Charlotte Islands. Work will shortly begin at one or two of these points, if we have any assurance from the Indian Department that aid will be given.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Superintendent of the Methodist Church.\n\n[Signature]\nGeneral Secretary of Missions.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nWith regard to the application of the Rev. John McDougall for certain grants for schools, which I understand are as follows:\n\nBattle River Boarding School . . . . $4,000.\nPer capita for 40 pupils . . . . . . . 2,880.\n\nIn this case two day schools to be closed.\n\nSaddle Lake for Building and outfit . . $4,000.\nPer capita for 40 pupils . . . . . . . 2,880.\n\nIn this case three day schools to be closed.\n\nI will be glad if you will let me know what has been done in connection with these applications, and also any particulars you can give to assist me in coming to a decision.\n\nDeputy Minister.\nOttawa, 27th June, 1898.\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nThe two reports of Mr. Benson and report of Revds. Dr. Sutherland and Dr. Carman may be filed.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 9th May, 1900\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the application of Rev. John McDougall for grants for the establishment of boarding schools at Battle River in the Bobhema Agency and at Saddle Lake, to be conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church, and towards which he asks the Department to contribute $4000 each for buildings and $2860 for the maintenance of forty pupils at each school, I beg to say that there is no official correspondence on file in regard to either of these matters within the past two years.\n\nIn March '98 the Rev. Dr Sutherland submitted a memorandum setting forth the requirements of the Methodist Missionary Society in regard to Indian education, in which, inter alia, he stated that there were three points in the North-West at which boarding schools, from his point of view, were urgently needed. First, at Battle River in Sampson's Band. Second, at Whitefish Lake, or between Whitefish Lake and Saddle Lake in connection with Pakan's Band, and third, at Norway House, as a centre from which quite a number of Bands could be reached. He stated that the expenditure need not be very large and that in each case probably $2000 would provide a building large enough to begin with.\n\nThe Minister approved of providing for the proposed school at Norway House and the Department\ncontributed $3000 towards the cost of the building and made a grant of $72 each for 50 pupils. This school is now in operation and has an enrollment of 36 pupils.\n\nThe other applications were not then entertained...\n\nThe Rev. Mr McDougall states that by the opening of the Battle River school, two day schools could be closed. These would be the schools on Sampson's and Louis Bell's reserve, where the majority of the Indians are Methodists. The Roman Catholics have a boarding school in this Agency on Ermineskin's reserve with provision for 50 pupils. Agent Grant gives the total population of the reserve as 138, which would be pretty evenly divided between the Roman Catholics and Methodists. The attendance at the day school on Sampson's reserve is not very encouraging, owing to the distance many of the children have to travel, and their absence with their parents during the haying and fishing seasons.\n\nThe establishment of a boarding school at Saddle Lake would, it is claimed, do away with three day schools: at Saddle Lake, Whitefish Lake and Goodfish Lake. These schools have a very fair attendance aggregating about 70 at the three schools and they are said to be doing good work, especially the one at Goodfish Lake. The Saddle Lake school was lately closed, owing to the teacher, who was also the missionary, being removed. No doubt if they had a boarding school, they would be able to retain a permanent missionary.\n\nThe Methodists have an industrial school in\nin the neighborhood,\u2014at Red Deer, which is attended by children from all the reserves above referred to, and unless it is the wish of the Department to increase the number of boarding schools, I think that accommodation could be found for even more children at this school.\n\nThe fact of the Roman Catholics having boarding schools in each of these Agencies is enough to make the Methodists ask for the same consideration, especially as the impression seems to have gone abroad that the Department is favorable to the establishment of more boarding schools. On the 30th June last there were 22 boarding schools in operation in the North-West Territories, and if all the applications for new schools of this class were entertained there would be no necessity for any day schools, as the boarding and industrial schools would more than accommodate the total school population.\n\n[Signature]\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 11th January 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nMemo, re application of Methodist Missionary Society for further grants for Indian school purposes.\n\nI have reported on each application separately in the order in which they occur in the private communication addressed to the Minister.\n\n(1). In March 1898 the Rev. Dr Sutherland made application for the establishment of boarding schools at the following points:- First at Battle River; Second, at Whitefish Lake or between Whitefish and Saddle Lake in connection with Pakan's Band; Third at Norway House and lastly for a hospital at Norway House, Dr Sutherland stated that $2000.00 for each of the Boarding schools would probably provide a building large enough to begin with in each case. The Minister approved of the Norway House Boarding school being established and provision was made for 50 pupils at $72.00 and $3000.00 for a building, and stated that he could not comply with the other requests above referred to.\n\nThe Methodists have three day schools in the Saddle Lake Agency, Whitefish Lake, Goodfish Lake and Saddle Lake, all receiving the usual Government support.\n\nWith regard to the statement that a boarding school has been provided for another Church, I may say in explanation that the Blue Quill's Boarding school is the one referred to, but it is not a new school but a new site chosen for an old established one.\none,-the Lac-la-Biche school which was removed from the latter place with the consent of the Department.\n\nRe the erection of another Church between Whitefish and Goodfish Lakes. This is a matter with which I am not familiar, as it has no connection with school work, but I find that the Department consented to the building of the Church after protest received from the Methodist Church and Protestant Indians (Pyle 194906 on this subject herewith.)\n\n(2) The question of restoring the grant for a teacher at Oxford House was lately before the Department in connection with an application for day schools there and at God's Lake and Island Lake, when the Minister decided not to accede to this request.\n\n(3) The grants asked for in this paragraph for God's Lake and Island Lake were refused as stated in the preceding paragraph. These points and Oxford House are outside Treaty Limits and the Indians who make this locality their headquarters spend most of their time in hunting and trapping, and day schools, if established, would not likely be regularly attended. No returns have been received for the past 25 years from Oxford House. These Indians applied for admission to Treaty but as the country is unfit for settlement the Department did not consider it necessary to treat with them.\n\n(4) The enlargement of the public school building at Norway House. The building referred to is used for day school purposes before the boarding school was established and is now used as a classroom for the boarders. This question was lately submitted to the Deputy Minister, who directed that Dr Sutherland should be reminded that at the time the\nDepartment contributed $3000.00 towards the erection of the boarding school he was advised that no further contribution was to be made by the Department. Fyle herewith with Minister's ruling turned out.\n\n(5). In the communication referred to hereunder, this school is called the Jack River school. The Department has no record of a school of that name. There are five Methodist schools (day) in the Berens River now in operation, which receive the usual Government grant and another school, called Norway House was closed when the boarding school of that name was opened. This school and the one at Rossville were both known as Norway House and the former was sometimes designated as No.2 to distinguish it from the Rossville school.\n\nThe application referred to in this paragraph is new to the Department.\n\n(6). The Vouchers referred to in this paragraph are turned out on fyle 168918 herewith and show an expenditure of $2995.83, which were paid by the Department out of the $3000.00 vote for this purpose, which was made on the understanding that no further grant would be given.\n\n(7). No correspondence has as yet been received by the Department on this subject, but there is a very well attended day school at that place.\n\n(8). There is no application on fyle for a school at this point. The census shows that the Loon Straits and Blood Vein Bands combined have a population of only 73, of whom are Methodists, 2 Roman Catholics and 68 Pagans, and in a letter from the Indian Commissioner in regard to certain remarks made by\nby Mr Inspector McColl in his last annual report with regard to the Blood Vein River Band, it is stated that these Indians only go on their Reserve to receive their annuities. They are a nomadic Band and have no settled home.\n\nA great might be said both for and against these applications, but it is for the Department to decide.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 29th January, 1901.\n\nMemorandum: -\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nWill you please read the Minister's memorandum and furnish me with the information he desires. Also note for the Supplementary Estimates the items of grants which he has mentioned.\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\n\nEncl:\nMinister's Office.\nDepartment of the Interior.\nOttawa, 26th January, 1901.\n\nMr. Smart,\n\nRespecting the Indian matters which are referred to in Dr. Sutherland's letter and which I discussed with Mr. McDougall, please note the following:\n\n1st. Let me have the file relating to the location of a Roman Catholic church school on the White Fish Lake Reserve.\n\n2nd. The grant for the teacher at Oxford House should be restored.\n\n3rd. Grants for school houses at God's Lake and Island Lake should be made. $100.00 a piece for school houses, and a grant of $200.00 each a year for the teachers. $600.00 should be provided for the enlargement of the public school building at Norway House.\n\nMaterial to the extent of $1000.00 should be furnished for the Norway House boarding school building.\n\nAs\nAs to school No.2 on the Norway House reserve, it is intimated that we have given authority to the Church of England to put a school there. Please let me know the facts in regard to this. It should not be done as the Reserve has been under the charge of the Methodist Church for a great many years, and it will simply result in disputes if the Episcopal Church is permitted to put a school within a few miles of Norway House. School No.2 on the Norway Reserve is generally called the Jack River school.\n\n[Signature]\nThe Secretary:\n\nIn further reference to the application of the Methodist Missionary Society for additional grants for Indian school purposes, I beg to report that there is no file relating to the location of a Roman Catholic school on the White Fish Lake Reserve, referred to in the Minister's memorandum herewith. File 194,906, which accompanied my memorandum of the 11th instant, refers to the erection of another church between White Fish and Goodfish Lakes by the Roman Catholics, in opposition to the wishes of the Methodist Church and the Protestant Indians of the neighborhood. This file is still with the Minister or the Deputy Minister.\n\n2nd. As to the No. 2 school on the Norway House reserve, about which enquiry is also made in the Minister's memorandum, I beg to say that a protest was received from Rev. Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, against the re-opening of this school under the auspices of the Church of England with the usual Government grant. By direction of the Deputy Minister the Indian Commissioner was asked to report as to the necessity for providing for the salary of a teacher to carry on a school under the Church of England. Mr. Laird's reply on file 118,274 is placed\nPerewith for your information. The statement made by the Commissioner that he was informed, in connection with the Supplementary Estimates, of the provision made for this school, is correct.\n\nIn October '99 a communication was received from the Bishop of Moosonee applying for further grants to schools in his Diocese. A school to be established at or near Norway House (Outside Treaty Limits) was one of those mentioned in his application. Provision was made for this school as above stated but no intimation was given to the Church of England authorities by the Department that this had been done. Rev. Mr. Burman of Winnipeg was informed on the 21st March last that it would not be possible to say until after the estimates were passed, what additional outside treaty schools carried on by the Church of England would be entitled to receive a grant, and he has not since been communicated within this matter. I cannot state positively whether the Commissioner has notified the Church authorities as his letter of the 6th ultimo (file 118,274) contains no reference to such notification.\nVancouver, B.C., Dec. 16, 1901.\n\nThe Honorable the\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nPursuant to a conversation at an interview which you were good enough to grant me in October last, I have put in writing the result of my observation of, and enquiries into, the system of education at present in operation among the Indians of British Columbia, and now respectfully submit the same for your serious consideration.\n\nToward the end of October, 1900, whilst travelling along the North West Coast, I found the Indians with their families returning home after the small fishing and berry gathering. The children as a consequence could no more than get to school by the first of November. On another trip over the same ground about the end of January, 1901, I found these same Indians and their families had gone to their sealing grounds and elsewhere. On the fourth of February there were very few people at Bella Bella. On the fifth I found but three old women and one little girl at China Hat, and the same night at Hartley Bay. I learned there was not a single Indian in the village. Hence ab non discet omnia. Children must accompany their parents in these wanderings as there are no Boarding Schools to accommodate them. Schools are left with but few and occasionally no pupils. Children at school for about three months in the year and hard at work forgetting during the other nine\u2014a\npsychological absurdity. An educational plant on the ground and paid for twelve months in the year, but effective for about three months only \u2014 an economic fallacy. We see these conditions at all limited in area. They are really as widespread as the B.C. littoral. But that they should not be allowed to perpetuate themselves, goes without saying. And this the more that the remedy is not far to seek nor difficult of application.\n\nWhat is the remedy? The remedy is the substitution of BOARDING FOR DAY SCHOOLS; but these to be of the simplest and most inexpensive character consistent with efficiency. Such a boarding school, with an attendance of 30, could very well be conducted by a Teacher, a Matron, and an assistant, and if unusually large a Deaconess or equivalent might be added. The children should live mainly on Indian food and in the Indian way, all being taught to keep themselves and their rooms clean and orderly, the larger ones also taking their turns in the workings of the institution; the girls helping in the housework, the boys in gardening, and outside work generally, and the use of ordinary tools. The Deaconess, where one is necessary, could take charge of the dormitory at night and during the day could visit the homes of the village and teach the mothers how to keep their houses.\n\nThis is no impractical theory. The demonstration of it can be seen at any time at Port Simpson, where for years our Boys Home has been run most successfully on just such lines. With such Boarding Schools, training boys and girls alike,\nnot simply scholastically, but practically to orderly lives and correct habits; training them not for three or four months at the most, but for nine months at the least in every year, with schools and children exerting their thus vastly increased influence directly upon the homes of the villages, the influence is bound to be incalculable.\n\nThese Boarding Schools should be built in or near the villages, and so subserve all the purposes of the Day Schools which should merge into them Day School purposes.\n\nThe Boarding School age might be from six or eight years to thirteen inclusive; after which the more promising pupils might be sent to one of the Institutes.\n\nAttendance might be for nine months in the year, with short Christmas and long summer holidays. During the summer holidays the children could accompany their parents to the salmon fishing and earn money for them as they usually do. Attendance, if at all possible, should be compulsory as it is with us, for a given number, if not for the full nine months in each year. As to the offensiveness of the compulsory aspect of the question, I think that to the Indians hitherto, it has lain in the indenture system, by which he signed away all control over his child being generally placed in a school so far distant that it amounted to a heart-breaking separation to the Indian who loves his children dearly; dearly enough, I am sure, to send them to the village Boarding School, but too dearly to send them far away and be happy. To be able to see their children in Sunday School and Church every week, and in case of sickness...\nat any time to have them with them during the holidays earning money would, I am sure, exactly suit the Indians.\n\nAt any rate they would feel that the present day schools could not fill the bill, and their constant appeal to me is to get them a boarding school in their own village.\n\nThe study of the first importance in these schools, for the Indian child, is the acquisition of the English Vernacular. This the coming Indian must have if he is in any degree to hold his own in the struggle with the rapidly invading whites. And where else could he acquire it, as he would in these schools where it would be the language of his daily life? In the school room, also, it is imperative that a reasonably adequate channel of communication be established between pupil and teacher, if education is to proceed with anything like reasonable facility and efficiency.\n\nWere the first two years concentrated primarily on English Language Lessons, and but incidentally upon other subjects, the progress made in the following five years would be worth fifteen of the present regime.\n\nThen should follow Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, and Hygiene sufficient for the needs of the child's Indian life; some Geography and History, so that he may know something of the world in which he lives and more especially of the Empire of which he forms a part.\n\nFinally correct moral principles should be assiduously inculcated, and just as assiduously should correct habits be formed upon these, the whole having the fullest play and development in everyone doing his part in the building up of a clean systematic and efficient school, in which integrity, industry and order are paramount.\nAs to the Statistical aspect of the present Educational order, I refer you to the Report of the Indian Department for the year ending June 1900. The Statistics I have compiled therefrom I herewith append in manifest A.\n\nI could not find in the report the exact number of children of school age, but took the number 3861 of children of the age from 7 to 15, inclusive, as approximately correct. As being somewhat too large it may discount, but should not at all destroy, the validity of the deductions therefrom.\n\nThe average number of pupils to the school under Ave. No. Atts 26 \u2014 accurately 25.7854, coupled similarly with the average number to the teacher II.040 gives food for reflection. The cost of a tradesman per annum $515.84 also contains sufficient truth for most serious consideration. Provision should be made by some kind of uniform Boarding School and some kind of compulsory attendance to raise these averages to an economically sound standard.\n\nAs to the Financial Statistics, they have been taken from the Reports of the Indian Department and Auditor General for the year ending June, 1900, and are herewith appended in the Manifest marked B.\n\nAt present the Average Vote for an average attendance amounts to $63.53 and the Average Grant to $57.84. On this basis $2553.52 added to the Actual grant of 1900 would have provided these 1082 Average Attendants, their full Boarding School per capita of $60.\n\nAssuming the Indian School Population of B.C. to be 3000, an average attendance of 2000, a per capita of $60 on this average attendance, and Compulsory Attendance, then the\ncost would be $120,000. Of this a proposition might be provided by the Indians. An Indian could very well give $20 worth of food stuffs and clothing for the support of his child. I am sure he would vote for such a law if he could have the Boarding School. The present system degrades the Indian by pauperising him.\n\nIn conclusion I may say that I have thrown out these thoughts by way of suggestion rather than finality. And from the standpoint of a churchman I would prefer four Boarding schools at $1500 each than one Industrial School at $6000. I may furthermore say that I speak from and for the coast line of B.C.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n(signed) R. Whittington.\n### School Statistics for B.C.\n\n| Schools       | No. | On Roll | Average No. Attendance | Average Total Attendance |\n|---------------|-----|---------|------------------------|--------------------------|\n| Day           | 28  | 893     | 488                    | .684 D                   |\n| Boarding      | 7   | 254     | 215                    | .646+                     |\n| Industrial    | 7   | 421     | 379                    | .900+                     |\n| Total         | 42  | 1569    | 1082                   | .690                      |\n\n**I Day School averages**\n\n- 32 -D\n\n**I Boarding School averages**\n\n- 36 -\n\n**I Industrial**\n\n- 60 -\n\n**I Average**\n\n- 37 -\n\nIndian Boys in B.C. age 7 to 15 inclusive (1889)\n\n- Girls \" \" \" \" \" \" \" 1672 Total 3361.\n\nOn Roll 1568, Total of School age in B.C. 3361 Percentage .483+D\n\nAverage No. Attending 1082 of School age in B.C. 3361 = .321+\n\n### Industrial Schools training:\n\n- **Carpenters**\n  - 47% Total cost of Schools in B.C. $68650\n\n- **Shoemakers**\n  - 17 \" \" \" 379 Pupils at $60. $22740\n\n- **Bakers**\n  - 15 \" \" \" 80 Tradesmen $45910\n\n- **Harness Makers**\n  - 4 \" \" \" 1 \" $515.842\n\n- **Painters**\n  - 6 \" This for the year 1900.\n\nTotal 89\n\nAssume 4 Teachers to the Boarding and 6 to the Industrial School under the present system.

Whittington, Superintendent of Indian Missions in British Columbia, respecting the condition of Indian education in that country. This Report is the outcome of a conversation which Mr Whittington had with you in October last. It was sent to me with the request that I would revise the Report, and forward a copy for your consideration.\n\nBelieving that the Report contains valuable suggestions respecting future educational work among the Indians, I send it to you with the hope that it will receive careful consideration. It may be considered impracticable to make any radical changes in schools already established in that country, but the suggestions in the Report may be well worth considering in connection with future movements for the benefit of the Indians tribes.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Honorable the Super't General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nGeneral Secretary.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 23rd December, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith respect to the report of Rev. Mr Whittington, Superintendent of Indian Missions in British Columbia, on the condition of Indian Education in that Province, a copy of which was transmitted to the Department by Dr Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, I beg to say that Mr Whittington's suggestions as to future educational work among these Indians seem to be dictated more by the spiritual than the temporal necessities. Before acceding to the project outlined by Mr Whittington, it would be well to consider what the cost to the country and the corresponding benefits to the Indians would be.\n\nMr Whittington submits with his report two manifests marked \"A\" and \"B\" compiled by him from the Auditor General's and Departmental reports of last year, which excepting some inaccuracies will answer the purpose of arriving at the cost of the proposed change. He gives the total cost of schools in British Columbia for last year as $62386.00 for a total average of 1082 pupils out of an enrollment of 1568, or $57.64 per capita.\n\nThe schools population is stated as 3361 for 3000 of whom he wishes to provide boarding school accommodation, with an average attendance of 2000 at a per capita cost of $60, or $120,000 in all. This is a large amount but as there are at present seven Industrial schools in operation in the Province with an average attendance of 379 pupils.\nat a per capita rate of $130 or a total cost of $48,270.00. This number of pupils would still have to be paid for at the Industrial school rate, which is $70.00 per capita higher than that of the boarding school; $26,530.00 would therefore have to be added to Mr Whittington's estimate, which would increase the sum required to $146,530.00 per annum and incidentals such as buildings, repairs, equipment, etc., would easily bring it up to $200,000\u2014an annual increase of nearly $140,000 for one province.\n\nThe arguments used by Mr Whittington would have as much, or more force in all the other provinces, excepting some portions of Ontario and Quebec, as in British Columbia; and as there are fully 20,000 children of school age in the Dominion with numbers of equally zealous church workers to look after their interests, you can readily judge what outlay such chimerical projects would involve. I pointed out the other day the sturdy growth of the School Vote, which will nearly reach the half million mark next year. Festina Lente would be a good motto to adopt in regard to the Indian education policy.\n\nIf the general results obtained by the Industrial schools are at least problematical, there is no assurance that those of the boarding schools would be as good, even if at less cost.\n\nI shall speak of the Indians of the North-West Coast of British Columbia, for whose special benefit Mr Whittington is derisive of substituting boarding for day schools.\n\nBella Bella is one of the points referred to by Mr Whittington and the census return for last year shows that there were 49 children of school\nage on the reserve with an average attendance of 27 for the whole year,\u2014not a bad showing considering that the children accompany their parents on their wanderings and that there is no boarding school to accommodate them. The quarterly returns of Miss Miller, who is in charge of this school, show a very high average for December and March quarters. This is a Methodist school and under the former teacher a still better average was obtained. If these children forget as readily as they learn the physiological absurdity is as much due to the methods pursued as to the absence of the children. The educational plant including the teacher, is under the control of the Methodist Missionary Society and could be utilized by them as to do away with the economic fallacy referred to.\n\nThe North West Indians are literally \"Toilers of the Sea\" which affords them almost their entire support. They make more from fishing than any other Indians in British Columbia, and in order to obtain the necessary skill and daring in these pursuits, they must begin to learn while they are young. No knowledge of books, refinements of life or manners will help them in perils of the deep and I do not think it would be wise to force them to change their present mode of providing for their sustenance until a better one can be offered them. They can find no other work! A man is not poor because he has nothing but because he does not work\". Life even in a boarding school will unfit them for their work and increase their sensitiveness of wants without the means to supply those wants which will but add to the burden of life.\n\nTo show you that the North West Coast\nIndians are not so badly provided with educational facilities; I shall quote from Mr Agent Todt's report of last year. Speaking of education he says:\n\n\"The education of the people of this Agency is carried on by five professional teachers, seven native teachers, eighteen missionary teachers and twenty-five missionary ladies\u2014in all fifty-five religious and secular teachers having thirty-three churches and seventeen schoolhouses\". There is a school population of 642 Indian children, 590 of whom live in the vicinity of schools. There are also a few Salvation Army officers who are helping to educate and improve the Indians.\n\nI can easily understand that to keep this number of religious and secular teachers in the field is a heavy drain on the funds of the missionary societies and no doubt accounts somewhat for their anxiety to be relieved by the establishment of boarding schools which would provide for their maintenance by the Government.\n\nThe Department should not be asked to break up the Indian home such as it is and the Regulations for compulsory attendance were not passed for that purpose. Of course there are Indians as well as whites who would like to shirk the responsibility of providing for their children?\n\nThat the North West Coast Indian is capable of teaching a high state of civilization without coddling was proved over a quarter of a century ago by the work of the Rev. Wm. Duncan at Port Simpson and Metlakahtla. That none of his successors in the mission field have achieved similar success is not the fault of the Indians. Work was the chief incentive to civilization employed by Mr\nDuncan,-work for the benefits to be had from it not merely supervision and direction.\n\nThat better results have not followed from the Industrial and Boarding schools is to my mind attributable to their failure to instil into the minds of the pupils the dignity of labor. They are taught to work, made to work and to work whether they like it or not, but they are not taught to see the necessity for work so far as they are personally concerned. \"The laborer is worthy of his hire\" and pupils should learn this maxim by practical experience. The Rev. Dr Ryerson in his report as to the best method of establishing and conducting industrial schools for the benefit of the aboriginal Indian tribes, prepared nearly fifty-four years ago, advocated this principle. Pupils should be paid for their work and pay for what they receive so that they may learn self-reliance and the orderly and intelligent conduct of affairs as well as a due sense of the value of money and other property and that the non-producer is a burden to himself and to the community and is to be dealt with accordingly.\n\nThe Indian should learn by experience that he can get nothing for nothing. In this connection I beg to refer to my report of the 23rd April last on the working of the George Junior Republic.\n\nMartin Duncan\nOTTAWA, 20th January, 1902\n\nRev.

Whittington, Superintendent of Indian Missions in British Columbia under the Methodist Church, containing statistics taken from the Auditor General's Report for 1900 in regard to Indian schools in that Province in support of his application for the establishment of boarding schools there.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that a lengthy report on this subject was received from Mr. Whittington in December last through the General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, which was addressed to the Superintendent General, who directed that that officer should be informed that no action could at present be taken in regard to Mr. Whittington's suggestions as contained in such report.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nGeo. R. Maxwell, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOTTAWA.\nTo the Honorable,\nthe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\n\nOTTAWA,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI hereby make application to the Department of Indian Affairs for the establishment of a Boarding School, with accommodation and equipment for 100 pupils, to be taken from the various Methodist Missions on the South end of Vancouver Island.\n\nBetween Cape Mudge on the East Coast, and Nitinat on the West Coast there are five Methodist Missions, at Cape Mudge, Nanaimo, Cowichan, Victoria, and Nitinat. The Nanaimo mission, including the Chemainus, Nellie, Uwhalas, and Penelakut tribes, has been steadily maintained for 40 years. The mission at Victoria for upwards of 30 years. The missions at Cape Mudge, and Nitinat for about 10 years each; and the Cowichan mission for 7 years.\n\nDay-schools, with the usual Government grants are in operation at Cape Mudge, Nanaimo, and Nitinat, but these only partially meet the needs of the villages where they are established; and when the parents go to their hunting or fishing camps they must of necessity take their children with them, which necessity would be obviated by the establishment of a Boarding School. There are also numbers of our children at Snouche, Quilicum, Nanaimo River, Chemainus, Cowichan, and Victoria, who are far beyond the reach of our day-schools, and whose parents are looking to us for the education of their families. Besides these, there are numbers of pagan Indians who are asking to provide a school where they can send their children.\n\nThis matter has been laid before our Missionary Board, and while that Board has decided that such a school is necessary, yet it belongs to Dominion Government to take the initiative, hence this application.\n\nTrusting that this will meet with the favorable consideration of the Department, and that steps will be taken as soon as possible for the establishment of this Institution, I have the honor to be, Dear Sir,\n\nVery Respectfully Yours,\n\nC. M. Tate,\nMethodist Missionary.\nOTTAWA, 24th October, 1902\n\nThe Acting Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the application made by Rev. Mr. Tait of Duncan, Vancouver Island for the establishment of a boarding school with accommodation for 100 pupils to be taken from the various Methodist Missions on the South end of Vancouver Island, I beg to say that by Mr. Tait's own admission the Methodists are fairly treated in the matter of day schools for this district, as there are three schools in the five missions which are under their control. The other two missions are in the near neighborhood of Vancouver and Nanaimo and if they do not wish the children to attend the Roman Catholic Indian schools established at these places, they could be sent to the white schools there.\n\nUpon referring to the census return from the Cowichan Agency, in which these missions are situated, I find that out of a total Indian population of 1944, only 352 are Methodists, the remainder being nearly all Roman Catholics. The school population is given at about 400, yet more than 75 of whom could be Methodists. On the reserves to which he calls particular attention to the lack of educational facilities I find that the Methodists would have, in proportion to their numbers, few if any children to send to school.\n\nThe question of the wholesale establishment of boarding schools in British Columbia came up last December on a report of Rev. Mr. Whittingdon, Supt. of Methodist Indian missions in B.C., and was dealt\nwith by the Superintendent General then. (SEE my memo. of 23rd Dec., 1901 turned out on this file.) The arguments I then used against such a sweeping extension of the boarding school system in B.C. apply to this section with even more force than they do to the northern portion of the island as these Indians are in constant contact with the whites and are progressive and well to do and their religious instruction is well looked after.\n\nIf the Methodists wish to establish such a school it would be well for them first to refer to Luke XIV, 26--29.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Blenner\nExl\n\nOTTAWA, 6th November, 1902\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th ulto. applying for the establishment of a boarding school with accommodation and equipment for 100 pupils to be taken from the various Methodist Missions on the south end of Vancouver Island; and in reply I am directed by the Superintendent General to inform you that no grant can be made for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN,\nSecretary\n\nRev. C.M. Tate,\nMethodist Missionary\nDuncan,\nB.C.\nOttawa, 12th April, 1904.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nAttached is a memorandum of matters discussed at an interview which I had a day or two ago with Dr. Sutherland of the Methodist Church. You might discuss them with me at your convenience.\n\nEncl.\nMemorandum regarding interview with Dr. Sutherland on Indian affairs.\n\nApplication is made for a grant of $1500.00 to enable the Principal at Chilliwack to put up a residence for himself and family. It is thought that this grant will enable the Principal with the labor which he can supply to put up a residence which will answer the purpose.\n\nApplication is made also for an extension of the McDougall Orphanage and an increase of the per capita grant, which is now on the basis of a boarding school.\n\nThe question of enlarging the Brandon Industrial School also brought up.\n\nIt is stated that at the Red Deer School the cost of bringing the pupils to the school, which is in other institutions paid by the Government, is charged against the School.\n\nSuggestion\nSuggestion made that the Caughnawaga and Oka Schools should be taken over and managed on the same basis as other schools in Ontario.\nOTTAWA, 13th February, 1904:\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nRev. Dr Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Missionary Society, who called at the Department on Monday to discuss Indian school matters, laid particular stress on the insufficiency of the per capita grant allowed the boarding schools. He said that such schools in the West cost the Church $120.00 per pupil and that the grant should be raised to at least $100.00.\n\nHe called attention to the age limit fixed by the regulations for the discharge of pupils, claiming that eighteen was too soon to cast an Indian boy or girl upon their own resources, and that the most critical period of their life was between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one years, when they required more care and attention than at any other time.\n\nHe also referred to want of provision for the ultimate disposition of ex-pupils, alleging that their return to the reserve before their characters were formed was a misfortune, as in most instances any good received at the school was lost.\n\nDr Sutherland gave it as his opinion that the day school was of little or no use to Indian children in general, as the attendance was too irregular and uncertain. The boarding school secured the attendance but was in too close proximity to the reserve to have the desired effect of solving the Indian problem. The industrial school, if properly\nproperly conducted on a sound system, with longer residence and something for the pupils to look forward to besides a return to the reserve, is, he thinks, the only means of accomplishing any lasting results.\n\nRegarding boarding schools,-if they are made more general, who is to bear the cost? The religious denominations carrying on these schools are not able to support those already in existence with the present grant and it will take as much to support a pupil in a boarding school as at an industrial school with much less to show for the money.\n\nThe cost of transporting pupils to industrial schools was also discussed. Dr Sutherland claiming that it should be paid for by the Department while the Department's contention is that it is only bound to pay for the filling up of the school to the authorized enrollment in the first instance,-and not for the filling of vacancies. The following extract from a letter addressed to Rev. John McDougall, Supt. of Methodist Missions in Man. and the N.W.T. on the 10th April, 1894, sets forth the Department's stand in this matter:-\n\n\"For the transport of children to the school to the number authorized by the Department in the first instance, in cases where it is found absolutely necessary to travel by rail, the Department will, on application, furnish requisitions to enable the children to travel at half rates and pay for the same, but the whole cost thereafter of transport to maintain the complement of attendance must be borne by the management\".\n\nThis rule still prevails in regard to all industrial schools on the per capita system.\n\nIn addition to the foregoing general questions, Dr Sutherland referred to the following schools in particular:-\nCoqualeetsa .................. Grant for a residence for the Principal.\n120,292\n\nMt. Elgin ..................... Increase of per capita grant to $200.00.\n158,001\n\nCaughnawaga .................. The transfer of this and the two Methodist\nschools at Oka to the Department. It was\npointed out to Dr Sutherland that the De-\npartment did not think it would be justi-\nfied in carrying on a Methodist school at\nCaughnawaga, where, out of 2034 Indians, all\nbut 46 are Roman Catholics. He admitted the\nforce of the argument and is willing to allow\nthe three schools to remain as they are.\n\nQuamichan }\n129,655) ....................

The Girls\nHome is not properly under the control of\nthe Society, being conducted by the Women's\nAuxiliary. They are asking for a grant of\n$450.00 to purchase iron bedsteads.\n\nRed Deer ...................... The Department has acceded to a request for\na team of horses and additional farming\nimplements. The claim for bringing in pupils\nis met by the quotation given above.\n\nNorway House }\n168,918) ..................... Enlargement of buildings, increase of grant\nMcDougall Orphanage }\n116963) ..................... and provision for more pupils. Still to be\ndecided.\n\nOutside Treaty ............... Dr Sutherland was informed that when pro-\nper vouchers were forwarded, the usual\ngrant of $100.00 to each recognized school\nwould be made.\n\n[Signature]\nI beg to direct your attention to a letter from Rev. Dr. Sutherland, General Secretary of the Methodist Board of Missions, dated the 23rd July. Mr. Sutherland has brought these matters to the attention of the Department several times and, although conditions have not materially changed, it is possible to accede to one or the requests and to take another into more serious consideration.\n\nThe estimates do not provide for the enlargement of the Morley Boarding School or for the increased per capita grant for any of the three schools mentioned, Morley, Norway House or Mount Elgin. For some time the Methodist Missionary Society has been urging the absolute necessity for a residence for the Principal of the Coqualeetza Home. This question has been carefully gone into and Sup't. Vowell has made a visit to the Home with the express purpose of making a report upon the subject. He says that \"there certainly is not adequate accommodation for the Principal and his family in the Institute.\" Under these circumstances I would propose that the Department grant $1,500.00 to purchase material for this house, it being understood that the Missionary Society will complete the building. Already the foundation has been built and the studding erected. If this action is taken, the claim which has for some time remained unsettled will be disposed of to the satisfaction of those concerned.\n\nIt seems to me also that we should look closely into the financial standing of the Elgin Institute. Last Fall,\n\nAugust 17th\u20141904.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nowing to the urgent representations of the Bishop of Algoma, an inspection into the financial condition of the Shingwauk Home was undertaken and it was decided to pay the existing deficit, of about $1,400.00, to improve the school buildings and add to the equipment by the purchase of a gasoline engine. This favorable treatment was forced upon the Department as the school was in such a condition that, without it, it must have been closed. Before long the action of the department will become public property through the financial report of the Auditor General; and the Methodist Missionary Society which has been urging more favorable treatment for the Muncey Institute might claim that the sister institution in the Province of Ontario has been better treated.\n\nI think, therefore, that we should undertake an examination of the accounts of the Muncey Institute. It seems to me that these two concessions are all that can at present be granted.\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Supt., General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, October 1st, 1904.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to your interview here the other day I beg leave to say that so far as the salary of the Oka and Caughnawaga teachers is concerned the Department will pay from the 1st July last to each of the Caughnawaga Schools $125.00 per year and to the Caughnawaga School $250.00, in all $500.00, an increase of $150.00 over last year.\n\nWith reference to some accounts for repairs spoken of when you were here I beg to say that these have not yet been received so that the Department is not at present in a position to deal with them.\n\nInstructions were issued a few days ago to the Agent to secure the stove mentioned by Reverend Mr. Oka at once.\n\nThe other matters discussed by you are still under consideration.\n\nReverend Thomas Griffith, Ph.D.,\n17 St. Luke St.,\nMontreal, Que.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\u2014\n\nWith reference to the matter referred to in Rev. Dr. Sutherland's private letter of July 31, just addressed to you, I beg to say that the question of placing the Industrial and Boarding schools in the Northwest which are carried on by the Methodist Missionary Society under the management of Rev. Mr. Perrier, at present principal of the Brandon Industrial school, is one which should concern the Methodist Missionary Society only. This Society has four schools under its control in the West, namely, the Brandon Industrial School, the Red Deer Industrial School, the McDougall Orphanage at Morley and the Norway House Boarding school. These schools are all conducted on the per capita system and are in receipt of the following grants:\n\nBrandon, $100 per capita for each of 119 pupils.\n\nRed Deer, $100 \" \" \" \" \" \" 80 \"\n\nMorley, $75 \" \" \" \" \" \" 45 \"\n\nNorway House, $75 \" \" \" \" \" \" 50 \"\n\nThe Brandon school is well and efficiently managed on the present per capita grant. Red Deer has a deficit owing to the mismanagement of former principals; the present one is being fairly successful. The Morley school is in a similar plight for the same reason, while the Norway House school is kept afloat by large additional grants from the Missionary Society's funds.\nIt is claimed by all the Churches carrying on boarding schools in the West that the present per capita grant is insufficient for their maintenance and the statement of receipts and expenditure received here bear out this contention. The question of increasing the per capita grant to schools of this class is now before the Department for consideration, and if the grant is increased to $200 there would be no grounds for complaint.\n\nMr. Perrier has shown himself to be a practical business man, and the financial affairs of the Brandon school prove this to be the case. If the Methodist Church wishes to make a financial success of their other schools, they should endeavour to place equally competent men in charge of them. There is no doubt about the present per capita grant for the Red Deer Industrial school being quite sufficient to meet the running expenses under efficient management, while if the boarding school grant of $75 is too low, it will be impossible for Mr. Perrier or any other man to make ends meet without large outside contributions. I think it would be a great mistake to remove Mr. Perrier from his present sphere of operations, where he is working so successfully, and I am certain that no amount of supervision could ever keep same principles within the limits of the per capita grant.\n\nI claim that where a religious denomination takes control of a boarding or industrial school on the per capita grant basis, it should assume all responsibility for its financial management. If they can show that the grant is not sufficient, the Department can, if it wishes the school to be continued under their auspices, increase the grant. I think that it\nis not too late yet to enter into an agreement with the religious denominations carrying on schools of this class, which should be binding on the denominations and the government, and if concessions in addition to the per capita grant are agreed to, they should be included in such agreement.\n\nIf Dr. Sutherland's suggestion were approved of, it would be simply adding a fifth wheel to the coach. They have four principals for their four schools, and it would be impossible for Mr. Poirier to be at more than one place at a time, and I doubt if they could get an good a man to replace him in the position he now holds. The Methodist Church must have good men available, and the best thing they can do is to place them in charge of these schools.\n\nThere is no reference made in Dr. Sutherland's letter as to the question of the increased expenses this proposed arrangement would entail, but I take it that he would expect the Department to pay Mr. Poirier's salary and travelling expenses, which would be no small item, as he would have to cover the whole of the West from Norway House to Red Deer to supervise work which properly belongs to the Church.\n\nThe Methodist Missionary Society controls all the grants to their schools, as the cheques are sent direct to Rev. Dr. Sutherland, who makes advances to the principals, and the Society should have full knowledge of the financial affairs of each central school under its control. Our Inspectors, also, are supposed to make a thorough audit of the books of all the schools they visit and report generally on their\nmanagement, and if these inspections were made more frequently than they are at present, it would be much better.\n\nIf Dr. Gutherion wishes to carry out this arrangement, it should be done at the expense of the Methodist Missionary Society, as there is no reason why the Department should be a party to it.\nOttawa, January 25, 1906.\n\nDear Dr. Sutherland,\n\nIn further reference to the suggestion contained in your letter of July 31, last, of placing the industrial and boarding schools in the Northwest which are carried on by the Methodist Missionary Society, under the management of the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, at present Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, I should like to be informed whether your Society would be willing to bear the extra expense your proposition would entail.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRANK PEBBON\nDeputy Sect. General\nof Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nsee private letter book\nand previous correspondence\nPrivate\nSir,\n\nRe Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nOn behalf of the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church, I beg to submit for your consideration some facts connected with the two Indian Boarding Schools, at Morley, Alta., and Norway House, Keewatin, both of which are under the direction of the Methodist Church. An experience covering several years has convinced us of the utter impossibility of conducting these schools efficiently on the basis of the present per capita grant. Since the school at Norway House was started, and for a number of years in the case of the one at Morley, we have been obliged to supply, out of church funds, from Two Thousand to Two Thousand, Five Hundred Dollars in each case, to cover unavoidable deficiencies. As regards Morley, this does not include expenditures which were considered to be due, in part, to a lack of business training and capability on the part of the former Principal, but represents an unavoidable deficiency while conducting the Institution on the most economical basis.\n\nI would respectfully request that you give this matter your most earnest and favorable consideration with two objects in view: First, to place these schools on a per capita basis of not less than One Hundred Dollars ($100), and secondly to make such a grant toward recouping us for the heavy extra expenditure involved as may be deemed just and equitable in the premises.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Gutgirke\n\nThe Supt General, Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,-\n\nI beg to enclose herewith several communications addressed to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, referring to certain Indian Institutes, Boarding Schools etc., and will feel greatly obliged if you will kindly call the attention of the Superintendent General to these matters at your earliest convenience.\n\nI have the honor to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th inst., with enclosure, in reference to boarding schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Missionary Society in the West.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the recent session of our General Board of Missions there was considerable conversation respecting the Indian Institutes, Boarding Schools and Day Schools conducted by us in co-operation with the Indian Department, and a general desire was expressed to do xxxxxxxx anything on our power to render these schools more efficient and to secure better results from the large amounts now expended on Indian education.\n\nAs one step, and we think an important one, in this direction, it was decided to place all the Institutes Boarding Schools and Day Schools conducted by us, under the oversight and direction of a single officer, and we have named for this position the Principal of the Brandon Institute, Rev. T. Ferrier. The Board recommends this as a policy which they think will result in great advantage to the Indian educational work, and we desire very much the concurrence of the Department in what is now proposed.\n\nI expect to be in Ottawa on the 8th or 9th of November, and if you could grant me an hour's interview I would be glad to explain further our proposition, and also to enlist your favorable consideration of this and a number of other matters affecting our Indian schools.\n\nHoping for a favorable reply, I have the honor, Sir, to be.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA. Butterworth\nGeneral Secretary\n\nThe Honourable,\nThe Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, November 8, 1906.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\n\nRev. Dr. Sutherland has written the Department stating that at the recent session of the General Board of Missions there was considerable discussion respecting Indian schools conducted by the Methodist Missionary Society and that a general desire was expressed to improve the schools with a view to obtaining better results, and that one step in this direction was to place all such schools under the oversight and direction of a single officer, and they named the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Principal of the Brandon school, for the position and ask the concurrence of the Department.\n\nThis question was brought to the notice of the Department in January, last, when I made a full report on the proposition, which is turned out herewith. I pointed out that if the Methodist Missionary Society wishes to carry out such an arrangement, it should be done at their expense, as there was no reason why the Department should be a party to it. There is no doubt about Mr. Ferrier's being a capable business man, and I think if the schools were placed under his direction better results would follow, although it would be a difficult matter to replace him at Brandon.\n\nP. S. Since the above was written the Toronto papers state that Mr. Ferrier has received this appointment, but Dr. Sutherland made no mention of the Department's having to pay the salary.\nOttawa, December 6, 1906.\n\nRev. Sirs,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 27, last, notifying the Department of the decision of the General Board of Missions to place all the institutions conducted by your Society under the oversight and direction of the Rev. T. Perrier, Principal of the Brandon Industrial School, and in reply I beg to say that the Department has no objection to waive to the proposed change, provided no additional expense is caused thereby and that suitable provision will be made for conducting the Brandon school.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. A. Sutherland, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nDear Sir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of December 6th #83343, intimating that the Department has no objection to the appointment of the Rev. T. Ferrier to the superintendency of our Indian Educational Work providing \"no additional expense is caused thereby, and that suitable provision will be made for conducting the Brandon School.\"\n\nThe latter point I have discussed with Mr. Ferrier, and he alludes to it in a communication which has just come to hand. We are both of opinion that satisfactory arrangements can be made for the Brandon Institute which will be laid before the Department in due time. These might involve a slight addition to the staff, but not necessarily the appointment of another Principal, as Mr. Ferrier would expect to give such special supervision to the Brandon Institution as would maintain the high standard of efficiency which is has reached. When the details of the whole plan are complete, I think there should be no difficulty in adjusting the financial side of the question in a satisfactory way.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

These documents contain the correspondence carried on by the Advisory Board of Indian Education, and from those dated Ottawa, March 21st and April 24th, 1908 we have been pleased to learn that the Hon. Frank Oliver, Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, and his Deputy assure the Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches of the intention of the Department to give a per capita grant of $100 for all pupils in residential schools East of the Great Lakes, and $130 in all such schools West of the Great Lakes and $500 for Day School teachers. Believing that with good management this amount will be about sufficient, we express our satisfaction with this new policy, and we assure the Superintendent General and the Indian Department of our hearty support in all the conditions and arrangements necessary to make this new departure a success. Further since there are business matters of great importance in connection with some of the schools requiring adjusting, we urge upon the Minister the great necessity of all appropriations being made at the next session of Parliament so that these increased grants will be available for the next Government fiscal year.\"\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a copy of certain resolutions respecting Indian Education adopted by the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church at its recent session, and respectfully submit the same for your careful consideration.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

There was no objection taken to this classification by any of the representatives attending the conference with the Minister in November last. Mr. Shore and myself left with the hope that this would be done.\n\n2. The school is more than 200 miles from a railway station and the cost of freighting and travel from Selkirk amounts to about $600 per year.\n\n3. The fuel is expensive, the nearest wood available being about six miles distant and the stumpage amounts to over $100.\n\n4. The Indians have adopted a mode of living that makes it necessary for the management to provide food and clothing of the same quality as in the schools of the Western Division.\n\n5. The actual cost to the Church has been $9,400. for some years.\n\nWhile I submit the above, I am of the opinion that had I the privilege of discussing the matter with the Principal I could set forth further reasons in detail.\n\nBe kind enough to present these facts to the Minister for his consideration.

The Commission named the men whom they would recommend to take charge of these schools, and they are very desirous of knowing whether they are to go into this work.

Perrier; in the Chair: T. C. Buchanan; C. H. Huestis; T. E. Egerton Shore; the Hon. W. H. Gushing; and Rev. A. Barner, Secretary.\n\nThe Commission having carefully reviewed the whole situation, and two of its number having recently visited the Northern reserves, found themselves in unanimous agreement as to the policy which should be pursued by the Methodist Church with regard to this work, and respectfully submit the following recommendations:\n\n1st. It is manifest to those who have personally studied the Indian problem that this work cannot be considered on the same basis as other forms of Missionary and educational work. The Indian people are a dependent race and must be regarded by the Church and Government from the standpoint of their need rather than from that of their productiveness. The Indian is the weak child in the family of our nation and for this reason presents the most earnest appeal for Christian sympathy and co-operation.\n\n2nd. We are convinced that the only hope of successfully discharging this obligation to our Indian brethren is through the medium of the children, therefore, the educational work must be given the foremost place.\n\n3rd. From past experience we have reached the conclusion that the day-school on the reserve cannot possibly accomplish the end in view. This is due to many reasons, the chief of which is that the Indian has not yet reached that state in his development which makes him sufficiently interested in the education of his children.\nday. It would seem, therefore, that we are shut up to\nthe policy of the residential school.\n\n4th. In the light of the foregoing facts we agree\non the policy of closing the Red Deer Industrial School,\nproviding that the Government establish, in lieu thereof,\nthree residential schools on reserves, feeling sure\nthat these will more effectually reach the constituency\nof children and will at the same time exert a helpful\ninfluence on the reserve life. We recommend that the\nfollowing be a committee on behalf of the Church to assist\nthe Indian Department in selecting sites on the reserves:-\nRevs. T. Ferrier, G. H. Huestis, A. Barner and the\nHon. W. H. Cushing.\n\n5th. These schools shall be located as follows:-\n\nMorley in the Southern part of the Province.\nHobbema in the Central part of the Province.\nSaddle Lake in the Northern part of the Province.\n\n6th. The population of children of school age is\nas follows:-\n\nMorley Agency, Methodist, 125\nHobbema Agency, \" 90\nSaddle Lake Agency, \" 60\nWhite Whale Lake, 25.\n\n7th. These schools should therefore be erected with\ncapacity as follows:-\n\nMorley, 80 pupils\nHobbema 70 \"\nSaddle Lake, 60 \"\n\nIn each case the buildings to be in harmony with\nClass \"A\" of the Government agreement.\n\n8th. If these schools were filled with pupils the\nincome at the present rate of per capita grant would be:\n\nMorley, 80 @ $100 $8000.00\nHobbema, 70 @ $100 7000.00\nSaddle Lake, 60 @ 100 6000.00\n\nThis, with the income from farm or ranch, together\nwith a grant of about $2000 per annum for each Institution\nfrom the Missionary Society, would be sufficient for\nmaintenance.\n9th. The Principal and his staff would be made responsible for the evangelistic work on all the reserves in the Province, with the exception of Good Fish and White Fish Reserves, which are forty miles North of Saddle Lake.\n\n10th. In each case it will be necessary to secure a tract of land from the Indians on each of the Reserves where the schools are erected of not less than two sections, 1280 acres, suitable for the industrial purposes of the Institution and for such uses only.\n\n11th. That there be secured for each of these Institutions, and under the direction of the Principal, a Nurse Deaconess, whose duty it shall be to visit the homes of the Indians in connection with medical and evangelistic work.\n\n12th. That there be strongly presented to the Indian Department at Ottawa the need of bringing about, upon the adoption of this policy, the transferring of the Indians at White Whale Lake to the Morley or any other desired Reservation.\n\n13th. That a treaty agreement shall be secured from all the Indians on the Reserves in question, subscribing to the following obligations:\n\na. Sympathetic attitude toward the Schools.\nb. That all children shall be placed in these Reservation Schools as soon as they reach the age of seven, and shall be educated there until they attain the age of eighteen, according to the regulations of the Indian Department. We recommend that Rev. A. Barnor be appointed a Commissioner on behalf of the Methodist Church, and we would respectfully suggest that Mr. J. A. Markle, Inspector of Indian Agencies in Alberta, be appointed a Commissioner on behalf of the Government, together to negotiate this treaty.\n\n14th. We earnestly recommend the Mission Board to launch a Cree paper on the plan suggested in the report prepared by Rev. C. H. Huestis, Red Deer, which report is in the hands of the General Secretary of the Foreign Department.\n15th. Referring to the item in the previous report of this Commission, page 9, regarding the influence of dances and public exhibitions on the Indians; your Commission is pleased to be able to report that in response to the action of the Indian Department at Ottawa in approaching Exhibition Boards in this Province, conditions are already very much improved.\n\n(Sgd) T.

Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th instant enclosing a copy of the report of the Commission appointed by the General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church to investigate the situation in Alberta Province with respect to the education of the Indian children on the Methodist reserves in that Province.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this report will receive due and careful consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. E. Egerton Shore,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nThe Hon. Robert Rogers.........\n\nI believe that Mr. Ferrier has gone over these matters carefully with Mr. Scott.\n\nIf there is any further information which we can give you, we shall very greatly appreciate being called upon to give it.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nTEES*WM.\nWe therefore recommended the establishment of three boarding schools: one on Saddle Lake Reserve, which would provide for Saddle Lake, White Fish and Good Fish Lake Indians; one on Hobema Reserve and one on the Morley Reserve.\n\nI understand that the Morley Indians have been deprived of any educational opportunity for some years since the old McDougall Home was closed. It has been even impossible to maintain a day school as the Indians are so widely scattered on that large Reserve.\n\nIt seems to us a deplorable thing that during the past five years a large part of the generation of Indian children have grown up without any education whatever. We therefore believe that it is most urgent to have a Boarding School located on the Morley Reserve at the earliest possible date. We believe that it is almost equally urgent that one of the other two schools in the northern Reserves be established without delay. Expenses of repairs to the present Red Deer School would be wasted and the present state of the building is most unsatisfactory and discreditable.\n\nMr. Perrier has urged for some time the necessity of a new school building at Norway House and at Port Simpson. I have not personally visited these Reserves yet, but all the correspondence that has come to me as well as Mr. Perrier's personal reports, show that the conditions urgently demand consideration.\n\nOf course we assume that the plans for the enlargement of the Mt. Elgin Institute, Muncey, Ont., are being carried out by the Government and that provision will be made in the Estimates this year for the completion of that work.\n\nI sincerely trust that you will be able to give us your support to the following items in this year's Estimates on account of buildings required at these points:\n\n- Muncey - extension...........$12,000\n- Morley, Boarding School......40,000\n- Hobema, or Saddle Lake,\n  Boarding School............40,000\n- Norway House Boarding School.40,000\n- Port Simpson Boys' Home......40,000\nThe Honorable Robert Rogers,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have learned from Rev. Thompson Perrier, Superintendent of Indian Education of the Methodist Church, of his very satisfactory interview with you recently at Ottawa.\n\nWe deeply appreciate the personal interest which you are taking in the education of the Indian and earnestly hope that you will have the heartiest co-operation of the Parliament in carrying out your plans for the development of that work.\n\nFor three or four years past we have been in correspondence and conference with the Department of Indian Affairs in connection with several matters which we have felt required the generous co-operation of the Government to put upon a satisfactory basis. One of the most urgent matters has been the re-organisation of our Indian Educational plan in the Province of Alberta. There are five Methodist Reserves in that Province. The General Board of Missions appointed a Special Commission to investigate the situation in Alberta in the Fall of 1909. That Commission reported to our Board in the Fall of 1910, and the matter was re-committed for further investigation. I went personally over the ground on our Reserves in Alberta and met with the Commission in Calgary in April 1911, when we devoted the whole day to most careful study of the matter. We were unanimously of the opinion that the moral and social improvement of the Indians in that Province was to be accomplished most directly through the medium of the educational work. We came to a unanimous conclusion, which we have understood to be in harmony with the views of Mr. Scott, Superintendent of Indian Education, namely, that the Red Deer Industrial School should be closed, as the buildings are in a most dilapidated and unsanitary condition and as the School is so situated that it is impossible to get the Indian children from the Reserves to attend the school.\nFebruary 5th, 1912.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 17th ultimo, addressed to the Hon. Mr. Rogers, in which you deal with several aspects of the question of Indian Education in which your society is interested, and to say that the matters referred to are now receiving the attention of the Department. It is expected that within the near future the decision reached by the Department may be communicated to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend T. E. Egerton Shore,\nGeneral Secretary,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nToronto, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott -\n\nIn reference to a communication from the Reverend Mr. Shore, General Secretary, The Methodist Church, on file herewith, mention is made of an interview between you and the Reverend Mr. Ferrier at which the matters mentioned in said letter are discussed. On looking over the files, I am unable to find any record of this interview. If there is one, it should be placed on file, and if there is not a memorandum should be made as to what really took place between you and Mr. Ferrier.\n\nD. S. G. F. A.\nOttawa, February 6th, 1918.\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. Pedley:\n\nAt the interview to which you refer in your memorandum of the 5th of February Mr. Ferrier presented the needs of the Methodist Church for additional appropriations in the cause of Indian Education closely on the lines of Dr. Shore's letter. The Department has never definitely approved of the plan of closing the Red Deer Industrial School that was submitted on the 12th of September last. The designs of the Methodist Church for Indian Education have been met to a certain extent in a preliminary way in the main estimates 1912-13. $12,000.00 for the addition of the Munsey Institute, and $48,000.00 for a new building at Norway House.\n\nAt the interview I took a note of the items which Mr. Ferrier had been urging in the order of their importance from his standpoint:\n\n- Morley New Building, (Part of the scheme for closing Red Deer Industrial School) $40,000.00\n- Fort Simpson, new building for boys 40,000.00\n- Coqualeetza Home, increase from 80 to 100 pupils at $130.00 2,600.00\n- Norway House to be classed in the Northern District and paid $125.00 p.c.\n\nI gave the usual Departmental reply that the matters would be given consideration, and have noted them for the supplementary estimates, with the exception of the classification of Norway House in the Northern Division, which cannot be allowed by the Department without some very much better evidence than has been forthcoming as to the cost of conducting the school.\nOttawa, February 14, 1912.\n\nNote:-\n\nIn connection with the proposal to close the Red Deer Industrial school and erect in lieu thereof boarding schools on other reserves in Alberta it should be noted that the Indians of the White Whale Lake Reserve, (Wabun) have applied for the establishment of a boarding school on their reserve. See file 400923.\nDear Sir:-\n\nOn behalf of the General Secretary I beg to direct your attention to the following resolution, which was adopted by our General Board of Missions at its last annual meeting:\n\n\"That we memorialize the Dominion Government to call a conference of all the various government agents and missionaries in the Indian work with a view to the general betterment, religiously, educationally and otherwise, of all the Indian wards of the Government in Western Canada.\"\n\nIn my own opinion that resolution is based first of all upon a belief on the part of our Board that the Government keenly desires the welfare of its Indian wards and that its Department of Indian Affairs is giving earnest and intelligent attention to the whole Indian question. The churches likewise have no other object than to serve the highest interests of the Indians. During the past few years in particular a spirit of co-operation among religious bodies and between them and the Government has produced a new air of hopefulness in connection with this work. We believe that real progress has been already made.\n\nBut none of us believes that an ultimate solution of our common problem has yet been found nor that maximum efficiency has been attained in the work as a whole. Our Board hereby expresses its hope and belief that advantage could be gained by such a conference, as a result of which the information and experience of each body participating in this work could be placed at the disposal of all.\n\nIf such a plan, or some modification of it, were found practicable and viewed with favor by the Government we should be glad to facilitate its work in every way.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nNovember 26th, 1914.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant, and note the resolution adopted at the last annual meeting of the General Board of Missions. I am very glad to have so cordial an expression of co-operation between the Church and the Department, and will take pleasure in discussing with the Superintendent General at a favourable opportunity, the question of calling a conference between Departmental Agents and Missionaries, as suggested in your letter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nJ.

Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 22nd ultimo I beg to say that the salaries paid to the schools you mention are as follows:\n\n- Georgina Island, Meth. $500.00\n- Christian Island, \" 500.00\n- Gibson, \" 450.00\n- Oneida, \" 350.00\n- Moraviantown, \" 550.00\n- French Bay, \" 700.00\n- Scotch Settlement, \" 500.00\n- Hiawatha, \" 300.00\n- Alderville, \" 600.00\n- Ohemong (Curve Lake)\" 600.00\n\nThe only schools that are recognized as being conducted directly under the auspices of the Methodist Church are the ones to which the word Methodist is added. The other schools in this list, with the exception of Hiawatha, are classed as undenominational. The school at Hiawatha is a white school and the appointment of the teacher rests in the hands of the white trustees and the Department makes a contribution of $300.00 a year towards the salary.\n\nFor the current year the salaries will be the same, with the exception of Oneida No. 3, which has been raised to $550.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReplying to yours of June 15th re the increase of $10.00 per capita grant to our Industrial and Boarding Schools for the current fiscal year:\n\nOn behalf of the Methodist Church, I wish to extend my sincere thanks to the Department for this recognition of help towards meeting the increased cost of maintenance.\n\nHowever, I can assure you that even this will not meet the entire increase on account of the advanced prices we have to pay for food and clothing, which will average at least 40% more than they were when the war broke out.\n\nYou will pardon me if I still press my request of May 28th for Coqualeetza, Red Deer and Brandon. If a refund of these items for transport, travelling etc. were made the management of these schools would be able to close the year without serious deficits.\n\nAgain thanking you for the increased grant and in anticipation of a favorable reply to my further request, I remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nJuly 6th, 1917.\n\nDear Mr. Perrier -\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, acknowledging notification of increase in the per capita grant to industrial and boarding schools, and am glad that you recognize the spirit which prompted the increment. You will of course understand that we have to look over the whole field and even such a moderate increase as we have given increases the annual expenditure by nearly $40,000.00 which is just new an appreciable increase in the expenditure for Indian education.\n\nI am almost doubtful whether we will be able to give any of the schools special grants of any kind. You would be surprised at the number of applications we have been receiving under this category. For instance one group of schools applied the other day for the issue of free beef and flour for the pupils.\n\nRev. Mr. Perrier,\nPrincipal Brandon Industrial School,\nBrandon, Man.\ndo not see how we can make any distinction, as it might cause invidious comparisons.\n\nI hope that you will have a successful trip to the Lake Winnipeg district.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJuly 11th, 1917.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of yours under date of June 27th, announcing an increase of $10 in the per capita grant for maintenance of residential Indian schools. This action on the part of the Department will afford a measure of relief from the serious situation confronting these schools on account of increase in the cost of articles necessary for their maintenance.\n\nI note your statement that this increase has been granted for the current fiscal year only, and also your request for cooperation in keeping down all expenditures on account of these schools. The attention of those in charge of this work in our own Church will be directed to both these matters.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJHA/M.\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMarch 28th, 1918.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nSome five years ago a deputation, made up of representatives from the Roman Catholic, Anglican, Presbyterian and Methodist Churches waited upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs in the interests of our Indian Boarding Schools. The result of this was an increase in the per capita grant. The Industrial Schools were not dealt with at that time, and no increase in grant has been asked for for some years. On account of war conditions, prices of food and clothing have greatly increased, so much so that we are finding it impossible to run our schools on the present per capita of $130.00 a year in the schools west of the Great Lakes.\n\nOn behalf of the Methodist Church I respectfully request that the per capita grant to our Industrial Schools be increased by $10. This would bring it up to $150 per pupil for Coqualeetsa, Red Deer, and Brandon, and $140 for Muncey.\n\nIf the Department can comply with this request we shall appreciate it, and it will assist us materially in financing our institutions.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esquire,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, OTTAWA.\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Ferrier\nMy dear Mr. Scott:\n\nOur General Board of Missions is to meet next week, commencing on the 30th instant.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nIn reply to yours of March 20th; re appropriation for building:\n\nThe most important business re plant that we would like to make this year is to sell out the Red Deer plant in Alberta and build in Edmonton. You will remember that the Alberta Commission some years ago desired to have a boarding school at each of the four Reserves in the North in lieu of Red Deer. One large school situated close to Edmonton would fill the needs of our Methodist Indians very much better and it would be right about the centre of all the Reserves, namely, Hobema, Louis Bull, Stony Plain, Whitefish Lake, Goodfish Lake and Saddle Lake. I was intending to discuss this with you when I go to Ottawa. We are also needing outside buildings at Norway House. We would like to pull down the north end of our building here in Brandon and build up a large and more substantial end to the main building. We need a Boys' Home at Port Simpson, an Industrial School at Hazelton and a Boarding School at Morley. I have named these in the order I think they should be taken up.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nIndustrial School, Brandon.\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is an acknowledgment of your letter dated July 8th, conveying the information that Residential Indian Schools have been allowed an increased grant of $10.00 per capita for the present fiscal year.\n\nOn behalf of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church I beg to express our very great satisfaction at this action on the part of the Department. It will afford a considerable measure of relief to a situation which had become urgent almost beyond measure.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJHA/M\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nJ. D.

This was prepared during the recent visit of the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools. Any salary increases over and above what was paid a year ago are noted in pencil. Requests concerning these increases by Mr. Ferrier were fair and reasonable, and I would recommend that the salaries asked for be allowed for the present school year. Most of the teachers that have been secured are qualified or have had experience in our work.\n\nIf you approve of this salary list, the September quarter can be paid at these rates. Most of the quarterly returns are in the office and we expect to hear from the rest of the schools in the immediate future.\n\nRussell Y.

G. Scott, Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs;\n\nAND WHEREAS The Crosby Sisters' Fund was destroyed by fire in January 1926.\n\nThis Central Board urges upon the Indian Department the great need of constructing a new building with accommodation for at least 150 pupils, at the earliest possible date.\nNOTED by Mr. Poveshell.\n\nRECORDED by Rev. Dr. Haggard,\n\nOn account of the destruction by fire at the Creedy Girls' Home at Port Simpson, some of the girls were sent to the Squamish Indian Institute. None of these girls are now coming admission. The Principal has also a waiting list of pupils.\n\nAND whereas the Government is now constructing a new building which will accommodate 150 pupils; and whereas the Principal can make temporary accommodation for more than 150 pupils.\n\nRECORDED, That the General Board of Missions request the Department of Indian Affairs to pay the per capita grant for all pupils accepted by the Department, and provide for and keep in residence until the Squamish Institute is completed.\nIndian Affairs.\n\nThat this General Board of Missions of the Methodist Church moved in favour of approval of the provision of new land at Breslau and New buildings for the buildings that have been already completed. But we regret that the work of construction of the new building has been delayed during the present year.\n\nAnd whereas, we think it without an Indian Institute in the Province of Ontario,\n\nwe request the Methodist Church give up its claim to 100 acres of farming land at Breslau, and also allow the Red River Institute and pave up this place, with a portion of the remaining land, with the understanding that the new place of residence shall be ready about October 1885.\n\nWe, therefore, request that the Department of Indian Affairs provide for the completion of this place during the year 1885.\n|                | 1911 | 1912 | 1913 | 1914 | 1915 | 1916 | 1917 | 1918 | 1919 | 1920 | Average for 10 years |\n|----------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|---------------------|\n| AHOUSSANT      | 39   | 28   | 28   | 34   | 34   | 29   | x    | x    | 19   | 22   | 23                  |\n| ALBERNI        | 50   | 46   | 45   | 51   | 47   | 41   | 44   | 41   | 38   | 40   | 44                  |\n| BIRTLE         | 49   | 45   | 40   | 45   | 43   | 48   | 55   | 64   | 59   | 66   | 51                  |\n| CECILIA JEFFREY| 38   | 31   | 35   | 39   | 58   | 63   | 56   | 51   | 65   | 56   | 49                  |\n| FILE HILLS     | 38   | 45   | 45   | 49   | 53   | 62   | 68   | 58   | 61   | 59   | 54                  |\n| PORTAGE LA PRAIRIE | 31 | 35   | 39   | 42   | 68   | 74   | 75   | 65   | 72   | 76   | 58                  |\n| ROUND LAKE     | 34   | 22   | 42   | 40   | 40   | 41   | 36   | 42   | 45   | 44   | 39                  |\n\nThis page is private\n| Year | 1926 | 1927 | 1928 | 1929 | 1930 | 1931 | 1932 | 1933 | 1934 | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 | 1939 | 1940 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 |\n\n*Note: The total amount paid by the Board for the year was $120,000.*\n\n---\n\n**Statement Showing Grants Made During Mission Board To Aid Aboriginal Schools For The Year**\n\n| Year | 1926 | 1927 | 1928 | 1929 | 1930 | 1931 | 1932 | 1933 | 1934 | 1935 | 1936 | 1937 | 1938 | 1939 | 1940 |\n|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Total | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 | 1200 |\n\n*Note: The total amount paid by the Board for the year was $120,000.*\nDuring the past 25 years I have been urged and pressed on the question of the great need of Indian Boarding Schools at the following places, viz:\n\n- Clayquot\n- Nitinat\n- Comox\n- Cape Mudge\n- Bella Coola\n- Bella Bella\n- Skidegate\n- Kitimat\n- Hamilton\n- Saddle Lake\n- Goodfish Lake\n- Sechelt\n- Porteau\n- Porteau River\n- Ucluelet\n- Lakes\n- Fisher River\n- and Halibut House \u2014 17 in all.\n\nI have objected to this program of Boarding Schools, and given opposition to the scheme for these reasons:\n\n1. On the ground of the enormous cost in building the plants, believing that neither the Church nor the State was justified into going into such an expense for such a system of schools.\n\n2. If these schools were built we could be unable to provide for them with an efficient and capable staff of teachers.\n\n3. That if the plants could be provided and efficient workers found to run them, the General Board should not be placed under the obligation to furnish the large amount of money that would be required from year to year to keep up the maintenance.\n\nDuring the month of January a delegation of the delegates from each of the following missions \u2014 Nanaimo, Anglican, Presbyterian, and Methodist visited upon the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs and his deputies for the purpose of securing an addition to the per capita grant for pupils in our Indian Residential Schools. During this interview we were asked by the Minister to furnish him with information as to the present\nThe following money was expended during 1912 and 1913, two years prior to the present, and during the last six years for the maintenance of these schools.\n\nAs a result of this investigation, there are indications in the school tables of variations regarding the attendance figures.\n\nThe first table shows the amount spent each year by our Board, Board of our W.M.S., in each of our schools for the last ten years. These amounts range from an average of $17,500.00 a year for the ten years. Of this amount the Board paid $8,670.00 and our W.M.S. paid $7,830.00.\n\nThe second table gives the average attendance for each of our schools for the last ten years and the average cost per pupil. The five schools under the General Board had an average attendance of 92 pupils and an average cost of $120.00 per pupil. The five schools under our W.M.S. had an average attendance of 85 and an average cost of $135.00 per pupil for the ten years.\n\nThere are also included here two tables of figures from the Presbyterian schools. One shows that the average attendance for their seven schools for the past ten years was 96 pupils. Their schools being small boarding schools, and the average cost per pupil for the ten years was about $150.00.\n\nI was not able to secure sufficient data from the Anglican Church to set forth the results in a tabulated form, but it was sufficient to show that their system was the small boarding school, and that they sent the Mission Board of their church as much, if not more, per pupil than is paid by the Presbyterian Church and our own W.M.S. for the schools under their care.\n\nThe object of setting forth these figures, data and information is to show conclusively that the small boarding school on the Reserve is not the type of school for our General Board to endorse for the education...\nAnd however our hearts shall be led by the guidance of the Spirit, we have, on behalf of the Missionary Board, consented, through its own agency, to the budget recommendation thereof and do hereby request the Board's permission to make the same accord. We believe, as Missionaries, that missions and institutions connected therewith must be carried on under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, and that the products of our labor should not be used for any purpose other than the advancement of the Kingdom of God.\n\nIt might be added, if we were now within a system of schools of the old missionary school type, sufficient to educate the children, it would cost less money than this plan, but more to maintain them.\nCOPY OF RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE\nGENERAL BOARD OF MISSIONS OF THE METHODIST CHURCH.\nOctober 20th, 1921.\n\nRE INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOLS.\n\nTHIS BOARD is of the opinion that the large Industrial School is the best type of school in which to carry on educational work for the Indian children under our care.\n\nWE THEREFORE RECOMMEND that it be the policy of this Board to secure a plant with at least accommodation for one hundred and fifty (150) pupils at each of the following centres, viz. -\n\nMuncy,\nNorway House,\nBrandon,\nEdmonton,\nCoqualeetza, and\nOne in Northern British Columbia.\n\nCERTIFIED CORRECT.\n\nC & Manning\nGeneral Secretary of Missionary Society of the Methodist Church in Canada.\nOctober 24th, 1921.\n\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir:\n\nI enclose you a Resolution that was adopted by our General Board of Missions at its recent Meeting, endorsing the type of Industrial School for carrying on our educational work, and suggesting the programme that would be sufficient for our present needs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.

C. declares its appreciation of the loyalty of the Indian Agents to the instructions of the Indian Department in furthering the best interests of the people, and in particular, notes with much sympathy the stand taken by Mr. W. M. Halliday of the Kwaguilth Agency, and others in carrying out the recent prosecution, consequent upon the laying of information under Sec. 149 of Indian Act.\n\nIt is our opinion that a fair and wise enforcement of this section of the Act generally throughout the province, would greatly facilitate the work of the Dept. on the various Reserves in the best interests of the people.\n\n4. Appreciation of Service.\n\nMoved by Rev. P. R. Kelly and seconded by Rev. W. H. Gibson that this Conference of Methodist Missionaries amongst the Indians of B.

Further that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\n2. Re Indian Land Settlement.\n\nWhereas for many years the question of Indian rights, particularly with regard to aboriginal title to the lands of the Province of B.C., has been a source of much unrest among the native peoples; and whereas the present Federal Government has given assurance that the Minister of the Interior and Senator Postock, will visit the province at the close of the present session of Parliament now sitting, and are taking up the matter with the provincial government, Be it resolved that the Methodist Church is gratified to learn this step is being taken and trust that final settlement of this long-standing and disturbing question will be accomplished.\nJune 17th, 1922\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 5th, the contents of which have been noted.\n\nI wish to thank you for your courtesy in transmitting to this Department a copy of the Resolutions passed at the recent Convention of Indian workers of the Methodist Church of British Columbia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nJ.H.

Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nAs Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\n\nWhen our Indian Mission Work in connection with our Industrial School in the town north of Edmonton was under consideration by our General Board of Missions, at its recent meeting, the following resolution was passed:\n\n\"Having learned that the Government is proceeding speedily with the erection of the school building at Edmonton and are intending to let the contract for the erection of the building in a few months, we desire to express our approval of the Government's action in planning to provide a suitable and adequate building for the work contemplated and trust that there will be no delay in the completion of the school so that it may be open for the reception of the children for the fall term 1923.\"\n\nIt is not necessary for me to add anything to the above, other than to say that I sincerely hope the buildings referred to will be completed without delay. If we understand, then we gave up our work at Red Deer, that the school north of Edmonton would be ready for pupils in the autumn of 1923.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nHon. Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nRE: RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nStrong representations have been made to the Board of Missions of the Methodist Church relative to the desirability of providing on the Hanney Reserve a Primary Residential School for Indian children.\n\nThere are many children on the Indian Reserve in Ontario who are too young to attend the ordinary residential schools, for whose education and care no provision has been made. Some of these are children of deceased soldiers.\n\nWhen the matter of providing such a residential school was under consideration by our Board of Missions at its recent session, a resolution was passed endorsing this proposal and urging upon the Department of Indian Affairs the necessity of establishing such a school at Hanney as soon as possible.\n\nI trust that this matter will receive the favorable consideration of the Government and that an appropriation of from $50,000 to $100,000 will be made at the next session of Parliament to erect such a school.\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nRev. Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nDear Mr. Stewart:\n\nMY MOTHER, A.F.A.,\nMORAL BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nAt the recent meeting of the General Board of Missions, held in October last, various representations were made relative to the desirability of providing an aim at possible to provide a Boarding School for the Indian children on the Morley Reserve, Alberta.\n\nAfter due consideration, the Board adopted the following resolutions:\n\n\"WHEREAS no school facilities have been provided for the Indians at Morley for some years;\n\nAND WHEREAS a Boarding School was planned for, but delayed by the War and present conditions;\n\nTHEREFORE, WE DO RESOLVE THAT we urge upon the Government and the necessity of proceeding with the Boarding School as originally planned for, with the utmost dispatch;\n\nAND FURTHER THIS provision be made for converting the present hospital building into a dwelling for resident pupils, and using the new church for classrooms; thus accommodating twelve to fifteen pupils in dormitories and caring for the ten children resident adjacent to the agency.\"\n\nThe above plan subject to reasonable co-operation by the Indians.\n\nThe proposal to convert the present hospital building into a dwelling for resident pupils and to use the new church for classrooms is suggested as a temporary measure and not by any means as a substitute for the Boarding School for which we trust the Government will soon provide necessary funds.\n\nIt is many years since the Indians on the Morley Reserve have had adequate facilities for the education of their children, and we cannot regard it as other than undesirable that a generation of Indian children is growing up on this Reserve without even the elements of an English education. We trust that the necessary appropriation to provide the Boarding School will be made at the next session of Parliament.\n\nI am,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\nRev. Charles Stewart,\nSuperintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nMorley, Alberta.\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nI enclose herewith copies of letters which I am sending to the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.

You may inform the Principals of the Mt. Elgin, Norway House, Brandon, Edmonton and Ogualoetza schools of this ruling. Other Methodist Indian residential schools will be required to pay the sales tax on all purchases made from their per capita grant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

This was placed before our Executive but we were so hurried with our business that it was not read. I was requested to send copies of it to the members of the Board of Missions, and as you requested a copy I am forwarding it as promised.\n\nWith every good wish,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ontario.\nOttawa, May 1, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd ultimo, enclosing a copy of a resolution passed by your Executive Committee, relative to a Conference on Indian Education to be held at Muncey next month. I have discussed the matter of a Department representative for this meeting, with the Deputy Superintendent General, and if at all convenient, either he or I will arrange to go to Muncey on the day in question.\n\nYou evidently overlooked enclosing a copy of your report on the Administration of Indian Residential Schools under Methodist Auspices. I should be pleased if you would let me have this document for our files.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, D. D.,\nGen. Secretary of Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nQueen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nThere are at the present time five Industrial Indian institutes under the administration of the Missionary Society of the Methodist Church. These are situated at -\n\nNunney, Ont.,\nNorway House, Man.,\nBrandon, Man.,\nEdmonton, Alta., and\nCoqualeetza, B.C.\n\nNUNNEY: - The Government owns the buildings and 220 acres of land and rents an additional 600 acres. The 600 acres is mostly pasture land. The farm buildings are nearly all of modern construction and are for the most part adequate to requirements. The Boarding School is a good building, to which additions have been made since constructed in 1896. It accommodates 125 pupils, is always filled to capacity, and has a large waiting list of applicants for admission.\n\nNORWAY HOUSE: - There is a farm here of 40 acres of land owned by the Government, of which 20 acres are under cultivation. We have also an Island where we cut hay and timber. The buildings, which are Government property, consist of a modern Boarding School, which accommodates 135 pupils, a cottage, class-room, barn, cold-storage building and some small out-buildings.\n\nBRANDON: - The Government owns 900 acres, 500 of which are under cultivation. This farm is equipped with good up-to-date barns, stables, hen houses, out-buildings, and four good homes for employees. The school accommodates 175 pupils. The main building is old and not in keeping with the other buildings.\n\nEDMONTON: - The farm, which is eight miles north of the city of Edmonton and consists of 955 acres, was purchased by the Government in 1919, in which year the Red Deer Institute was closed, with the understanding that all necessary buildings for an up-to-date Industrial Institute would be provided on the Edmonton farm by the Autumn of 1921. The War and change of Government prevented this from being done. We expect the buildings will be completed and the school opened in the Autumn of 1923. Five hundred acres of the farm are under cultivation; the balance is for the most part pasture and bush but first-class soil. All of the stock, implements, etc., at Red Deer, which were not sold before closing this Institution, were transferred to Edmonton.\n\nCOQUALEETZA: - The Methodist Church, many years ago, purchased 95 acres of land at Coqualeetza, B.C., and erected the necessary buildings for an Industrial School there. The school building having been damaged by an earthquake has become unsafe. In 1922 arrangements were made with the Government to transfer to it eight acres of this farm, on which the Principal's residence and other buildings stand, on condition that it would erect a\nModern Boarding School and farm buildings on this property. These will be completed by the Autumn of 1923. The Boarding School, when completed, will accommodate 175 pupils. About eighty-five acres of the Cocoualeetza farm are under cultivation.\n\nThe immediate management of these Industrial Institutes devolves upon principals appointed by the Board of Missions, subject to the approval of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. Each principal selects his own staff, fixes their salaries, and assigns them their duties, his salary being fixed by the Board of Missions. Over them all is a Superintendent of Indian Education for the Methodist Church, whose services have contributed greatly to the efficiency of our Indian Schools.\n\nThe average attendance of pupils at each of these Institutes for the four years ending June 1922, with the per capita grant for maintenance paid by the Government, the total by the Government in each case, and the amount paid by the Missionary Society from time to time, together with salaries paid the principals, are given in the following table:\n\n| Average Attendance Per Capita | Government Grant | Missionary Society Grant | Total | Principal |\n|-------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|-------|-----------|\n| **HUNGRY**                    |                  |                          |       |           |\n| 1918-19                       | 126              | 11,562.50                |       |           |\n| 1919-20                       | 120              | 11,986.75                |       |           |\n| 1920-21                       | 114              | 12,334.05                |       |           |\n| 1921-22                       | 129              | 120.00                   | 14,765.53 | 1,500.    |\n| **NORWAY HOUSE**              |                  |                          |       |           |\n| 1918-19                       | 89.2             | 12,529.49                | 5,722.59 |           |\n| 1919-20                       | 95.              | 13,611.30                | 6,135. |           |\n| 1920-21                       | 92.              | 13,949.94                | 6,000. |           |\n| 1921-22                       | 90.2             | 165.00                   | 15,328.60 | 6,215.59 | 1,400. |\n| **BRANDON**                   |                  |                          |       |           |\n| 1918-19                       | 105              | 15,686.91                |       |           |\n| 1919-20                       | 102              | 14,546.28                |       |           |\n| 1920-21                       | 110              | 16,899.79                | 2,705.21 |           |\n| 1921-22                       | 116              | 170.00                   | 19,731.16 | 536.63 | 2,073. |\n| **RED DEER & EDMONTON**       |                  |                          |       |           |\n| 1918-19 R.

This is the more significant since the per capita grant to this Institute was $45.00 per pupil less than was paid to Norway House and $50.00 per pupil less than to each of the other Industrial Institutes under our Church, except Edmonton, which not having pupils has not had a per capita grant since the Red Deer School was closed. This favourable showing is not accounted for by the quality of soil or acreage connected with Muncey School, nor by its geographical position in relation to markets, etc., since all these existed prior to the appointment of the present Principal.\n\nThe records show that for the six years before he took charge there were continuous deficits which cost the Missionary Society a total of over $16,000.\n\nThe impression made upon me when visiting this institution was that it is managed with rare efficiency both in regard to farming operations and in the education and training of the children.\n\nBRANDON: From information I have gathered from personal inspection and other sources, I am of the opinion that Brandon is one of our best conducted Schools. The boys in attendance have an exceptional opportunity to learn how to farm according to the most approved methods, both as applies to cultivation of the soil and the care of stock, with which the farm is well supplied, including poultry, the care of which is an important feature in the instruction imparted. At Brandon, as well as in our other Indian Schools, Domestic Science is an important subject in the School course for girls.\n\nThe Missionary grant to this Institution in the last two years was $3,241.84. Had it not been for this, the deficit on June 30th last would have been $9,746.60.\n\nEDMONTON: The Edmonton Institute is not yet ready to receive pupils. The Principal's residence, the farmer's residence, the utility building, the horse barn and the pump house are the only structures which have been provided. It is expected that a very fine school building to accommodate 150 pupils will be erected by the Government during the coming summer. Other buildings, such as cow barn, pig pen, hen house and implement shed, will, we hope, follow a year later. The absence of buildings which are necessary to extensive mixed farming, also an insufficient water supply, together with the extra expense consequent upon getting a new undertaking under way, account in some measure for the deficit of $5,246.66 in connection with this institution since January 1st, 1920, which, if we add to it the grant from the Missionary Society in 1921-22 of $4,200, would make a total deficit of $9,446.66.\nIt is disappointing that with no school expenses to meet there should be such a heavy deficit in connection with this farm but so many uncontrollable factors have contributed to this result that I am reluctant to attribute it to inefficiency of management. Conversations with previously successful farmers in Alberta, who in recent years have been unable to carry on without loss, suggest that the deficit at Edmonton is probably due to uncontrollable conditions. The Department of Indian Affairs has recently made a grant of $4,200 to reduce the liabilities of this institution.\n\nCOQUELITZIA: I have visited this School on two occasions, the latter being in March 1923. On each occasion I have been impressed with the inadequacy of the buildings. A new chapel with kitchen underneath was built last summer. A very fine school building is to be erected this year. The barn is now in course of erection.\n\nFarming operations at Coqualeetza must necessarily be conducted differently from what they are on the prairie. Difference of climate and soil and limited acreage (95 acres) as well as the requirements of the pupils, are factors which must determine the policy of this institution. The usual field crops can only be grown in small quantities. Stock raising on a large scale does not seem practicable. The climate and soil favor extensive cultivation of fruits, especially small fruits and vegetables. These are the principal crops produced on this farm; scarcely enough field crops are grown to feed the cattle, hogs, and horses, kept on the farm. There is sufficient general farming done to give the boys a knowledge of this industry. A better example of how to care for farm stock should be in evidence.\n\nI was not favorably impressed with the quality of the cattle and hogs on this farm, or of the care taken of them.\n\nMost of the children who attend this institute come from the Pacific Coast, where very little farming is done. Boat building, fishing, carpentering and lumbering are the chief industries by which they will probably earn their living in later years. Manual training is consequently an important feature of the instruction given at Coqualeetza. Many of the boys show great skill in the use of tools.\n\nThe deficit for the year ending June 30th, 1923, was $2,457.15. It would have been $15,740.81 but for grants from the Missionary Society during the quadrennium, amount to $7,766.03, and grants from the Woman's Missionary Society, totalling $5,517.63.\n\nNORWAY HOUSE: I have not visited our school at Norway House and cannot speak with personal knowledge of this institution. It makes heavier demands on the funds of our Missionary Society than any of our Indian Schools. This may, in some measure, be accounted for by a lower per capita grant from the Government, than the other Institutes in the west; by smaller attendance of pupils; by having no farm products for sale, and by the higher cost of pro-\nThe deficit at this school, on June 20th, 1923, was $2,716.53\nand would have been $26,730.41 for the last quadrennium but for\nmissionary grants aggregating $26,074.18. The present principal\nhas been in charge only two years and so far as I can learn is\nrendering splendid service.\n\nThe policy of appointing principals and holding them respon-\nsible for the administration of these schools, is sound, but fuller\ninformation as to assets and liabilities than has hitherto been\nfurnished should be at hand before grants of missionary money are\nmade to them. There should be a system of accounting which would\ninvolve an annual stock-taking as well as an annual audit.\n\nIn this report I have referred to deficits in connection with\nall but one of those Institutes. This may not, in some instances,\nhave been the proper term to use, since what is termed a deficit\nmay be a liability incurred in the purchase of stock which, when\nsold, might bring a higher price than was paid for it and leave\na credit balance rather than a deficit. From any data available,\nI am of the opinion that the term deficit when used in this re-\nport, is the proper term, except in the case of Brandon, where\n$2,500. is an investment in pure bred cattle, which are still un-\nsold.\n\nIt should always be kept in mind that the purpose of these\ninstitutes is to give Indian boys and girls such an education as\nshall make them men and women of fine character, industrious\nhabits, and capable of earning their living in some useful occu-\npation. With this end in view, efficiency should not be sacri-\nficed to economy.\n\nThe officials of the Department of Indian Affairs contend in\nevery school where more than one hundred pupils are in attendance,\nan assistant principal should be appointed.\n\nThe teachers in these schools impressed me as being worthy\nof the positions they hold. Those who serve in the classrooms\nhave the usual academic standing and have been approved by the De-\npartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nThe pupils in the schools I visited seemed to be happy and\ncontented. There was no evidence that they felt themselves to be\nunder arbitrary restraint or that unkindly discipline was admin-\nistered by their teachers. An atmosphere of good fellowship and\nmutual confidence seemed to prevail everywhere.\nDear Mr. Ferrier;-\n\nI am today in receipt of your letter of May 1st, and am pleased to know that either you or the Deputy Superintendent General will arrange to attend the proposed Meeting at Muncey re Education among the Indians on June 28th.\n\nAbout the Report on the Administration of Indian Residential Schools, which I was to send you. - I may say that on account of pressure of work in the office the help has not yet succeeded in sending this Report out, but I am enclosing a copy to you.\n\nWith best wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC. E. Manning\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nOttawa, May 5, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nI have to acknowledge, with thanks, your letter of the 3rd instant, enclosing copy of your Report on the Administration of Indian Residential Schools under Methodist auspices.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, D.D.,\nGen. Secretary of Home Missions,\nMethodist Missionary Society,\nWesley Buildings,\nQueen St. West,\nToronto, Ont.\nThis Conference was called by the Rev. S. L. McVitty, Principal of the School, and the Methodist Church was represented by Rev. G. J. Shaw, D.D., General Superintendent, Rev. G. B. Manning, D.D., General Secretary of the Home Department of our Mission Board, and Rev. T. Perrier, of Brandon, Man.\n\nThe Indian Department was represented by Rev. Russell T. Perrier, M.A., Superintendent of Indian Education for the Government.\n\nSome 50 delegates and a large number of interested Indian visitors were present on behalf of the Indian Bands in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nThe meeting was opened by singing and Revs. Burgess and Robinson led in prayer.\n\nOn motion, the Rev. Dr. Shaw was appointed Chairman, and Rev. T. Perrier, Secretary.\n\nRev. S. L. McVitty explained the object he had in view in calling together representatives of the Methodist Church and the Indian Department to meet so many Chiefs, Councilors, delegates and visitors from the various Bands in Ontario and Quebec who send children to the Mount Elgin Institute for instruction in class work and industrial pursuits.\n\nThe Chairman appropriately addressed the meeting and declared it open for conference.\n\nThe first subject for discussion was the day school on the Reserve. This was opened by Mrs. Stebbins and Teacher Rockwood, who were followed by a large number of delegates. Some\ndifficulties, such as the following were set forth as reasons why no successful work was not accomplished in Reserve Schools\u2014\n\nNon-attendance, due to long distance from the schools; bad roads; bad weather; lack of suitable clothing by some who were poor.\n\nIncompetent teachers.\n\nLack of suitable equipment, and the need of making the play grounds more attractive by providing such things as swings, footballs, basketballs and baseball outfits.\n\nOpinion was in favor of more strict enforcement of the compulsory clauses in the Indian Act by the appointment of trained grant officers.\n\nMr. R. T. Perrier, on behalf of the Department, informed the Convention that the Department was remedying the needs wherever possible by sending to schools where they were sure they would be used\u2014football, basketballs; and by erecting swings, but not sending baseball outfits, as the latter were easily lost and soon became private property. Already this year sums in the aggregate amounting up to $1,000 had been expended.\n\nMr. Perrier also stated that an addition of $17,000 was voted by Parliament this year for the purpose of securing more competent teachers in the day schools. The staff of teachers was not increased, but to teachers who were qualifying themselves and for new appointments, better salaries could be paid.\n\nAs to enforcing the compulsory attendance as provided in the Indian Act. The Department would take immediate action if requested by the Band Council and the Indian Agent. But in all other cases the Department preferred to note out mercy as well as\nnotice, in hope that in time the people would themselves take action\nin respect to the suggestions for more thorough inspection of day\nschools. It was stated that the inspection was made by the public\nschool inspectors of the Province.\n\nA Committee consisting of the following Chiefs was\nappointed to draft resolutions to cover the points debated:\u2014\nChiefs Cornelius, Billy, Peter, Timothy\nand James.\n\nThe need of an Orphanage to care for orphans was the\nnext subject for discussion. After a general discussion on the\nneed of such an institution, which has been under consideration by the\nChurch authorities and the Indian Department for some time, Rev. Dr.\nBanning was called on to give information that he had gathered by\nsending out a Questionnaire from his office in Toronto.\n\nIn reply he stated that all who had been requested to\nanswer his questionnaire had not done so, but from answers received\nhe was able to give the following figures as to the number of\nchildren who should at present be in such an orphanage as was pro-\nposed:\u2014\n\nPerry Island - 6 children\nSt. Clair - 10 \"\nWalpole Island - 35 \"\n\ntogether with others that make a total of 52 orphan children from the\nreports to hand.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education informed the\nconvention that not only was the Church taking action, but that the\nIndian Department knew the need and was in hearty sympathy with the\nmovement; and that the Department was prepared to build two such\norphanages for the children of Ontario - one for the Protestant and\none for the Roman Catholic children. And such would be built as\nsoon as the Department could secure the money from Parliament.\n\nThe Convention was very much pleased and encouraged\nby this information, and the following resolution - moved by Chief\nSagees and seconded by Rev. Father Sadie - was carried unanimously:\n\nTHAT this Convention desires to express its hearty\napproval and appreciation of the forward move made\nby the Indian Department in endeavoring to secure\nthe necessary funds to build two such orphanages to\ncare for the needy children.\n\nThe Convention adjourned for lunch (which was provided\nby the Institute) to meet at 1:30.\n\nThe meeting opened at 1:30, with Rev. Dr. Shaw in the\nchair.\n\nPrayer was offered.\n\nThe Minutes of the morning session were read and approved.\n\nThe next question introduced for discussion was -\nHow can we improve the Mount Elgin Institute?\n\nThis question was discussed under different headings.\n\nFIRST:\nWhat age and class standing should be required for\nentrance?\n\nThe age fixed by the regulations of the Indian Depart-\nment is 7 years for admission and 16 for discharge, thus pro-\nviding a general policy for all residential schools in the Dominion.\nHowever, there is sufficient leeway for adjustment, and Mount Elgin\nis a case where there may be a change.\n\nAfter a full discussion the following resolution was\nmoved by the Rev. S. R. Neville and seconded by Chief Legge\u2014\n\nTHAT the age of pupils at admittance be about 16 years\nand that their class standing be about the Second\nBook.\n\nCARRIED.\n\nThe general opinion was that this should not be too\nstrictly adhered to until we had an Orphanage to provide care for\nchildren under 16 years.\n\nSECONDED\u2014The second question discussed was, Should girls or boys\nof bad character be admitted as pupils?\n\nThe discussion led up to the conclusion that this\nInstitute was not a reformatory, and rather than run the chance of\ncontaminating the morals of the School, it would be better to care\nfor such boys and girls on the Reserves and only in very extreme\ncases should they be sent to a Reformatory.\n\nThe discussion of this question ended when the Super-\nintendent of Indian Education assured the Convention that a further\nquestion should be placed on the application forms for admittance,\nrequiring the Band Council, Indian Agent, teacher or missionary to\nvouch for the general character of the applicant before admission.\n\nSECONDED\u2014The next question was, How to get the children promptly\nreturned after holidays?\n\nMany reasons were advanced why they did not return on\nthe date fixed when sent out from the School. Yet the general\nopinion prevailed that a more active move should be made by the Band\nCouncil and the Indian Agent in having delinquents more promptly\nreturned and that any noted transgression should be reported\nimmediately to the Department.\nThe next subject discussed was the half day system, which places the pupil in the class room half of the day and in some industrial department the other half. Some favored two days in the class room and one of work; others two weeks of class room and one week of work. Some of the points brought out in the discussion were:\n\nA change of programs was more natural every day than every third day or every third week. Some thought the child could not make as good progress as if kept a whole day in the class room. It was shown that 20 hours of study per week were given under present system, including one hour of night work \u2014 more than the average in a Reserve School.\n\nThe pupils of these residential schools average a grade a year, which is about all that children do in the same grades in our city schools.\n\nAfter a very full and lengthy discussion, the following resolution was moved by Mrs. Robidoux and seconded by \u2014\n\nRESOLVED THAT two days be given to class room work and one to industrial duties in the Round River Institute.\n\nThis motion was voted down by a large majority, so that it is understood that the present program of the half day system is to be continued.\n\nThe next question introduced was, Should we have a High School for all Indian pupils who have passed the Entrance examinations and wish to go on with a higher education?\n\nA great deal was said for against such a school, the opinion prevailing that inasmuch as all High Schools, Colleges and Training Schools were open to any Indian boy or girl, it was a moot\nbetter policy to take their places in such schools and colleges now provided.\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Education stated that a vote of $25,000 was made this year to assist Indian pupils in their efforts for a higher education and that one hundred and ninety were the total number throughout Canada who were availing themselves of the opportunity. He also stated that four conditions had to be met before aid would be given by the Department. These were:\n\n1. The educational standing and general moral character had to be vouched for and recommended by an Agent and minister, or the Principal of a Residential School.\n\n2. The child must reside in a home approved of by the Department.\n\n3. The child or its parent must help financially as far as reasonably possible.\n\n4. The progress of the pupil must be sufficient to warrant continued help.\n\nIn answer to the question does the Government use funded Band money for this or for the upkeep of residential schools? The Superintendent replied: The Indian Department does not use money belonging to an Indian Band for building or maintaining Residential Schools or for helping worthy pupils in receiving a higher education. All such money is voted by Parliament from the consolidated revenue of the country.\n\nIn answer to a further question, viz.: What amount of money does the Government vote for Indian Education? The Superintendent replied by sketching a diagram on the blackboard, which showed that the vote of Parliament for Indian Education began in 1898. In 1916 it was half a million. It reached one million in 1926, and then dropped during the four years of the war to three-quarters of a million, rising again to the million mark in 1930.\nSince then it has gone rapidly up until the last vote of the present Parliament reached $1,265,000 - $500,000 more than was voted by Parliament in any previous year. And it was hoped that a vote of $8,000,000 for the next ten years would give a plant and a standing for our Indian Educational work which would be satisfactory to the Indian Department, the Churches assisting for the progress of our Indian people.\n\nThe following resolution was carried:\n\nTHAT WHEREAS some of the pupils of the Institute after holidays do not return promptly to the Institute;\n\nIT IS THEREFORE moved by P. W. Jacobs, and seconded by Jessie Logan that a resolution be passed at this meeting asking the Indian Department to instruct the various Indian agents to see that the children be returned promptly to the Institute; and that the Indian Councils assist the agents to do the work.\n\nThe Committee on Resolutions re Day Schools reported and the following resolutions were carried unanimously:\n\n1st. That we highly approve and endorse the action of the Indian Department in securing qualified teachers where it is practical; and that Indian teachers be engaged to take Indian schools if they promise to qualify by taking a course at Normal School, when asked by the Department, as the Superintendent, Mr. Perrier, gave the committee to understand is being done.\n\n2nd. That the Council should pass a recommendation of the teachers to be engaged by the Department.\n\n3rd. That we approve of the Department helping destitute children with clothing in order that they may attend school.\n\n4th. That we also approve of sport equipment being provided for schools.\nThat we recommend that the Council of each Reserve assist in the enforcement of the Compulsory School Act.\n\nHaving noted the statement of Mr. Fennell, Superintendent of Indian Education, that the government has appropriated $17,000 more in the estimates for better teachers among the Indians, we would ask the Convention to pass the approval of the action of the government and the Educational Department at Ottawa.\n\n(Signed) HENRY P. FISHER,\nWILLIAM HUNT,\nJOSEPH JONES,\nWILLIAM PHILLIPS.\n\nDr. Chown congratulated the Principal of the School on the success of the Convention and on the provision supplied for the comfort of the gathering. He also expressed thanks to Mr. Russell T. Fennell for his presence on behalf of the Indian Department and for the vast amount of valuable information which he so clearly and forcefully presented to the Conference.\n\nThe meeting adjourned by the singing of the National Anthem and prayer by the Rev. Father -\n\nAt the close of the Convention the representatives of Church and State and all the delegates and visitors were invited to take part in a picnic on the beautiful lawns of the school grounds.\n\nThe Ladies Aid of Canada and Nancy Mission each had a booth, from which the 1,000 or more people secured refreshments; and I am sure that the vast crowd of people who attended the gathering were greatly pleased with the closing day of the school term.\n\nNearly all of the 120 pupils left for a two months' holiday.\n\n(Sgd.)

T.

If a lump sum of $10,000 were provided, I think that it would be quite possible to have these buildings constructed satisfactorily by the management. Under supervision, the boys could take down the buildings and prepare the old lumber for use. The taking down of the old institute building should be by contract with the understanding that all the material is the property of the contractor and must be removed from the premises. Should any of it be of value in the constructions this could be arranged between the management and contractor.\n\nPort Simpson Girls' Home:\nA dam should be constructed further up the stream for the water supply and thus provide fire protection as well. This would cost about $1,000.\n\nEdmonton:\n- Chicken House\n- Implement Shed\n- Cow Barn\n- Piggery\n- Hog wire for pig yard and more fencing.\n\nIf provision is made for $12,000 I think it should cover the cost of the above. The per capita grant should provide for 125 pupils.\nRev. T.

In the past, the Methodist Missionary Society has been interested in the management of the River Settlement and Oneida No. 3 Schools. I have noted, however, that your share in the responsibility has been more nominal than heretofore. In fact, the incumbents Miss Ethel A. Browne and Miss Catherine C. MacDonald have been appointed without reference to your Society.\n\nI purpose visiting the reserves near Muncey, with a view to bringing the day school work up to the required standard. It may be necessary to secure the services of better qualified teachers.\n\nBefore taking such action, however, I wish to learn whether you concur in the Department assuming the sole responsibility. In the past, we looked to your Society for nominations in the case of the River Settlement and Oneida No. 3 Schools. Of late, however, the Department has engaged the teachers.\n\nPlease let me have an expression of your wishes in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. C. E. Manning, D.

Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have your letter of September 22nd, in which you say \"it is proposed to make some changes of a remedial nature in the Indian Day Schools in the Caradoc Agency. In the past the Methodist Missionary Society has been interested in the management of the River Settlement and Oneida No. 3 Schools.\" You then propose that the whole responsibility for teachers in these schools be left with the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nThis is a matter that I would like to talk over with you before reaching an agreement in regard to your proposal. At the moment, the course you propose does not impress me as being in the best interests of all concerned. Doubtless, you could make it convenient to call at the Mission Rooms, Toronto, and have a conference with me in regard to the matter when you are on your way to the River Settlement, as proposed in your letter.\n\nAwaiting further word from you, I am\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.M.M.T\nOttawa, October 17, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI should be pleased if you would recapitulate the needs of the Indian residential schools conducted by the Methodist Church.

We will take note of this when forwarding cheques to the teachers whose salaries are paid through our Missionary Society.\n\nWith all good wishes,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E. Manning\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 4, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the Department has been allowing teachers in Indian day schools for some years past bonus at the rate of $15.00 for each teaching month in addition to their regular salary. During this period the bonus cheques have been sent direct to the teachers, while the salary cheques for the schools conducted under your auspices have been sent to your general treasurer.\n\nPayment of bonus to teachers of Indian day schools has been discontinued from March 31st, last, and it has been decided to increase the salary of each teacher by $150.00 for the ten teaching months, which is the same amount as was previously allowed as bonus. This amount is being included in the regular salary cheques which are being sent to your general treasurer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nFrom the figures of the 10 years 1910-1919 inclusive, and the enclosed tables, the following statements can be made.\n\n1. The Methodist Mission Board has educated an average of 528 pupils for five years in five schools at a total cost of $47708.00, or an annual average cost of $17. per pupil.\n\n2. The U. M. S. of the Methodist Church has educated an average of 51 pupils for five years in two schools at a total cost of $68122.00 or an annual average cost of $267.00 per pupil.\n\nIf from this amount $20,000.00 is subtracted, being about the cost of a new building with furnishings, the average annual cost is $147 per pupil.\n\n3. The Presbyterian Mission Boards have educated an average of 404 pupils in seven schools at an total cost of $181,141.00 or an annual average cost of $93.00 per pupil.\n\n4. During the past year ending June 30, the Mission Boards have spent about $50,000.00 for the maintenance of the 14 schools that will come under the management of the United Church.\n\n5. The expenditure of Missionary money by all the four churches engaged in assisting the government in the education of Indian children proves that the establishing of a system of boarding schools on or near a reserve has been very expensive as a policy.\n\n6. If the Methodist Church had 20 small boarding schools to bring into the United Church, it would require from the Missionary treasury about $100,000.00 a year to maintain them.\n\n7. A school that does not accommodate at least 100 pupils is a very expensive proposition to the Missionary Society managing the same.\n\n8. A school that accommodates and has an average attendance of 125 or more pupils can be operated with little or no expense on the part of our Missionary Societies.\n\n9. If the 1170 pupils now in attendance in the 14 Residential Schools were consolidated into nine schools giving an average of 130 pupils to a school it would save about $60,000.00 per year to the Missionary Societies of the United Church of Canada.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\nStatement showing the average attendance of the fourteen Indian Residential schools that shall come under the management of the United Church.

Dr. C. E. Manning,\nMethodist Mission Rooms,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. Manning:\n\nA further word in answer to some of your questions re our Indian schools, and their superintendency. We have three types of Indian schools for the education of Indian children.\n\n1. The day school on the reserve, which is built and maintained by the government in harmony with the promise of education in the terms set forth by treaty.\n\n2. Small boarding schools on or near an Indian reserve. These were originally built and maintained by the different churches engaged in missionary work among the Indians of Canada. In other words, the Church is responsible for the building and location of this type of school.\n\n3. The large Industrial School, built by the government, usually convenient to a number of reserves, yet so situated as to have city or town privileges. The management of these schools has been given to the different churches doing missionary work among the Indians, the government support being the per capita grant and material for repairs to plant.\n\nTwenty-three years ago, when I was appointed Superintendent of Indian Schools under the care of the Methodist Church, I gave careful study to each of these types of schools. The policy of the small boarding school on the reserve was very popular, and the churches were building accordingly.\n\nThe following places were pressing their claim upon the Methodist Church for favorable consideration and action. In B. C.: Clayquot, Muskitto Harbour, Namikow, Namikow, Cape Mudge, Bella Coola, Bella Bella, Kitimat, Skidegate, Port Simpson, and Hazelton. In Alberta: Morley, Robson, Red Deer Lake, and Good Fish Lake. In Manitoba: Fisher River, Behrens River, Norway House, Cross Lake, and Nelson House, a total of twenty-one in all.\n\nMy objection to the policy of building up this programme of small schools was fourfold:\n\n1. I did not think the Church could be justified in spending such a large sum of money to educate wards of the Dominion Government.\n\n2. If the plant was built, we could not secure efficient and competent people to manage so many small schools under the conditions and environment surrounding them.\n3. The Mission Board would not be justified in the annual expenditure that would be necessary to maintain them from year to year over and above any government aid that we could expect.\n\n4. The supply of pupils for the Industrial School would be cut off if, on the same territory we had a number of small boarding schools, consequently we had to make a choice between one large school, and a number of small residential schools.\n\nBelieving it was in the best interest of our Mission Board, and the education of the Indian boy and girl, your superintendent has, amid a great deal of opposition adhered to the policy of the large Residential School, with two exceptions, viz: lat Norway House, which is in part a missionary enterprise in the heart of our missionary work in the great Northland; and 2nd, Morley. The executive of our Missionary Board at its last meeting accepted of the responsibility of managing this school, which is now under construction, with a capacity for fifty pupils.\n\nAbout four years ago, I compiled the grants made to Residential schools by the different mission Boards of all the churches through a period of ten years, from 1910 to 1919, and found that the average cost of educating a pupil in a school with less than 100 pupils was a little over $100.00 per pupil a year for the ten years. This $100.00 was missionary money over and above grants received from the government.\n\nThese figures further proved that a school with less than fifty pupils cost more per pupil than schools with fifty up to a hundred pupils.\n\nTransmitted herewith are two tables of figures for the past five years of the fourteen Residential Schools that will come under the management of the United Church of Canada.\n\nOne table gives the annual expenditure of missionary money to maintain each school and the average cost per pupil for the 5-year period, and the total cost for the Mission Board concerned.\n\nThe other gives the average attendance of pupils in each school, also the average for the five years. These figures may throw light that might aid in framing a policy that should govern our Indian Educational work under the United Church.\nIndustrial School, Brandon,\nJuly 1st, 1925.\n\nRev. Dr. G. M. Henning,\nGeneral Secretary of Home Missions,\nToronto, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Henning,\n\nYou have asked me some questions from time to time re the superintendency of Indian schools and hospitals, such as: Should the appointment be continued in the United Church? Is there sufficient work to occupy a man's full time? Could the work be done by one of the secretaries from the Toronto office? And some others re audit of accounts and the nature of the inspection by the superintendent. No doubt these questions have been prompted in search of light to aid you and others upon whom rests the great responsibility of framing the policy and organization of the United Church. They cannot be answered without my personal experience coming more or less into this communication, which may make a contribution to the policy that shall govern a small but very important part of our missionary enterprise.\n\nI had only been about a year in the Indian work when the late Dr. Sutherland began requesting me to visit other institutions, inspect the same and report to him. These visits and reports led up to the appointment of a superintendent of Indian schools, and two years after, the Indian hospitals were added to the superintendency. The condition of our educational and medical work at that time certainly justified the appointment. I submit herewith some brief impressions made upon my mind of each of our institutions on the occasion of my first visit.\n\nIt is twenty-six years ago today that I took charge of the Brandon Institute. The farm was without a buggy, light wagon or cart, without a lawn, hedge, hen or a hog. The live stock consisted of four horses and as many cows and woods were thriving everywhere. One small workshop and barn made up the outbuildings. The main building had two hundred and fifty pieces of broken glass. There was a large debt, an empty fuel bin, empty wardrobe, empty cellar, empty pantry and empty kitchen and about one hundred empty mouths to feed. All the pets and clothing was on the ninety pupils who were destructive, untrained young men and women from thirteen to twenty-three years of age. They were having their own way, smashing everything they could not eat or wear and running rough-shod over a discouraged staff. It looked as though the institution had fallen into a pit and was waiting for someone to come and give it a decent burial.\nMount Elgin Institute at Nimpoy looks up in memory with its untidy yards and a lot of old sheds, outbuildings and dilapidated barns that had passed their day all unconscious of their need of repairs and paint. The main building had accommodation for about one hundred pupils who were receiving such harsh treatment as to call forth numerous complaints from the Indian people and the Indian Department. Several attempts were made on the part of the pupils to burn up the whole business all because it was under the management of a man who had the idea that physical strength was to take the place of what ought to be done by the heart and head in educating and training young life, who believed that it was safer to deal with the hide than the honor of the pupil and a man who took more interest in hydraulics than hygiene.\n\nAt Norway House we had a poor barn shaped building with broken doors, worn out floors, no modern conveniences of plumbing, heating or lighting, a cold shell of a place with partial accommodation for about thirty-five or forty pupils who were obliged to live without a balanced ration as there was no garden, poultry or stock. An incompetent staff were trying to penetrate the stronghold of heathenism with the belief that the problem could never be solved.\n\nAt Morley, the McDougall Orphanage was more of a boarding house to feed the entire population of the reserve, including their ponies, than an educational institution for the enlightenment and training of the young. We were operating a proposition that was prospering the people, at a great cost to the Missionary Society.\n\nRed Deer had a miserable lot of buildings, the boys' home being very dark and unsanitary. There was a stable for horses but none for stock. The arrangement was unconscious of the great possibilities of the rich fertile land of the farm and the opportunity presented as a training school for farmers and stockmen. For many reasons the whole institution was very unsatisfactory with the Indian people of Alberta. The office appeared to be used more for a real estate business than to make a contribution towards civilising and educating the people.\n\nAt Coqualeetza I found the best equipped and managed institution under the care of the Methodist Church. Mr. Cairns a layman with a strong spiritual nature was carrying on, contending with the difficulties of shortage of funds and an insufficient plant.\n\nAt Fort Simpson we had twenty boys housed in a building and under a management that was a disgrace to the Methodist Church. The situation was such that I gave the man to understand that his services would not be required after the end of the year.\nWe had some thirty day schools west of the lines with about half of them receiving $300 each from the Indian Department towards salary, which was supplemented by $100 of missionary money. The other half of these schools were not recognized by the government and were carried on as a missionary enterprise, the Board meeting the entire cost. Very few of these thirty teachers had proper qualifications.\n\nTwo years later the General Board believed it had sufficient reasons for placing the hospital medical work under the same superintendency. I found the hospitals under the care of Dr. Large, Dr. Kergin and Dr. Wrinch, carrying on greatly handicapped by the need of more funds and proper plants. The names of these men and others who have followed them are household words all up and down the Pacific coast. Your superintendent has never assumed that he could instruct such doctors on how to manage a hospital, still I trust he has greatly helped them by his assistance in securing more modern and up-to-date plants with better heating, ventilating and sanitary conditions as well as more adequate support from the provincial government and the Indian Department. Stoves have been replaced by furnaces for warm air or steam heating. Electricity has turned out the lamps, water pressure has given modern conditions and a fine X Ray machine in each is helping to win patronage. The per capita grant from the Indian Department for Indian patients has been raised from 50\u00a2 to $2.50 per day, all of which has practically made our hospitals independent.\n\nOne of the first and most important problems for your superintendent to decide was the type of school the church should adopt. A programme of some eighteen small boarding schools to be situated upon reserves, was pressed upon his attention for his support, sometimes by heated debate and intense opposition to what he believed was the safe policy. Had we this system of twenty small boarding schools to take into the United Church we would have had to meet a request of about $100,000 per year from our missionary treasury for their maintenance. In another communication I will send you some facts that will prove this statement.\n\nAt the time the appointment of superintendent was made, the Board was of the opinion that there was plenty of work to occupy the whole of a man's time. The conditions I have outlined are sufficient ground for this conviction. In harmony with this opinion, Dr. Sutherland arranged for me to accompany him to Ottawa for the purpose of placing my resignation as principal of the Brandon Institute before the Department of Indian Affairs. This resignation was not acceptable to the Department and the Deputy Minister offered\nthe home on the Brandon farm and the office in the institute towards the support of the Superintendent of Schools, providing he would remain as principal of the Brandon school, with a free hand to engage any person he wished for his assistant. On behalf of the Board, Dr. Sutherland accepted of this proposition and this arrangement remains to the present. The following year, the Board increased the work and responsibility of the superintendent by nominating him Chairman of the Lake Winnipeg District, which position he held for twenty years.\n\nIt may be said that the Brandon Institute paid the salary of the Superintendent of School and Hospitals for ten years.\n\nWhat are some of the practical results of the policy of having a Superintendent of Schools and Hospitals?\n\n1. The most of our day schools have teachers who are fully qualified for the teaching profession and instead of a salary of $300 being paid by the Department to only half of them and the schools run at quite a cost to the Mission Board, the salaries range from about $600 to $1,000, all paid by the Department and over and above this they are giving us $500 towards the salary of each of our missionary teachers. The greater number of these teachers are happy and contented in their work and nearly all our class-rooms are comfortable and sanitary.\n\n2. We have three nurses and field matrons supported by the government with skilled medical service available for all Indians under our care.\n\n3. One hospital has been replaced by a very fine new plant and the others are greatly improved. Special homes for nurses have been, or are being provided. The provincial support and that of the Indian Department are much increased both for plant and maintenance. The grant per day for Indians has been increased from 50\u00a2 to $2.50 with substantial increases by the provincial government to patients other than Indians and the doctors are carrying on under very much improved conditions with all hospitals on a high standard as training schools for nurses.\n\n4. The principals and staffs in all our residential schools are proud of their work. A fine Christian spirit pervades the atmosphere and the home life and training are all tending to the uplifting, educating, civilising and Christianising of the Indian people. Neither the church nor the state need be ashamed of the plant and the management of the same. The government have constructed some substantial and beautiful buildings and are prepared to erect more. They are giving us liberal up-keep for the support of each plant. The per capita grant has been increased from $80 to $110, to $140 and up to $170 and about all we need are full schools to make them self-supporting.\nThe government spent during the year 1924 for plant and maintenance of our medical and educational work about $500,000. The annual government grants for maintenance alone has been increased from about $40,000 to about $170,000 per year.\n\nThe relationship of the field officers of the Indian Department and the missionaries and teachers on the reserves is carried on with much less friction. The business of the church within the Indian Department has been conducted in perfect harmony. The government officials all through the years have shown their appreciation of the work of the church being connected with the Department by an individual. There has never been the slightest antagonism or friction from either side and the spirit existing between the officers of the Indian Department and the General Board is of a very high order.\n\nAll these improvements and many more have been brought about by a better class of workers and the loyalty and devotion of the great bulk of our entire staff. Your superintendent has simply tried to improve the machine, keep it well oiled, steer it in the right direction, secure the right type of people and advice, help, encourage and inspire them in their task. And above all to create a Christian atmosphere that light, love, joy and peace shall reign in all our institutions.\n\nYou will see that this historical and personal experience gives an indirect answer to most of your questions. I naturally feel like refraining from giving you a direct answer but the responsibility cannot be evaded.\n\n1. Should the superintendency be dropped? Union will present new problems and a uniform policy must be provided. The building programme is not complete. There are need of a great many improvements. To drop this peculiar work at this particular time, in my judgment would be a mistake.\n\n2. Should the United Church set aside a man to give his whole time to this work? If there is no other way of having it properly done, it could abundantly pay from a financial as well as from an efficient point of view. Your present superintendent has divided his time and effort between the principalship of the Branson school, the chairmanship of the most difficult district in Canadian Methodism and this superintendency and he has not given more than one half of his time to the latter. My experience would lead me to believe that to appoint a man to give his whole time would not be a necessity.\n\n3. Can it be handled from the Toronto office by one of the secretaries? The experience of the past proves that this method ended in confusion and failure. When the manage-\nment was transferred from the Foreign to the Home Department of our General Board, the missionaries, principals, teachers and other workers gathered in convention in our different conferences, unanimously requested that no change be made in the superintendency of the work. This request was largely due to the attitude and treatment given our Indian work by annual conferences, stationing committees and even our General Board. These courts have placed the Indian work at the foot of the list and to the closing hours of the sessions and if it were not for the care, watchfulness and sympathy of men who spend all their time in it, it would be sadly neglected.\n\nA proper inspection of one of our institutions cannot be done in less than a week by a man who is familiar with every detail of each department. This together with an annual visit to each of the day schools will be too great a task and claim upon the time of a man who is not familiar with the internal working of an institution and who has other interests which in his judgment, place the needs of the Indian work in a second or third position. Such an arrangement would simply result in a call which would be of no value to the principal, staff and pupils in the management and conduct of the institution. It would leave the Indian work without a special advocate as a living link, to connect the interests and details of our educational and medical work with the Church and the Indian Department.\n\nI trust that this communication will aid you and all others who may be responsible for the policy and organization that shall govern this important part of our work, which has to be conducted not only satisfactorily to the Church but to the general public and the Government of our country.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\nIndustrial School, Brandon, Man.,\nSeptember 2nd, 1925.\n\nMr. Russell T.

Scott, F.R.S.C., Litt.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Dr. Scott,-\n\nI understand that a deputation of representatives from the different churches waited upon the Minister a short time ago in the interests of the schools they represented. The schools managed by the Methodist church were not represented in this deputation. The reason for this was that we were in a state of transition from the Methodist church to the United Church of Canada. Dr. Manning, our esteemed secretary, was of the opinion that we could not assume authority for the United Church, therefore the time was inopportune to approach the Minister on important business. In this opinion I fully concur. You will see that it was not for lack of interest or that we were perfectly satisfied with the present standard of the per capita grants.\n\nMy object in addressing you is to bring to your attention my personal opinion of what should be done for the Residential Schools that were under the care of the Methodist church, providing the Department should see fit to revise the per capita grants to that class of residential schools that were designated as boarding schools. I would suggest the following:-\n\nMount Elgin from $140 to $150\nNorway House \" $165 \" $175\nMorley to start at \" $175\nPort Simpson \" $165 \" $175\nKitamaat \" $165 \" $175\n\nBrandon and Edmonton, also Coqualeetza to be left for future consideration. I do not know what the deputation asked for on behalf of the schools they represented, but would suggest the above scale providing it can be done in justice to the claims for other schools and should the Department revise the scale of per capita grants.\n\nTrusting my request will meet with your usual courteous and just consideration, I remain\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nT. Ferrier\nFebruary 18, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,\n\nI have your letter of the 9th instant requesting that the per capita grant rate be raised in the case of certain Indian Residential Schools which have been managed by the Methodist Church. Your representations and those of the deputation that waited on the Honourable Mr. Stewart are now receiving consideration.\n\nI am pleased to have your suggestions and if I am able to secure the necessary additional appropriation I shall communicate with you in due course.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent,\nMethodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, June 22, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nReferring to your letter of December 7th, last, requesting provision for improvements at the Indian residential schools under your care, I am pleased to state that the Department hopes to effect the following improvements:\n\nMt. Elgin - General repairs.\n\nNorway House - General repairs and replacements to mechanical plant; contribution towards Evans monument.\n\nBrandon - General repairs and fencing.\n\nEdmonton - Small outbuildings and replacements to fencing.\n\nCoqualeetza - Hen house.\n\nPort Simpson - Dam.\n\nThere is also an item to provide a combined school and teacher's residence at Klemtu. I do not propose to send out authority for this new day school building until I am absolutely convinced that it is necessary.\n\nI am also glad to inform you that we hope to offer some help towards the nurses' home at the Port Simpson hospital.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, and beg, in reply thereto, to state that the requests it contains seem to fall under two heads, viz., for assistance in building for school purposes, and for assistance in maintaining Indian pupils in schools.\n\nIn regard to assistance in building for school purposes, I would say that though you have not stated what sum is asked for, in order to purchase the Birtle public school, from what I remember of a conversation on this point, the whole monetary aid sought may be estimated at a low figure.\n\nIn regard to assistance in maintaining Indian pupils in schools, it appears that the grants at present provided for your Church, are about $8040 per annum; and that these, if increased as you suggest, by $100 per cap. per annum, and if a further\n\nRev. A. B. Baird, B.D.,\nWinnipeg.\ngrant should be given to assist a school on\nthe Indian Head Reserve, would amount to\n$16,870, or an additional subsidy of $8760;\nin a word, over twice the amount now granted.\n\nI am fully prepared to give every weight\nto the consideration that you have so well\nsuggested, but there are others that have\nrecently led me to doubt whether the partial\nownership by the Department of schools\nthat in effect it does not control, is desirable;\nand suggest to my mind the propriety of\nof rendering more liberal assistance towards\nthe maintenance of children in school rather\nthan to increase its expenditure in the\ndirection of erecting buildings.\n\nBut before answering your letter fully, I\nwould like to draw your attention to this\npoint, and ask for an explanation of your\nviews in relation to it. It seems to me\nthat different schools will perform very\ndifferent work, and that whilst some will\nbe merely day-schools, at which the pupils\nmay have a little industrial occupation,\nothers they will be regularly trained in\ncertain trades; whilst at another or others\nagain, a higher education may be given,\n\nTeachers\nteachers be trained, and so forth. It therefore seems to me that as the expense incurred in carrying on different classes of institutions will be directly dependent on the work done in them respectively, it should be fully understood to what class any institution applying for a grant belongs to; and that the grant should be proportioned to the work to be done, and payment of it be dependent upon the accomplishment of that work.\n\nI have to,\n\n(Sgd.) Mayor Reed,\nCommissioner\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nWinnipeg\nDec. 31st, 1888.\n\nTo the Commissioners of Indian Affairs,\n\nSir,\n\nThe Committee which has charge of the missions of the Presbyterian Church among the Indians of the North West, begs to lay before you the following requests, and to invite your attention to some of the needs of educational work among the Indians, at the time when the estimates for the ensuing financial year are being prepared.\n\nAnd first in the matter of buildings\u2014The assistance for which we ask is in every case to erect or enlarge industrial schools, in which the pupils are to live while they are being educated. An addition is required to connect the present mission building with...\nThe Stony Plains reserve near Edmonton into a boarding school. At present there is a log school house erected by the Indians with the assistance of a grant of $100 from the Government, and an additional log dwelling house erected by the Presbyterian Church at a cost of $200. What we ask is that the Government appropriate $200 to build an addition to this house for the purpose of converting it into a boarding school. The committee has always endeavored to make the industrial department especially prominent in their school, an endeavor in which it has on several occasions received special assistance from the Government. It may be mentioned that the late Commissioner offered in an interview on the subject to assist in making this a boarding school whenever we were ready.\n\nAn addition to the school conducted by Mr. Moore at Macdonaldburg is needed. The church does not have a frame building but costing $400 without any help from the...\nthe Government, and we ask that\nthe Government now devote $500 to\nthe erection of an additional building\nthe lower part of which may be used\nas a school-room, and the upper\npart as a dormitory for boys.\n\nNew buildings are needed on\nthe Assiniboine reserve near Indians\nHead. The buildings now in use\nare quite unsuitable, and the com-\nmittee wish to replace them by an\nindustrial school building costing\n$1600 of which the Government is\nasked to contribute $800.\n\nThe committee need the\napproval and vigorous support of\nIndian Agent Mankle has opened\nan industrial school at Birtle.\nThe public school building, which\nis situated so far out of the town\nas to be inconvenient for the purposes\nfor which it was built, has been\npulled and fitted up, and the\nventure has succeeded so well, that\nthe committee is anxious to keep\nit as a permanent institution.\nIt is therefore asked that the\n\nGovernment\nGovernment purchase this building, where the town is willing to sell, and place it under the care of the Indians to be used as an industrial school. The building is a substantial structure of stone, and can be bought at a price much below its original cost.\n\nIn the second place comes the question of maintenance. The Committee finds that the $10 per pupil\u8865\u52a9 allowed is quite inadequate. In a country where living is as expensive as it is in the North West, it is not possible, even with the strictest economy, and utilizing local products to the utmost extent, to supply a child with food for twelve months or $120 to say nothing of the expense of clothing and schooling. The Committee therefore asks that the allowance be raised to $200 per pupil, per year, for the schools at Flaxeld Lake, Moosejaw, Qu'Appelle, Birtle and the Little Hills.\n\nWe venture to support\n\nHere\nThese requests by the following considerations:\n\n1. The importance of education:\n   There is no need to argue this point. The Government admits that in the education of the children is the hope of the Indians. In the light of this statement the Government will probably admit too, that the amount spent in educating them is too small in comparison with the amount spent in feeding and governing them.\n\n2. The superiority of industrial schools in which the pupils board, to day schools. We cannot indicate this superiority more emphatically than it is put by the commissioners in his last report. The schools we have established and propose to establish are intended to improve somewhat the same work as the Government industrial schools, only at very much less cost to the Government.\n\n3. The Presbyterian Church has shown its anxiety to push on this work by expending $5000 on buildings.\nsimilar to those for which assistance is asked. The whole expenditure of the Church among the Indians for their current year is over $18,000. This is quoted to show that the Committee does not ask the Government to bear the brunt of the work, while the Church stands by idle, or only comes in to reap the credit.\n\n4. It may obviate a possible objection to say that this work is no longer an experiment. It was an experiment when Mr. Hugh McRea began his school at Otter Lake four years ago, but the success that has attended his efforts, and those of Mr. Moore at Mississagi's, have so far been so promising as to invite further endeavours in the same direction. The Committee has during the past summer undertaken a considerable extension of the work along this line, and is ready to advance as rapidly as the means placed at its disposal by the Church give it the power. This appeal is made to the Government\nin the hope that the work which is admitted on all hands to be valuable, and now indefensible may be extended.\n\nIn behalf of the Committee...\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n(Sgd) Andrew B. Baird\nOFFICE OF THE\nIndian Commissioner,\nNORTH-WEST TERRITORIES.\n\nRegina, May 29th, 1889\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter enclosing herewith a copy of a letter from the Rev. R.M. Board, written on behalf of the Committee of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church concerning the grants given by this Department to certain schools conducted by that Church, and a copy of a letter of mine written in answer thereto.\n\nThe latter has not yet been replied to.\n\nWhile in Ottawa you may remember that you stated that it would not be possible to purchase the Stable School building as requested; and it is clearly my own opinion that rather than give any more assistance for the present towards\n\nThe Hon.\nThe Dept General\nof Indian Affairs\nOttawa\nbuildings in this district, if the Department desires it well, to increase its grants; such increase should be made in the direction of maintaining pupils, and not in that of assisting to build.\n\nIn this connection I may add, that at an interview recently had with certain authorities of the Presbyterian Church in Minnipeg; they complained, of the Episcopalians and Roman Catholic churches being given grants of $200 per pupil per annum, whilst their church, which they consider took the field first, is only allowed $100 per pupil.\n\nIn regard to the assistance which it is claimed was promised by government to make the day school on the Stony Plain Reserve into a boarding school; I beg to state that it is felt that it would be wise to grant aid to this project, especially as, as stated by Mr. Baird, industrial instruction has for some time been given in the school, and it has been\nfound that this cannot be very efficiently carried out in a day school.\n\nI leave the lesson to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nHapton Reed\n\nCommissioner\nMemorandum -\n\nThe undersigned begs to submit herewith a letter of the 29th ult. from the Indian Commissioner for the North-West Territories, and copies of the letters which accompanied it, from the Rev. A.B. Baird to the Indian Commissioner, and from the latter to the former, respecting the grants given by the Dept' to certain schools conducted by the Presbyterian Church in the interests of Indian children in the N.W. Territories. The points involved in the correspondence appear to be, first, the advisability\n\nTo the\n\nHonble\n\nE. Dewdney\n\nSup't General of Indian Affairs\nadvisability of the Dept contributing towards the expense of the erection or purchase of certain buildings for school purposes, and, secondly, the advisability of increasing the annual grant at present given by the Dept to certain boarding schools conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church from $60. to $100. per capita.\n\n(1) The undersigned beg to report that, as regards the question of the Dept assisting in the expense of constructing school buildings, he considers the amount applied for by the Presbyterian Church authorities by no means extravagant. He sees no reason why the assistance should not be given in so far as concerns schools situated on Indian Reserves, as the land upon which the schools are located belongs to the Government and is under its\nthe control of this Dep't. But as regards giving assistance towards the erection or purchase of school buildings situated on land which does not belong to the Government he considers the principle an objectionable one.\n\nAny assistance, however, which it may be decided to give towards building operations must be deferred until the same has been voted by Parliament, so there was no provision made therefore in the last estimates voted by the House.\n\n(2) With respect to the augmentation of the per capita grant applied for, the Indian Commissioner first remarks that the amount to be contributed by the Dep't towards the maintenance of schools should depend upon the class of institution to which the assistance is to be given. In the N.W. Territories there are\nare two classes of institutions at which Indian children are lodged, fed and educated, firstly, the industrial institutions, such as those at La'Appelle, Battleford and High River, to which also will belong the schools proposed to be established at Regina, St Paul's and Elkhorn. At these institutions a staff of artisans is maintained in salary for the purpose of giving instruction in trades to the pupils, and the institutions are conducted on an expensive scale generally.\n\nSecondly, the boarding schools, which to a certain extent are of an industrial type also, but at which no staff of mechanics is maintained for the instruction of the pupils in industries, and consequently the expense of maintaining such institutions is much less than that\nof maintaining those of the\nspecial industrial type.\nThe industrial schools\nwhich it is proposed to\nestablish at Regina and\nSt. Paul's and the one which\nhas been in part already\nestablished at Elk Horn\nwill come under class\nNo. 1, and to these it is\nproposed to contribute only\nat the rate of $100 per capita.\nThe undersigned\nconsiders that, as regards\nany of the schools referred to\nby Mr. Baird in his\ncommunication to the\nCommissioner, they can only\nbe regarded as belonging\nto Class No. 2, that is\nBoarding Schools; and\nhe is of opinion that\n$60. per pupil is a\nsufficiently liberal\nallowance for schools of\nthis class, more especially\nwhen they are situated on or\nin the immediate vicinity\nof Reserves, so many of\nnot most of the pupils\ncooled\ncongest them at probably return to their homes every Friday and remain until Monday, thus effecting an important saving to the institutions by those children not being fed thereat for at least two days in each week. For example: at a school of forty day pupils, five pupils are at their homes for two days in the week, which is equal to fifty pupils for one day, and 50 pupils at 17 cents per day (the rate at which the Dept's contributes) makes a saving of $8.50 per week, or $442.00 per annum. And in addition to this it must be remembered that there are some fort-five holidays in the year during which the schools would probably be completely empty of inmates. This saving is not effected in the Industrial Schools, inasmuch\nas they are situated at too great a distance from the Reserves to admit of children returning to their homes as in the case of the other schools, as before situated. Moreover, the Boarding Schools are not conducted on so extensive a scale, nor are the expenses in any respect equal to those of the Industrial schools.\n\n[Signature]\nActing Chief\nDept General\nIndian Affairs.\nSir,\n\nWith ref. to yr. letter of the 29th inst. & the letter from the Rev. A.B. Baird enclosed therein, written in behalf of the Comm. of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Ch., concerning the grants given by this Dept't to certain schools conducted by that Ch., & to yr. letter written in ref. to the former, I beg to inform you that the papers having been submitted to the S.E. &c., he is of opinion that the grants applied for by the P. Ch. authorities towards the construction of school buildings is by no means extravagant, & he sees\nno reason why the assistance asked for should not be given in so far as schools situated on Reserves are concerned, be recommended to the favourable consideration of the Board upon which the schools are located belongs to the Gov't & is therefore under the control of this Dept., but the S.S. considers that the assistance asked for towards the enlargement, construction, or purchase of school buildings which are situated on land not belonging to the Gov't cannot be properly granted, and that, in respect to any assistance which may be given towards the school buildings on Reserves the same can only be done after it has been voted by Parliament, & therefore, it is impossible for the application\nof the P.C. authorities\nfor assistance towards\nthe building in the\nReserves referred to by them\nto be completed with it\npresent.\n\nThe S.G. is further\nof opinion that the stipulated\ngrant of $60 per ann. is a\ninsufficient liberal allowance\nfor institutions of the\nboarding school type, as\nthey are not conducted\nupon so extensive a scale,\nnor are the facilities\nafforded to pupils for the\nattainment of a knowledge\nof the mechanical arts\nso great, nor doubtless\nmanagement costs so much, as at\ninstitutions of the\nindustrial type, to some\nof which the Dep't has\nundertaken to contribute\nnot at the rate annually\nof $100 per cap. The\nS. J. consequently regrets that he cannot see his way to recommend that the capitation grant of $60 towards the support & education of Indian children at boarding schools be increased to $120, as applied for by Mr. Baird.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nNote\n\nFor correspondence re.\nBirtle Bdg School see\nfile 116624-1\nDear Sir,\n\nThe letter of even date which I transmit to you and in which Mr McLeod states that the Regina Industrial school is now filled, at least so far as the dining room and dormitories are concerned, removes the objection which in the opinion of the Department stood in the way of the increased grant to the Birtle school. Will you be so kind therefore as to take action upon the matter before the supplementary estimates are brought down, and have the grant to the Birtle school increased so as to provide for the maintenance of forty pupils.\n\nIt is perhaps proper for me to say that the accompanying report from the Rev Mr McLeod was not obtained at the suggestion of any member of our Committee - indeed it came as a surprise to us.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nDear Sir,\nYour obedient servant\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, ONT.,\nDear Sir,\n\nAllow me on behalf of the Committee which has charge of Presbyterian Indian missions schools to ask that the Indian Department in compiling estimates to be laid before Parliament, will provide for an increase of fifteen pupils in the Bible schools, ten in the Board Hall School, and five in the Red River School.\n\nI have no wish to weary you with a recapitulation of our arguments in favor of these grants which was fully detailed in connection with our request for an increased grant to the Bible school last year; but if you wish for any statement or explanation I shall be pleased to give it.\n\nAllow me to call your attention to the fact that no acknowledgment has been received by my letter of the 30th May last in which I addressed the crowded condition of the Regina dining room and dormitories as a reason why the increased grant to Bible work be no longer delayed. I have the honor to be, etc.,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAndrew B. Baird\nOttawa, January 11th, 1895.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo, in which you request that provision may be made to increase the number of pupils at Birtle, Round Lake, and Pine Hills Boarding Schools respectively.\n\nIn reply I may point out that, without reopening the discussion of last year on this subject, it is far from clear to the Department why such request should be made with regard to Birtle and Round Lake Schools. During the last fiscal year the average attendance at Round Lake was only 14, and during the only quarter of the current year for which returns have yet been received it was 12 pupils. The grant earned at Birtle was for an average of 20 during the last year, and for an average of 19 during the first quarter of the current year.\n\nIt would seem, therefore, that a margin still exists at both schools, without increasing the provision, but if the Committee would prefer to have less of it apportioned to Round Lake and more at Birtle, the Department would have no objection to make such an arrangement.\n\nWith regard to Pine Hills, the Department feels\n\nRev. Prof. A. H. Baird, B. D.,\nJoint Convener P. P. M. Society,\nWinnipeg,\nManitoba.\nfeels that it so near to Regina that there can be no reason why the children should not be drafted to the Industrial School there, as it certainly considers should be done, and consequently regrets its inability to see its way to increasing the number of pupils there.\n\nWith regard to the concluding paragraph of your letter, the department is surprised to learn that you have received no acknowledgment of your letter of 30th May last, in which you adduced the crowded condition of the dining-room and dormitories at the Regina School as a reason why the increased grant to Birtle need be no longer delayed, in view of the fact that it addressed a reply to you on the 6th June last, a copy of which is herewith transmitted.\n\nIn this connection I may add that the Assistant Commissioner was at the time advised of the department's views as to how more room should be provided if required, and it may be inferred that the matter was arranged to the satisfaction of the Reverend Principal, since not long afterwards he requested authority to receive a considerably increased number of pupils, for whom he said there was increased accommodation in the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs.\nMiss Graham,\n\nMr. Scott states that he does not know why there is an appropriation for a R.C. school at Alonzo but when there is none in operation and no appropriation for a Presbyterian school although there is one in operation. The responsibility rests with the school as he thinks as he got the list of schools from that branch. The appropriation could very well be used for the Presbyterian school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nM. Stone\nMEMO.\n\nSir: There is mistaken in saying that the responsibility in connection with the preparation of the school estimates rests with the school boards during the time they are in charge of the schools. They never consulted about the school estimates, nor was it ever thrown the least of schools to be reported on.\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Secretary.\n\nI would suggest that henceforth before the estimates in regard to schools are submitted to the Minister they be sent to me for reference. This is only proper to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nH.C. Ross\nRound Lake Whitecourt P.O. Assiniboia\nDec 15, 1897\n\nRev. Principal Grant,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYellow Calf & Akooos have called upon me this morning. They have asked me to write to you. They have driven 30 miles this cold day 30\u00b0 below zero for the purpose of having me write you. They are glad for the help they have received from you. They are still of the same mind on school matters as they were when you saw them. They say we find it hard to move our people because there are so many trying to move them. The teachers from the Appellee try to draw them that way and the teachers from Elk Horn try to take them in the opposite direction as they obey neither or stand still.\n\nYou have spoken for us & succeeded in opening up the school at Round Lake for 10 extra scholars making the number 30. There are 30 more who find that there is plenty of room yet. Can\nyou spoke for us again that the number may still be increased. There are still 30 children who are not attending school & the most of them would attend school if they could be sent to Round Lake. You know our views & why we would be pleased to send our children to school. We would like to take hands with you & do not wish that you would forget us. And we are sure we will never forget you.\n\nHave written to Rome again me by these men & I need not say that I am glad to have the number in our school increased to 30. & I think it would be for the good of the Indians if the number was still higher say 50 or 60. These men will be glad to hear from you when you find time &c etc. We are all well at Round Lake Mr. McKay & Jane kept very busy teaching & helping in the new big family. We shall remember your visit & ought all join in sending you very kind greetings. The compliments of the season. I am Yours respectfully\n\nH. McKay\nOttawa Oct\n\nJanuary 31, 1898\n\nTo the Secretary of the Indian Department,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn behalf of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada they have to submit for your consideration the cases of the Indian schools mentioned below and to request the continuance of the grants heretofore made by the Department together with such increases in the grants as the circumstances of several schools deem requisite at the disposal of the Department for educational purposes may permit.\n\nH. W.\n\nButte - A grant of $72 per pupil up to 40 being an increase of ten pupils\n\nCrowfoot - $72 per pupil up to 30 being an increase of 5 pupils\n\nFile Hills - $72 per pupil up to 15 being an increase of 5 pupils\nPortage La Prairie - a grant of $72 per pupil up to 25\n\nNote: There is an increase asked in this instance but I don't know precisely what the increase is.\n\nThis school I believe has never cost the Government anything for land or building and is said to be one of the best in the West.\n\nIt is understood that Mr. Forget is recommending this school for a grant.\n\nRound Lake - a grant of $72 per pupil up to 30 being an increase of 10 pupils\n\nRegina - a grant of $120 per pupil up to 150 pupils\n\nBuilding - At Birtle there is need of more school accommodation. The school has been carried on for nine years in buildings provided by the Church. At first a building was rented. In 1879 & 1880 failing to get help from the Department the Church put up a building costing $7000. The main building which is of stone is now much too small for the children in attendance.\nThe number I believe is our No. The basement which was intended for a playroom, washroom & cellar has been used as a kitchen & pupils' dining-room. The Principal reports that the schoolroom is a half too small. The obsolete\n\nI am informed that the Agent of the Department has recommended that it be taken over and made an industrial school. This school stands in the midst of a large territory with a very considerable native population & the supply of children is likely to be constant.\n\nFor this school we ask the Department to build a new kitchen, dining-room & school-room extension of the present building at an estimated cost of $2000 or\n\nB.C.\n\nAlberni. Here to date this school I believe has received only the day school allowance up to $300 per year. The buildings were erected for a boarding school according to plans approved by the Department at a cost slightly more than $3751 or $3750.\n$1500 was paid by the Department. The building is in good repair and every way suitable for the purpose. It can accommodate from 40 to 50 boarders. There are in the two bands in this neighborhood 81 children under 16 years of age. We ask that the grant usually given to Boarding schools be given to this school up to the number of 35 pupils.\n\nAn application to the foregoing effect, though for only 35 pupils was made in Nov. 1876. We were then assured the matter would receive attention when the estimates were being made up. I shall be glad to know that something can be done in this direction this year.\n\nSpecial items\n\n(1) Occasionally cases arise in which some of the older boys connected with a school can be hired to farmers who will give them a good training in farm work.\n\nWe ask that in such cases, when a late earning boy is hired out, with the consent of the Indian Agent, he should be permitted to fill his place.\non the rate earning list with the name of some other boy connected with the school whose name is not on the rate earning list in order to keep up the full attendance of the school.\n\nThe Honorable, the Minister of the Interior whom I saw this morning regarding this matter has kindly promised that every such case when properly certified shall receive the best consideration of the Department. Recognizing the fact that the rule under which exchanges have been allowed in the past is an important one, I believe deviations from it should only be allowed where it is clearly in the interest of the Indian children and under such conditions as shall leave no opening for or encouragement to unfair dealing with the Department. I mention the subject now that it may be matter of record that this understanding has been arrived at.\n\nSome time ago, I cannot fix the exact date from memory, but think it was about\ntwo years ago, Mr. Swartout a teacher in our employment at the solicitation of the Indians opened a school at a place called Ahousaht. The usual reports were made & the customary grant was paid for three quarters of the year. When the last quarter's pay was applied for the application was refused on the ground that it had been discovered that the Roman Catholic church had a claim based on priority of right.\n\nI am credibly informed that the work done by the Roman Catholic Church was among a tribe known as the Clanaquahto & that the Clanaquahto & the Ahousahts, between whom there is said to be much ill feeling, are distinct tribes and live about ten miles from each other.\n\nIt is important for many reasons that the several Churches engaged in mission & educational work should respectfully respect each other's claims & that no\nChurch should intrude upon the sphere of another's labor.\n\nIf therefore an investigation is proved that the Roman Catholic Church has a prior claim by reason of earlier entry among these people I think I am perfectly safe in saying that the Church which I represent will consider the matter as finally settled.\n\nBut if investigation proves that the Cayuga-akts & the Mohawks are distinct tribes & that the Presbyterian Church has had prior entry among the latter, I ask that the claim for the unpriced quarter be referred to be allowed & that the customary grant be given for a day school during the present year.\n\nPlease also find here-with enclosed a copy of an interesting letter written to Principal Grant of Queen's University by the missionary at the Bay of Quinte.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMr. Moore,\nClerk.\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nWith reference to the Rev. Dr. Moore's letter of the 27th inst., May today:\n\n1. As to the increase grant of the grants to the schools mentioned, as the Minister has decided not to make any increased grants this year, it does not deem necessary to report on any of these schools.\n\n2. With respect to the continuance of the present grants, as hitherto it has not been the custom to consult the officer in charge of schools when the estimates concerning schools were being prepared, does not know whether provision has been made for the continuance of these grants or not.\n\n3. Dr. Moore states that he submitted to the Minister the proposition that, when boys earning grants are hired out to farmers, the principal of the school be allowed to fill their places with other pupils for whom no allowance has been made, so that the school may not lose a portion of the per capita grant on account\nof some pupils being given the advantage of the \"outside\" system. Dr. Moore states that the Minister promised him that any such case when properly certified will receive the best consideration of the Department. Dr. Moore says that he mentions the matter in order that it may be on record that this understanding has been arrived at. It would be well to obtain from the Minister or Deputy an acknowledgment of this understanding.\n\n4. As to the school at Shuswap, Cowichan Agency, B.C., Dr. Moore is mistaken in thinking that Mr. Swartout was ever teacher of this school\u2014having been the teacher of the school on the Tobin Reserve (unlocated) school on the Tobin Reserve, West Coast Agency. John W. Russell is the teacher at the former school. There was, however, a misunderstanding about the grant for the Shuswap school. Pecuniary was voted for a Roman Catholic school, but through error one quarter's salary was paid to the\nPresbyterian school. It might be well, however, to ascertain from Capt. Vowell whether Dr. Moore is correct in his impression that the ground is occupied by the Presbyterians only and that, therefore, the grant ought to be voted for the school conducted by his Church, the Roman Catholics not having any.\n\nH. Ross\nMEMO.\n\nAccountant.\n\nHas provision been made in the Estimates to continue the grants hitherto made by the Dept. to the schools mentioned in Rev. D. Morris' letter of 21st Oct. Please see page 2 of the Rev. Morris' letter.\n\nYours from\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, 26th Oct. 1898\nTo Mr. W. in regard to the request of Mr. Brown concerning the sale of 37 acres Ross\n\nYours,\n\nR. M. Ross\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY.\n\nThe following amounts are provided for the schools mentioned in the Rev. Dr. Moore's letter:\n\nBirtle, 40 pupils at $72;\nCrow Stand, 30 pupils at $72;\nLake Hills, 12 pupils at $72;\nPortage la Prairie, 20 pupils at $72;\nRound Lake, 30 pupils at $72;\nRegina, 140 at $130;\nBirtle, nothing provided for buildings;\nAlberni, $300, salary of a day school teacher.\n\nWith reference to the request referred to in paragraph 3 of Mr. Ross' memorandum, I would say that there could be no objection to the course suggested by Dr. Moore if the new boy takes the place of the old as a grant earner for the school. Of course it would be impossible to pay the grant for both boys.\n\nJan'y 26th, '98.\nMEMO.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n40 \\times 72 &= \\$2880 \\\\\n12 \\times 32 &= \\$384 \\\\\n20 \\times 72 &= \\$1440 \\\\\n30 \\times 72 &= \\$2160 \\\\\n140 \\times 130 &= \\$18200 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n14000 \\\\\n130 \\\\\n\\hline\n4200 \\\\\n1400 \\\\\n\\hline\n18200 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n40 \\times 72 &= \\$2880 \\\\\n30 \\times 72 &= \\$2160 \\\\\n15 \\times 72 &= \\$1080 \\\\\n25 \\times 72 &= \\$1800 \\\\\n30 \\times 72 &= \\$2160 \\\\\n150 \\times 120 &= \\$18000 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n28080 \\\\\n27704 \\\\\n\\hline\n376 \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nMemorandum: Superintendent General.\n\nThe Rev. Dr. Moore is evidently under the impression that he is asking for a total increase in the grants towards the schools named in his letter of the 21st instant of $2500 over what is allowed this year; but as a matter of fact the total increase, if all he asks for were granted, would amount to only $376.00.\n\nI would recommend that Dr. Moore be informed of the number of pupils and the rate at which provision is proposed to be made in the Estimates for the coming year, and also that the Superintendent General does not intend to ask for any money for buildings or additional school accommodation at present.\n\nThe proposition made by Dr. Moore, under the heading of \"special items,\" on page 4 of his letter, is one, I think, deserving of favorable consideration. What he asks is, that when boys are hired out to farmers, their places should be filled by other pupils at the institution for whom no allowance is made, so that no portion of the per capita grant may be lost through the absence of the boys hired out. (See paragraph 8 of Mr. Ross' memo, and last paragraph of Accountant's memo, under). This concession, if granted, should apply to all schools conducted on the per capita system.\n\nAs\nAs regards the salary of the teacher of the school at Ahousalt, which has not been paid in consequence of the money being voted for a Roman Catholic School at that place, it would seem, as far as I can at present make out, that the item was intended for a Presbyterian school, as there is no Roman Catholic school there. Mr. Superintendent Vowell will be asked for a report in the matter.\n\nAsst. Secretary.\nOTTAWA, 7th February, 1896.\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo, in which you ask on behalf of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada for the continuance of the grants heretofore made by the Department to Presbyterian schools, also for certain increases in these grants.\n\nIn reply I beg to inform you that the following provision for the school referred to has been made in the Estimates to be submitted to Parliament at its present session:\n\nBirtle------------------40 pupils at $72 per capita, no provision for buildings.\nCrowstand-----------------30 pupils at $72 per capita\nPilo Hills---------------12 \" \" \" \"\nPortage-la-Prairie-------20 \" \" \" \"\nRound Lake--------------50 \" \" \" \"\nRegina-------------------140 \" \" $250 \" \"\nAlberni -----------------$300 for salary of a day school teacher\n\nWith reference to your request for assistance towards new school buildings or enlarging some of the present buildings, I have to say that the Superintendent General has decided not to ask Parliament for money for this purpose at present.\n\nThe Superintendent General approves of your proposition that, when boys who have been drawing a per capita grant\n\nRev. Wm. Moore, D.D.,\nat\nOttawa.\nat an industrial school are hired out to farmers and so far\nthe time being the school loses the grant for such pupil,\ntheir places should be filled by other pupils at the insti-\ntution who had not previously been drawing the grant. In fact\nthis practice has been allowed by the Department for some time.\n\nWith reference to the Presbyterian school at\nAhousaht, Cowichan Agency, B.C., I beg to say that you are mis-\ntaken in thinking that Mr Swartout was ever teacher of this\nschool\u2014he having been the teacher of the Ucluelet school on\nthe Itesau Reserve, West Coast Agency. Mr John W. Russell is\nteacher at the former school. There was, however, a misunder-\nstanding about the grant for the Ahousaht school. The salary\nwas voted for a Roman Catholic school, but through an error one\nquarter's salary was paid to the Presbyterian school.\n\nInquiries are being made of Mr Vowell, Indian Supt.,\nVictoria, in the matter, and as soon as his report is received\nyou will be further advised.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. N. McNEILL\n\nAssistant Secretary,\nOTTAWA, 10th February, 1896.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to the school conducted under Presbyterian auspices at Ahousaht, B.C., for which there is no grant provided in the current year's estimates, although there is provision for a Roman Catholic school at that place, I beg to say that the Department would like a report from you in regard to this school. It has been continuously in operation for some time past, but with the exception of one quarter paid in error, has received no grant, and the grant for the Roman Catholic school, which has not been in operation, has been taken to pay for the Roman Catholic school at Clayoquot, which is also unprovided for.\n\nFinally furnish the Department with particulars as to the reason for providing for a Roman Catholic school at this point, where none is in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.F. Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Supt.,\nVictoria,\nB.C.\n\nAssistant Secretary\n41 C\u00b0 British Columbia,\n\nIndian Superintendent's Office,\n\nVictoria, 18 February 1898\n\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated 16th instant requesting my report on the Ahousaht and Clayoquot schools, more especially in respect to the grants which have been made for these schools.\n\nIn this connection I beg to submit that the Roman Catholic was the first religious denomination that undertook to establish schools for the Indians in the West Coast Agency other than at Albemarle. Schools at Ahousaht, Clayoquot and other places before any grant was furnished by the Department towards the support of these institutions. Mr. Agent Gullod's letter dated 1st June 1896 \"Copy\" of which was transmitted to the Department under date 8th June 1896 together with \"copy\" of the Rev. Father Van Nevel's letter dated 12th May 1896 makes mention of the schools under consideration but both letters refer more particularly to the Clayoquot School.\n\nRegarding the Roman Catholic School at Ahousaht it would appear that denomination had erected a school building there and had opened the school which the Department had recognized and had allowed it the usual annual Grant of from year to year but owing to the irregularity with which the teachers furnished the Quarterly Returns the grant was only occasionally paid.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nIt would appr\nIt would appear that this school had lately often been kept closed for some time. Under date 1st Nov 1895, the Rev. Mr. Swartout Presbyterian missionary made application for a grant in aid of his opening a school at Ahousaht. Copy of this application together with Copy of Mr. Agent Macdonald's letter dated 26th Nov 1895 was forwarded to the Department under date 22nd Nov 1895. A school was opened by the Presbyterians with Mr. Rupert as Teacher but as no instructions were received from the Department authorizing this school no entry was made respecting it in the Estimates for 1897-98. As at the time that the Estimates for 1897-98 were submitted no intimation had reached this office to the effect that the Roman Catholics had abandoned their school at Ahousaht. This School was included therein under the heading \"Schools authorized by the Department\" but from which no returns have been received for some years, a grant was however obtained for this school although no grant was made for the Clayoquot Roman Catholic School; the last named School was entered in the Estimates under the heading of \"Schools Authorized by the Department and in Active Operation\" as no grant was obtained for it this grant made to the Roman Catholic School at Ahousaht was transferred to it (the R.C. School at Clayoquot) per Departmental letter dated 2nd March 1897. I may add that there is a Roman Catholic School at Ahousaht which is authorized but not open and there is a Presbyterian School there which is opened but not authorized. No entry is made for a money grant respecting the R.C. School at Ahousaht in the Estimates for 1898-99.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent 1895\nOTTAWA, 16th March, 1896.\n\nRev: Sir,\n\nReferring to the letter to you from this Department of the 7th ultimo in which you were informed that Indian Superintendent for British Columbia would be asked for information in regard to the grant provided for the Roman Catholic School at Ahousaht, I beg to say that a letter has now been received from the Superintendent in which that gentleman explains that the Roman Catholic Church was the first on the ground with several years' experience, and as such it is desirable to follow the practice of not encouraging one religious denomination on ground already occupied by another religious body, the Department is not disposed to recommend a grant for the salary of a teacher of the Presbyterian school at the point in question.\n\nWith respect to the statement made by the Department in its previous letter to you on this subject that Mr Swartout never was the teacher at Ahousaht, I find that Mr Swartout was to whom you refer as the missionary of your church at Ahousaht, while the gentleman of the same name to whom the Department was referring was teacher of the Ucluelet school in the West Coast Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev. Wm. Moore, D.D.,\nOTTAWA.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary\nOttawa, 17th May, 1901.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. McLean,\n\nWill you please let me have a report upon the different points raised in the letter herewith from the Rev. R.P. MacKay to Dr. Moore.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Sup't General.\n\nac.\n\nLetter from Rev. R.P. MacKay returned to Dr. Moore under cover.\n\nLetter from Dr. Moore, 28th May '01.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 21st May, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the communication from Rev. Dr Mackay, Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, addressed to Rev. Dr Moore of this city, I beg to say\n\n1st. That all payments for schools conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, with the exception of the Regina Industrial school, are made through Rev. Dr Warden D.D., Toronto and that there will be no objection to his being sent an advance in favor of the Crowstand school, should he apply for it.\n\n2nd. The Indian named John Black referred to is apparently carrying on missionary work at Lizard Point and could not well be sent back to his Reserve by the Department. The best thing Dr Mackay could do would be to communicate with the authorities of the Church under whose auspices he is working.\n\n3rd. I do not know the locality called Dodger's Cove, or whether the Presbyterians have a school there or not.\n\n4th. With regard to the establishment of a boarding school in the neighborhood of Rat Portage I beg to say that there is nothing on file to show that the Department has held out any inducements in this direction. A protest, however, was received from\nRev. Father Cahill of the Roman Catholic Boarding school at Rat Portage, approved of by His Grace, the Archbishop of St Boniface, against the establishment of a boarding school by Presbyterians in that neighborhood, aided by the Government.\n\n5th. With reference to the complaint of the missionary at Ahousaht that he is considerably disturbed by the persistent efforts of the Roman Catholics to take away children from his school, I may say that this complaint is too indefinite for the Department to be called upon to take any action. Where different religious denominations enter the same missionary field they must expect difficulties and contentions to arise and they should be prepared to deal with them.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, 23rd May, 1901.\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nDear Dr. Moore,\n\nI beg to return herewith the letter from the Rev. R.T. Hackay, D.D., of Toronto, which you left with me some days ago, and to advise you as follows upon the different subjects therein mentioned.\n\n1.- I may explain that all payments for schools conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church, with the exception of the Regina Industrial School, are made through the Rev. Dr. Warden, D.D., Toronto, and that there would be no objection to his being sent an advance in favour of the Crowstand School should he apply for it.\n\n2.- The Indian named John Black, referred to in the second paragraph of Mr. Hackay's letter, is apparently carrying on missionary work at Lizard Point, and could not well be sent back to his Reserve by the Department. I should think that the proper course, under the circumstances, would be for Dr. Hackay\n\nRev. W. Moore, D.D.,\nOttawa.\nto communicate with the authorities of the church under whose auspices he is working.\n\n3.- With regard to the application for a grant in connection with the Day School at Dodges Cove, I may say that we do not appear to have any information at all on the subject in the Department, and it will be necessary to have further particulars in this regard before a definite reply can be given. However, as the Session is now at an end, it would be too late to make any provision for a grant this year.\n\n4.- There does not appear to be anything on file to show that the Department has held out any inducements with regard to the establishing of a Boarding School in the neighborhood of Rat Portage, although it is quite true that a protest was received from the Roman Catholic Boarding School at that point against the establishment of another school under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church. I do not think that there is any way in which the grant could be made, at all events for the present, but I will be glad to keep Mr. Mackay's representation in mind, should the matter be further considered later on.\n\n5.-\n5.\u2014 With reference to the complaint of the missionary at Anousant, that he is considerably disturbed by the persistent efforts of the Roman Catholics to take away children from his school, I may say that I will be very glad to have this matter carefully looked into, but the complaint in its present form is too indefinite for the Department to be called upon to take any action. Of course, where different religious denominations enter the same missionary field they must expect difficulties and contentions to arise, and they should be prepared to deal with them. But, on the other hand, I can very well understand the annoyance to which Mr. Russell claims he is being put to in this relation. If he will furnish the Department with fuller particulars on the subject, I will be glad to have the matter further looked into.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Supt. General.\nToronto, Nov. 7th, 1901,\n\nTo the Hon. Clifford Sifton,\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sirs\u2014\n\nI am instructed by the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada to make application to the Department of Indian Affairs for the following grants:\n\n1. DAY SCHOOL GRANT FOR DOUGLAS COVE.\n\nIn this Band located in Barclay Sound there are two hundred Indians. Our missionary has labored amongst them for six years, and a Day School was opened in March 1899. There are thirty-two children enrolled and an average attendance of thirteen. The application is for a Day School Grant.\n\n2. BOARDING SCHOOL GRANT FOR THOUGHT.\n\nThere are nearly three hundred Indians in this Band, and there are one hundred and one children under sixteen years of age. A Day School was opened in December 1895. For five years previous no Mission work of any kind had been done in that village. During the last year sixty-eight children received instruction in the school, but fifty-six was the highest number on the role at one time.\n\nThe Day School Grant was given to this School in 1900. It was thought when the Iberni School was built in 1896 capable of accommodating from forty to fifty children, it would afford sufficient accommodation for the Tribes on the Coast. But it is already full, and very few of these are from the Coast tribes. It was found indeed that Iberni is beyond the sphere of the Coast Indians, and that they will not send their children so far.\n\nIt is accordingly deemed necessary in order to keep these children in regular attendance and give them the best possible advantages, that a Boarding School be erected at Thought. With that object in view application is now made for a Boarding School Grant for fifty children.\n\n3. SHOAL LAKE BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nThis is a new school, and the main building is about completed, and has cost us so far $3000.00. There will be added next summer an addition for kitchen &c., the whole being planned to accommodate forty children.\n\nThere are about four hundred and fifty Indians on the South and West of this Lake for which no provision is made.\n\nThis application has been presented to the Hon. Commissioner Laird, and he has notified us that he has placed in the estimates $2160.00 for this school, being the usual boarding school grant for thirty pupils at $72.00 per pupil and $54.00 for purchase of school debt.\n\n4. CROFTON WATER SUPPLY.\n\nThis matter was already before the Department this year. Water has hitherto been drawn from the Assiniboine River from a point about one-half a mile away and up a steep grade. Not only is the labor great, but the quality is at certain seasons not good. There is besides no proper protection against fire.\n\nAccording to request, Mr. Gilmour sent measurements to the Hon. Commissioner Laird. The lateral distance from the river he reports to be eight-hundred yards, and the elevation one hundred and thirty feet.\n\nThe Commissioner thinking that very strong power would be required to raise water such a height, and also that eighty hundred...\nyards of piping would be expensive, deems it better to try and get water by borings. He accordingly informs us that he has placed in the estimates $750.00 for that purpose.\n\nTrusting these applications will receive favorable consideration,\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\nToronto, Jan. 2nd, 1903,\n\nJames A. Smart, Esq.,\nDep't of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.,\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nAs you are aware, the Government grants for Indian Schools in connection with the Presbyterian Church have been paid through our Treasurer, Dr Warden in Toronto. We find that the day school grant for Swan Lake Reserve has been paid directly to the teacher, and did not come through Dr Warden's hands. He also says that he has received no grant for the Ohiaht School B.C.\n\nThe Cecilia Jeffrey School was opened last year, and the grant was to begin on the 1st July...it also, in accordance with the regulations should come to Dr Warden. Would you kindly see that this is attended to?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.P. MacKay\nOttawa, January 5th, 1903.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant with reference to the Day School at Swan River Reserve.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you are perhaps not aware of the fact that I have ceased my connection with the Department of Indian Affairs but I will be pleased to transmit your letter to the new Deputy Superintendent General of that Department, Mr. Frank Pedley, who I have no doubt will deal with the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\n80, Confederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nOTTAWA, 13th January, 1903\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant respecting the payment of grants to Indian schools conducted by the Presbyterian Church, I beg to say that the teacher of the Swan Lake school had given a Power of Attorney for his salary which was only cancelled since the September Quarter payment was made. All future payments to this school will be made to Rev. Dr Warden.\n\nThe first return and requisition for salary received from the Ohiapt school was for September quarter last and the Indian Superintendent asked that the cheque be sent in care of the Indian Agent at Alberni, which was done. He has, however, been advised that requisitions are, hereafter, to be made in favor of Rev. Dr Warden.\n\nThe first return from the Cecilia Jeffrey boarding school was only received on the 9th Dec. last\n\nRev. R.P. Mackay, D.\n\n80 Confederation Life Bldg.\n\nToronto\nand the Cheque was sent to Rev. Dr Warden on the 15th of that month.\n\nTrusting that these explanations will prove satisfactory, I am\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFRANK PEDLEY\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nended\n\nBa\n\nINCREASE.\n\nBy Birth.\n\nVaccinated or not.\n\nSIGN\n\nThat the meeting of the Indians be brought by the next meeting of the Provincial Executive for their approval and\n\nTherefore be it\n\nResolved,\n\nThat the members of the Department of Indian Affairs by the Department of the meeting of the Indians have been present.\n\nTherefore be it\n\nResolved,\n\nThat the members of the Department of Indian Affairs be present at the next meeting of the Provincial Executive for their approval and\nIII.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nI beg to thank you for the large map of the Dominion which came to hand a couple of days ago.\n\nThe statement which on behalf of the Presbyterian Church was to have been lodged with the Minister has not gone forward because we have not yet received from Mr. Blake a copy of his memorandum. He was to let us have this and we were to state our reasons to it or in what respects we differed from it and we thought it better that the particulars as to our work should go forward at the same time. I have written to Mr. Blake about the matter and hope that we shall soon be in a position to lodge the promised statement.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nON INDIAN MISSION SCHOOLS.\n\n-----------------\n\nThe Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church having considered the Memorial re Indian Missions and schools, signed by the Honorable S.H.Blake, and submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs, beg to submit the following considerations:\n\n1. The locality in which a school is situated necessarily affects the outlay for its maintenance. As the schools under the care of the Presbyterian Church are not in any case very far from a railway, the rates for transportation, and the cost of living are less than those that prevail in more remote localities. Yet, the cost of living has generally increased throughout the West.\n\n2. The claims of Foreign Missions conducted by the Presbyterian Church in China, Japan, India, the South Sea and West Indies, are extremely urgent, which fact, along with the rapidly increasing claims of the multitudes of many nationalities pouring into the Western Provinces, impossible for the Presbyterian Church to increase her annual expenditure on the Indian section of her work. Material increase in cost of maintenance in that direction must be met by curtailment of the amount of work done.\n\nThe secularization of the Indian Schools, we regard as a national calamity. There is no expectation of any appreciable denominational advantage from Indians. So far as that is concerned, we would abandon all connection with them. But it is the Indians, more probably, than of any other community, that their chief weakness is on the moral side of nature. Intellectually, they can compare\nexperience has taught that the brightest, and most hopeful of them readily fall before the temptations which they meet when entering upon the struggle for self support. In order to fortify and equip them for such conflict, religious instruction is, we believe, an indispensable necessity.\n\nThe earnest desire of the Government to fulfill the pledges given to Indians by treaty, as to education and otherwise, the Presbyterian Church appreciates, and is still prepared as in the past, to co-operate, not only in providing the best available educational staff, but also in sharing in the expenses. How far ecclesiastical control and religious instruction could be practicable if all the expenses were borne by the Department, would have to be determined by the Department. Yet such control, especially as to the selection of teachers, is indispensable if the training is to be such as we think it ought to be. It is not possible too strongly to emphasize the thought that all agents that have to do with the Indians, whether in the school, or upon the farm, should be persons of clean lives and moral purpose, who feel that a sacred trust has been committed to them. We are persuaded that much loss has come to the Indians, to the country, through want of carefulness in that respect.\n\nIt seems to be universally agreed that the Indians be brought as quickly as possible to self support by the cultivation of the land. That being accepted, the administration of the Reserves and the Educational policy should be made to converge to that end.\n\nThe policy the Department has already adopted regarding the Reserves and keeping before each young Indian's objective, a homestead he can call his own, seems so important, and that for reasons so manifest as need no specification. The educational policy should therefore\nso adjusted as most quickly and effectively to attain this object.\n\n7. The educational system should, we think, centre around the Boarding School as best fitted to accomplish this end, and for the following reasons:\n\n(I) They can be located sufficiently far away from the Reserves to avoid too frequent intercourse with the former life, and yet not so far as to make it impossible for the parents to see their children at intervals.\n\n(2) Sufficient instruction can be given in farming and domestic duties to enable the young people to start on their own farms with such appliances as they are likely to command.\n\n(3) This can be more economically done in the Boarding School, than with the more expensive equipment of the Industrial School, and, at that stage of the Indian's development, be more effective.\n\n(4) The Boarding Schools reach a larger percentage of the children than the Industrial Schools have ever done or were intended to do. Instead of a select few, the policy should be that every child enjoy a training sufficient to self support, and this can be secured because of the location without hardship to either parents or children.\n\n(5) The larger the school, the more institutional the less homelike it becomes, and the personal influence correspondingly decreased to the disadvantage of the child.\n\n8. In order to enable the Boarding Schools to do this efficiently, it would be necessary to connect a sufficient amount of agricultural land with each school, to make industrial training possible, and also to adjust the per capita grants to the requirements of this curriculum of training. It is believed that this can be done more economically and to better purpose being done by the Industrial Schools.\n4.\n\nIf this policy were adopted, the usefulness of the Industrial Schools would be practically gone. If not abolished, they could be greatly reduced in numbers. The few Indian youths of special gifts requiring a higher education than the Boarding School could give, could be provided for in existing institutions, or if Industrial Schools should still be deemed necessary, a very small number would suffice.\n\n10.\n\nThere may be certain localities in which the Day School is not the only possible provision, and in such case should be continued, but in every case should be taught by teachers capable of appreciating the importance of moral and spiritual development.\n\nWhilst Churches may, and sometimes do err in their appointments, yet on the whole, we believe the highest interests of the children would be better conserved if such appointments continue to be in the church's hands.\n\nII.\n\nIf all the Reserves were surveyed into Homesteads, it would be possible to establish and encourage the closest connection between the school and the land, and excite in the mind of every child the ambition to have a home of his own.\n\n-------------------\n\nR. B. Macdonald\nTO THE DEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS:\n\nI have been requested to give a summary of the educational work done by the Presbyterian Church amongst the Indians of Canada. I am not perfectly sure as to the number of pupils in attendance, and so give approximate figures, the reports for the past year not having yet come to hand.\n\nThe amounts paid by the Government are taken from the Treasury Books, and the amounts credited to the church are the estimates for the same year. The expenditures would slightly differ from the estimates but almost always in the way of increase. For practical purposes they are sufficiently accurate. This statement does not of course include expenditures at points where there is no educational work.\n\nI accordingly submit the following:\n\nI. INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL:\n   REGINA: Principal, Mr R.B. Heron; pupils 70.\n   Government $7268.56.\n   Church Occasional grants in aid.\n\nII. BOARDING SCHOOLS:\n   (1) CECILIA JEFFREY SCHOOL: This is situated on the West Coast of the Lake-of-the-Woods.

The Memorandum presented by Honorable S.H. Blake represented the attitude of the Episcopal Church, and I was accordingly instructed to prepare this.\n\nI also enclose a statement of Industrial, Boarding and Day Schools controlled by the Presbyterian Church, giving amounts contributed to each by the Department and by the Church. I hope this is what was wanted.\n\nI was sorry not to be present when the interview took place.\n\nTrusting the Department will find it possible to take action during the session.\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, May 1, 1906.\n\nRev.

A. E. Armstrong,\nAssistant Secretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nHill Hills Boarding School\nMay 12, 1908.\n\nFrank Reddy, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOntario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIndirectly it has come to my knowledge that the joint committee representing the Anglican, Methodist, and Presbyterian churches have presented a new Indian educational system to the government which is being favorably received and that the intention is to act upon it in the near future.\n\nAs I am one of the workers in our schools and deeply interested in the advancement of the Indians, it may not be considered presumptuous on my part to ask for information regarding this new system and also if any steps will be taken without first giving the missionaries an opportunity to express themselves.\n\nI understand it at present the intention is to close industrial and boarding schools and establish day schools on all the reserves.\n\nIf this is so\u2014and I can speak from experience\u2014I am firmly convinced that any such system, at the present stage of Indian civilization, will not be a success. No new system, it has been under trial for years and the experience of the past has shown the Indians in our western provinces to be...\nwandering and scattered, admits of anything like regular attendance at school on the part of their children.\n\nI taught for three years in a day school on the Mietanac Reserve, and probably under no favorable circumstances so will be found in most reserves. The school did its work and had its influence over the children and the parents but the uplifting effects were very much less comparatively speaking, to what it has been here in the boarding school.\n\nIn the first place the home life was unutilized and worse, although they were a Christian people and the children were daily in this environment, the attendance was irregular and not punctual and on bad days in order to secure anything like progress I had to walk up the road two miles in the forenoon (all the children happen to be living along the same road) go into a house and hear and set lessons. In the afternoon return, correct exercises of the morning, hear and set fresh lessons. The children could not come to school on bad days and had to go to them. Finally to secure anything like a satisfactory attendance, we took the children into our own home from Monday to Friday. This plan is still adopted there.\n\nThis is an instance I believe effective in a day school.\n\nAdvantages changes in our educational system could be made but before doing so it would be fair to give those who are on the field an opportunity to discuss such changes, as they are the ones who should know where the difficulties lie.\n\nI would suggest a conference of the Indian teachers, agents and inspectors.\nand have this question thoroughly discussed and gone into and any changes that are made, let them be on the basis of past experience.\n\nMay I ask if any change going to be made, and are those in the field going to have an opportunity to express themselves.\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nBalcarres,\nSask.\nOttawa, May 22nd., 1906.\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of May 12th, I have to say that although changes in the present system of Indian education are now under discussion, there has been no intention to make any very drastic or sudden alterations. I observe that you say: \"Advantageous changes in our educational system could be made but before doing so it would only be fair to give those who are on the field an opportunity to discuss such changes, as they are the ones who should know where the difficulties lie.\" I shall be glad to receive your full views on this subject at an early date. Your suggestion as to a conference between Indian teachers, agents, and inspectors has been noted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nMiss Kate Gillaspie,\nPile Hills Boarding School,\nBalcarres, Sask.\nTo The Hon. Frank Oliver  \nMinister Of The Interior  \nOttawa.\n\nSir:-\n\nWe the undersigned beg respectfully to submit the following for your consideration:-\n\nWhereas:-\n\nHaving learned from different sources; and lately from the columns of the daily press, that the system of education, now in force, for the training of the Indian youth of the western Provinces does not seem to be satisfactory to the Department of Indian Affairs and:-\n\nWhereas:-\n\nA change in the said system, and also in the methods of dealing with the Indian Problem is under consideration by the Department Of Indian Affairs:-\n\nTherefore:-\n\nWe respectfully wish to say:-\n\nFirst:-\n\nWe are in full sympathy with the Department Of Indian Affairs in wishing to secure the best possible results in dealing with the Indian Problem:-\n\nSecond:-\n\nWe do not think the best results are being obtained under the present system:-\n\nThird:-\n\nWe hereby make request that before any change be made in the present policy of dealing with the Indian Problem that:-\n\n(over)\n(a) A Conference be arranged between representatives of the Department Of Indian Affairs and those actually engaged in the educational and missionary work among the Indians.\n\n(b) If possible, you arrange to attend, in person, such a conference.\n\n(c) We beg further to say that:\n\nThe foregoing is drawn up and sent with no spirit of fault-finding; and all is respectfully submitted.\n\nSigned:\u2014\n\nOn behalf of The Association Of Indian Workers,\n\nPresident\u2014Principal Birtle School\n\nVice-Pres.\u2014Principal Regina School.\n\nSec.

McLaren and Hoven as officers of the Presbyterian Association of Indian Workers; and in reply I have to say that the Department would be glad to receive from you, jointly or severally, a full statement of your views on the question of Indian education. It is thought that a better result would follow the consideration of such a statement than in dealing with the miscellaneous views which might be expressed at such a Conference as you suggest. However, it seems important that the views of those who have given thought to this subject should be considered and it is hoped that you will be able to submit them at an early date so far as your Association is concerned. It is thought advisable to request you to submit this statement through the Rev. Dr. R. P. McKay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nV. A. Hendry, Esq., M.B.A.,\nPrincipal Portage la Prairie School,\nPortage la Prairie, Man.\nOttawa, March 8th., 1906.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to send you herewith copy of a document received by the Department. A reply is being addressed to Mr. W. A. Randly, requesting that a full presentation of the views of the Association, either jointly or severally, should be transmitted to the Department through your hands.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McElroy\n\nSecretary.\n\nRev. R. P. McElroy, D.D.,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church,\nTORONTO.\nRESOLUTION of the INDIAN WORKERS ASSOCIATION\nof\nPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH for SASK. AND MAN., 343770\n\nSCHOOLS.\n\nThe goal of our system of Indian education should be the compulsory education of all Indian children between six and fifteen years of age in public schools, situated upon the reserves, or in school districts adjacent to them. This aim should be kept before pupils and graduates, so that a spirit and a mode of life favorable to the early attainment of such a system, may be cultivated. At present, apart from compulsory attendance, even the most advanced and sedentary bands give but an indifferent support to the day schools, even when noon-day meals, shelter and food for the school days of each week, clothing, all features of the residential schools, have been provided. A semi-boarding school having these latter features, properly equipped and manned, would be the most servicable upon the larger reserves of the advanced type, more particularly if the Indians are sedentary, the children have far to walk, and no residential schools near. On small reserves with a small school population, if the children do not attend regularly a simple day school, the school should be closed and the children sent to nearest residential school until such times as compulsory attendance at a public school upon or adjacent to the reserve is feasible. At present, apart from compulsory attendance, no day school, no matter what its type, can reach all the Indians upon a reserve, or even the majority, unless the teacher be one of exceptional gifts for Indian work.\n\nWhere boarding schools are already well established, or where improved day schools are not feasible, or where there are a number of small reserves that can be grouped for school purposes, and yet have none of the reserves more than a few hours drive from the school, we would advise the erection of residential schools properly equipped and efficiently manned, where the industries adapted to the life of Indians might be taught to the boys, and household science, sewing,\nand home nursing to the girls. Temperance, hygiene, sanitation, the care of the young and of the sick, should be on the curriculum of every school. Lantern slides should be used as much as possible since the sense of sight is highly developed in the Indian race. These residential schools should not be too large. Smaller schools with the home advantages do more efficient work especially in moral training. Boys and girls mingle freely and naturally under careful supervision. Such schools are more efficient than either the large residential school with its institutional government, its rigid separation of the sexes, its atmosphere of suspicion on the part of teachers, or the day school with half grown girls and boys, even upon nominally christian reserves are imbued with immoral ideals regarding sexual relations, that are a menace to their growing up to be pure minded men and women. Such boys and girls filled with Indian ideals are always the most difficult to control and instruct. Better have more residential schools with an attendance of twenty five then a few large institutions. Unless the moral training of the Indian children is efficient, they can never become good citizens of Canada. In this connection, it would be well to have rigid regulations made as to the amusements permitted at each school. Nothing that encourages the survival of previous Indian customs, the excessive desire of sports, or association with the evilly disposed sporting white population should be permitted.\n\nFurther, no Indian should be forced in any way to send his child to a school where his own religious faith is not taught, and in any reconstruction of policy, no reserves now served by schools of the same religious teaching should be so left by the closing of such schools, that they would be compelled to send their pupils to the nearer schools of an antagonistic faith, or to schools of their own faith far removed from such reserves. Such, for example, would be the position of Muscowpetung, Piapot, Pasqua and Hurrican Hill reserves should Regina Industrial School be closed. To go to Fil\nHills or Round Lake Boarding schools the Protestants would have to pass the Roman Catholic schools at Qu'Appelle and Crooked Lake. It is not just to place large bands of Indians so that the choice of a school is between their natural desire to have their children near home, on the one hand, and the wish to have them reared in their own faith, on the other. In the event of Regina Industrial being closed, (the Association believe all Industrial schools or none should be closed irrespective of creed,) we would recommend the following plan to meet the needs of the reserves connected with our Association. Improved day schools for Piapot and associated reserves also for Moose Mountain and Mistawasis reserves. Day schools with compulsory attendance at Swan Lake, Hurrican Hills, and Sioux Wapaston. Pipestone can be served either by the erection of an Anglican Boarding School at Oak River reserve, or by having the children attend the white public schools situated on one corner of the reserve or by attendance at Birtle Board school. The Portage Boarding School should be moved to the West of the town and given a farm so that it may minister more efficiently to the Indians on Long Plain, Indian Garden, Swan Lake reserves and to the Portage Sioux Band. Crowstand, Birtle, Round Lake, and Cecilia Jeffrey Boarding schools can minister to their present constituencies. The least needed school is at Okanase.\n\nAttendance at all day schools should be compulsory, but if parents so request in writing, their children should be freed from religious but not from ethical instruction. Habitual truancy or irregular attendance should be punished by transmission of the delinquents to the nearest residential school favored by the parents. Instructions to agents in this regard should be strictly enforced. Where no day schools exist pressure should be brought upon Indians to send their children to the nearest residential school they favour. This might be done effectively by funding the annuity money of all healthy children of school age who are not sent to school and by giving the parents\nthe annuity money of all pupils sent to school. This is the reverse of the present policy, which has kept many a child out of school.\n\nThe age of admission in day schools should be seven as in the Provincial public schools. Children transmitted from day schools should be twelve years of age. Those from reserves where there is no school should be ten years of age. Children under that age should be admitted only when it is in their interest. Children who have never gone to school or who come from inefficient day schools, make very poor English scholars and are more difficult to train in every way, and more particularly morally, if they are over twelve years of age. Medical examination of new pupils and the medical supervision of all schools should be most rigid. Some provision should be made to meet the schools needs of diseased and delicate children rejected by medical inspectors.\n\nThe midsummer vacation should be extended and children allowed one month at home and two months free from the class room work, namely the months of July and August. Close confinement in hot weather is most injurious to pupils and teachers alike. The children can be better employed about the farm and garden during the month of August and be allowed the month of July at their homes. Holidays at Christmas should be discouraged so long as Indians reside in the present style of houses. No absent leave should be granted except for definite and essential causes. In this connection it is well to encourage the older boys to begin operations on their farms the two summers previous to graduation. This plan has been successfully tried at three of our schools. It is a gradual break between school and reserve or colony life. One or two weeks freedom from class room work in the spring time when an Indian's vitality is low would promote greatly the health of the pupil.\n\nPermanency of efficient staffs should be aimed at if the confidence of the Indian is to be secured and good work done. The qualifications of the instructors in the various departments should be\nclearly defined and graded. Salaries necessary to procure and retain such instructors should be paid. The inspection of each department of every school should be thorough, and each instructor should be given a written statement of the inspectors report as to the condition of his department. Inefficient workers who refuse to improve should be promptly discharged. It might be well to use entirely, the Provincial text books and have the Provincial public school inspector exercise oversight of the class room work in Indian Schools in whose district, they may be situated. This would keep the Indian School teachers in touch with the public school system into which they are to ultimately emerge.\n\nThe per capita grants for maintenance should provide for full expense of maintaining the schools, apart from salaries. The rapid rise in the cost of living and labor makes the present grants utterly inadequate to meet the demands made upon it. The salaries of class room teachers should be placed upon a par with those of Provincial public school teachers so that particularly in day schools the instruction in English studies may be efficient instead of meagre, as at present. We urge that Government Grants be sent direct from the Department at Ottawa to the different schools and that the Church Officials be notified of the amount sent to each school. Such a course would put us in possession of our Grant money some three weeks earlier.\n\nAll school buildings at present in use and to be used should be thoroughly overhauled so that good ventilation, light and heat may be provided. All new buildings should be built upon models provided by the Department. Further, the most sanitary methods of maintaining a school clean and healthful should be explained to and demanded from those in charge of every school. Residential quarters, either in the school building or adjacent, should be provided in every Boarding School for a Principal who is a married man. The best interests of\nof our schools, have at times been sacrificed since there was no accommodation for a Principal unless he was a single man or a man without a family. Isolation dormitories, with lavatories and wash rooms adjacent, should be provided in every residential school, either in the building or on an associated agency or in a school hospital. Recreation rooms for boys and girls and a gymnasium should be provided in every residential school, and in every improved day school. Care in the selection of sites should be exercised so that good water and drainage are assured. Lavatories and bath rooms for pupils and staff, and proper fire protection also the best possible heating system should be installed in every school. All schools should be fully equipped and than be expected apart from any special recommendations of the inspector to maintain themselves out of the per capita grant.\n\nRESERVES,\n\nIt is highly desirable that everything possible be done to safeguard and encourage the graduates of all our schools. The most effective method in view seems to be the Colony system. This system tends to put pupils on their own responsibility at the same time they they are under the guiding restraint of a Government Official and are protected from the parasitic habits of their worthless friends. These Colonies should be situated to meet the needs of all our school graduates and as such graduates show ability to manage their own affairs their privileges should be enlarged. Loans in the way of seed, implements, stock and buildings should be given to them, but strictly on the understanding that all such loans must be repaid at the date agreed upon. Provision should be made to compel such repayment or cancel their rights as settlers in the Colony.\n\nThe reserve Indians should be encouraged to develop their native industries such as tanning, moccasin making, and bead work since such articles, if well made, can always find a ready market.\n\nA good farm instructor on each reserve is very advisable.\nHe can supervise the general farm work and give instruction in the use of tools so the Indians can make any necessary repairs around the farm. If such instructor has ability to lead and manage the Indians he will be of great service but if he lacks such ability his salary is wasted money.\n\nDances conducted in the old Indian fashion are found to be very demoralizing to the Indian race. They are filled with old pagan ideas and tend to unfit the Indian for the more modern duties of life. They crowd in great numbers, in very small houses poorly ventilated, and dance until morning. When overheated they go out into the cold and often the result is that Tuberculosis is hastened or developed.\n\nThe question of marriage and divorce is one of the greatest evils standing in the way of their moral betterment. At present on the majority of reserves the people live together and separate at will, cases being known of young women not over thirty years, having six different husbands. If they were compelled to register their agreement to live together as husband and wife before an agent and such an agreement to be as binding as in our own marriages we think that the difficulty would be greatly improved. Bigamy would then be with them a punishable crime and they would be subject to our criminal code. Some means, however, should be provided for honorable divorce in particular cases.\n\nWe believe that suitable hospitals on each reserve or where a number of small reserves are situated close together one hospital might serve them all. These need not be large or expensive buildings and as far as possible tents should be used for patients. A building would be required for the nurse and assistants, with living rooms, kitchen, small dispensary and store rooms. In some cases the hospital might be located near the school and the principal of the school be in charge, but accounts kept separately. In such cases the school girls might act as assistants to the nurse, and in this way receive valuable\ninstruction in the care of the sick. Where the institution is situated on the reserve, the nursing staff should be expected to instruct the Indian women in the care of their infants and in the selection and preparation of suitable foods for them. The appalling death rate in the Indian race is from among the infants.\n\nWe suggest that better ventilation of Indian homes should in every way possible be encouraged. These could be improved if there were some regulation as to the size and number of rooms in a house. If a few model cottages were built on some of the reserves it would encourage them along this line. The agents should be furnished with plans of such cottages that Indians buildings might have something to guide them in their work.\n\nThe practice of conjuring over the sick should be prohibited by law since many cases of death are caused by such practices.\n\nWe believe that the question of education and uplifting the Indians on the reserves is not so hopeless as is generally believed. Further, work accomplished among these people is permanent and greater effort should be made to help them. The women on the reserves need instruction in the selection and preparation of foods, care of their children, and the ventilation and sanitary care of their homes. The use of lantern slides, on the reserves, might be made a very useful mode of educating the older people along the lines of temperance, sanitation, and diseases if such views were accompanied by a talk in simple language. By means of such slides their minds are opened to the larger and newer things and they begin to think.\n\nTO BE APPENDED TO THIS RESOLUTION IS THE ASSOCIATION'S REPORT TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY'S MORAL AND SOCIAL REFORM COMMITTEE WHICH DEALS FULLY WITH DRINKING, GAMBLING AND ETC.,\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nI received the enclosed document from the Western Indian Workers' Association in answer to questions that were sent by the Department and which you desired to have answered through our Committee. As there has been delay in receiving it I send it immediately and have held a copy of it to submit to our Committee when they meet. In the meantime as the session is far advanced and I earnestly hoping that action will be taken soon by the Department I send this without delay. If the Committee has any remarks to make they will be sent later.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM/MEA.\nOttawa, June 3rd., 1909.\n\nDear Dr. MacKay:\u2014\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of May 19th with enclosure from the Western Indian Workers Association. The Department is waiting to take action upon the report of the Advisory Board, and the various recommendations which have arisen ancillary to that report are receiving due attention, but it has not yet been found possible to arrive at a decision.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nTORONTO.\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nYour of June 10th received informing me that the Department has postponed action in dealing with the Indian problem because of the lack of unanimity of feeling amongst the churches interested. Personally I regret this postponement. If the Department refuses to take action until there is unanimity, then I expect it will be delayed beyond your day or mine. The Memorial received from the Association of Missionaries as to the needs of the Pasquah and the neighboring reserves, as well as of the Hurricane Hills Reserve, expresses their views and is a contribution to the budget of information in the possession of the Department, but that the Department should turn aside in its purpose because of these views with which it may not agree is unexpected and disappointing. To us it is more than disappointing, it is embarrassing. It has been freely circulated in the west that the Regina School is to closed. The Indians have heard it and I may say that our Roman Catholic friends have taken pains to give it circulation. The result is manifest. The difficulty of getting pupils is greatly increased and it will be next to impossible to get any man to undertake the responsibilities of the Principalship under these circumstances.\n\nHowever, we have but to bow to your decision, however ungraceful the bow may be. I recognize the difficulties with\nMr. Fedley\n\nwhich the problem is beset, but feel assured that a firm hand and a decisive action would be in the interests of the Indians as well as of the Department.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRPM.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay\nOttawa, June 25th., 1908.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 14th instant I beg to say that while postponement is regrettable it is hoped that some advance may be made before long. At least the improvements which have been touched upon in the correspondence between the Advisory Board and the Department may be to some extent carried out.\n\nWith reference to the situation at Regina, it is unfortunate that any reports which may have been circulated as to the proposed changes have made it difficult to obtain pupils for the School. If the Western Committee in the best interests of the work of your Church in the Qu'Appelle district could decide and make representations to the Department that the erection of a small Boarding School on Pasquah's Reserve, or in that vicinity, which pupils could be drafted from the neighboring reserves, would serve as well as the Regina School in Saskatchewan, the suggestion would be carefully considered. After the support of such a School was provided for there would remain a considerable surplus from funds formerly applied to the Regina School which could be used on Presbyterian Schools elsewhere.\n\nI would be glad if you would give these matters further consideration.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. [signature]\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto.\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy Dear Sir:\n\nI have pleasure in reporting that the Western Committee have expressed their approval of the proposal to close Regina School and build a Boarding School on the Pasquah Reserve. Their resolution is as follows:\n\n\"The Committee agree that if a suitable Boarding School is provided at a convenient point on the Pasquah, Muscowpetung and Piasapot Reserves, it will cordially acquiesce in the proposal to close the Regina Industrial School, and that, if it be resolved to close the Regina School, only such further expenditures be made as may be deemed absolutely necessary to make the building habitable during the period that may elapse before it is closed.\"\n\nDr. Farquharson adds, \"With a Boarding School at Pasquah, an improved Day School at Hurricane Hills, Moose Mountain and Mistawasis, our work will be well equipped.\"\n\nMay I suggest certain points that arise in this connection, and that will require consideration?\n\n1. It will, I presume be necessary to spend one more winter at least in Regina, and if so, some expenditure will be necessary. Mr. Heron, who approves of the proposal to close Regina, says that three or four hundred Dollars, expended before the winter sets in, might suffice, but more, if continued through the coming summer.\n\n2. Dr. Farquharson says that in transferring Regina pupils to other schools, the Department may have difficulty. In some instances in similar circumstances, the parents insisted on their children going back to the Reserves. That is a point still some distance in the future, and will be, no doubt, in mind when the time comes.\n\n3. The Western Committee evidently considered, although they took no formal action, what might be the proper application of funds saved by the closing of Regina. Their judgment seems to be that the Department might spend the value of the Regina property in building schools, both improved Day Schools and Boarding Schools, and that they might distribute the stock and equipment at Regina among the Boarding Schools. If this were done, and then the $14,000 paid annually for the maintenance of Regina were applied to the maintenance of the other schools, it would put our work in good condition. This, I pass on as their judgment, and for your consideration.\n\n4. I suppose expedition is desirable. The transition stage is\nalways demoralising. Would it be possible for the Department to take immediate action and indicate how soon it might be possible to begin the increased grant for the Boarding Schools? I think that if some such definite promise, say July 1910 or January 1911, were given, it would elicit a measure of cooperation and enthusiasm that would be helpful.\n\nThese suggestions, I submit for what they are worth, and in the hope that real progress may be made in Indian education, satisfactory to you and to us.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM-EMS.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nThe Western Committee of the Presbyterian Church having expressed their approval of the proposal to close the Regina Industrial School, there should be no obstacle in the way of carrying out the proposed change in accordance with our letter to the Advisory Board of March 26th. It will be remembered that opportunity was to be given for those locally interested to express themselves upon that proposal. Those immediately interested in the Regina School have now acquiesced.\n\nIt is stipulated that the Department should consent to the erection of a Presbyterian Boarding School on Pasquah's Reserve. I do not think such a course would be a wise one. The pupils from Pasquah's, Piapot's and Muscowpetung's Reserves at the Regina School amount to only 12 and it would hardly be feasible to conduct a Boarding School successfully with that number of pupils. Within a reasonable distance of this Reserve the File Hills Boarding School is located which is in every way an effective school. The Department has consented to spend $4000.00 on improvements to the buildings, and with an increased expenditure in this direction the File Hills School could be made large\nenough to accommodate all the pupils which could be collected from\nthe other Reserves, so I would propose to put a $7000.00\naddition to the File Hills School; $4000.00 of which has already been\nvoted, and to increase the pupilage at that school.\n\nAs our letter of March 26th contemplated re-distributing the\namounts saved by the closing of any large denominational schools\namongst the smaller Boarding and Day Schools (with an increase in\nper capita grant to the former) I would recommend that the following\ndivision of funds, which is in the main the same as given in the\nabove-quoted letter, be carried out:-\n\nIn lieu of Regina Industrial School - $14,000.00.\n\nIncrease per capita grants from $72 to $100 at following schools:-\n\n| School          | Pupils | Grant |\n|-----------------|--------|-------|\n| Cecilia Jeffrey | 30     | $840.00 |\n| Birtle          | 50     | $1400.00 |\n| Crowstand       | 50     | $1400.00 |\n| Round Lake      | 40     | $1120.00 |\n| File Hills      | 25     | $700.00 |\n| Portage la Prairie | 25   | $700.00 |\n\n$6,160.00\n\nIncrease in pupilage 15 at File Hills and 10\nat Cecilia Jeffrey and 5 at Portage la Prairie, 3,000.00\n\nBalance for expenditure on improved type\nof Day Schools, 4,840.00\n\n$14,000.00\n\nChief Accountant.\nOttawa, 7th December, 1908.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 24th of August last I beg to say that the proposition to close the Regina Industrial School and redistribute the amount thus saved between the Boarding and Day Schools in which your Church is interested has been considered favorably. It would be proposed with your concurrence to close the Regina School so that the change could take effect on the 1st of April next. On that date the per capita grants would be readjusted on the following scale:\n\nIn lieu of Regina Industrial School --- $14,000.00\n\nIncrease per capita grants from $72 to $100 at following schools:\n\n| School            | Pupils | Grant |\n|-------------------|--------|-------|\n| Cecilia Jeffrey   | 30     | $840. |\n| Bissett           | 50     | $1400.|\n| Crowstand         | 50     | $1400.|\n| Round Lake        | 40     | $1120.|\n| File Hills        | 25     | $700. |\n| Portage la Prairie| 25     | $700. |\n\nIncrease in pupilage 15 at File Hills and 10 at Cecilia Jeffrey and 5 at Portage la Prairie 5,000.00\n\nBalance for expenditure on improved type of Day Schools 4,840.00\n\n$14,000.00\n\nThe only part of the rearrangement which would seem to require a little further consideration is the establishment of a Boarding School at Pasquah's Reserve, or in that vicinity. It seems to the Department that as only about 12 pupils are recruited from that district to the Qu'Appelle School, it would be better to enlarge and strengthen\n\nRev. R.P. McKay, D.D.,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\nstrengthen the File Hills School and provide for housing whatever pupils may be drafted from the vicinity of Pasquah's Reserve to this school. To meet this need the Department would feel inclined to spend a sufficient amount to provide accommodation at the File Hills, and I should be glad if you would further discuss this point with the Western Committee of your Church. The condition of the present building at File Hills should be carefully looked into as it might be considered a more advantageous scheme to erect an entirely new building designed specially for the work, giving full weight to the experience which has been gained during the past in the matter of Indian education.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have received today from Dr. Farquharson the action of the Winnipeg Synodical Committee, which I beg to report:\n\n1. They approve of the closing of Regina School as proposed. Of course the date of closing can be adjusted to suit the conditions, as already indicated by your Department.\n\n2. The Committee are desirous of meeting the wishes of the Department as to making File Hills a centre for that whole region instead of building on the Pasqua Reserve. Yet they have misgivings on that point. They have agreed, however, to gather definite information and report within a month.\n\n3. They recommend that a Boys' colony be started on Lizard Point Reserve, where there are fully 25 graduates of schools nearly all married in the Agency, only five or six of whom are farming successfully. They feel that these boys need to be separated from the elder pagans and guided by a strong and sympathetic hand.\n\n4. They say that Mr. Bailey, who is at present missionary on the Lizard Point Reserve, is proving himself to be the kind of man needed to control a colony. He got the Indians to put up 800 tons of hay last season and to sell a good deal besides. He also got the Indians to go out harvesting and threshing so that over $2000.00 was brought back in wages, and that he so controls that the money is wisely expended. Mr. Bailey is himself a practical farmer and is besides a good stock man, having a knowledge of veterinary and medical science, obtained on an Irish farm and in Edinburgh Medical College. I should think that when such a man turns up, which is rare, he should be utilized.\n\nThe Committee think that there should be some co-operation between the school and the colony, so that pupils leaving the school could be placed on probation under strict discipline for a few years.\n\nThis seems to be a practical scheme, and if successfully applied would work a revolution not only on that Reserve, but throughout that whole agency. It will, I am sure, command the earnest consideration of the Department.\n\nThese points I have pleasure in submitting at the request of the Synodical Committee, and wish you a very Happy Christmas.\n\nRPM.\n\nI am, Yours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, Janv 12th., 1910.\n\nDear Dr. McKay,\n\nIn reply to your letter of Dec. 22nd, the contents of which have been noted, I have to say that no doubt all details in connection with the closing of the Regina School can be arranged satisfactorily. The Department will at once consider the suggestion of establishing a colony on the Lizard Point Reserve (Way-waysee-oappo's).\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nFrank Redley\n\nRev. R. P. Mackay, D.D.,\nSecretary Foreign Mission Committee,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nTORONTO.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Sutherland,\n\nIn pursuance of the arrangement with the Presbyterian Church the grant for the following Boarding Schools and number of pupils may be paid from the 1st of April at $100.00 per capita instead of $72.00 and the payment continues at that rate:\n\n- Cecilia Jeffrey, 30 pupils,\n- Birtle, 50 pupils,\n- Crowstand, 50 pupils,\n- Round Lake, 40 pupils,\n- File Hills, 25 pupils,\n- Portage la Prairie, 30 pupils.\n\nAn increase of 15 pupils is allowed at File Hills, 10 at Cecilia Jeffrey and 5 at Portage la Prairie.\n\nChief Accountant.\nNorth Bay, Sept. 21st, 1910.\n\n371986\n\nFrank E.

Frank Oliver,\nSupt Genl of Indian Affairs, Ottawa Ont--\n\nWill be glad to meet you Ottawa November eighth to discuss indian affairs.\n\nHamilton Cassels\nJanuary 17th, 1911\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nThere is one point in connection with the new regulation upon which I am not clear. Is it the desire of the Department that temporary appointments, made in order to supply emergencies, must be approved by the Department? Sometimes, through sickness or other causes, changes need to be made suddenly, and it is important that there should be action with as little delay as possible. Otherwise, I can quite see the desirability of having the Department kept fully in touch with whatever is being done, and their sanction secured.\n\nThe point has arisen in connection with the temporary arrangement made by Dr. MacKay himself with Mr. Horon, during his absence on account of Mrs. MacKay's health. Mrs. MacKay will not, I understand, be able further to take charge of the School and we shall require a Matron as well as a Principal.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM-ES.\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.P. MacKay\nOttawa, January 21, 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant, and in reply I beg to say that whenever practicable even temporary appointments should have the approval of the Department before they are made. It is recognized, however, that in cases of emergency this may not be possible and under such conditions the matter should be submitted to the Department for approval at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. R. P. MacKay, D.D.,\nSecretary,\nForeign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada,\nToronto, Ont.\nHamsack, Sask. Aug. 16th 1911.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYou will find enclosed three resolutions passed at the recent Convention of Presbyterian Indian Mission Workers for Manitoba and Saskatchewan held in Augustine Church, Winnipeg. As Secretary of this Association I shall be pleased to hear at an early date what action the Department proposes taking in regard to the questions dealt with in these resolutions. I am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nW. McWhinney\n\nTo The Ass't Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\nResolved,\n\nThat in view of the new regulations affecting the conduct and control of Indian Boarding Schools by which the Indian Department reserve to itself greater control of these Schools and is to be the judge of the fitness of the staff for their positions and because the present mode of inspection is lacking in thoroughness and justice, we the Presbyterian Indian Mission Workers in Annual Convention assembled, pray the Department of Indian Affairs to see that the inspection of these Schools be placed exclusively in the hands of inspectors specially appointed for that purpose, and that these men be selected from those who by education, training and experience in actual work in such Indian residential Schools have proved themselves qualified for their work.\n\nFurther, we would ask that copies of all reports of Departmental Inspectors, reflecting adversely upon any School or any member of the staff of such School, be sent to the denominational official or board having charge of such School, with a view to giving such School or member of staff the opportunity of explanation or defence, and further that no reports except those received in writing and regularly filed be countenanced by the Department.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Association,\n\nW. McLean-Hinney - Secretary\n\nDated, July 20th, 1911.\n\nAugustine Church,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, August 31st., 1911.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 16th in which you enclosed three Resolutions passed at a recent Convention of Presbyterian Indian Mission Workers, and in which you state that you will be pleased to hear at an early date what action the Department proposes to take in regard to the questions dealt with in the Resolutions, I have to inform you that the Department does not intend to take any action until these are presented through the proper channel. If the Secretary of the Foreign Mission Committee of the Presbyterian Church in Canada decides to present these Resolutions to the Department in their present form they will receive attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. W. McWhinney,\nPrin. Indian Boarding School,\nKamsack, Sask.\nSir,\n\nI beg leave to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of Aug. 21st No. 289032-2 and to say that the Executive of our Association has decided to present the resolutions referred to through the channels which you do viz through the Foreign Mission Secretary of our Church.\n\nI am also directed by the Executive to say that in any case it is the intention of the Association to bring this matter before the Synod of Saskatchewan at its meeting in November next.\n\nI Am,\n\nYours Respectfully,\n\nRev. W. McWhinney\n\nTo The Ass't Deputy and Secretary,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Can.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of the 20th. of September I take it that Dr. MacKay's request applies to such cases as the Birtle School where we have a contract to pay $100.00 per capita but where the Church intends to make such improvements to the buildings as will place them in Class \"A\", entitled to receive a grant of $125.00. It was decided to give the Churches every encouragement and support in improving these buildings and to that end we have increased the per capita grant from the 1st. of April in a good many cases, before the improvements had been made, on the understanding that they would be made. I think this really should apply to all the Presbyterian schools and I propose at an early date to examine Mr. Ogilvy's reports on them and take action. The papers will be submitted to you in due course.\n\nChief Accountant.\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA\n\nSeptember 20, 1911.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nRev. Dr. McKay was here a couple of days ago and he spoke to me about some schools that were being brought up to the standard by the Church and wanted to know if payment of the full per capita grant could be allowed during process of building.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nToronto, October 9th, 1923\n\nMr. Frank Pedley,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Pedley:\n\nAllow me to inform you officially that the administration of mission work amongst the Indians carried on by the Presbyterian Church has been transferred from the care of the Foreign Mission Committee to that of the Board of Home Missions.

I understand there is a classification of Schools upon which the grant depends. I would also be obliged if you would send me a copy of any agreement entered into by the Presbyterian Church regarding the Schools at Alberni, Ahousat and Ucluelet. I am asking for this information as these schools have been placed under the Home Mission Board which I represent in B.C. and if I had full information on these matters I would be in a better position to supervise the work.\n\nI remain Yours Sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev. Geo. A. Wilson, B.A.\nSuperintendent of Home Missions for British Columbia and Yukon\nOttawa, November 21, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 13th instant I beg to say that, as requested, copies of the Indian Act, Regulations relating to the education of Indian Children and Correspondence and Agreement relating to the Maintenance and Management of Indian Boarding Schools have been sent you under separate cover. The Department pays a per capita grant of $100.00 per annum for thirty-five pupils at the Ahousaht Boarding School and of $100.00 for fifty pupils at the Alberni Boarding School and a salary of $400.00 per annum to the teacher of the Ucluelet day school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

On the return of these documents the signature of the Deputy Superintendent General will be affixed and a copy of each will then be sent you.\" etc.\n\nNow these agreements in some way have been mislaid. I am afraid it is a reflection upon our style or filing letters, but they are being asked for, and I am not able to lay my hands upon them. Would it be too much to ask that you get copies struck off at my expense of course? I am sorry to put you to the trouble, but I hope it will not be too great inconvenience, and it means only the expense of stenography.\n\nI trust you are keeping well. I am not often\nin Ottawa now, and consequently not in a position to look in and revive old acquaintances.\n\nIf you can do this at an early date I shall be greatly obliged.\n\nI am,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRPM-JS.\n\n[Signature]\nMarch 4th, 1915.\n\nDear Dr. MacKay,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your favour of the 2nd instant in which you ask that duplicate copies of the agreements between the Presbyterian Church and His Majesty the King, represented by the Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs, regarding the future maintenance and management of the Crowstand, Birtle, Cecilia Jeffrey, Round Lake, Portage la Prairie, Ahousaht, Alberni, and File Hills Boarding School, be made and sent to you.

Scott,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAs you are aware, our contract with the Government on Indian work expires on April 1st. The matter has been for two years now before our Board as to what the arrangements should be in the future for this class of work. We have put a great deal of money, as a Church, into this work, and feel that, under existing conditions, it would be impossible for us, on the same scale, to spend money in these Boarding Schools.\n\nI am enclosing an Extract Minute of the action of our Board with reference to the future of this work, and would like to know what your judgment is on the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nA.S.G.-A.V.\n\n[Signature]\nInasmuch as the Indians are the wards of the Government, and the main concern of the Church is the moral and spiritual welfare of these people, it is the opinion of this Board that the Church should assume in future no responsibility for buildings or farms or equipment, but confine its support to the salaries of workers as hereinafter set forth.\n\nIn carrying out this principle,\n\n(1) No money in future shall be spent on buildings or farms or equipment.\n\n(2) That the upkeep of all such buildings, farms, and equipment, whether owned by the Government or by the Church, be assumed forthwith by the Government.\n\n(3) That as soon as possible all the properties or assets owned by the Church be taken over by the Government on terms mutually satisfactory.\n\n(4) That in order to safeguard the Government from extravagant management, a maximum expense for maintenance may be fixed beyond which the Church will assume responsibility.\n\nRe appointments, salaries, etc.\n\n(1) That all appointees by whomsoever appointed be satisfactory to the other party to the transaction.\n\n(2) That all Principals, Matrons, teachers and farm instructors be appointed by the Church.\n\n(3) That the salaries of Principals, Matrons and teachers in Boarding schools be provided by the Church.\n\n(4) That the salaries of all teachers in day schools, all farm-instructors and of all employees not otherwise provided for, be assumed by the Government.\n\nOn motion of Mr. Turnbull the report was adopted. The Sub-Executive was authorized to make agreement with the Government along the general lines outlined in the finding of the Committee.\nApril 14th, 1916.\n\nDear Dr. Grant,\n\nI have your letter of April 8th, with extract from the minutes of your Board with reference to future Indian work. I shall bring these matters to the attention of the Minister at the earliest possible moment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. S.

Scott, Esq.,\nIndian Department,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nYours of June 27th addressed to Dr. Somerville, has been handed to me. We are glad to learn that the Government has decided to increase the per capita grant to residential Indian schools by the sum of $10.

McLean, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nCanada.\n\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI have yours of July 8th, in which you notify us that the per capita grant for residential Indian schools has been increased to $10.00. We are very glad to get this information. I note that this increased rate is to date from April 1st.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJHE/CMoC.\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nIndian Dept.\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nOn July 8th you wrote us that the Department would allow an increase grant of $10 per capita to date from April 1st. Kindly let us know when we may expect the cheque. I presume that you will add the increase to the quarterly cheques but what about the retroactive grant?\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/EB\nOttawa, September 9, 1919.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference to the payment of the increased grant of $10.00 per capita to the residential schools conducted under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Canada.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this increase in the per capita grant dates from April 1st, last, and, when payment of the grants for the quarter ending June 30th, last, was made, the grant at the increased rate was paid for all schools. Cheques for the amount of the grant due at the increased rate have been sent to the Treasurer of the Presbyterian Church, except in the case of the Alberni Boarding School, as the returns for the June quarter from that school have not yet been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

This will simplify our book-keeping and accounting.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state whether you desire that the cheques in payment of this bonus be sent by our Church Treasurer each quarter or whether the amount of the bonus due be sent to the Principals of the individual schools, under the auspices of your church.\n\nI will be pleased if you will state your wishes in this matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C.

Canon Gould,\n   General Secretary of the Missionary Society.\n\nare unanimously agreed upon the following conclusions, which the joint-deputation craves permission to submit as requisite and urgent requests to the authorities concerned, of the Dominion Government.\nConclusion I:-\n\nThat the present scale of per capita grants, inclusive of the special war bonus of $20.00 allowed for pupils in Indian Residential Schools, be made the permanent scale, and that to meet, in part, the heavy increases in the costs of supplies, equipment and maintenance, a bonus of $20.00 per pupil be added thereto all round.\n\nConclusion II:-\n\nThat since financial deficits in the maintenance of Indian Residential Schools frequently arise in large part from the fact that although the Church is compelled to organize and maintain the schools on the basis of an attendance of the maximum number of pupils for which the schools have accommodation, a lesser number of pupils are actually in attendance,- the Government put into force the Compulsory clause of the revised Indian Act, and secure an attendance of the maximum number of pupils at each and all Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAll of which, on behalf of the joint-deputation, is very respectfully submitted.\n\nS.

The salary of Miss Reid, nurse at Cecilia Jeffrey, has been sent direct to herself.\n\nThe bonus due teachers of the day schools is sent direct to each teacher. This is the course provided by the regulations governing the payment of bonus.\n\nKindly advise if you desire Miss Reid's salary sent direct to you or if you wish any change in the present method of payment of grants and salaries as shown above and your request will receive immediate attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRev.

When I spoke with Dr. Scott, I suggested that hereafter it would be better to have all cheques, intended for workers in the Presbyterian Church, made out in favor of the Treasurer of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, but have the cheques mailed to me. I expect in every instance the cheque will indicate the purpose for which it is issued. There has been some confusion in the past and after conference here, I feel that the plan outlined should work out nicely.

J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\nConfederation Life Building,\nToronto, Ont.\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, Nov. 10, 1923.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI should be pleased if you would recapitulate the needs of the Indian residential schools conducted by the Presbyterian Church. The Estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared, and it is important that the Department has the major needs, in order of their relative importance. This general letter should be supported by a letter for each residential school; the letters concerning the individual schools should go into details relative to the major needs, and should indicate the minor requirements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. H. Edmison, D.D.,\nGeneral Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nPresbyterian Church in Canada,\n434 Confederation Life Bldg.,\nToronto, Ont.\nExtract from Report of R. J. Ross.\n\nI am pretty well convinced that the Indian child must first be taught industry before we can expect him to make a creditable showing in the class room. There is no place better than the kitchen, the laundry or the sewing room, or the farm for this purpose. I understand it is the custom in Indian schools to have the younger children in the class room for a full day and the older ones - both boys and girls - for the half of each day. During the other half-day they are being taught in the other departments of the school.\n\nThe Indian, himself, cannot endure sustained labor and thinks it a hardship that his child should be compelled to work. One Indian father told me recently that he was a H - of a man and a regular slave-driver, because when he came for his boy, he found him in the field with fifteen others weeding sunflowers. If you yield to the natural desire of an Indian parent, to let his child lead an indolent life, there is no hope for the child either in the class room or out of it.\n\nThen we must remember that the white child is fitted at home to be a housekeeper or farmer. From his earliest years he has seen his father and mother toiling, and succeeding in their toil and making a home for themselves and their children. He himself is asked early in life to lend a hand, and is trained in the home just as the Indian child is trained in the Indian Boarding school. If the Indian girl is not trained to be a housekeeper in the boarding school, where will she get her training? She is decidedly at a disadvantage as far as her home is concerned. She sees nothing there that will be of any assistance to her in keeping house in later years. If she follows the custom of her mother, she will put an old quilt up to screen her from the heat of the sun and sleep there; and spend hour after hour in idleness with no thought of making a home for herself or anyone else. She will love her children but will know nothing about clothing them or feeding them or keeping them clean.\n\nIt seems true that the younger Indian have not the high sense of honor that their forefathers had. It may be that this could be accounted for by the fact that the Indian is in a transition stage. I cannot believe that all the religious and moral teaching of the schools will be ineffective.\n\nAs to the class room, our younger children are decidedly bright and receptive. We are putting forth every effort to emphasize the class-room work of the pupils. They attend regularly and discuss their school work while at play and they repeat their memory verses while at work. I am hopeful that with an experienced and capable staff of teachers, good results will be obtained.\nExtracted from the Report of Mrs. Sara Marshall.\n\nThe half-day plan laid down by the Dept. of Indian Affairs, is of course not conducive to rapid strides in book knowledge.\n\nHowever it is only the few in any nationality who climb to the heights in literature, medicine, or law and it is, and will be, the same with Indians - their population being 105,000 any marked success will be noticeable. When I entered Indian work 30 years ago the quarterly returns of school-room work were exactly as they are today. Your highest grade was and is Grade VI. The Presbyterian Church has risen to this and went far over in most schools.\n\nIn our schools populated by what we call white people, parents have no say in choice of teachers but leave it to a stated few to choose. Indian schools are on the same footing.\n\nAs to the present generation having lost a high sense of honor formerly a trait of a trait of the tribe, we have only to take our memories back to early days in time of regime of Cabots, Cartier and etc., noting how far exploiting the Indian went and wonder how they have not lost the trait in striving to follow up \"Civilization.\"\n\nWe are also aware of intermarriages with types of white people and know that in all coming days children bear this burden. As to interpreting Cree - I am told by the Indians, there is very little pure Cree spoken. (I am only referring to Birtle agency, Cote reserve and adjacent reserves).\n\nIn cases where a large amount of land is cultivated, boys may be kept out of class room during the very busy seasons and we all know that around the ages of 14 years, when handling horse and being among the stock, appeals far more to a boy than sitting in a school room with a book written in, to him, a foreign language.\n\nI think the standard of school room work in Catholic schools does not measure up to Protestant schools. I also think compulsory attendance in school room is not carried out in Catholic as in Protestant schools.\n\nThe Government travelling nurse stated to me that in all her travels no schools measure up in every way as Presbyterian Indian schools.\nCompulsory School Attendance.\n\nThere is a point in this paragraph. Our conception of compulsory education is that children must attend a day school and not a residential school. The day school is our ideal in Indian education but we are far from it yet because of reserve conditions and the lack of responsibility among the Indian people. My opinion is that once children enter the residential schools they attend the class-room very regularly unless it is in the large Industrial Schools with nine or ten hundred acres of land.\n\nHolidays, Selection of teachers, Course of Studies.\n\nIn any schools that I have known during my time in Indian work all children who have homes get away for holidays from one month to six weeks each year.\n\nWe have to follow the course of study outlined by the Province in which we work. Our classrooms are inspected by the Provincial Public School Inspectors. (Do you think it would be advisable to have some of the Indian parents on the Manitoba Advisory School Board?) The parents of today graduated twenty-five years ago when the standards are very low compared with the present time. The same holds true in regard to the Indian parents having a voice in the selection of teachers.\n\nIn all the residential schools that I know all the children attend class-room until they are 12 years old and go on the half-day plan from 12 to 18 years. The teachers are Prof. Second Class and have their standard in the class-room to keep up and would object to having children kept out. The Inspector will examine the roll and we must give a good reason for absent children, or it is reported to the Department.\n\nIn 1910, 1911 I was in the service of the Department and inspected 11 Day Schools each year and the work of the residential schools was 100% better. The improved day school was brought in to better these conditions.\n\nLow Standard of Class-Room Work.\n\nI have not found the parents anxious to send their children to school in fact I have found the majority of the parents absolutely indifferent. Regarding the children not being kept regularly in the class-room, I have never heard of this complaint except in connection with some of the very large Industrial Schools and I do not know if there is any truth in it. Indians will bring up anything on earth if they want to complain. The statement \"Ex-Graduates have not enough education to enable them to transact ordinary business - scarcely enough to enable them to write a legible letter.\" To me, this is an extraordinary statement that I would not care to make until I had read all the reports of the Class-room Inspectors. Our Inspector, Mr. Maguire, said our Junior room was the best primary room in his Inspectorate. Half the children are in Grade 3, and very few of them are over 11 years of age.\n\nIt used to be a common thing to send a child to the large school at the age of 15, 16 and even 17 years of age with no English\nCompulsory School Attendance.\n\nThere is a point in this paragraph. Our conception of compulsory education is that children must attend a day school and not a residential school. The day school is our ideal in Indian education but we are far from it yet because of reserve conditions and the lack of responsibility among the Indian people.

Our Inspector, Mr. Maguire, said our Junior room was the best primary room in his Inspectorate. Half the children are in Grade 3, and very few of them are over 11 years of age.\n\nIt used to be a common thing to send a child to the large school at the age of 15, 16 and even 17 years of age with no English\nThe parents sent them because they could not manage them at home. They cannot learn English at that age. I sent two such boys home because it was not just to have them in the senior room and you could not put them in the Junior Room. Many such were pushed into the larger school in the early days because the smaller schools would not have them and if Mr. Heron does not refer to this class of pupils in his statement, I cannot think that he is correct.\n\nThe cure for such a state of affairs is compulsory education. If children are well they should begin their class room work at seven years of age and not at 14 or 16.\n\nIndustrial Education for the Indian.\n\nAfter 25 years in Indian work, and seeing the problem on the reserve and in the schools, in B.C., Alberta, Sask., and Manitoba, it is my opinion, that there is no education that the Indian children need so much as the training they will get \"on the farm, in the garden, laundry, bake-shop and kitchen.\" He may not work in some cases even when taught to work with his hands but he is more likely to do so since it gives one the confidence of accomplishment. A fair elementary education is necessary to transact ordinary business, to read the local newspaper, etc., I would say grade 6 to 8, but the higher education will not help much to solve the reserve problems, and the Indian must stand or fall on his ability to make a living on the reservation. I wish you could spend a month on a few reserves in Manitoba, go into every home, see the houses and equipment, stock, crop, tillage, roads and hear what you think about the necessity of industrial education. When the Indian enters fully into our economic atmosphere and can pay his own way, he can have any kind of an education that he wishes.\n\nClass-Room Standards.\n\nParagraphs 6,7, 8, 9, deal with the same subject as was taken up in paragraph 4, and the Inspectors reports at Ottawa will settle this point. These men are Provincial Public School Inspectors, and the grading will be the same as in the English speaking schools. One has to keep in mind that the Indian children have no English when they enter school and also that the average age of entering school is about eleven years.\n\nLack of Self-Reliance.\n\nI think there is truth in this at the present time. One must remember that all the foolish things that is apt to get into one's head is usually there around 20 years of age. If we could only do our youth over again as we think we would do it at 50 years it would be the pious age of youth. The lack of self reliance is in every community to a greater degree today but we are passing through a re-constructive period in history. The war may bring some good and grand things but we know already of some of the contemporary evil ones and the reservation is no more free from them than elsewhere.\nThe Department's Policy.\n\nAbout 14 years ago the Department made a careful study of the Indian problem to re-adjust policy. They got reports from inspectors, agents, principals and we saw the fruits of that information in 1911, Improved Day schools on the reserves, better constructed and equipped residential schools, (100% improved) in many cases higher standards in class-room work and Industrial work, the latter very much improved, and the Provincial Public School Inspectors to take charge of the class-room work. This last change was introduced in 1922. As a Church engaged in this work we can do nothing better than to co-operate with the Department to the extent of our ability and I have found them the essence of consideration during all my years of work.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nSigned:- W. A. Hendry.\nReport of F. Rhodes.\n\nReplying to your communication of the 4th inst., enclosing a copy of a paper read by Mr. R. B. Heron to the Regina Presbytery meeting regarding Indian education; I beg to advise that Mr. Heron's statements are correct in only a few particulars.\n\nFirstly it is noted that Mr. Heron does not offer any suggestions or solutions to the existing arrangements in Boarding schools, to say that an Indian child is brought to a Boarding school and does not attend classroom is not correct, so far as this school is concerned.\n\nIf we are to allow pupils to attend classroom for the full day, and if the pupils (Girls) are not to be taught Domestic Science then the staff of a School this size will have to be increased 100%.\n\nIn an institution such as this, who may I ask is going to prepare Meals for 70 people, bake bread, Laundry work and general cleaning of the school, further where are the Girls going to receive instruction in Domestic Science? Certainly not in their own homes!\n\nWe cannot make Pauline Johnstone, or Long Lance's out of all our pupils no more than we can make Ralph Connor's or Nellie McClung's out of our White boys and girls, but the pupils in our Church Schools are getting the best Training and Education that is possible.\n\nI may say that no pupil in this school is kept out of Classroom for the purpose of earning Revenue of for the School, true there are odd occasions when it is found necessary to keep one or two boys out of the Classroom owing to pressure of outside work, this however does not in any way interfere with their education as the occasions are very infrequent.\n\nMr. Heron apparently loses sight of the fact that there are dull boys and girls amongst the Indians and it is not fair to these schools or their Staffs to cite these as examples of graduates.\n\nIt may be interesting to note that two of our Girls aged 16 years have just passed the Grade 8 Examinations and are now eligible for entrance to High School, these girls are the only pupils from this school who have sat for Examination.\n\nPersonally I fail to see how we can inaugurate a better system for Educating and training the Indian children than that which is now in vogue at this school, the work must be done either by Pupils or Hired help, if it has to be done by hired help then there will be a heavy drain on the finances of the Women's Missionary Society and as a consequence some part of the organization will suffer.\n\nWe have had nothing but praise from the Parents for the facilities and instruction given to the pupils of this school.\n\nI hope to be in a position in the near future to give you the percentage of prizes won in classroom work in competition with the White Children at the Provincial Exhibition held in Regina recently. I know it is as high but have not been able to check over them yet.\nReport of H. B. Currie, Alberni, B. C.\n\nYours of the 4th inst to hand re the paper read by Mr. Heron before the Regina Presbytery, and asking if in my opinion the situation is as Mr. Heron represents.\n\nI know no Mr. Heron, in some respect the situation is as he says, but I would not care to stand in Mr. Heron's position. The worst prevaricator is the one that tells only half the truth. And that is just what Mr. Heron has done. In the second clause of Mr. Heron's paper he says Indians may be in school, living in it day and night; in fact, yet not be in regular attendance in the class room. This is a serious charge against the officers of the school and the Indian Agent, the Inspector of Indian education and the Indian Department. It is simply a charge that they are not doing their duty or that they would insist on regular attendance. So far as this school is concerned, the pupils are in regular attendance so far as the health conditions of the pupils will permit. Facts are the strongest evidence against such exaggerated statements as Mr. Heron has indulged in. So I will now turn up the class room Register of this school and give you the record for the past quarter (1st April to 20th June). In this quarter there was 64 class room days. On our Register is 86 names. 51 pupils were in the class room 64 days. 16 pupils were in the class room 63 days.\n\nWe had the Flu in March and the pupils that were in class room less than 57 days were in every case out recovering from said Flu. Those who lost time between 57 and 64 days were out for other minor ailments.\n\nI have no doubt your other schools can show equally good Class Room attendance. Now I do not wish you to get a wrong impression from the above. When I say the above pupils were in the class room as above it simply means that the larger pupils were in the class room half of each day, as is required by the Indian Department. The other half day was spent just as Mr. Heron says - There are farms and gardens, laundries and bake-shops and kitchens in connection with Indian schools, and when the pupils are not in the class room they are receiving an important part of their training in the said farms, gardens, kitchens, laundries, bake-shops, sewing rooms and etc. This part of an Indian's training is of even greater importance to an Indian than the Class Room work. A large part of the Indians have not the strong constitution a white man has, simply because for generations they have not lived right. Food, sanitation, clothing and environment have all been wrong. With a result\nthat the Indian population was gradually decreasing until ten or fifteen years ago, when the training of our Indian school began to make its influence felt. Since then the Indian population has gradually increased. Even yet it is my opinion that were the Indian child closely confined in the classroom all day and hours of home work, and other things crowded into a white child's life - heaped upon the Indian child - well it would be only the strongest of them that would survive. It is the half day in the classroom and the other half devoted to the open life on the garden or farm - or the complete change to the kitchen, laundry, or sewing room that is their salvation, from a health viewpoint. On the other hand, for the time being at least, it is not important that the Indian should become a people of high educational endowment. What our Government is aiming at, at present, is to make good citizens out of them. When that has been attained, will be soon enough, to think of their higher education. Even now if a few bright pupils show aptitude, I am satisfied those in charge of the Indian Schools and the Government will be glad to lend whatever assistance. But as I was saying, the thing to do first for the Indian is to make him a good citizen. This cannot be done until the home life is right. The Home life cannot be right before the wife can cook a meal well, make, mend, and keep clean suitable clothing, and have a good general knowledge of good housekeeping and sanitation. While the father must have learned to work to provide a suitable living for those immediately depending upon him. All this our Indian Boarding schools are doing. So the farms, and gardens and laundries and bake-shops and kitchens are a real blessing to the Indians and not a detriment, as Mr. Heron would like you to believe. And under such conditions of school life I have been able during my thirteen years as Principal of this School to pass a number of my pupils at the Provincial Examinations for entrance to High Schools. And any number of the balance are bright, intelligent, young men and women today, quite capable of giving a good account of themselves in competition with the white population.\n\nMr. Heron is writing from Sask. I am not familiar with conditions there, I speak of the Indians of Vancouver Island as I find them, and will leave to my fellow workers in Sask. and Alberta to answer Mr. Heron's charges there. But I will say this Mr. Heron is apparently out to swipe everybody and everything in sight. I gather this from what he says about our schools of learning in Canada. \"He says, Capt. Long Lance this man while a Canadian, Indian, had to go to the United States to procure the education that enabled him to write a good story. Well, I rather admire Mr. Heron's courage. He is a real hero or he would never have been able to stand before an intelligent body of men such as I would imagine constituted Regina Presbytery and say, Our splendid Universities and Colleges were unable to give Captain Long Lance the education to write so good a story. When he makes such charges against McGill, Queens or a dozen other Colleges or Universities one might mention, it simply shows that his unreliable statements are scarcely worth considering.\nExtract from Report of G. A. Hackney.\n\nI have been wondering what percentage of the pupils of the Boarding school are received at the age of 7 years and kept there in regular attendance till they are eighteen. Judging from the pupils that have been sent here from this reserve I should say that that percentage is very small indeed. Most of the boys and girls who have gone from us have been those who perhaps have not been sent to school at all until they were eight or nine and in some cases, ten. Thereafter they are so irregular in their attendance that when they reach the age of 13 or 14 they are still only in the second or third grade with rather poor standing at that.\n\nSome of the quarterly reports that I have forwarded to the Gov't. have revealed a distressing situation. Children who should have been in school at least 4/5 of the time have only been present from 5 to 10 days and the aggregate of days absent has almost equalled the aggregate of attendance. I think I shall enclose one of these reports that you may see for yourself what we as teachers of the day school have to contend with.\n\nThis sort of thing goes on till those children, roaming about the reserve, commit some misdemeanor and are sent to the boarding school.\n\nIf it be true that the majority of the pupils in our boarding schools are of this type then it is small wonder that the results are such as Mr. Heron complains of.\n\nMr. Heron's statement that the Indians as a rule are anxious to have their children educated, is if this reserve is typical, pure fiction. From the Chief down they manifest little or no interest in these matters and an attendance officer is an urgent necessity.\n\nOf course, the key man is the agent and, if he is not on the job, the teacher has not a chance.\n\nThe Indian children are intelligent and if given a proper chance will give a good account of themselves at school.\nReport of J. L. Millar.\n\nIn reference to Mr. Heron's letter of Aug. 7th, I must say that the facts do not correspond with our local situation. We follow, as far as possible, the full day system for class room work. The Inspector always gives a very favorable report of the standing of our pupils.\n\nIt would apply to the graduates of the R. C. schools in the district.\n\nWe are careful also to educate along the industrial lines such as the kitchen, laundry, bake-shop, farm, carpenter shop etc., the children have not had the education along these lines as English speaking children generally receive. The Indian children have a \"good capacity for education but generally lack in ambition and ideals to realize their possibilities. Our Indian School Inspector, Mr. Cairns, an old teacher of Indian children, is a firm believer in the half-day system, especially for the large schools. Our system suits the requirements of our school better.\nExtract from Report of W. J. Cookson.\n\nAs to the matter of an Indian having a voice in the selection of a teacher or the course of study, it is unreasonable to expect that a parent without any education should be in a position to decide as to what is in the best interest of the child in either of these respects.\n\nIn the second place while the children are the wards of the Church and Department of Indian Affairs, in my experience I have always found that the parents are quite satisfied to leave such matters in their hands.\n\nIn the matter of work, a pupil at 15 years of age is put on the half-day system at least that is the rule in the Cecilia Jeffrey School. One half-day in the class-room and the other half in whatever work there may be to do around the building. I consider that their training in this respect is equally as important as their work in the class-room.\n\nIf in the years that a child is supposed to be in school, they are not able to get an education of a higher standard than that which the writer refers to, it is not by any means the fault of the system. A child that may not be sent to school as in the case of a girl that we admitted a few days ago, until they are thirteen years of age cannot be expected to make very much progress; on the other hand, if the discipline of the school is such as to allow the child to be absent from the class-room, it must necessarily be with the same result.\n\nIn conclusion let me say that I find that the children in this school far exceed anything that the writer has reference to and that the parents do not complain of the system.\nDear Mr. Edmison:\n\nAt your request I offer to reply to Mr. R. B. Heron's paper read before the Regina Presbytery. In doing so I do not presume to answer for all the schools under the different Churches - But so far as the criticism goes it applies to all Indian Boarding Schools for they are all conducted on much the same method being all under the direction and inspection of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nHowever, as Birtle is one of our oldest schools and the Reserves from which we draw our pupils are all under Presbyterian missionaries it is but fair that I should defend our methods and make clear to your Board and to the Church at large that the best course is being followed.\n\nI wish to make clear at the outset that the Department of Indian Affairs has an educational Department to supervise and inspect the 100 Indian Schools under their care, in much the same way that the Provincial Educational Departments supervise and inspect the Public Schools. Consequently Mr. Heron's criticism of the methods of the Indian Boarding Schools is directed against the Department of Indian Affairs and not against any policy or method that the church defines for this work.\n\nMr. Heron evidently favors the establishment of the day school on the Reserves with the children living at home. This no doubt would be the ideal way of educating them if conditions warranted it. But the inspectors of Indian Schools and Inspectors of Indian Agencies and Indian Agents are all agreed that under present conditions on the Reserves, the day school is an absolute failure on most of the Reserves throughout Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Mr. Heron says that attendance under the compulsory School Attendance Act may mean merely living in a boarding school and not attendance in a class room; that the children put in too much time in bake-shops, laundries, housework and farm-work and too little in the class room. This is the Indian complaint. Nothing would please the Indian better than to sit down and have the White men feed, clothe and wait on him. If we did this work for the children in the school, we would be making them worse Indians and unfitting them still more for the conditions of civilized life.\n\nIn this complaint he assumes that the Indian Boarding School aims at doing for the Indian children just what the Public Schools does for the white child. Whereas the Boarding School not only teaches them to read, write, etc., but tries to teach them new conditions of living. Teaches them to eat different food, to sleep in beds, to dress, wash, bath, to bake their bread, cook their food, keep their houses and make a living on farms, etc. not like their parents have done but in a manner that shall enable them to live in civilized conditions in which they find themselves,- tries to instil into them energy, perseverance, self-control, morals, and religion, and make these so much a part of their life, that they shall practice them as long as they live.\n\nConsequently, all their work around the school is a process of instruction to fit them for new conditions of living - the actual class room work is only a part of the training. There would be no use teaching them to do business unless they had been taught to have some business to do.\nHowever they do get the actual class room attendance - In our Birtle School the number of School days exceed those of the Public School and the Hours are the same.\n\nAll the children under 14 years of age are in the class room for the full hours, unless sick. Those from 14 to 18 years work on the half-day system. The girls spend the alternate half-day in the kitchen, laundry, sewing room etc., and the boys spend the alternate half-day on the farm, stock, garden and general repair work. In a couple of generations much that we have to teach these children in the school, they will have learned in their homes and the day-school and class-room work and higher education can receive the attention that it does now with our white children.\n\nMr. Heron's complaint that the parents have no choice of the teachers and courses of study, of their children is far-fetched. Neither do parents of white children choose their teachers and up to High School there is no choice of subjects.\n\nMr. Heron says what it is doubtful if the majority of pupils of Indian schools leaving school at the age of 16 years could pass the examination equal to 4th or 5th Grade for White children - In Birtle school we follow the same course as the Public Schools of Manitoba and the 69 Indian children in attendance ranging in age from 7 to 18 are graded as follows: Standard I, 14; II, 17; III, 0; IV, 10; V, 19; VI, 8; VII, 1. In view of the fact that it is only about three years since the attendance was made compulsory for the Indians it was inevitable that with the first enforcing of this law, a number of boys and girls from 14 to 18 years of age came into the schools for the first time, most of them without English and are leaving as soon as they are eighteen. Consequently, they could not get on very far.\n\nThen, many of the parents who have not been in school themselves keep their children out on all manner of pretexts, till they are 11 or 12 years old and they are thus at a disadvantage throughout their whole course. The complaint that Mr. Heron makes that few of the pupils are able to interpret English into Cree, or vice versa needs only a little consideration to see how unfounded it is. We do not expect pupils in Public School to translate from one language to another. Only when they get into High School, do they attempt this. With the range of thought and language so divergent as that of English and Cree it is not to be expected that a Public School pupil can easily interpret one into the other and it is especially hard to translate the abstract reading of an ordinary sermon into the simple concrete language of the Cree.\n\nFurther he says that one has only to attempt conversation with an ex-pupil to find out how limited his vocabulary is. Everyone knows that it is characteristic of the Indian not to talk more English than he has to. Even if he knows English well, he will often meet you with a blank stare when asked a question. And often it is very convenient for him not to talk and pretend that he does not know how. Many of them are not anxious to learn how or to use the white Man's language or copy his verse.\nMr. Heron points out that the younger Indians have not the same sense of honor and self-reliance that the older Indians had. He must admit that the sphere in which the older Indians moved was very different limited when compared to that of the ordinary Indian school graduate. And even if we admit the statement, may we not find an explanation in the changed conditions? Before the Indians came into contact with civil laws, the relationships within their own tribes were those of a family. They must respect the rights and possessions and women and children within the tribe. And if they infringed on any of these rights of another tribe their whole tribe had to answer for it. Civil law treats them as individuals and groups of families and thus leaves them to exhibit each other and to outdo the white man if they can.\n\nI conclude by this by repeating Mr. Heron's own statement that \"The Presbyterian Church is conducting a number of Indian schools in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, it is most important that as a Church, every possible effort be made to fulfill our obligations to these parents whose children we have taken and that we give these children that will best equip them for a place in the citizenship of the country.\" May I add to this that an expert staff at Ottawa assisted by a Commissioner at Regina with School Inspectors, Inspectors of Agencies and with Indian agents and Farm Instructors on the Reserves are in a position to know all the conditions of the Reserves and Indian Schools, have worked out through years of experiments the present Indian Boarding School. I have no doubt that they consider that under present conditions - and in this the staffs of our school will all agree - that the Boarding School, teaching the Indian children all these departments of work and keeping them away from the temptations and conditions on the Reserves is the best method possible to equip the growing generation of Indians for a place in the Christian citizenship of the country.\n\nSigned: F.E. Pitts.\nPrincipal of Indian Boarding School, Birtle, Man.\nIn the Regina \"Leader\" a news item from Ottawa states that the Social Service Council of Canada passed certain resolutions; one of which was to ask for better enforcement of the School Attendance Act as it applies to the Indian Schools.\n\nCompulsory school attendance is quite familiar to us, but as applied to the Indian children it means something quite different from the law which governs the attendance of white children at the ordinary public school. In one case it means the attendance in the classroom - in the other merely the taking up of residence in a Boarding School or Industrial School - and this is the point the Social Service Council may have overlooked: viz., Indians may be in a School, living in it day and night, in fact, yet not be in regular attendance in the classroom.\n\nIndian children are compelled to leave their homes at the age of seven - to remain in school, with only an occasional holiday, until they are eighteen. The parents have no voice in the selection of the teachers, nor in the selection in the course of study the children are to pursue, nor in the number of hours they attend the class-room.\n\nThe Indians, as a rule, are anxious to have their children educated, but they complain that they are not kept regularly in the class-room; that they are kept out at work that produces revenue for the School; that when they return to the Reserves, they have not enough education to enable them to transact ordinary business, - scarcely enough to enable them to write a legible letter.\n\nThere are farms and gardens and laundries and bake-shops and kitchens in connection with Indian Schools; the parents claim their children spend time at work there that should be devoted to the class-room.\n\nThe class-room standing of many of the graduates of these schools would indicate that the parents have considerable ground for complaint.\n\nIt is doubtful if the majority of these pupils, leaving school at eighteen years of age, could pass a higher examination than that set for a fourth or fifth grade class in a school for white children. To say that white children are more intelligent and learn faster, does not dispose of the complaint, nor explain the difference in the standing of white and Indian children with the same number of years of school attendance to their credit. Indians have shown over and over again that they are capable of holding their own in class-room and College halls, and also in literary work of very great value. I have in mind a Cree Indian, gold medalist in the University of Manitoba, who later translated the Gospel of Luke from the Greek to the Cree language, a volume of poems whose verse and story are inspiring to all Indians hearts, was an Indian woman. Lately there appeared in the Regina Leader, and also Maclean's Magazine, stories of Cree Indians, written by a young Indian of literature.\nIndian is capable of great things, if given the chance.\n\nThe ex-pupils of our Indian Schools have such faulty education that very few of them are capable of interpreting Cree into English, or vice versa. A story is told of a clergyman who attempts to preach to an Indian congregation through an interpreter. From the text (Matt. 14:27) \"It is I, be not afraid,\" when this came to the interpretation ears of the congregation in their own language, it was: \"Hit him in the eye, don't be afraid\"!\n\nOne has to attempt a conversation with these ex-pupils to find how very meager is their English vocabulary, and how painfully limited is their knowledge. This is further emphasized by the fact that very few of them subscribe to any paper or magazine of any kind; Any system of education that leaves young men and women without a desire to read, is open to criticism.\n\nI would point out too, in passing, that men with years' experience among the Indians agree that the younger men have not as high a sense of honor as, and are less self-reliant than the old Indians who have never been in school.\n\nThe Presbyterian Church is conducting a number of Indian Schools in Saskatchewan and Manitoba; it is most important that as a Church, every possible effort be made to fulfill our obligation to these parents whose children we have taken, - and that we give these children the training that will best equip them for a place in the citizenship of the country.\n\nAvenhurst, Sask.,\nMay 1925\n\nSigned: R.

By resolution of Presbytery, this was forwarded to me. I at once sent a copy of it to the Principals of our Indian Boarding Schools and I received replies, copies of which I am enclosing as I thought you might be interested to get the point of view of these men.\n\nAt the meeting of our Executive, after reading Mr. Heron's letter, and the replies from the various Principals, the following Minute was adopted:\n\n\"A communication from the Presbytery of Regina was received enclosing a copy of a paper on Indian Education given at a meeting of that Presbytery by Rev. R.B. Heron. In view of the fact that through the publication of this paper certain criticisms of the Indian Residential Schools had received a measure of publicity, this phase of the work was given even closer than customary attention by the Executive. Full and carefully written letters were read by the General Secretary from the Principals of the Schools, dealing with methods employed, courses and hours of study, etc.\n\n\"As the outcome of this inquiry, the Executive expressed:\n(1) satisfaction with the results being secured, taking into account all the difficulties incidental to the work; (2) approval of the practice now being followed by the Indian Department of dividing the children's time between study and practical training, as that which long experience has\nfound to be most effective; (3) confidence in the wisdom and devotion of the Principals of our Indian Boarding Schools and their associates engaged in this exacting, sometimes discouraging, work.\n\n\"It was agreed that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Department of Indian Affairs and that the Special Committee on Indian Work be instructed to prepare an article for the Presbyterian Witness, setting forth the work being carried on in our Indian Boarding Schools.\"\n\nMr. Heron's article was without our knowledge, published in the Presbyterian Witness.

They are all matters of absolute necessity. We have always encouraged our Principals to endeavor to overtake minor repairs, and they have accomplished a good deal in that respect. We feel, therefore, that all on the enclosed list are matters of urgency, and of major importance.\n\nA number of the items have already been before the Department, and while sympathetic consideration has been promised, with the probability of action in 1924, we have included them again in this list, trusting they may be duly granted, and become effective as early as possible in 1924.

R. B. Heron, who read a paper on Indian Education at a meeting of the Regina Presbytery. The replies to your letter to Presbyterian principals and teachers, copies of which you enclosed, are both interesting and conclusive and I am pleased to learn that the present scheme of educating our Indian wards is confirmed by them and by the Executive of your Board.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

This includes salaries for March quarter at Cote, $435.00; at White Bear, $270.00; and at Round Plain, $180.00.\n\nSeparate cheques have hitherto been made out for the different schools. If it is just the same to you, we would prefer that you follow the old custom. Our method has been to endorse the cheques over to the proper parties and send them on, merely making a record in our books. Separate cheques have to be made out, and it would be more satisfactory if this could be done in your office.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJHE/HG\nOttawa, April 15th, 1924.\n\nRev. sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, with reference to the payment of salaries for the teachers at the Cote, White Bear and Round Plain Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that separate cheques will be forwarded in future for these schools. I might say that the reason for forwarding only one cheque for the March quarter was due to the fact that in order to pay the salaries out of the appropriation for the fiscal year 1923-24 a cheque for the total amount due for the three schools was drawn prior to the receipt of the returns. As stated above, however, this will not occur in the future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. J. H.

On Monday of this week, we received a cheque covering grants to File Hills, Portage La Prairie and Swan Lake. We did not return the cheque. We turned it over to the Treasurer and had him break it up into individual cheques, but this is a lot of work and necessitates book-keeping. Where individual cheques are to be written, we feel that it would be better that it should be done by the Department. I presume this was a slip, but I thought you ought to know.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.H.

Later, about the first proxime, you should forward a general letter, listing the major requirements in order of their relative importance.

As he has now so many pupils waiting to come in and can take care of only 90, we would prefer to have the $5000 with an additional $1000 to be used in the erection of a residence to the North of the present building. We could then use the space now occupied by the Principal for school purposes. This would permit of an attendance of 120. Mr. Hendry reports that he has had to refuse admittance of children from several reserves for the past four or five years. If the Government will grant this request for $6000 Mr. Hendry hopes in a short time to be able to take care of the enlargement of the barn out of school funds.\n\nCecilia Jeffrey\u2014 For hospital repairs............. 600\n\nThe sum of $400 was promised by the Department through Agent Edwards, to make necessary alterations and repairs to the hospital. It cannot be used in winter weather. We estimate that we will require $600 to cover this expenditure. Some time ago the Department intimated that the Government would look after the repairs to the hospital if the Women's Missionary Society assumed responsibility for the plumbing etc. This cost the Church $1400 and the W. M. S. are not now in a position to undertake repairs to the hospital.\n\nNew Building................................. --\n\nThis is a request which has appeared year by year. The W. M. S. are of the opinion that a new school should be placed in a more suitable location nearer civilization. A school built in the district of Keewatin would draw children from a large territory and the children in our present school could be brought much easier than our staff can go and come under all kinds of difficulties to Kenora, or if thought wiser a school could be built along the G.

As agreed by you and Mr. Milne, the W.M.S. property has been divided on the assumption that four of the Indian Residential Schools, namely Portage La Prairie, File Hills, Round Lake and Alberni, shall remain under the care of the W.M.S. of the United Church. By our agreement, the Missions on the Reserves in the vicinity of these Schools have all been assigned to the United Church.\n\nIt is also agreed that the new Government School, to be erected soon near Kenora, to take the place of the Cecilia Jeffrey School, shall go to the Presbyterian Church.\n\nI am also sending you twelve copies of the agreement we reached in regard to the estimated costs of the properties for which we were not able to secure the actual cost.\n\nTrusting you will find these statements satisfactory, believe me,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nSigned\u2014 J.H. Edmison.\n\nJHE/ENS.\nMarch 7, 1927\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq., D.Litt., F.R.S.C.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Dr. Scott:\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, the Dominion Property Commission appointed by the Dominion Government was assigned the duty of dividing the Home Mission properties of the Presbyterian Church in Canada between the United Church of Canada and the Presbyterian Church. The Chairman of the Commission suggested that if possible, the two Boards interested should get together and reach an amicable settlement. I am glad to say we were able to accomplish this.\n\nDr. Andrew S. Grant, Secretary of the General Board of Missions of the Presbyterian Church, and I had several conferences. We made a tentative division of the property, then submitted our recommendations to the Committees of our respective Churches. The report was then passed on with the approval of both Boards to the Commission, which has just issued its finding and adopted the division as recommended.\n\nYou will be interested particularly in the finding as it affects the Indian Schools formerly under the Home Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church in Canada. The division as agreed upon is as follows:\n\n| Cecilia Jeffrey Indian School | Parcel 3794, Div.492, Rainy River |\n|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n| Birtle Indian School          | (1) Pt. Sec.6, Tp.17, Ra. 26W.    |\n|                               | (2) S.W. & Sec.15.                |\n|                               | (3) Part Blk.\"H\"                  |\n| Ahousaht Indian School        | Lot 363, Clayoquot Dist., 140 acres |\n| Alberni Farm                  | Pt.lot 81,Alberni Dist.           |\n\nThese were all the properties held by the Presbyterian Church in Canada in which we were carrying on Residential School work amongst the Indians.\n\nYou will note that in the case of Alberni, we have\nentered only the Farm. The School itself is the property of the Government.\n\nBy the agreement with the Commission, the United Church will carry on work in these institutions until April 1st. At that time we are to hand over Cecilia Jeffrey and Birtle Schools to the Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nWhile the four residential schools at Portage La Prairie, File Hills, Round Lake and Alberni were not considered by the Commission because not the property of the Church, in my conferences with Dr. Grant these were considered. I am sending you a copy of my letter to Dr. Grant dated January 10th and a copy of his letter to me, dated January 12th. From these communications you will see that there was a definite understanding reached to the effect that these four residential schools are to remain under the care of the W.M.S. of the United Church. If no such understanding had been reached, the representatives of the United Church would not have been willing to have assigned to the Presbyterian Church, two out of the three schools owned by the Church, and, as you will see, the two largest. As the result of the Commission's findings, we are only getting the little Ahousaht School.\n\nI purpose visiting Ottawa in the course of a day or so and will talk over the whole situation with you.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nENCS.2.\nJHE/HG\nMarch 14, 1927.\n\nDear Dr. Edmison:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, concerning the future management of the Indian residential schools which were formerly under the Mission Board of the Presbyterian Church. I note that the Cecilia Jeffrey and Birtle institutions have been assigned to the Presbyterian Church and that Ahousaht school and the farm in connection with the Alberni work have been given to the United Church. I have also noted that a definite understanding has been reached concerning the Portage, File Hills, Round Lake and Alberni Indian Residential Schools, which are government-owned - that they remain under the care of the W. M. S. of the United Church. I am pleased to have this official writing in this connection and I trust that these schools will have many more years of much usefulness.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

General.\n\nI have given some consideration to the statement which you handed me the other day which might be thought to show that this Department was discriminating against the Roman Catholic Church in the distribution of educational grants.\n\nThe educational policy of this Department is for administration without prejudice as regards the various religious denominations engaged in the work. It may be said that schools have been established in various localities throughout the Dominion as the needs of these localities are represented to the Department. We have not been able, owing to the very large cost of this service, to give what might be considered a complete educational system, one which would reach all classes of Indians, and without a very large increased appropriation it would be impossible to do so. At present we vote $400,000.00 approximately, and the amount would certainly have to be doubled in order to establish what might be called a complete system of education to Indians. I cannot refrain from expressing the view that it is unfair to make the comparison instituted by this statement. I think, however, that the statement has been compiled from information which was obtained from our Annual Report for 1904 and if the writer had had the advantage of the full records of the Department a different statement would have been the result and the present one would not have come to hand.\n\nThe grants of the Department are not made on the principle upon which the statement has been compiled, and while consenting to examine the figures on this basis it must not be understood that this can be considered fair and just.\nIt is manifest that no fair comparison could be made between Roman Catholic grants and grants to any single Protestant sect. If such comparison is to be made at all it should be made between the Protestant and Roman Catholic bodies.\n\nMaking such a comparison we get the following result as the per capita expenditure. It would appear that the Protestants get $5.89 per capita of their whole number and the Roman Catholics $5.25. A glance at the per capita grant for the different Provinces will show how they vary and comment is superfluous on this point:\n\n### Indian Education - Roman Catholic Schools\n\n| Population | Appropriation | Unit |\n|------------|---------------|------|\n| P.

A day school system meets the requirements of these Provinces perfectly as the Indians have been a long time in contact...\nwith civilisation. They reside on reserves where they are directly in contact with the influence of their priests and there is no need of institutions to take them away from the evil influences of reserve life.\n\nIn British Columbia where there are shown to be 11,555 Roman Catholic Indians, nearly 50% of the total population, it is not the aim of the Department, as was before stated, to provide a complete educational system. The reserves are very many and of small area and the only way to meet the needs of these would be to establish a very large number of boarding schools which expense the Government could not possibly meet without doubling present appropriations.\n\nFor the Province of British Columbia, where the Roman Catholics have, as said before, nearly 50% of the population, our main estimates provide $64,500 for Industrial and Boarding Schools and $11,400 for Day Schools, in all $95,900. Of this amount $46,850 is devoted to Roman Catholic Schools, bearing the same proportion to the total vote as the Roman Catholic population does to the total population. The only new school provided for last year was the Schilt Boarding School, a Roman Catholic Institution.\n\nIn the Province of Ontario there are 6544 Roman Catholics being about 35% of the total population. The total vote for the Province of Ontario is $56,460.00 and the schools under Roman Catholic guidance receive of this amount $14,185. or more than 35%.\n\nIn Manitoba and the North West Territories the Roman Catholic population is 5284; the total population is 24,336 and the Roman Catholic Indians are about 21% of the whole. Now the grant for the North West Territories last year in the main estimates was $395,062., exclusive of Treaty 8. The amount set apart for Roman Catholic Schools is $118,197., being 30% of the whole expenditure. As the Roman Catholic population as I have shown is only 21% it will\nwill be seen that the Church is receiving more than her proportionate share.\n\nOf late years there has been a disproportionate increase in Roman Catholic pupilage in all the schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories. Some little time ago I prepared a statement making a comparison between our expenditure in 1897-8 and 1901-02. I found that there had been an increased number of pupils - 253 - provided for the Boarding Schools. Of these 253 were for Roman Catholic Institutions or nearly the whole number granted.\n\nI think I need not go further to show that instead of the Roman Catholic Church being discriminated against in the matter of educational there is no cause for complaint.\n\nD. G. Scott,\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 14th November, 1905.\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, November 26th, 1905.\n\nDear Sir Wilfrid:\u2014\n\nWith reference to the comparative statement, herewith attached, dealing with the expenditure by this Department for school purposes and which at first sight would appear to indicate a discrimination against the Roman Catholics, I beg leave to say that I have gone into the matter carefully with the Accountant and have had him prepare an analysis, herewith also attached, which you will see puts the matter in an entirely different light.\n\nThe basis principle of our expenditure for schools is to be found not in the total Indian population, but rather in the school population and the conditions attaching thereto and it would be almost impossible, as the Accountant points out, to make a fair comparison from the standpoint of population alone.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nFrank Pedley.\n### TABLE FOR THE WHOLE DOMINION\n\n| Denomination | A'mt voted | No. of Indians | Per Capita |\n|--------------|------------|----------------|------------|\n| **Presbyterians** |            |                |            |\n| Day Schools  | $1800.00   |                |            |\n| Boarding \"   | $15080.00  | 1409           | $23.51     |\n| Industrial \" | $16250.00  |                |            |\n| Total        | $33130.00  |                |            |\n| **Anglicans** |            |                |            |\n| Day Schools  | $19225.00  |                |            |\n| Boarding \"   | $25364.00  | 14758          | $10.57     |\n| Industrial \" | $11503.90  |                |            |\n| Total        | $55092.00  |                |            |\n| **Methodists** |            |                |            |\n| Day Schools  | $8975.00   |                |            |\n| Boarding \"   | $8280.00   | 11177          | $5.17      |\n| Industrial \" | $40600.00  |                |            |\n| Total        | $57855.00  |                |            |\n| **R.Catholics** |            |                |            |\n| Day Schools  | $16140.00  |                |            |\n| Boarding \"   | $61020.00  | 34915          | $4.67      |\n| Industrial \" | $86100.00  |                |            |\n| Total        | $163260.00 |                |            |\n\nThis table shows that the educational grant per capita to the Roman Catholics for the whole Dominion is:\n\n- $18.84 less than that of the Presbyterians;\n- $5.90 less than that of the Anglicans; and\n- $.50 less than that of the Methodists.\n\nTabular comparison showing: 1.

This shows the per capita cost of the Roman Catholic schools by population to be less than that of the other denominations as given in the foot-note to the table referred to.\n\nArchbishop Duhamel also forwarded a table for the whole Dominion, which is taken from the blue book of 1903-04, but on checking over this statement I find that it does not work out. The actual per capita cost according to population is given in a statement appended hereto, marked \"A\", which shows the grant to the Roman Catholics to be,\n\n$19.59 less than that to the Presbyterians\n.48 \" \" \" \" Anglicans\n.16 \" \" \" \" Methodists.\n\nStatement \"B\" covering that year gives the per capita cost on the enrolment by denominations, which shows that, with the exception of the Presbyterians, the Roman Catholics are in receipt of a higher per capita.\ngrant by enrolment than any of the denominations. This statement shows the grant to the Roman Catholics to be,\n\n$29.39 less than that to the Presbyterians\n\n13.06 more \" \" \" Anglicans\n\n12.12 more $ \" \" Methodists.\n\nThese two statements cover the whole Dominion and the reason for the apparent excessive cost of the education of Presbyterian children is owing to the small number of pupils and schools, especially day schools. They have no Indians under their supervision east of Manitoba.\n\nFrom these two statements it would appear that the Roman Catholics have no cause for complaint as to the treatment they receive from the Government in regard to school grants.\n\n[Signature]\n### TABLE FOR BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\n| DENOMINATION | AMOUNT VOTED | INDIAN POPULATION | PER CAPITA |\n|--------------|--------------|------------------|------------|\n| PRESBYTERIAN |              |                  |            |\n| Day Schools  | $600.00      |                  |            |\n| Boarding Schools | $4500.00   | 412              | $12.71     |\n| Industrial Schools | $5100.00    |                  |            |\n| **Total**    | $15600.00    |                  |            |\n| CHURCH OF ENGLAND |          |                  |            |\n| Day Schools  | $2400.00     |                  |            |\n| Boarding Schools | $2700.00   | 4326             | $5.09      |\n| Industrial Schools | $16950.00  |                  |            |\n| **Total**    | $22050.00    |                  |            |\n| METHODIST    |              |                  |            |\n| Day Schools  | $3600.00     |                  |            |\n| Boarding Schools | $3500.00   | 3422             | $5.05      |\n| Industrial Schools | $10400.00  |                  |            |\n| **Total**    | $17500.00    |                  |            |\n| ROMAN CATHOLIC |            |                  |            |\n| Day Schools  | $2400.00     |                  |            |\n| Boarding Schools | $6600.00   | 11155            | $3.72      |\n| Industrial Schools | $32500.00  |                  |            |\n| **Total**    | $41500.00    |                  |            |\n\nThis table shows that for the Province of British Columbia, the per capita granted to the Roman Catholics is:\n\n- $8.99 less than to the Presbyterians;\n- 1.37 less than to the Church of England;\n- 1.37 less than to the Methodists.\nOttawa, May 10th. 1906.\n\nTo the Honorable F.

Sir,\n\nWith reference to your Grace's letter of the 10th May last, addressed to the Hon. the Superintendent General, on the subject of Indian education, and the respective grants made to the Roman Catholic and other religious denominations, I am directed to say that the comparative statement which accompanied your communication does not completely set forth the Department's policy with regard to Indian education. The statement submitted would go to show that the Department has discriminated against the Roman Catholic Church in the matter of educational grants. It is thought that your Grace will agree, after perusal of this letter, that this has not been the case.\n\nThe educational policy of the Department is for administration without prejudice as regards the various religious denominations engaged in the work. Schools have been established in various localities throughout the Dominion, as the needs of these localities have been presented to the Department. It has been found impossible (owing to the very large expenditure which would be involved) to organize a complete educational system for all Indians but as far as possible the Department has met, and continues to meet the needs of the Indians, not however, upon the basis of population. It is therefore clear that no basis for comparison by population or by religious denomination exists. Yet\n\nThe Most Revd Archbishop Duhamel, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Ottawa,\nOttawa.\nassuming the position taken in the statement forwarded by your Grace to be tenable the expenditure carefully analyzed does not show that the Department has failed in making grants for the education of Roman Catholic Indians which compare favorably with other grants. It is manifest also that no comparison could be instituted between Roman Catholic grants and grants to any single Protestant sect. If such comparison is to be made at all it should be made between the Protestant and Roman Catholic divisions of the population. Making such comparison we get the following results as to the per capita expenditure.\n\nIndian Education \u2014\u2014 Roman Catholic Schools.\n\n| Population | Appropriation | Unit |\n|------------|---------------|------|\n| P.Q. & Maritime Provs. | 11,532 | $10,190.00 | .88 |\n| Ontario | 6,544 | $14,125.00 | 2.15 |\n| British Columbia | 11,555 | $46,850.00 | 4.05 |\n| Man. & N.W.T. | 5,284 | $112,197.00 | 21.83 |\n| **Total** | **34,915** | **$183,362.00** | **5.28** |\n\nIndian Education \u2014\u2014 Protestant Schools.\n\n| Population | Appropriation | Unit |\n|------------|---------------|------|\n| P.Q. & Maritime Provs. | 654 | $300.00 | 1.34 |\n| Ontario | 15,808 | $18,685.00 | 1.18 |\n| British Columbia | 7,540 | $49,050.00 | 6.50 |\n| Man. & N.W.T. | 9,481 | $163,070.00 | 17.37 |\n| **Total** | **33,444** | **$250,614.00** | **6.69** |\n\nIt would appear that the Protestants get $6.69 per capita of the whole number and the Roman Catholics $5.28. A glance at the per capita grant for the different Provinces will show how they vary and comment is superfluous on this point.\n\nOf the 34,915 Indians shown as belonging to the Roman Catholic faith 11,453 belong to the Province of Quebec and\nthe Maritime Provinces for which only day school accommodation is provided, there being 34 day schools in these Provinces 28 of which are under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. A day school system meets the requirements of these Provinces, as the Indians have been a long time in contact with civilization. They reside on reserves where they are directly in contact with the influence of their priests and there is no need of institutions to take them away from the evil influence of reserve life.\n\nIn British Columbia where there are shown to be 11,555 Roman Catholic Indians, nearly 50% of the total population, it is not the aim of the Department, as before stated, to provide a complete educational system. The reserves are very many and of small area, and the only way to meet their needs fully would be to establish a very large number of boarding schools, which expense the Government could not possibly meet without doubling present appropriations. For the Province of British Columbia, where the Roman Catholics have, as said before, nearly 50% of the population, our estimates provided $64,500 for Industrial and Boarding Schools and $11,400 for Day Schools, in all $95,900.00. Of this amount $46,850.00 is devoted to Roman Catholic Schools, bearing about the same proportion to the total vote as the Roman Catholic population does to the total population. The only new school provided for lately was the Schelt Boarding School, a Roman Catholic Institution.\n\nIn the Province of Ontario there are 6544 Roman Catholics, being about 33% of the total population. The total vote for the Province of Ontario is $35,400.00, and the schools under Roman Catholic guidance received of this amount $14,125 or more than 33%.\n\nIn Manitoba and the North West Territories the Roman\nRoman Catholic population is 5864; the total population is 24,336, and the Roman Catholic Indians are about 21% of the whole. The grant for the North West Territories in the main Estimates of 1905-6 was $295,063, exclusive of Treaty 8. The amount set apart for Roman Catholic Schools was $112,197, being 38% of the whole expenditure. The Roman Catholic population is, as shown only 21%; your Grace will therefore readily see that the church is receiving more than a proportionate share by population.\n\nOf late years there has been a disproportionate increase in Roman Catholic pupilage in all the schools in Manitoba and the North West Territories. From a comparison between the number of pupils for whom provisions was made in the estimates for 1896-7 with the number provided for in 1907-8 it has been found that there has been an increased number of pupils - 880 - provided for the Boarding schools. Of these 676 were for Roman Catholic Institutions or nearly the whole number granted.\n\nIn British Columbia for the same years the increase has been 540, of which increase 150 pupils were assigned for Roman Catholic Institutions.\n\nIt is confidently thought that your Grace will agree that the Roman Catholic Church has not been discriminated against in the matter of educational grants.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nMost Revd Sir,\n\nYour Grace's obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Sect.

Fr. Poitras, O.M.I., of Saint Mary's, Winnipeg, procurator of the Rev. Oblate Fathers for their missions; the Rev. Father accompanies Rev. Fr. Hugonard, the well-known Principal of Qu'Appelle Industrial School, and both are sent to state and explain to you our requests in favor of the education of Indian children.\n\nBOARDING-SCOOl at CROSS LAKE, Keewatin.\n\nThe first request is in favor of a Boarding School at Cross Lake where there are (50) fifty children of school age and where the day-school is almost useless. Three hundred Catholic Indians and hundreds of pagan Indians are asking for this Boarding School.\n\nThe cost of the building to accommodate thirty children would be over $7000 dollars. We ask then, the capitulation for thirty children, and a grant of $3000 towards the new building.\n\nTHE ENLARGEMENT OF THREE SCHOOLS:\nKENORA--TOUCHWOOD HILL--FORT PELLEY.\n\nIn these three schools which are doing very well, they are obliged to refuse children, and the boys have hardly any accommodation as I have seen it myself.\n\nA grant of $3000 dollars to each of these three schools towards the building of a new edifice for boys according to plans that could not be put to execution without three times this amount, and an allowance of $1000 dollars for a heating apparatus in each school at Fort Pelley and at Touchwood Hill, and for a water-system or aqueduct for the\nschool at Kenora, would make it possible to put the work on a better footing and to increase the amount of good done to these Indian children.\n\nI understand that the inspector in the western part, Mr. Graham, and Mr. Lemieux in the east, are favorable to these improvements.\n\nINCREASE OF THE PER CAPITA GRANT.\n\nNow, Honorable and Dear Sir, we never pressed you concerning the capitation or annual grant for each child in the \"Boarding Schools\"; but, we are aware of the movement on foot to have it increased, and we are in full harmony with the gentlemen who have been waiting on you in Ottawa, last year, for this special purpose.\n\nIt is evident for all those who follow things closely that we lose money and that we get in debt every year, to keep the \"Boarding schools\" going on, at Kenora, at Touchwood Hill, and at Fort Pelley. Would it not be possible then, to increase the capitation?\n\nOften times, I have heard the superintendent of our missions, in the diocese, Very Rev. Father Vagnan, repeat to me: \"These Boarding Schools are a cause of ruin for us\"!\n\nLet me hope then, Honorable and Dear Sir, that you will give the matter a new consideration, and that you will come to the conclusion that an increase of the per capita grant should be allowed.\n\nNo matter what certain people have said, the children, as a general rule, have taken great advantage of the education given in the \"Boarding Schools\", the intellectual and moral standard have been raised, and the new generations will show yet a better result.\n\nWith the hope that our requests will be granted to us,\n\nI remain, Honorable and Dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nArch.of St-Boniface.\nRight Rev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th ultimo introducing the Rev. Father Poitras and the Rev. Father Hugonard, and referring to matters connected with Indian education.

F. Adalard,\nArchbishop of St. Boniface,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nOttawa, May 12th., 1923.\n\nRight Rev. Sir,\n\nThe Department has of late been giving special consideration to the question of Indian education in Canada. In dealing with residential schools under the control of Protestant denominations the work has been furthered by the appointment of representatives from each Church which has conferred with the Department. As the details of management of the Schools under the control of the Roman Catholic Church have to be conducted through the Bishop of the diocese in which the School is located, it has been somewhat difficult to carry out uniformity of treatment. Would it not be possible to have all the business of Roman Catholic Indian Schools transacted through one representative? By this means equalization of treatment could be arrived at, and the best interests of the work be advanced.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nFRANK PEDLE\n\nSimilar letter sent to:\nMt.

Donnellan - New Westminster\nMt. Rev. G. Brugnat - Fond du Lac, Wis.\nMt. Rev. E. Grondin - Alberta\n\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Oliver,\n\nNow that the Advisory Board of the Protestant denominations has accepted the suggestions of the Department with reference to Indian education it becomes necessary to make an additional appropriation for the financial needs of the scheme. We have come to an agreement only with the Protestant denominations, and if we are to alone provide for increased per capita grants to Protestant Schools, we will require in the Supplementary Estimates an additional vote of $35,765.00, (say $36,000.00).\n\nIf we are this year to provide sufficient to enable us to pay an increased grant to all Roman Catholic schools as well, without reduction, we will require $103,861.00, (say $103,000.00).\n\nIn one of the early memoranda on the subject certain Roman Catholic schools were scheduled to be closed, but Roman Catholics not having been dealt with and not having approached the Department in the same way as the Protestant bodies, asking for a general re-consideration and expressing their inability to carry on the work unless some increased financial assistance were given, no agreement has been arrived at as to closing the said schools. However, supposing that they are...\nbe closed, the Department to provide for the remaining Roman Catholic schools and for the Protestant schools on the basis of the new arrangement, we would require to provide $80,111.00, (say $80,000.00).\n\nI would submit these alternative estimates for your immediate consideration, as it will be necessary to decide within the next few days, in order to add the amount to the Supplementary Estimates of the Department, now before the Finance Minister.\n\nThe Protestant schools which are to be closed according to agreement are: Regina, Elkhorn, Morley, Emmanuel College and Old Sams.\n\nThe question of closing the following Roman Catholic schools might be brought before the proper authorities: Cowessess, Keeseekoose, Muscowequan, Onion Lake, Thundershields, Blood, Peigan, Ermineskin, and Crowfoot. These schools are all situated in the Provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. A new type of day school will be established experimentally at certain points to be decided upon, and the Boarding Schools at Ermineskins and Bluequills and the large Industrial Schools at Duck Lake and Dumbow would remain; together with all the Boarding Schools in the outlying districts where the Indians make their living by hunting.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nTo F. Pedley, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\u2014 His Grace the Archbishop of Saint Boniface has received your's of the 12th inst., concerning a representative of the Roman Catholic Indian Schools with whom all business would be usually transacted by the Department.\n\nHis Grace is surely favorable to this project as far as he is concerned, but before giving a definite answer he will have to communicate with his colleagues.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nsecretary.\nSaint-Albert, Alta., May 20, 1908\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI acknowledge receipt of your communication of the 11th inst. (file 34480). Concerning the advisability of the appointment of some common representative for all the Catholic dioceses having Indian schools, so that the Department could deal with this representative in all questions related to said schools.\n\nThis question has been considered several times already, and I believe that the idea has originated with us some twenty years ago. But we have found out that there were too many difficulties in the way, that the proposition seemed to us practically impossible.\n\nThis representative should be personally acquainted with the conditions of all the missions. That would mean long, expensive and difficult journeys, that would take all his time. And then would it be possible to find a man whose views would agree with those of all the bishops interested in the work. And suppose they would not agree with some of them, what about the issue?\n\nI believe that it is, in fact, very easy to deal with us. We want no privileges; we expect only to be treated as the Protestant denominations are treated; and when regulations are made we want that these regulations be fairly applied, and that every rule be made to equally work both ways.\n\nIt is only that last point, which has been too often, in\nthe fact, a cause of dissatisfaction and pain within us; so much so that I feel bound to put it here on record.\n\nI had no opportunity to consult my venerable colleagues, on the point at issue; but, I am afraid, their opinion will concur with mine.\n\nI have the honour to remain, dear sir,\n\nyours very respectfully,\n\n+Emil J.

Legge, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of St. Albert,\nSt. Albert, Alta.\nBISHOP LEGAL ON INDIAN EDUCATION.\n\nTo the Editor of the Free Press.\n\nSir\u2014I beg, with your kind permission, to reply to certain statements made in his official report by Mr. James McKenna, and dealing with the results of the education of Indians in industrial schools and boarding schools.\n\nI quote his words: \"There are people who think that the best way to correct thought to belittle the work of the missionaries is to send Indians to the Indian question seriously, and at first hand. They do not realize how much the civilization influences of their own country have been felt by them; they influence far in advance of the opportunity given them, and we bear witness to their great benefit to the nation.\"\n\nThese are words of common sense spoken by one who is in a position to know. It shows that he has not only seen, but, except for all, this silly nonsense about the failure of the mission schools. After a personal experience of 25 years in the field of Indian education, I find the results of the Indian education in our industrial and residential schools have been far in advance of what was anticipated or expected.\n\nUnfortunately, not the half of those splendid results could have been anticipated.\n\nIt is perfect nonsense to expect that some of these children could be moulded in the short space of, perhaps, six years, or even ten, into a race of Indians, or child a creature absolutely immune against the influences of the world of an Indian child, that would do away with all the bad traits of the race.\n\nIf, after leaving school, some of these children fall back into the habits and misdeeds to which they find themselves exposed, it is not the fault of the youth of good and respectable families attracted by the promises of the school, but act in a bad or even worse manner, we must blame the lack of supervision, in the same surroundings.\n\nWhat might have been avoided had the government adopted the policy of sending the parents, or guardians, of the children attending industrial or residential schools, under the direction of the school, to have readily submitted, and of giving them some supervision and guidance. Unfortunately in many instances, just the reverse happens, and instead of trying again the system of day schools, or dormitories, or residential schools, as it is purposed\u2014thereby doing away with the very thing they want to get rid of (or them), it is for anyone who is even slightly familiar with the condition of our Indian reserves, at least in the West, to see that this is the case.\n\nThis system has been tried and found wanting. The reason, I believe, is the scattered condition of the Indians, and the fact that there are hundreds of more than half a dozen children living on the reserve, and therefore, on account of the distance; but even worse, the parents or guardians are in the immediate vicinity of the school, and there is no necessity for the officers to bring the attendance to any degree of regularity.\n\nNo, there is only one system which is applicable to the case, and that is the system on the Indian child. It is the system of the residential or dormitory schools, if you like to call them so. And even then, the child, after leaving the institution, has not always received the proper training and guidance, and the work done on his or her behalf is not always completed. It is a education, but not a complete education of it, and, after a short while, the effect of the school is lost.\n\nLet the government spend a little more money for the industrial or residential schools, and the result will be still greater. The money is not extravagant, but we should generously look at the few thousand dollars spent, when the thousands are in possession of this immense existing Indian, in which we find practically every vice and crime, and an inextinguishable thirst for all kinds and all descriptions.\n\nEMILE J.

His Grace will see to have this gentleman replaced, next summer.\n\nBelieve me, Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSecretary\n\nJ. D. M. Lean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa,\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of the Department re Indian Boarding Schools --- and to return my thanks for the timely help afforded to these schools by the government. We have been trying till now to follow the rules expressed in the said document, and every year the commissioners sent to pay Treaty Indians have visited our schools and found them efficient. The Honourable Minister of the Interior himself passed here last spring, visited our school and found it quite satisfactory.\n\nI suppose some person will be appointed to sign the contract proposed by the government and receive my own signature which I will give readily. However, I would state that half breeds and even white children are found at the Sisters' convents who have charge of the Indian children. I understand that the government does not want to contribute anything to the support of these children and it is all right, but it has always been granted that they may live under the same roof as the Indian children, provided I took on myself to accommodate them all comfortably, and I secured a sufficient number of Sisters to take care of them. If there were other schools public or separate in this country, half breed or white children might go to them, but there are no other and we are obliged to have these children in the same houses with the Indians only.\n\nI trust our way of working which has been approved and praised from the beginning as conducive to the general welfare of this country will be allowed to continue as long as there are no other means of getting schools for half breed and white children.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,\n\nE. Bernard, C.M., Bishop of Iberia, vicar apostolic of Athabasca.\nOttawa, March 31st., 1911.\n\nRight Reverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 16th, the contents of which have been noted. Your suggestion that there should be an intermediary grant of $112.00 has received consideration, but it is thought that the rates fixed by the Agreement are fair to both parties to the Contract. It has been the policy of the Department to give a title of occupancy to mission and school properties on the Reserves. During a great length of time this tenure has been found to work satisfactorily, and I think as Your Lordship surmises, it would hardly be possible to arrange for title in fee simple.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

ALBERT, Alta.\nWinnipeg, November 15, 1911.\n\nThe Assistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nSir,\n\nA careful perusal of the correspondence and agreement relating to the maintenance and management of Indian Boarding schools has led us to the conclusion that it is not required any more, under said agreement now in force, to render accounts of the amounts received or disbursed for the maintenance of said schools. We fail to see that any of the nineteen clauses of said agreement concerning the management of these schools requires this to be done.\n\nWe have discussed this matter with the Inspector of the schools under our charge and he is of the same opinion.\n\nSo we presume that it will be right for us to instruct the Principals of our schools in consequence and that this will meet the approval of the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nLes Reverends Peres Oblats.\n\nPer. [Signature]\n\n353 St. Mary's Ave.\nOttawa, November 28, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have your communication of the 13th instant in reference to reports from officers of the Department upon the financial condition of boarding schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department considers that it is entitled to know the financial standing of the institutions to which grants are made and is privileged to call for such reports under Section 16, Part I of the Agreement.\n\nIt has been represented that the system required by the Department entails much labour. No particular system of book-keeping will be insisted upon. No doubt it is necessary for each of these schools in its own interests to keep records of all receipts and disbursements and any system that will enable an Inspector to make an intelligent audit will be quite satisfactory to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

We have St. Bernard's and St. Bruno's Boarding Schools there, and we are authorized to keep 65 children, 50 at St. Bruno's and 15 at St. Bernard's. I can boast that we did not spare anything to put these schools on a footing as perfect as possible.\n\nI acknowledge with pleasure that you have given us all the help and encouragement necessary for such a work. Now, I hear that, as white people are settling in the neighborhood of Indians at Sawridge and Swan River, Lesser Slave Lake, these white people have their own schools, and the teachers try to bring to these schools the children of the Indians who used to come to St. Bernard's and St. Bruno's Boarding Schools.\n\nIf these white people's teachers were allowed to have\nto have the Indian children for their pupils, it would be detrimental to the purpose which the government has in view, which is the good education of Indian children not only by imparting to them secular knowledge but by giving them moral and religious formation according to their creed. Children coming to daily public schools could indeed learn to read and write, but the rest of the time would be lost to them. In Boarding Schools these children receive as good if not better instruction, and they are taught religion, morality, discipline, cleanliness, divers kinds of works according to their condition, etc. Therefore I earnestly beg you help us to have these Indian children removed from these public schools or prevented from going there.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nE.

During that year the total expenditure for salaries and grants to day schools and boarding schools was $115,719.00, of which amount $61,499.00 (or 53.2%) was paid to the Roman Catholic teachers and schools.\n\nFor the same year the Protestant population was 12,422, or 50.2% of the total population. The expenditure on salaries and grants in connection with the Protestant schools was $61,499.00, being 53.2% of the\ntotal expenditure.\n\nYou will see from the above that so far as the expenditure for salaries and grants is concerned the amounts paid to Protestants and Roman Catholics were very nearly in ratio to the population.\n\nI have also made an examination of the amounts expended on buildings and repairs in this province for the five years ending March 31st, 1915. This statement shows approximately an expenditure on Roman Catholic schools of $217,985.00, and on Protestant schools of $50,754.00. The expenditure on Roman Catholic schools was largely incurred in the erection of the new buildings at Kootenay and Kuper Island. These are the two finest Indian schools in the province and at no point are there any Protestant schools that can compare with them. You will see from this statement that in the way of capital expenditure the Roman Catholics have had during the past five years a decided advantage.\n\nThere are only eleven Roman Catholic day schools in operation out of a total of forty-six. I understand the policy of the Roman Catholic Church is not favourable to the erection of day schools and that their authorities are of opinion that our best educational work is performed in residential schools. In Indian Agencies where the vocations of the Indians are hunting and fishing it is held to be almost impossible to establish day schools and the Roman Catholic authorities urge upon us the establishment of boarding schools in these outlying districts. As a case in point you will remember the Roman Catholic Boarding School at Fort St. James, where we have just this autumn authorized a grant to 50 pupils at $125.00 per capita.\nI think it will be conceded that these statements show that the Indian educational work of the Roman Catholic Church in British Columbia is being generously acknowledged and is receiving equitable support.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nJune 25th, 1917.\n\nDear Father Welch,\n\nI have pleasure in informing you that after discussing the matter with the Hon. Dr. Roche, we have decided to give the boarding and industrial schools an increase of $10.00 per capita in the grant for the current fiscal year. This will apply only to the end of this year, when we will consider the then position of the schools.\n\nI hope this will be a measure of relief to the administrators of the schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nI have just received your communication of the 25th ult. and hasten to thank you for the financial aid promised to our Indian boarding and industrial schools. It is fresh proof of your interest in their general welfare, and will be much appreciated.\n\nI am sure you will often have a remembrance in the prayers of the good Sisters in Sechelt and North Vancouver who have long carried a particularly heavy burden. Believe me-\n\nYours sincerely and gratefully,\n\nJ. Weller\n\nDuncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent-General,\nOttawa.\nWINNIPEG, July 23rd 1917.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nOf Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nOwing to absence, the letter of the Department of Indian Affairs announcing the increase of the per capita grant for the Indian Residential Schools only reached me a few days ago. I have already taken means to have your wise and very reasonable recommendation regarding economy communicated to the Principals of the Schools directed by the Oblate Fathers under my jurisdiction.\n\nI have no doubt that the increase will be greatly welcomed and I beg to extend in the name of those interested very sincere thanks.\n\nI have the honor to remain,\n\nYour very obedient servant,\n\n+ Alfred A. Vincente,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg.\nLe Pas, Man. 19 July, -17.\n\nDunlop Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor of acknowledging receipt of your letter of the 27th of June in which you inform us that a grant of $10.00 will be added to the per capita grant for the children in Boarding schools.\n\nI beg to express you and to the Department my most sincere thanks for that favor. It was needed, for I was myself wondering if we would be able to keep up our Boarding schools on account the high price for everything.\n\nI have already given my instructions to the Principals to reduce the expenses and practice the strictest economy.\n\nI remain yours truly,\n\n+ O. Charlebois, S.J.\nBishop of Keewatin.\nJuly 28th, 1917.\n\nDear Father Grandin,\n\nI have pleasure in informing you that after discussing the matter with the Hon. Dr. Roche, we have decided to give the boarding and industrial schools an increase of $10.00 per capita in the grant for the current fiscal year. This will apply only to the end of this year, when we will consider the then position of the schools.\n\nI hope this will be a measure of relief to the administrators of the schools.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nVicar of Missions,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nSir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter from the Department, communicated to me by His Lordship Right Reverend A. Pascal Bishop of Prince Albert, regarding the increase of the per capita grant. I want to offer, in reply, my most sincere thanks to Department for its liberality in support of Residential Indian schools. It is a great help and it will be highly appreciated.\n\nYou may be sure that efforts will be made to carry out the Department's desire in exercising the strictest economy in order to reduce the cost of maintaining these schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Wetell\n\nPrincipal\n\nDuncan B. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nTo His Grace,\n\nArchbishop Matheson,\nBishop's Court,\nWinnipeg, MAN.\n\nYour Grace:\n\nI apologize for having waited so long to send in the required information promised in my letter of October 21st. The reason of my delay is the present influenza epidemic. I visited our Indian schools and had to remain in some a longer time than I expected at first.\n\nFrom the reports I have read, all our schools without exception have been unable to meet all their expenses. Where there is a farm attached to the institution, things are a little better, still they also show a deficit.\n\nThe country is in a very difficult financial situation, this is plain; therefore each citizen must do his share in helping the country to alleviate the common burden; on account of that we do not want to ask more than is strictly necessary. We think that another grant of $10.00 per capita would help us greatly, and perhaps enable us to get through the crisis safely, though with some sacrifices.\n\nWe would be much obliged if Your Grace could settle this with the Department at Ottawa, in the name of all.\n\nThanking you for your kindness I remain,\n\nYour Grace's\n\nmost humble servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial.\nDecember 16th, 1918.\n\nRev. Sir -\n\nHis Grace Archbishop Matheson has transmitted to me your communication of December 3rd, in reference to the grants to be paid Indian residential schools.\n\nIn reply I would state that the Honourable the Superintendent General intends to consider the whole question of Indian education, with special reference to the present financial grants, when he is dealing with the Supplementary Estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\nI do not think it would be possible to give any special consideration to any school or schools; our policy will be to treat all schools alike.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Ils ont d\u00e9j\u00e0 une lourde dette.\n\nAvant la guerre vous supportiez cette \u00e9cole, je ne demande pourquoi vous ne continuez pas \u00e0 la soutenir. Ce n'est pas\nla faute des sauvages, ou la faute des missionnaires si les vivres contenus plus cher et ont fait payer des frais par le transport.\n\nJe persiste \u00e0 croire que c'est une question de justice que vous deviez r\u00e9gler, une dette que vous devez payer.\n\nJe n'ai pas encore la main le chiffre exact du d\u00e9ficit depuis quatre ans mais vous pouvez le trouver dans le m\u00e9moire qui vous a \u00e9t\u00e9 envoy\u00e9 par les missionnaires d'Albany. Et si vous ne le trouvez pas, j'en demanderai une copie au P\u00e8re Carrier qui demeure \u00e0 Hearst o\u00f9 je commencerai \u00e0 r\u00e9sider vers le 15 septembre.\n\nEn attendant, je vous remercie pour cette petite augmentation, comptant bien que vous r\u00e9glerez le tout bient\u00f4t.\n\nVoil\u00e0 ma croix,\n\nMonsieur le Secr\u00e9taire,\n\nVotre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9,\n\nJos. Hall\u00e9ghin\n\nPrefet apostolique de l'Ontario-Nord.\nArchbishopric of Quebec,\n\nQuebec, Aug.11, 1919.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nAs the Catholic Indians of James Bay have been under my jurisdiction for several years, Mgr. Latulippe has forwarded me your letter of July 9 No.289032-R.\n\nThe increase in the grant of $10.00 per head is evidently very far from corresponding with the increase in the cost of living.\n\nI cannot understand how the poor Oblate missionaries can keep up the school at Albany. They are already heavily in debt. Before the war you supported the school. I wonder why you do not continue to maintain it. It is not the fault of the Indians nor the fault of the missionaries if commodities cost more, and it is necessary to pay ten cents a pound for shipment.\n\nI hold to the belief that it is a question of justice that you should settle, and a debt that you should pay.\n\nI have not at hand the exact statement of the deficit during the past four years, but you can find it in the statement that was sent you by the Albany missionaries, and if you do not find it I shall ask for a copy from Father Carriere who lives at Hearst, where I am to live about September 15.\n\nIn the meantime I have to thank you for this small increase and trust that you will settle the matter soon.\n\nBelieve me, as-\n\nRos. Halle, Priest,\nApostolic prefect,\nof Northern Ontario.\nOttawa, August 29, 1919.\n\nRev. Sir -\n\nI have your letter of the 11th inst., acknowledging the increase in the grant we made to boarding schools. While the increase in the per capita grant is not large, no further appropriation could be had at present. I regret that the Department cannot consider responsibility for deficits incurred by the management of these institutions. All our schools are on the same basis and have been treated alike. I hope that the management at Albany will be able to conduct their school this year without any deficit.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Joseph Halle,\n\nArchbishop's Palace,\n\nQuebec, Que.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn one of our conversations, in your office, about a year ago, I drew your attention to the fact that some of our Indian boarding schools should receive a larger grant than some others; and my reason for this claim was that there were greater expenses to be met in schools far from the railways. When we have to pay one dollar, and in some cases, two dollars freight on all supplies, more than in schools situated on railway lines, it seems only just and right that the grant to the former schools should be larger in order to meet the larger expenses. This is true of the schools in Onion Lake, Cold Lake, Blue Quill's the Blood and Peigan reserves. With the price of every thing, freight included, soaring higher up every day, I must in justice to the above schools ask you to take this matter into consideration, and to give them an increase in the grant per capita, or a lump sum large enough to make up for the extra expenses incurred by said schools. We try as a rule to do our work on the grant allowed by the Deptt. but in these cases, it cannot be expected that we could give the children the food and clothes they have been receiving so far, if we do not get help from you.\n\nIn the hope that you will acknowledge the justice of my claim, and be able to grant it, I remain, Dear Sir,\n\nyours respectfully\n\n[Signature]\nJune 10, 1920.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, in reference to an increased grant to certain of the Roman Catholic schools where large expense is incurred on account of having to freight in supplies.\n\nI regret very much that Parliament has made no provision for any increase in the grant to boarding and industrial schools, this year, and it is not possible therefore for me to give favourable consideration to your request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. H. Grandin, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers,\nProvincial House,\n101st, 107th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nIndian Industrial School\nAt\nLebret - Sask.\nDec 7th, 1920.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your request for a general report on the financial standing of the Qu'Appelle School I beg to submit the following which comprises three periods, showing the cost of maintenance of the school and the receipts from the Indian Department and other sources to meet the expenditures.\n\nFrom March 31st 1918 to March 31st 1919, the fiscal year of 12 months, the total receipts were $39,552.56 and the expenditure was $30,192.32 covering the following accounts: Freight, Fuel, Light, House Equipment & Expense, Repairs, Farm, Recruiting, Salaries and Miscellaneous, leaving a balance of $9360.26 for Provisions and Clothing of 190 pupils for 12 months, less one month holidays, although a number of pupils remain here during vacation, this rating would show hardly $50.00 a year per pupil or about 16\u00a2 per day for the most important duty of clothing and feeding the pupils. The Government Grant being $130.00 per capita.\n\nFrom March 31st 1919 to March 31st 1920, fiscal year of 12 months, the total receipts were $38,861.19 and the expenditure, for the same accounts as the previous year, was $25,578.97 leaving a balance of $13,082.22 for Provisions and Clothing of 185 pupils, for same period as previous year, showing an allowance of about 22\u00a2 per pupil per day. The Government Grant for this period was $140.00 per capita.\n\nFrom March 31st 1920 to Nov 30th 1920, a period of 8 months, at the rate of $140.00 per capita, the total receipts were $23,161.28 and the expenditure, for the same accounts, was $15,243.43 leaving a balance of $7917.85 for Provisions and Clothing of 210 pupils or about 16\u00a2 per day per pupil.\n\nDuring the last period there were three employees less thereby making a saving of a certain amount but the Farm\nFarm crop was a total failure producing only 3 bushels to the acre which will mean a greater expenditure for feed, grain and potatoes.\n\nWith high prices still prevailing, particularly the necessaries, such as Flour, Beef, Sugar, Tea, Clothing, Leather and Fuel, it is impossible to meet the expenditures necessary for the proper maintenance of the school and leaving us each year with a large deficit which must be met at some future date.\n\nIf the grant per capita was raised in proportion to the advanced cost of the necessaries of living a good showing can be made in all departments of the school without having an annual deficit such as has been in the past.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nRev L.

Canon Gould,\n   General Secretary of the Missionary Society.\n\nare unanimously agreed upon the following conclusions, which the joint-deputation crave permission to submit as requisite and urgent requests to the authorities concerned, of the Dominion Government.\nConclusion I:\n\nThat the present scale of per capita grants, inclusive of the special war bonus of $20.00 allowed for pupils in Indian Residential Schools, be made the permanent scale, and that to meet, in part, the heavy increase in the costs of supplies, equipment and maintenance, a bonus of $10.00 per pupil be added thereto all round.\n\nConclusion II:\n\nThat since financial deficits in the maintenance of Indian Residential Schools frequently arise in large part from the fact that although the Church is compelled to organize and maintain the schools on the basis of an attendance of the maximum number of pupils for which the schools have accommodation, a lesser number of pupils are actually in attendance, the Government put into force the Compulsory clause of the revised Indian Act, and secure an attendance of the maximum number of pupils at each and all Indian Residential Schools.\n\nAll of which, on behalf of the joint-deputation, is very respectfully submitted.\n\nS.

A. Dennis, M.D.\n\nPrincipal\nMon bien cher p\u00e8re Guy,\n\nEn cons\u00e9quence de la fameuse r\u00e9union du 7 janvier je vous adresse les rapports ci-joints indiquant les recettes et d\u00e9penses ainsi que les d\u00e9ficits de nos \u00e9coles, depuis 1922. Vous \u00eates assez au courant de nos affaires d'\u00e9coles indiennes pour vous rendre compte que les d\u00e9ficits proviennent de la diff\u00e9rence entre l'octroi gouvernemental et les d\u00e9penses totales. Ce d\u00e9ficit serait encore plus grand si nous tenions compte du salaire que devrait recevoir les principaux, leurs assistants, les s\u0153urs et les ma\u00eetres; ce salaire est en certains cas vraiment d\u00e9risoire. Comment est combl\u00e9 le d\u00e9ficit? par les \u00e9conomies provenant des produits des fermes des directeurs, -oblats,- par le travail des s\u0153urs, des fr\u00e8res et des p\u00e8res, et, en certaines circonstances, comme par exemple \u00e0 Lebret, en engloutissant dans le caisse de l'\u00e9cole les fonds des oblats.\n\nIl me manque le rapport de l'\u00e9cole de Marieval, Sask., d\u00e9pendante de St-Boniface. Le R.P. Naessens m'a fait parvenir le rapport de toutes ses \u00e9coles, Le R.P. Bellemare ne m'a pas encore r\u00e9pondu; chez lui les communications sont plus difficiles.\n\nVous aurez dans ces divers rapports la mati\u00e8re d'un bon dossier.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn accordance with the request of The Honorable Sir James Lougheed, Minister of the Interior and Inspector General of Indian Affairs, to a Deputation from various Religious Denominations in charge of Indian Schools, I take the liberty of handing you the financial Statements of 17 Schools in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, covering the period from 1912 to 1921.\n\nI would call to your attention the fact that in every case the deficit would be larger if a reasonable salary was paid to the Principals, Assistants, Sisters and Teachers. In some cases the salary is simply a derision.\n\nKindly note the remarks of Rev. Fr G. Leonard O.M.I., Principal of Lebret Industrial School about the small deficit of 1917-18 and the following explanation:\n\n\"Greater Production was urgently advocated at this time and the School did extensive farming that year thereby deriving a large revenue but after this the Department advised us to curtail our farming operations as the Indians were complaining that their children were working too hard. The next year and the following this was done and, naturally, the deficit increased each year afterward.\"\n\nHoping that these Financial Statements will prove of interest to the Department, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, February 24, 1921.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant enclosing financial statements from the Roman Catholic Indian residential schools in the provinces of Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, covering the period from 1912 to 1921.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 14, 1921.\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFollowing your request in our conversation of the 7th instant re means to enforce compulsory education of Indians, according to The Indian Act of 1920, I beg to send a translation of Rev. Fr Baillargeon's remarks in the matter. Rev. Fr Baillargeon is Principal of Muscowequan Indian Boarding School. His letter is dated March 1st and is translated as follows:\n\n\"I would be highly interested to know if the Department has the intention to enforce the law of compulsory education for the Indians. What a relief it would be for me to learn one day of the appointment of a special officer with full authority. It is really provoking to see people of so inferior a condition as the Indians, who, for the most part are ignorant of the first word about education, dictate laws to us and raise all possible difficulties when they have to place their children at school. I am positive that if the gentlemen in charge of the Indian Department were completely aware of the circumstances and were themselves in our position that they would immediately put the law into force. For my part, I am convinced that most of the agents are bound by so many things that they are not free to see to the proper enforcement of the law. I am of the opinion that a Police Officer or Constable would be the only proper man to uphold the authority of the law and have it respected. He would be the only one having the necessary liberty and authority to enforce the different laws regarding the Indians and specially that of school attendance, which is not an easy problem. The Department is to be congratulated for having enacted such a Law.\"\nI hope that the gentlemen in charge will consider the appointment of a proper official who would have full authority to settle any question without committing himself or compromising important matters. By such a nomination the success of educational and religious efforts would be secured and it would be for us a real pleasure to send the Indians with their foolish and unreasonable complaints to an independent tribunal.\n\nI may add that Rev. Fr Baillargeon voices the sentiments of all the Principals which whom I have treated educational problems, and I am sincerely hoping that the Department will find the proper means to enforce the Law of compulsory education.\n\nWill you kindly note also that this request was presented by the Deputation that waited upon Sir James Lougheed, on January 7th.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy\nApril 26th, 1921.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nRelative to the bonus of $20.00 per capita, for the present fiscal year only, to augment the regular per capita grant provided for the Indian Residential Schools, a sum sufficient for the purpose was included in the Department's estimate for submission to Parliament at the present Session, and it may be assumed that the necessary appropriation for the purpose will be approved.\n\nI would suggest that the payment of this bonus be made quarterly, on receipt of the usual returns of attendance, and that in calculating the amount due each quarter, the bonus be treated as an increased per capita grant and paid on the average attendance as shown by the returns, in the same manner as the regular per capita grant. This will simplify our book-keeping and accounting.\n\nI will be pleased if you will let me know, at your convenience, whether it is desired that the cheques in payment of this bonus to the Roman Catholic Residential Schools be sent to the Principals as is done in the case of the regular per capita grants, or the wishes of the church authorities in the matter.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nFather Guy, on a recent visit to the Department, requested that, in future, the per capita grants to Kenora, Pine Creek, Cowessess and Muscowequans Boarding Schools be paid as follows; $120.00 per capita to the principal of each school and $25.00 per capita to Revs. Peres Oblates, 222 Provencher Ave., St. Boniface, Man. He was promised that this would be done.\nOttawa, Canada, June 21st /21\n\nMr Duncan C.

Fr Beys C.M.I., Provincial of the Oblate Fathers for Southern Manitoba and Southern Saskatchewan who has directed me to ask from the Department that the $20.00 bonus for the following schools be paid to: REVERENDS PERES OBLATS,\n\nviz: Qu'Appelle School at LEBRET, Sask., Cowesses School at CROOKED LAKE, Sask., Muscowequan School at LESTOCK, Sask., Pine Creek School at PINE CREEK, Man., Sandy Bay School at SANDY BAY, Man., Fort Alexander School at FORT ALEXANDER, Man., Fort Frances School at FORT FRANCES Ont., Kenora School at KENORA, Ont.,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy, O.M.I.\nOTTAWA, June 24th, 1921.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the payment of bonus of $20.00 per capita to the Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools during the present fiscal year.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that this bonus will be paid as directed by you in the case of each of the Catholic schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nRE: Sir:\n\nOn behalf of the R.C. Residential Schools I take the liberty of asking from the Department that the sum of $20.00 which was granted as an extra bonus for the fiscal year 1921-22 become permanent and therefore be added to the regular per capita grant.\n\nThe R.C. Indian Residential Schools form 55% of the total number of Residential Schools under the jurisdiction of the Department with a pupilage of over 60% of the Indian children of school age. I am officially making the present demand in the name of the Catholic Indian population at large as also in the name of the Superiors of Districts and School Principals.\n\nThe reasons brought forth in favor of this request are the same that were outlined to the Honorable the Minister of the Interior, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, by the joint deputation of Church representatives which waited upon him on January 7th of the present year. These reasons can be summed up in the high cost of supplies, equipment and maintenance.\n\nI hope that the Department will give this official due consideration and provide for the extra allowance in the estimates to be presented at the next Session of Parliament.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nJoseph [signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nNovember 30, 1921.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 30th November, in which you ask on behalf of the Roman Catholic Residential Schools that the sum of $20.00 granted as an extra bonus for the year 1921-22 become permanent and be added to the regular per capita grant.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter will be given consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

Fr Hugonard:\nRef: My letter of October 31st 1921 (No C-25)\nYour \" November 16th 1921\n\nJoseph Guy\nST. MICHAEL'S INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL\nBUCK LAKE, SASK., Sept. 23rd, 1921.\n\nW. H. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nREGINA, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI went to Regina last week to consult you concerning the Buck Lake Boarding School. Unfortunately you were away and today I beg leave to state in writing the purpose of my visit.\n\nThe need of larger and more up-to-date buildings is well known to you personally and to every Officer of the Indian Department who has visited the School. During your first visit to the School three years ago you were struck by the dilapidated condition of the School.\n\nWe thought the time inopportune to ask the Department for new buildings because labor was scarce, the cost of building exorbitant and the attention and efforts of the Government were absorbed by the all important problems of the war.\n\nNow that conditions are normal again, labor plentiful and price of building has considerably decreased, the Very Rev. Fr. Grandin, President of the Order of the Oblate Fathers, the Directors of the School, has petitioned the Department for new buildings.\n\nTo justify our request we submit to your consideration the following facts:\n\n(1) The reports of the Inspectors show that since its erection in 1894, the School has a splendid record and has done excellent and efficient work.\n\n(2) Since 1909 the School has been self-supporting and this is the first time we are asking for any financial assistance.\n\n(3) The character of the training given by the School is shown by the number of former pupils who enlisted during the war, as well as by the marked and increasing thrift and industry displayed by the pupils on the Reserves.\nW. H. Graham, Esq.\n\n(4) The fact that the School is always full to its capacity shows that it enjoys the full confidence of the Indians.\n\nHowever, the Oblate Fathers see opportunities for more efficient work and greater assistance to the Department in training and educating Indian children, if they had an up-to-date building that would accommodate 150 pupils.\n\nMost of the boys leave the Delmas and Onion Lake Schools at the age of fifteen or sixteen, that is, before they have acquired fixed habits of work, thrift and industry. Could we receive them here we are in a position to give them a thorough training in mixed farming and domestic science.\n\nWe have 1500 acres of land for farming and stock raising. This land was bought by the Oblate Fathers for the exclusive use of the School. We have a good water supply and the farm is equipped with ample machinery and barns. All we need now, to have a first class and up-to-date Indian School, is a larger and more modern building.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers are not now in a financial position to erect such buildings, this is why they are petitioning the Department for assistance.\n\nKnowing dear Sir, the special interest you take in the welfare of our Indian children, your long experience among them and the great influence you enjoy with the Department in your capacity of Indian Commissioner, I confidently ask you to approve and recommend our request.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd)\n\nPrincipal.\nREQUESTS made by Very Rev. Fr H GRANDIN O.M.I.\n\n(ALBERTA and MIDDLE PART OF SASKATCHEWAN)\n\n1o-RECONSTRUCTION OF DUCK LAKE INDIAN SCHOOL:\n\nThe question of the reconstruction of this important and very successful School has been seriously discussed this year and the principal arguments are embodied in a copy of a letter addressed to Mr Commissioner Graham hereto annexed. I understand that Mr Graham is giving his entire approval to this request and has consequently sent in his recommendation of same to the Department. Mr Ferrier after his appointment as Superintendent of Indian Education has visited Duck Lake School and struck by the splendid work achieved in it as also by the poor condition of its structure is fully endorsing this demand. Personally I consider the request for the reconstruction of Duck Lake School as the most important on my list and I therefore give my fullest recommendation to it. Of course a few problems would require discussion between the Department and the School authorities but I sincerely believe that an understanding can be easily reached to the satisfaction of all parties interested.\n\n2o-ERECTION OF A BOARDING SCHOOL ON COLD LAKE RESERVE:\n\nThe Department must have received a letter from Rt Rev. H-J. O'Leary, Archbishop of Edmonton asking for the appointment of a teacher for a day school on Cold Lake Reserve and possibly for the establishment of said day school if same is not in operation. This request is only in case there is no possibility for an immediate construction of a boarding school. Mr Ferrier has investigated into this matter and has also secured the opinion of Mr Graham and of the Agent of the Reserve and is prepared to speak in favor of the said construction if sufficient funds can be provided for in the estimates.\n\n3o-BOARDING SCHOOLS ON THE BLOOD AND PEIGAN RESERVES:\n\nRev. Fr Grandin, The Rev. Principals and the Sisters of both these institutions find the present situation almost intolerable on account of the material situation of the schools. During a trip to Ottawa Rev. Fr Grandin was made to understand that the urgent reparations necessary for both schools would be attended to and I have even on my file a letter from the Department dated June 16 1921 stating that it was the intention of the Department to \"keep the present buildings in a fair state of repair\". I am sorry to state that nothing has been done and the staff view with anxiety the coming of Winter.\n\nRev. Fr Grandin would welcome a definite solution in connection with those two schools and that of Dunbow as the Department contemplates the erection of a large school in Southern Alberta.\n\n4o-INCREASED PUPILAGE AT ERMINSKIN BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\nThe Principal of this School requests me to apply for the increasing of the number of children from 60 to 70 stating that he has erected a new dormitory with the consequence that he has the accommodation for the number of children requested.\n\n5o-INCREASED PUPILAGE AT BLUE QUILLS BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\nKindly refer to correspondence (file 118-1-1) in this matter.\n\nJoseph Henry.\nREQUESTS made by Rt Rev. Bishop CHARLEBOIS O.M.I.\n\n(MANITOBA NORTH and SASKATCHEWAN NORTH)\n\n1o-BEAUVAL INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\na) Installation of toilet and bath room fittings;\nRef: My letter U-2 of Oct.4, 1921\nYour \" 132-1-5 of Nov 21st, 1921.\n\nb) Request by His Lordship Bishop Charlebois for the sale to the Department of BEAUVAL School and buildings in connection therewith for the following reasons:\n\nI - Impossibility to make separations and improvements;\nII - The Department would be in a position to place said School on a better footing more in conformity with the standard of similar Schools;\nIII - The ground belongs to the Department, it would therefore be in order that the buildings belong to the same;\nIV - An extension will be necessary before long and His Lordship feels that he is not able to finance such an outlay;\nV - The School has to bear all expenses of upkeep etc., and if the grant is the same as some other schools where the Department covers all incidental and necessary expenditure. BEAUVAL School is situated at 125 miles from Railway communication.\n\n2o-CROSS LAKE INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL:\n\nAppropriation of attic as a dormitory for boys and girls. The annexed plan indicates alterations involving an expenditure of approximately $6,000.00. Those alterations are asked in lieu of the extension mentioned in my letter B-4 of Feb. 9th 1921 (answered by your letter of Feb. 21st) and for the same reasons. However if the Department would prefer to build an annex to the building the Principal and staff would look to such an improvement with very great satisfaction.\n\n3o-ERECITION OF A BOARDING SCHOOL AT STURGEON LANDING:\n\nThis request has already been made in my letter A-10 of May 28th 1921. Your letter (132-5-1) of June 18th advised me that said request was noted for future consideration. In a recent letter Rt Rev. Bishop Charlebois strongly urges me to bring this matter again to your attention in view of the next fiscal year.\n\n4o-APPOINTMENT OF AN AGENT FOR THE DISTRICT OF PELICAN NARROWS:\n\nI beg to refer you to my letter A-11 of May 25th, 1921 to which no answer was given by the Department.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nREQUESTS MADE BY Rt Rev.

DUNCAN SCOTT,\nDep't. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe provincial of the Oblate Fathers of the provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan, the Very Rev. J. B. Beys, O.M.I., has explained to me in full the present condition of the Indian Schools under his spiritual and temporal supervision. As several of these schools are in my Archdiocese I naturally take great interest in their welfare.\n\nThe Rev. Father has pointed out to me that owing to the fact that some of these schools belong to the Government and some of the Fathers themselves, the proper management of these schools has become very difficult and suggests for reasons that will be fully explained to you that it is most desirable that the Government should become the owner of all these Indian Schools.\n\nI heartily endorse Rev. Father Beys' opinions in this matter and hope that your Department will as soon as possible, take matters to bring about the desired change in the ownership of these schools so that the work so successfully conducted in Government owned schools under your jurisdiction, may be duplicated in the schools now owned by the Reverend Oblate Fathers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n+ O.

A careful inspection of these School Buildings whether situated in Ontario, Manitoba or Saskatchewan shows a want of unity in their management due mostly to the fact that the Government of Canada which pays in part for the upkeep of those schools is not the owner of the buildings proper. Whilst there are eight schools under our supervision, only four belong to the Government. Those of Pine Creek, Cowesses, Muskowekwan and Kenora were built and now are owned by the Corporation of the Oblate Fathers in Manitoba.\n\nB. A further consequence of this diversity of ownership is that Government Inspectors find themselves handicapped in their endeavors to secure uniform management of the schools in their inspection and are unable to give satisfaction to the staff, to the pupils and their parents.\n\nC. The Indians have come to look upon the schools belonging to our Corporation with disfavor and much prefer those schools which are the property of the Government. Being wards of the Government they feel perfectly at home in buildings belonging to it, but consider themselves as strangers in buildings belonging to private Corporations.\n\nD. Occasionally improvements of an absolutely urgent nature and which cannot be undertaken by the Oblate Fathers are made at the expense of the Government, and the Government is criticised for it on the ground that, as these buildings are not its property, it should not spend any money on them.\nStill, if the Government did not carry out these improvements, the Corporation of the Oblate Fathers would not be financially able to do so, and the consequence would be that these schools would be left in a condition materially inferior to the Schools belonging to the Government, and the staff of these schools would be greatly handicapped in its work and would probably be unable to carry out the instructions of the Government Inspectors.\n\nE. Under the present system the Department of Indian Affairs gives to the Corporation of the Oblate Fathers a per capita sum of $25.00 both for the upkeep of these schools and for interest on the investment. This sum is altogether inadequate for the purpose. As a result of our experience in the management of the schools belonging to our Corporation, we have come to the conclusion that our Corporation cannot any longer bear the burden of the maintenance of these schools for the per capita grant at present allowed, because this per capita is barely sufficient to keep the buildings in repairs and does not in any way provide for the improvements so widely recommended by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nAs an example of the unfair burden which the Oblate Fathers are asked to bear in the management of the schools which are their own property, we beg to instance the school of Pine Creek. This school represents an investment of $62,000.00. Allowing 6% interest per annum on the principal invested, 2% for depreciation, $400.00 for insurance and $200.00 for taxes, we have a total annual overhead outlay of $5,560.00. This latter amount does not at all provide for repairs. If 1% per annum were allowed for repairs, the total would be $6,180.00. The per capita grant for this school being $25.00 for eighty children, the sum which the Oblate Fathers receive from the Government is, therefore, $2,000.00. But they have to spend $6,180.00 to keep up the school. The weight of this burden is apparent to everybody and unless the Fathers receive help from the Government of some kind or another, they will eventually have to lay the burden down.\n\nWe might add that as the number of children authorized is almost never complete, in fact has never been so for a full period of one year, we have never received $2,000.00 in any given year, for the school of Pine Creek.\nMr. Duncan Scott #3.\n\nOur Corporation was induced in the past into investing large sums of money for the building of these schools in the hope that the extra per capita grant of the Government, coupled with private donations, would enable them to carry on the work of the schools and pay the interest on the large sums of money invested therein. As figures prove, their hopes were never realized and, if the past is a gauge of the future, they will never be.\n\nThe Oblate Fathers, therefore, realizing the many inconveniences of the present dual-ownership of the Indian Schools under their management, are ready to transfer to the Government, the ownership of the schools which they own for a sum of money even less than the present value of the buildings and lands on which these buildings are situated. The purchase of these schools will necessitate a considerable outlay of money on the part of the Government. The latter in return will become the owner of very valuable buildings and lands, and which is more important than anything else, will be in a position to establish absolute uniformity in the management and upkeep of all these Indian Schools.\n\nHoping your Department will consider this change favorable, we remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCORPORATION OF LES REVEREND PERES OBLATS,\n\nPer\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nFebruary 25, 1922.\n\nReverend Father Beys,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of February 17, which was presented by Rev. Father Plourde.\n\nI have to assure you that your request will have our careful and sympathetic attention. I am somewhat doubtful that we will be able to obtain this year the appropriations for new buildings for our residential schools throughout the country, as we are instructed by the Finance Department to be most economical, but this does not mean that the Department will not lay the applications that we have received before the Government and point out the necessity for adequate money grants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. B. Beys, O.M.I.,\nCorporation of The Reverend Oblate Fathers,\nWinnipeg, man.\nFebruary 25, 1922.\n\nDear Archbishop Mathieu,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of January 9, which was presented by Rev. Father Plourde.\n\nI have to assure Your Grace that the request presented by Father Beys will have our careful and sympathetic attention. I am somewhat doubtful that we will be able to obtain this year the appropriations for new buildings for our residential schools throughout the country, as we are instructed by the Finance Department to be most economical, but this does not mean that the Department will not lay the applications that we have received before the Government and point out the necessity for adequate money grants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMt. Rev. O. H. Mathieu, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Regina,\nRegina, Sask.\nMarch 7, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonourable Charles Stewart,\n\nI have read the attached letter from the Rev. J.B. Beys, Provincial of the Oblate Order, requesting that the Department assume the ownership, upon payment, of the Indian Boarding schools at Cowesses, Pine Creek, Muscowequan and Kenora.\n\nIt would certainly be in the interest of our work if all these buildings were owned by the government, as well as other boarding school buildings owned by the Roman Catholic Church and the Protestant Churches who are interested in Indian education. The union of the Church and State in this matter of Indian education is well recognized, and in 1911, when we made a new arrangement with the schools, the then Superintendent General, the Hon. Frank Oliver, laid down as a principle that we should own our own school buildings, although he did not pledge the government to acquire the existing boarding school buildings owned by the Churches. One can readily realize that individual capital expenditure and the upkeep of these buildings are a serious drain on Church funds.\n\nAs a matter of general policy, I am in favour of the acquisition of all these buildings. As you are aware our Estimates do not contemplate any building operations for the approaching fiscal year, but it might be well, and I would propose with your concurrence to do so, to submit supplementary estimates for the value of these buildings, (which seems to me would be fair) and to include the necessary buildings for the other Churches which are now on requisition, in order that the denominations may be treated fairly and equitably, and that the whole matter may receive the careful consideration of the government.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that we have in the Archdiocese of Vancouver, B.C., six Indian Boarding Schools. Three of these viz., St. Eugene, Kamloops, and Sechelt, belong to the Government. The other three, viz., St. Mary's Mission, St. Joseph's, Cariboo, and St. Paul's, Squamish, are the property of Religious Communities. The schools at Mission and at Cariboo belong to the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. The one at Squamish is owned by the Sisters of the Holy Infant.\n\nNow, as the Department is aware, we have carried on these schools for many, many years at considerable expense and self-sacrifice.\n\nIn the first place, we purchased the land and cleared it. Then we erected costly school buildings, and at Mission and Cariboo installed electric light and modern heating systems, and as time went on made many improvements, and all at our own expense. It has been a long and a hard struggle from the beginning. We have never taken any salaries, we could not afford to do so. The produce of the land and the entire Government Grant were needed for the running and upkeep of the schools.\nBut this condition of things we realize more and more is becoming insupportable. The Indian children after all are the wards of the Government, and so we have now come to the conclusion that it would be in the best interests of all concerned, to request the Government to purchase these schools from us.\n\nWe therefore respectfully venture to make this offer to you, feeling assured that you will give it your serious consideration.\n\nI have the honour to remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Welch, O.M. P.\nOttawa, March 29, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welsh:\n\nI have yours of the 14th instant, referring to the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding Schools and the Cariboo Industrial School - all three the property of Roman Catholic Orders.\n\nIn reply to your request that the Government purchase these institutions, I wish to state that I believe such action would be in the best interests of our Indian wards and would relieve the Church of the expense that it has long been bearing. The policy of this Department is to assume such responsibilities whenever we are successful in having funds voted for the purpose.\n\nAt present, the condition of the country's finances is such that all expenditures not absolutely necessary are being curtailed. For the coming fiscal year, the amount voted for Indian Education will be sufficient to meet the needs of only those institutions that are already owned by the Department. In the interim before moneys are released for a more extensive programme for Indian Education, all that this Department can do for church-owned institutions, in addition to the per capita grant, will, as in the past, be freely offered.\n\nLater, I will be glad to entertain such a request on the part of the Roman Catholic Church in British Columbia.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSUGGESTIONS\n\n1o-HOSPITALS:-The suggestion has come from Rev. Sister Superior of Crowfoot School that instead of the travelling nurses presently employed by the Department one of the sisters in the different schools be appointed in charge of the reserve with a salary. She would attend to the needs of the Indians who have far more confidence in the nuns than in the Government nurses. In connection with this suggestion which the Rev. Sister Superior was making for her own school but which can be extended to a certain number of schools and reserves the Department could, for a small outlay, build a bungalow near those schools ($2,000.00 would cover the expense) where the sick Indians could go. It would be a great economy for the Department. I must state that during my visit to different Catholic Schools during Summer I found out that in all those schools there was at least one trained nurse with many years experience among the sisters. I am prepared to discuss this suggestion at length with the Department if it is found opportune.\n\n2o-TRAVELLING NURSES:-I take the liberty to ask that this position be abolished after the experiences made by the Department. As above stated all our Catholic schools are provided with trained and experienced nurses who are more interested in the Indians and have had more experience with them than the young ladies sent by the Department. I do not wish to enter into the detail of the complaints which have come to me from every quarter but I am in a position to show facts substantiating my words and I am prepared to discuss this question at length with the Department. Presently, for the sake of economy, I repeat that this institution is useless and a source of unnecessary expenses.\n\n3o-PROPORTION OF CATHOLICS:-In preparing the estimates I would suggest that you keep in view the proportion of\nSUGGESTIONS\n\nCatholic Schools and Children and appropriate the amounts according to that proportion. This seems to me but reasonable and I have been requested by a number of our head men to impress this point upon the Department. I leave the matter entirely to your discretion as my past experience with the Department speaks highly of the latter's good intentions.\n\n4o-PUBLIC SCHOOL INSPECTORS:-I must state that the inspection of the Catholic Indian Schools does not meet with favor amongst the Catholics. I know that such an inspection was being made in the Maritime Provinces, in Quebec and Ontario but allow me to state that in those Provinces there are Public and Separate Schools and the inspection of the latter is made by Catholic inspectors. Therefore the inspection of Catholic Indian Schools is made by Catholic inspectors.\n\nIn the Western Provinces the situation is different as the principle of Separate Schools is not admitted. A few complaints have reached me one of which has been transmitted to the Department. Outside of the results I wish to lay stress on the fact that this is also a matter of principle and of rights assured us. The history of the first treaties made between the Government and the Indians is interesting in this matter.\n\n5o-DISCHARGE FROM SCHOOL:-It is found an inconvenience to discharge girls at 16 and the suggestion is here made to extend that age to 18 for all the schools.\nSPECIAL REQUESTS\n\n1o-REV. FR HUGONARD'S MONUMENT:- A grant of $1,000.00 has been included in the present year's estimates but as there is probability that the monument will not be finished at the end of the fiscal year and consequently the amount will not be available I respectfully ask that the request for the amount be renewed in the estimates for the next fiscal year.\n\n2o-$20.00 INCREASE IN PER CAPITA GRANT:- Last year I asked that the $20.00 grant allowed the previous year become part of the per capita grant. The increase was kept on during the present fiscal year but I do not know if same is considered as part of the per capita grant or not. In case it is not I would renew the same request as last year.\n\n3o-APPOINTMENT OF AGENT AT PELICAN NARROWS:- This request was made last year and I respectfully refer you to my letter of May 25th, 1921, to which no answer was given by the Department.\n\n4o-CONVENT AND CHURCH AT TOBIQUE:- Rev. Fr Hugolin must have attended to this matter and I simply mention it at present.\n\nJoseph [signature]\nUNIVERSITY OF OTTAWA\n\nOttawa, November 27th, 1922.\n\nMr Duncan J. Scott,\nDep. Supt Gen. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott,\n\nPlease find annexed list of requests in view of the Estimates to be voted at the next Session of Parliament. I take the liberty of giving a list of major requests in the order of their importance according to the needs of the Indians and our own desires:\n\n1o-RECONSTRUCTION OF KAMLOOPS SCHOOL; \u221a\n2o-CONSTRUCTION OF A SCHOOL AT STURGEON LANDING;\n3o-\" AND REOPENING OF ST PHILIP SCHOOL; \u221a\n4o-RECONSTRUCTION OF DUCK LAKE SCHOOL;\n5o-CONSTRUCTION OF ANNEX TO CROSS LAKE SCHOOL; \u221a\n6o-\" \" \" \" FORT FRANCES SCHOOL;\n7o-PURCHASE OF BEAUVAL SCHOOL;\n8o-\" \" PINE CREEK SCHOOL;\n9o-\" \" ST MARY'S MISSION SCHOOL;\n10o-CONSTRUCTION OF STABLES AT FORT ALEXANDER SCHOOL.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Eay, o.m.d.\nOttawa, Dec. 4, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter of the 27th ultimo, showing a list of the most important needs for the coming fiscal year at Indian residential schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. Writings showing the special needs at each school are also received, and the majority of the items have been placed in the initial draft of the Estimates for Indian Education, 1923-24.\n\nI wish to assure you that I will urge the Honourable the Superintendent General to ask the Government for a large appropriation for the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe inexpensive equipment requested for Fort Frances, Sandy Bay and Cowessess Boarding Schools should be brought to the attention of the local agents by the Rev. Principals. The Department will initiate a correspondence with our representative, concerning the low level of the water in the pressure tank at Sechelt.\n\nIn reply to the request of the Principal of the Ermineeskine Boarding School, I am directing that a letter be addressed to him, offering an increased pupilage if he will make arrangements for added accommodation.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joe. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, Jan. 29, 1923.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that the Department of Customs and Excise has ruled that Indian residential schools owned by the Government are exempt from the sales tax on their purchases, provided the materials purchased are for their own use and not for resale. You may inform the Principals of the Fort Frances, Kenora, Fort Alexander, Cross Lake, Sandy Bay, Qu'Appelle, Crowfoot, Blood, Kamloops and Fraser Lake Schools of this ruling.

To establish the precedent, $48,000 was voted for the present fiscal year, and the purchase of the institution at Kenora is now in hand. The arrangements in this connection and for the purchase of all church-owned Indian residential schools, that are modern and adequate for the purpose of Indian education, were the result of the conference held between church representatives and the Hon.

The approximate value, also, was mentioned. A copy of that recapitulation is attached to this memorandum. In view of Archbishop Mathieu's request, it might be advisable to entertain the purchase this coming fiscal year, of the Muscowequan School at Leetchiok. Mr. Grace states in his letter that he has learned that $35,000 is being appropriated and that this is the amount that he has asked for Muscowequan's. In Father Beys' valuation of the boarding schools, based on the cost with 2% depreciation per annum, the amount for Muscowequan's is $55,000. This is divided as follows:\n\n- Main building .................. $35,000.00\n- Barn .................................. 5,000.00\n- Other outbuildings .............. 4,000.00\n- Furniture and implements ....... 3,000.00\n- Livestock .......................... 5,000.00\n- Quarter section of land ...... 3,000.00\n\nIt will be noted that funds will not be available for the purchase of the whole plant, unless Father Beys is agreeable to a much reduced valuation.\n\nI think it unfair to other diocesan authorities and Oblate provincials if we first purchase the four institutions mentioned by Archbishop Mathieu.

I naturally expect that this year the Government will further implement its promise made last year by purchasing one of the three remaining schools. I understand that you have appropriated the sum of $35,000 for this purpose. As this is the amount that I have asked for the school situated at Lestock and known as the Cowessess school I hope that you will use this amount for that purpose.\n\nI understand that demands similar to the one which I am now making have been proposed to your Department. I am in full sympathy with these other requests but I feel sure that you will agree with me that the Government should fulfill its promise to me before entertaining the purchase of schools situated outside of my jurisdiction.\n\nThanking you, my dear Mr. Scott, for the attention which you have already given to this matter and hoping that you bring it to a satisfactory conclusion,\n\nI remain,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

An understanding was reached that the Government would relieve the Church of capital expense at Indian residential schools when funds could be provided to meet the needs. Further, it was understood that the Government would favourably consider the purchase, from the churches, of modern institutions adequate for the purpose of Indian education. The principle was established this fiscal year: $48,000 was voted in the supplementary Estimates, 1922-23, for the purchase of the Kenora Indian Residential School from the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nArchbishop Mathieu, of Regina, and the Provincial of the Oblate Order, Father Boye, of Winnipeg, have named three other schools the transfer of which is requested. Other diocesan authorities of the Roman Catholic Church have offered other schools to this Department.\n\nIn the Main Estimates for Indian Education, 1923-24, there are included two items in this connection. It was proposed to purchase one Roman Catholic school in northern Ontario and the Young Men's Boarding School under Presbyterian auspices, in southern Saskatchewan.\n\nArchbishop Mathieu is pressing that his requests be favourably considered first, and is hoping that any money voted will be used to effect a transfer of some of the property at one of three schools in his diocese, viz: Pine Creek, Kuesowegan's and Cowessess. At his Grace and the Oblate representatives have been the first to approach the Government in connection with the purchase of Indian residential schools; some consideration should be made, in view of their initiative.\n\nThe transfer of the Kenora Boarding School, which was provided for this present fiscal year, is about to be completed.

The Government's intention is to relieve the churches of capital expense at Indian residential schools.\n\nA year ago, Archbishop Mathieu of Regina, in conjunction with the Provincial of the Oblate Order, Father Heys of Winnipeg, requested that the Government purchase four modern, up-to-date Roman Catholic institutions in the West. Funds were provided in this connection, in the Supplementary Estimates, 1922-23, and the transfer of the Lenora Indian Residential School from the Roman Catholic Church to the Crown is nearing completion.\n\nIn pursuance of this policy, there are in the Main Estimates, 1923-24, two items with reference to acquiring from the churches Indian residential school property. It is proposed to purchase, this coming fiscal year, one Roman Catholic school and one Presbyterian school. The Roman Catholic institution is one of the three remaining schools in which His Grace Archbishop Mathieu and Father Heys of Winnipeg are interested, and in this regard we are able to meet their wishes, if Parliament sees fit to allow the item.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nList of Residential Schools at which part of grant is paid\n\n& Rev.

The course above indicated would bring such difficulties to an end.\n\nMoreover, those orphans could become the nucleus of an Indian Industrial School in the N.W.T. We would cooperate with the Department by keeping them on our farms where our brothers could teach them different trades as well as the kind of farming most suited to the northern country.\n\nI leave the matter to your judicious and kind consideration and I am positive that you will certainly take action for the benefit of those poor orphans.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, Oct. 17, 1923.\n\nDear Bishop Breynat:\n\nWith reference to our conversation and in answer to Your Lordship's letter of the 6th instant, relative to orphan and destitute Indian children in the North West Territories, I wish to assure you that your recommendations will not be overlooked. Our agents are being advised to give the preference to such children when vacancies occur at Indian residential schools, and they have also been instructed to put into effect the compulsory clause that is on the statutes, in this connection, without hesitation.\n\nWhen any orphan boy or girl is about to graduate from one of the schools in your diocese, it might be well to correspond with the Department, relative to the advisability of having him or her kept on one of your farms or placed with some Sister's community.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nBishop of Mackenzie,\nFort Resolution,\nN.W.T.\nOttawa, October 23rd, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department desires, in future, when recruiting is being done for residential schools in your Agency, that preference be given to the case of orphan and destitute children. As you are, no doubt, aware, many cases arise where children of these classes are neglected, ill-treated and are often the cause of family quarrels. In order to provide for the proper care of such children, it is considered that it would be in their best interests to place them in residential schools where they can be properly looked after, and, at the same time, receive an education and training. It should be understood, however, that in recruiting such children only those of school age and in good health should be placed in school. If in any case the parents of a neglected child or the guardian of an orphan refuse to allow such child to be sent to a school, you should take the necessary action under Section 10 of the Indian Act to have such a child placed in school. You will be good enough to inform the Principals of the schools in your Agency of the Department's desire that preference be given to orphan and neglected children, and they should make every effort to see that children of these classes receive favourable consideration when recruiting is being done for their schools. Care should, however, be taken to see that such child is admitted only to a school conducted under the religious denomination to which he or she belongs.\n\nWhen an orphan boy or girl is about to graduate from a school conducted under the auspices of the R.C. Church, you should correspond with the Department relative to the advisability of having the boys kept on one of the farms, where the Brothers could teach them different trades, as well as the kind of farming most suited to the northern country, and the girls could be placed in a community under the charge of the Sisters.\n\nThe school authorities and yourself will please be guided by the above requirements of the Department in all future recruiting for residential schools in your Agency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

Fr McGuire O.M.I., Principal of Kamloops Indian Industrial School. I have no commentaries to add to those of Rev. Fr McGuire and I leave the whole matter to your judicious consideration. Kindly return letters after perusal.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy\n\n[Signature]\nDecember 29, 1923.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI am returning to you the two letters from Father McGuire, which you so kindly let me read. When we meet again, which I hope may not be long delayed, we will have a conversation on the subject of the Indian Agency at Kamloops.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa.\nFort Simpson, N.W.T.,\nJan. 3rd, 1924\n\nSir,-\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter #160-5, of October 23rd, 1923, re recruiting for schools.\n\nIn the past, I have endeavoured to follow the line of conduct which you lay down for my guidance in the said letter.\n\nSince the appointment of an Agent at Fort Resolution, in whose Agency Fort Providence is included, there is no residential school in my Agency.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD.M. Harris,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nWhile visiting our Indian Schools of the Blood and Peigan Reserves, I learned of the complaints lodged by different Inspectors concerning the insufficient knowledge of English and in particular of the faulty pronunciation of some of the Sisters connected with these institutions.\n\nI frankly admit that in this matter all is not as perfect as would be desired; we will do our best to remedy this as much and as soon as is possible. Still it would not do to exaggerate the seriousness of this matter, nor should these complaints make us overlook certain other points of far greater importance than the defective pronunciation of English.\n\nI would, therefore call the attention of the Department to the following observations, which those interested in the success of our Indian Schools ought to take into account.\n\nI -\nMost of the Indian Children upon their arrival at the school do not know a word of English, the only language authorized by the Department in the imparting of knowledge at these schools. Confide these children to the most eminent professor of the most celebrated University of the British Empire; of what use will be the purity of his language, the correctness of his accent be, if the pupils do not understand him?\n\nIn our schools there is a preliminary grade of instruction, absolutely necessary, wherein the knowledge of English and the English accent are of but secondary importance. And this preliminary instruction requires of the teacher special qualities on account of the inferiority of the Indian Children who, unlike the White Children, do not speak English before coming to School.\n\nII -\nLet us suppose that the teachers have a perfect knowledge of English and that they have not the slightest trace of a foreign accent, and let us suppose that they succeed in imparting to their pupils such a knowledge of English that their accent does not betray their Indian origin. Would this be sufficient to justify anyone in saying: This instruction is excellent, this education perfect? Certainly not! And why? For the simple reason that language is only a means of communication, and education comes chiefly from what is communicated and from the manner in which it is communicated; because intellectual and moral training require a proficiency far other than that of accent and diction. This proficiency in accent and diction is no test or criterion of the intellectual, and much less of the moral, value of a person.\n\nNo one would dream of maintaining the intellectual and moral competency exclude competency in any language, but the former competency infinitely surpasses the latter, so that if there are to be deficiencies in the educator, it is preferable that they be in his accent rather than in his intellectual worth or in his moral character.\n\nIII -\nLet us enter further into the matter and suppose that we have been fortunate enough to secure the services of teachers with all the diplomas granted by Elementary Schools and by High Schools, teachers having at their service experience accumulated during years of teaching White Children: is all this sufficient to make of such men competent teachers in our Indian Schools? It is not. And this point is one that should be insisted on, because it does not seem to be understood that teaching and education in these Indian Schools have something all their own, a special character or stamp, and require special qualities in the educator. The value of our Indian Schools is judged by a comparing of them with Schools attended by White Children. The same criterion is used in judging both. This all starts from a wrong point of view which, if justice is to be done, must be rectified.\nIn Canada, the Indians are treated in a way altogether different from that in which the other peoples forming the Dominion are treated. Their social condition is altogether special. The Government considers them as minors.\n\nThe Indian Policy of the Federal Government has undoubtedly in view the welfare of the Indians from a social as well as from an economic point of view. In its conduct towards them, in keeping them under its guardianship, the Government does not deny their real intellectual qualities, more or less hidden deep down in their nature; it seeks to show not their inferiority, but rather the special nature of their character, of their way of life, of their surroundings. In this policy there is no injury done, no contempt shown: it is a policy dictated and imposed by facts.\n\nIn reality it is only by the process of a long and laborious evolution that the Indians will (if they ever do) become able to adapt themselves to our civilization. But this adaptation for the present at least, is not to be desired either in so far as the White People or the Indians are concerned.\n\nThey are unable to appreciate the nobler, the more elevated, the educative side of our civilization. From their coming into contact with the White population, the Indians get nothing but the White man's defects and vices. Whenever the pleasures afforded by civilization come within their reach, they give themselves up to these pleasures without restraint and to brutal excess. Left to themselves, they abuse of their liberty to work out their own destruction.\n\nIntellect, will, aptitudes, temperament both individual and social, the conditions of surroundings, etc., all those elements in which the life of man is canalized, have a distinct mark and character of their own in our Indians.\n\nNow, unless education is to come to grief and to become an obstacle rather than a stepping-stone on the way to progress, it must take these various elements into consideration. No being can be developed unless this development be according to that being's aptitudes and the fundamental conditions of its nature.\n\nIt is self-evident then that teaching and education in our Indian Schools require a peculiar pedagogy based on the nature, the character of our Indians and the peculiar conditions in which they are destined to live.\n\nThe one who undertakes to educate these Indians needs certain qualities which are acquired and developed only by constant association with the Indians and by persistent, detailed observation of their ways and customs. It is not by short visits made at great intervals, with methods and ideas formed in civilized surroundings, that a just, exact knowledge of the conditions required by those who educate our Indians is to be acquired.\n\nConsidering the question from this point of view, it is clear that the fittest judge is the missionary who lives constantly with the Indians and who has no other end in view than the good of those confided to his care.\n\nAnd as for education in this special line, nothing can hope to compete with a religious Community which has made of this very branch a specialty and has made of it, so to say, its life-work. In such a Community there is a tradition: members of the Community may change or may disappear, but the tradition, the pedagogy, the method remains, and we must not forget that this method is the result of the experience of several generations of educators formed and trained on the spot always having the same difficulties to face and having the same end to attain.\n\nWhile doing our best to make up for the deficiencies that exist in the teachers of our Indian Schools, we must not lose sight of their qualities, nor forget the good they are doing and the results they have obtained. We must encourage them in their devoted\nenable them to make up for what is wanting.\n\nTo return to the Rev. Sisters engaged in teaching at the Indian Schools on the above mentioned Reserves, I would like to point out that as they receive scarcely half the salary of schoolmistresses teaching White Children, it would be hardly reasonable to exact of them the same diplomas as are required of other teachers, especially when we consider that in order to do their work in the Indian Schools competently these Sisters need other qualities as already explained.\n\nOn the other hand it would not be prudent to exact that those Sisters who have spent years in these Schools be charged under the pretext that their pronunciation of English is faulty. This would be to deprive these Schools of the experience these Sisters have acquired during the years they have spent in these very Schools.\n\nThe best means of settling the whole matter would be to afford these Sisters the opportunity of perfecting themselves in the knowledge, especially in the pronunciation of English. This can be done without much inconvenience. They could spend two months every year at Calgary or at Edmonton and there follow the summer-schools.\n\nAnd I would suggest that the Department for Indian Affairs undertake to defray the expenses this might entail. And thus everybody will be satisfied.\n\nF. Blanchin O.M.I. D.D.\nProvincial\n\nEdmonton, Alta.\nJanuary 25th 1924.\nOttawa, April 17, 1924.\n\nDear Father Blanchin:\n\nI have your letter of January 25th, with reference to the language qualifications of the classroom instructors at the Blood and Peigan Roman Catholic Residential Schools. I am pleased to note that it is your aim to remedy any unsatisfactory conditions that obtain.\n\nI wish to assure you the Department concurs in your remarks concerning the several factors that make for complete education and that many qualifications are necessary for successful teaching. Further, the nature and psychology of the Indian child must be kept in mind by the instructor if the best results in the development of the pupil are to be obtained. The fact that all Indian residential schools and most of the day schools are conducted with the help of the churches is evidence of the Department's consciousness of the special fitness of religious communities and workers to undertake this activity.\n\nThe language of classroom instructors is an important factor and I hope that there will always be available Reverend Sisters who possess, in addition to their special and very desirable qualifications, a good knowledge of English. Be assured that the disadvantages under which our teachers are labouring will be remembered when public school, or other inspectors make unfavourable comparisons concerning the work done in Indian schools.\n\nMy aim and that of the Superintendent of Indian Education is to secure the best possible services for our educational work and the Department will cooperate with you in the plan to send teachers to summer schools in Calgary and Edmonton. When the details have been worked out, please communicate with me and I shall be pleased to inform you to what extent the Department can assist.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. F. Blanchin, O.M.I., D.D.,\n10,188 - 107th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nMarch 17th, 1924.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nThe Hon. the Superintendent General has directed me to reply to your letter addressed to him on February 20th, and to state that while it would afford him pleasure to accede to your request he thinks it will hardly be possible for him to do so. He wishes me to point out that the demands made on the Government are varied, and while he would personally be interested in His Lordship Bishop Breynat's wish to make a representative exhibit, he does not feel that he can create a precedent by paying transportation expenses. He trusts that His Lordship and you will appreciate the reasons which have led him to come to this conclusion.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev.

The object of this meeting was to unify the methods of administration of these schools; to improve, as far as possible, primary and industrial education of the children entrusted to them; to get better acquainted with the intentions of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and to co-operate more efficiently therewith.\n\nThe first step of the assembled Principals was to wire greetings to the Officers of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, wishing thereby to recognize not only their devotedness and unquestionable impartiality, but also the sympathy and encouragement received from them on many occasions.\n\nThe members of the Convention have successively attended to:\n\n1.- The administration of schools.\n2.- The education of children.\n3.- The sanitary conditions.\n\nIn...........\nIn connection with these different points, it has been decided to bring to the knowledge of the Department certain resolutions unanimously adopted by the members.\n\nADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS.\n\n1.- We are anxious to have the Department of Indian Affairs understand that our Principals are not mere employees, but a group of educators subject to a hierarchy, having their principles, their methods, etc.; and we request that this hierarchy be consulted in connection with serious measures to be taken regarding the education of Indians.\n\n2.- We urgently ask: 1.- That the government and administration of these schools be directly and exclusively in the hands of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. 2.- That the Department, in communicating with the Principals of these schools, shall have no other intermediary than the local Agents at points where these schools are situated.\n\n3.- These Agents are the natural and ordinary supervisors of these schools; but for extraordinary inspections, such as auditing of books, enquiries, etc., we think it desirable to entrust them to the officers directly responsible to the Government at Ottawa.\n\n4.\n4.- In order to obtain more unity in the cooperation of both civil and religious authorities, we think it necessary that the requests of our Principals for repairs, enlargements, improvements, etc., to our schools, be addressed to us; and that we deal directly with the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nEDUCATION.\n\n1.- We have given orders to three members of the Convention to compile a complete list of the books to be used in all our schools and to prepare a general program of study, the whole to be submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\n2.- There are, in our schools, quite a large number of children specially gifted to go through secondary studies fitting them to become machinists, engineers, book-keepers, teachers, etc. And we think it would be proper, for this purpose, to establish a high school for all children to enter on leaving our Catholic schools in the West. In order to save on staff and maintenance, this school could be attached to an ordinary school; for instance, to that of Lebret.\n\nWhile..........\n3.- While it is obvious that our Religious have, on the whole, given complete satisfaction as teachers, we are however of the opinion that we should conform to the wishes of the Department, and require them to have a Certificate from some Province of the Dominion, to serve as a certain guarantee to the public. In view of encouraging this movement, which can be accomplished but gradually, we believe that the Department should increase the per capita grant to the schools on reaching such improvement in their teaching staff.\n\n4.- Industrial education of our children, of both sexes, must not for any consideration be neglected. If, from seven to fourteen years of age, class room work must be practically the only occupation of the child, we believe that, from fourteen to sixteen years, half of the time should be devoted to a training adequate to his future calling. From sixteen to eighteen years, industrial work should become the almost exclusive aim.\n\nWith the view of facilitating a proper agricultural training for boys, we would suggest that the schools be supplied by the Department with agricultural implements for the use of the children, and in some cases, where the school has little or no property, that additional land be secured for this valuable purpose.\n\nMoreover, in order to extend the advantages of education, we wish that, on leaving the schools, with the.........\nthe recommendation of the Principal, and the assent of the Agent, the children receive from the Department, according to their merits and as an encouragement, a practical help in the way of articles to be used in their work.\n\n5.- We realize the advantages that result from the inspection of our schools by Inspectors of public schools of different provinces; but we ask that these Inspectors respect our books and programs, and take into consideration the difficulties attendant on the education of Indian children; difficulties resulting from a defective start in bringing them up, from a very characteristic apathy, as well as from precarious health. We ask that these Inspectors receive instructions from the Department in this connection, and that the Principals of the schools be so advised.\n\n6.- We would consider the above resolutions on Indian education incomplete, without thanking the Department for the sum of $1,000, placed at our disposal, for the erection of a monument to the late Rev. Fr. Hugonard, O.M.I., a pioneer in Indian educational work. We are pleased to state that steps are being taken to erect this monument at Lebret within the next year.\nHYGIENE\n\n1.- In the case of contagious diseases, such as tuberculosis, scrofula, etc., it is a well known fact that the Indian child, being far from his native locality, is liable to fret and pine and lose all chance of recovery. We, therefore, believe that, instead of grouping these cases in a hospital, or in a sanatorium, it would be better to have each school provided with rooms specially furnished for this purpose, and in charge of competent nurses.\n\n2.- In the last few years, sanitary inspection by nurses has been inaugurated in our schools, a matter that has been everywhere the cause of regrettable incidents, and without compensating advantages. These nurses, who are no doubt capable, have ordered measures leading to the transformation of our schools into hospitals or sanatoriums; moreover, in their manners, their dress and their language, they have often forgotten certain requirements essential to the proper training and disciplining of Indian children. Even the physicians have, in the majority of cases, disapproved of the regulations prescribed by these visitors. We believe that the regularity of the sanitary service is sufficiently guaranteed by our nurses, who are competent, and subject to the control of the physician attending the school and to the local Agent.\n\nIn.........\nIn closing these meetings, the members of the Convention wish to recognize and highly praise the great work accomplished by our Canadian Government for the civilization of our Indians. We believe that no other nation has made greater sacrifices for its autochthon population; and that, nowhere else, means better adapted to the object pursued, have been employed. In making appeal to the different churches in its work of civilization, the Dominion of Canada has recognized that all true civilization must first be based on a moral law, which the Christian religion alone can give. Pagan superstitions could not,\u2014whatsoever certain philanthropists might think,\u2014suffice to make the Indians practice the virtues of our civilization and avoid its attendant vices.\n\nSeveral people have desired us to countenance the dances of the Indians and to observe their festivals; but their habits, being the result of a free and easy mode of living, cannot conform to the intense struggle for life which our social conditions require. This has to be kept in mind for the training of new generations.\n\nThe results obtained in the work of civilization of the Indians are very remarkable, and we wish that the work accomplished might be better known.\n\nWith...........\nWith this in view, we beg to suggest the establishment of a MUSEUM or HISTORICAL AND SCIENTIFIC EXPOSITION where, close to articles pertaining to morals, religion, industries, works of primitive tribes - the memory of which is soon lost - could also be seen the work accomplished by civilization, and the results obtained both on the reserves from Agents' activities and in the schools of any denomination. It would appear that this would encourage and perpetuate one of the best works in the Dominion of Canada.\n\nVery Reverend Fathers J. B. Beys, O.M.I., and F. Blanchin, O.M.I., Provincials of the Oblate Missionaries in Western Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, respectfully beg to submit to the Department of Indian Affairs this Memorandum, signed by themselves and endorsed by all the Principals present at the Convention, with the assurance of their earnest desires for the development and success of the noble work undertaken by the Canadian Government.\n\nSigned:\n\nRev.

The Estimates for the coming fiscal year are being prepared, and it is important that the Department has the major needs, in order of their relative importance. This general letter should be supported by a letter for each residential school. The letters concerning the individual schools should go into details relative to the major needs and should indicate the minor requirements.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Fathers Beys and Blanchin have issued orders to the Principals of Indian Schools under their respective jurisdiction to meet together on the 28th and 29th inst., at Lebret, for the benefit of the work entrusted to their care.\n\nIt is understood that I will play an important part at that meeting and you may rely upon me to speak most favourably of your own and the Department's dispositions regarding Indian work.\n\nI have thought advisable to inform you privately and confidentially of this meeting and ask from you if you could suggest any special matter that I could bring to the attention of the 18 principals of the Prairie Provinces and their religious Superiors.\n\nYou know my sentiments and earnest desires, so you are at liberty to advise me and you may feel sure that I will do my very best to help the Department in its work and influence among the Indians and those in charge of them.\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJoseph [Signature]\nConfidential\n\nAugust 7, 1924.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI have your letter of August 3rd, apprising me of the proposed conference of the Principals of Indian schools which the Very Reverend Fathers Beys and Blanchin have arranged for. I have no doubt that this will be an interesting and valuable meeting, and if any suggestions arise from it which will render our work more efficient or our cooperation more complete, I shall be very pleased. I think one point that might be kept before the meeting is the importance of giving such a training to the pupils as will be of real benefit to them in after life. We have been pressing the boarding schools of late to have proper agricultural training for boys as I think amid all the surrounding difficulties that should be carried out. You know my opinion that the control of the schools should be from headquarters here, as I think this would tend to unify matters, as every case could then be considered on general principles that would be well known to all those in control.\n\nI have been at my desk ever since you went away, with the exception of taking a few days from time to time. I have just sent you a letter with reference to the McIntosh school, which I hope may be satisfactory. I do not think there is anything there that cannot be conveniently arranged. I expect the Minister in town on Monday next.\n\nWith kindest regards to the Very Reverend Fathers Beys and Blanchin, and with an expression of hope for the success of the conference, I am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nConfidential\n\nAugust 8, 1924.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI would like to write you a supplementary note with reference to the proposed conference.\n\nI should be glad if you could indicate to the conference how difficult it is now for us to get parliamentary appropriations for the most pressing needs of our work. Situated as you are at Ottawa you know something of these difficulties, and the pressure that is brought to bear upon the Department from all sides. What is required by those interested in your own share of Indian education in the west is well known, but there are interests in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and the Maritime Provinces also to be considered. To my mind the need is very apparent for two industrial institutions, one in Nova Scotia and one in Quebec, which would be under your jurisdiction. I think if you could dwell a little upon this item of the extent of our field and the difficulty of providing for all the worthy demands, it might be well.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nReverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\n597 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nLEBRET SASK 28 AUG 1924\n\nDUNCAN C SCOTT\n\nDEPUTY SUPT GENERAL OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, OTTAWA ONT.\n\nTWENTY FIVE OBLATE MISSIONARIES COMING FROM BRITISH COLUMBIA ALBERTA SASKATCHEWAN MANITOBA AND ONTARIO ASSEMBLED IN A SPECIAL CONFERENCE AT LEBRET WISH AT THE OPENING OF THEIR SESSIONS TO ASSURE YOU PERSONALLY OF THEIR BEST SENTIMENTS AND OF THEIR DEVOTION TO THE DEPARTMENT STOP PLEASE ACCEPT THEIR SINCERE WISHES FOR THE SUCCESS OF YOUR WORK AND THE PROMISE OF THEIR HEARTY COOPERATION WITH THE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS.\n\nREV J GUY.\n\n335P\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\nOttawa, August 29, 1924.\n\nRev.

The object of this meeting was to unify the methods of administration of these schools; to improve, as far as possible, primary and industrial education of the children entrusted to them; to get better acquainted with the intentions of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, and to co-operate more efficiently therewith.\n\nThe first step of the assembled Principals was to wire greetings to the Officers of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, wishing thereby to recognize not only their devotedness and unquestionable impartiality, but also the sympathy and encouragement received from them on many occasions.\n\nThe members of the Convention have successively attended to:\n\n1.- The administration of schools.\n2.- The education of children.\n3.- The sanitary conditions.\n\nIn.........\nIn connection with these different points, it has been decided to bring to the knowledge of the Department certain resolutions unanimously adopted by the members.\n\nADMINISTRATION OF SCHOOLS.\n\n1.- We are anxious to have the Department of Indian Affairs understand that our Principals are not mere employees, but a group of educators subject to a hierarchy, having their principles, their methods, etc.; and we request that this hierarchy be consulted in connection with serious measures to be taken regarding the education of Indians.\n\n2.- We urgently ask: 1.- That the government and administration of these schools be directly and exclusively in the hands of the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. 2.- That the Department, in communicating with the Principals of these schools, shall have no other intermediary than the local Agents at points where these schools are situated.\n\n3.- These Agents are the natural and ordinary supervisors of these schools; but for extraordinary inspections, such as auditing of books, enquiries, etc., we think it desirable to entrust them to the officers directly responsible to the Government at Ottawa.\n\n4\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\n4.- In order to obtain more unity in the cooperation of both civil and religious authorities, we think it necessary that the requests of our Principals for repairs, enlargements, improvements, etc., to our schools, be addressed to us; and that we deal directly with the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\nEDUCATION\n\n1.- We have given orders to three members of the Convention to compile a complete list of the books to be used in all our schools and to prepare a general program of study, the whole to be submitted to the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa.\n\n2.- There are, in our schools, quite a large number of children specially gifted to go through secondary studies fitting them to become machinists, engineers, book-keepers, teachers, etc. And we think it would be proper, for this purpose, to establish a high school for all children to enter on leaving our Catholic schools in the West.

It would appear that this would encourage and perpetuate one of the best works in the Dominion of Canada.\n\nVery Reverend Fathers J. B. Beys, O.M.I., and F. Blanchin, O.M.I., Provincials of the Oblate Missionaries in Western Ontario and the Prairie Provinces, respectfully beg to submit to the Department of Indian Affairs this Memorandum, signed by themselves and endorsed by all the Principals present at the Convention, with the assurance of their earnest desires for the development and success of the noble work undertaken by the Canadian Government.\n\nSigned:\nRev.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nAnother Convention of the Catholic Principals of Indian Residential Schools is being planned for some time next month. I take the liberty of submitting to you a few of the questions which we have presently in view for discussion. Your valuable advice is foremost in our deliberations as it was evidenced last year.\n\n1o-The Program of studies and list of books herewith annexed will be presented for fuller discussion and acceptation after revision if necessary. As this is my only copy would you kindly return to my name at Duck Lake School before July 16th. I wish to add that the De La Salle series of books is that of the Christian Brothers who enjoy a world wide reputation as teachers. All their books as well as all the others mentioned are fully revised and up to date in information supplied. One of the inspectors of the Public Schools of Saskatchewan declared the other day to Rev. Fr Leonard, that those books were the best he had ever seen.\n\n2o-Government help to discharged pupils.\n\n3o-High school education for some pupils.\n\n4o-Method of census on indian reserves.\n\n5o-Health regulations specially for T.B. children.\n\n6o-A few special questions of interior discipline.\n\nYour suggestions on the above points and others are welcomed. You may rest assured that those meetings are entirely in view of establishing closer cooperation between the Department and the school authorities. Another point to be discussed will be one taken up last year viz: more definite centralization towards the Department at Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, July 11, 1925.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, with reference to the agenda for the coming Convention of Principals of Indian Residential Schools under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. I am hopeful that these meetings will result in much good and I shall be pleased if you will convey to the Rev. Gentlemen as you gather the Compliments of this Department, which is so closely associated with you in an important work.\n\nThe programme of studies, which is returned herewith at your request, has been carefully examined by Mr. Perrier and its general worth and its suitability have been noted. When the Rev. Principals have given this question further discussion and have submitted a definite recommendation, you may be assured that the Department will give very sympathetic consideration.\n\nIt is our practice to assist promising graduates of Indian schools whenever funds can be found for the purpose. There are limited funds for tuition grants and the cases of successful graduates who appear worthy of assistance and who have been recommended by church and department representatives, will receive our favourable consideration from time to time. Further, when funds can be found, material assistance to establish homes will be granted, when there is a reasonable promise of permanent helpfulness.\n\nThe question of securing vital statistics on Indian reserves is somewhat difficult at times, and, if missionaries and principals will assist in this connection, the Department will be grateful for their cooperation.\n\nThe problem of tubercular children has engaged our serious attention for many years and I have tried to provide careful supervision, particularly in the case of pupils in residential schools. Considerable success has attended this effort to isolate and arrest the progress of this dread disease when still in the incipient stage. We are expending a large sum from Parliamentary Appropriation for this purpose and for the care of pupils and other Indians in the various sanitaria.\n\nI will await with considerable interest a memorandum following the Convention of the Rev. Principals.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nIndian Residential School,\nDuck Lake, Sask.\nOttawa, November 2, 1925.\n\nDear Father Blanchin:\n\nThe question of vocational training for boys at Indian residential schools is more and more engaging the attention of the Department. I am prompted to urge upon you the advisability of the Oblate Fathers accepting the entire responsibility for the management and conduct of the Roman Catholic institutions for Indian children in your ecclesiastical province. An official communication in this connection concerning the Blood School was directed to your office some weeks ago.\n\nFunds are being provided from time to time by Parliament for the replacement of old buildings by modern structures and equipment. The mechanical plant at these institutions is very costly and requires expert supervision. The Department would be very reluctant to ask the Church to take control of one of these schools unless it was clearly understood that a competent Rev. Settlement would be responsible for every phase of the activity. In addition to the Rev. Sisters, who give such excellent service, there should be on the staff lay brothers who are qualified not only to give boys vocational instruction but who are competent to take charge of a modern plant.\n\nThere is added satisfaction to the Department in having a Rev. Principal entirely responsible. He is subject to his Provincial and the Provincials are in close contact with the Rev. Father Guy, of this city. This principle of centralized control is one which I strongly reaffirm and it suggests that I might at this time again thank the Oblate Fathers for their great service to our Canadian Indians and to state that it is a source of much gratification to the Department to be associated with them in the conduct of Roman Catholic Indian residential schools.\n\nD. Scott\n\nWith reference to the training of boys at these schools, I must emphasize the very important instructions given in the garden by the Oblates.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nDear Father Blanchin:\n\nThe question of vocational training for boys at Indian residential schools is more and more engaging the attention of the Department.

This principle of centralized control is one which I strongly re-affirm and it suggests that I might at this time again thank the Oblate Fathers for their great service to our Canadian Indians and to state that it is a source of much gratification to the Department to be associated with them in the conduct of Roman Catholic Indian residential schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. F. Blanchin, O.M.I., D.D.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n10,188 - 107th St.,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nMy visit at Sandy Bay School impressed upon me the necessity of certain repairs which should be done by the Department. I may say that the Principal is more than willing to cooperate with the Department and I think this point should be kept in view in considering the present request.\n\nHere is a list of a few repairs to be attended to: Gutters, inside staircase, foundation of exterior staircase, flooring of boys' recreation room, flooring and ceiling of stable, interior of ice-house.\n\nA few pieces of equipment for the laundry and dairy would also be needed.\nOttawa, November 3, 1925.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nPursuant to your request, I have directed a letter to the Rev.

Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr Scott:\n\nThe second Convention of the Principals of Catholic Indian Residential Schools has taken place at Duck Lake, Sask., August 26 and 27, 1925, under the joint direction of Very Reverend Fathers Beys and Blanchin, Provincials of the Oblate Missionaries for the Prairie Provinces. I feel highly pleased to place before the Department the result of our work as shown in the following resolutions and remarks.\n\nThe resolutions of our first Convention embodied in a Memorandum were submitted to the Superintendent General on October 1st, 1924. The principals assembled at the present Convention again approved of them, after having expressed their gratitude to the Department for action already taken in some matters and have requested the undersigned to bring them again to the attention of the Department for further consideration.\n\nThe resolutions of our second Convention read as follows:\n\nRESOLUTION No 1:-WHEREAS:lo-All indian schools specially in the matter of education are under the immediate jurisdiction of the Federal Government;\n\n2o-The principle of religious education in indian schools is recognised by the said Federal Government;\n\n3o-We catholic principals, devoted to the education of indian children, belong to a religious denomination with distinct principles and for this reason requiring a program of studies in harmony with the tenets of our faith and that of the children confided to our care;\n\n4o-The education of indian children begins at a later age than that of the white children;\n\n5o-In their families indian children generally receive neither moral nor domestic education and consequently the schools must make up for those deficiencies by a special program extending over at least ten years;\n\nIT IS UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVED THAT the Program of studies and list of books prepared by a special committee chosen at our last Convention and thoroughly examined by all principals and teachers be accepted and presented to the Department of Indian Affairs for final approbation.\n\nRESOLUTION No 2:-WHEREAS: indian day schools established within the recruiting grounds of a residential school\n\n1o-hamper the recruiting of the residential school;\n\n2o-prevent the material prosperity and efficiency of said residential school;\n\n3o-entail heavy expenses;\n\n4o-give only the minimum of results;\n\n5o-for the most part meet opposition from the agents:\n\nIT IS RESOLVED BY AN UNANIMOUS VOTE TO respectfully request\nthe Department not to establish such day schools within the recruiting grounds of a residential school.\n\nRESOLUTION No 3: WHEREAS: in some districts parents lo-show negligence or repugnance to send their children to school or 2o-encourage truancy:\n\nIT IS RESOLVED to submit to the Department the desire of all principals that subsection 3, section 10, part 1, of the Indian Act be enforced in such cases.\n\nRESOLUTION No 4: To give more precision to a resolution of our First Convention of Memo of 1924, page 3, Education: parag 2) another resolution has been passed as follows:\n\nWHEREAS: lo-a certain number of our children better endowed than others are desirous to undertake higher studies or perfect themselves in mechanical arts;\n\n2o-the number of said children does not justify in each school the appointment of a special teacher nor the opening of an extra class; the principals UNANIMOUSLY RESOLVE to request from the Department that said children be sent: lo-to Duck Lake School if they wish to receive higher education or\n\n2o-to Qu'Appelle School if they desire to take up mechanical arts or carpentry; the Department to pay the salary of master engineers and carpenters together with the travelling expenses of the pupils.\n\nRESOLUTION No 5: WHEREAS: in the case of young men leaving school it is considered advisable to follow a uniform system of help\n\nIT IS RESOLVED to offer the following suggestions: lo-That every qualified young man recommended by both principal and agent be, upon his leaving school, supplied with a few implements and requested to work under the direction of the farming instructor;\n\n2o-That at the time of his marriage if he has given satisfaction, said implements be turned over to said young man with a gratuity of about $200.00, to be spent under the supervision of the agent, for the building and furnishing of a home;\n\n3o-That however special distinction be made in favor of pupils having remained a longer number of years at school;\n\n4o-That boys be encouraged with the above prospects during their school days;\n\n5o-That in places where farming of land is impossible the young men be supplied with the means of livelihood.\n\nRESOLUTION No 6: WHEREAS: lo-On account of many serious reasons it is not thought advisable to send children to public sanatoriums;\n\n2o-Evident facts certified to by our missionaries and principals show beyond doubt that most of the indian children sent to public sanatoriums have died, whilst the majority of those sent to their homes or kept in our schools under special supervision, have recovered their health;\n\nIT IS RESOLVED BY AN UNANIMOUS VOTE to ask from the Department lo-That tubercular children be sent to their homes with special instructions to parents rather than sent to a public sanatorium;\n\n2o-That for cases which could not be properly attended to at home special quarters be reserved in each school.\n\nIn connexion with this question all the principals as a body of missionaries heartily endorse the construction of the proposed annex to the North Battleford Hospital for indian patients and recommend same to the Department.\nRESOLUTION No 7: WHEREAS; lo-The Provincial Governments are not in charge of Indian residential schools;\n\n2o-Our duty is to centralize more and more our work towards the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa;\n\n3o-Our requests to have more weight should be presented to the Department by a recognized official representative and our rights exposed, and if necessary, defended by such an intermediary; the members of the Convention by an unanimous vote\n\nRESOLVE to ask from the Department of Indian Affairs that Rev. Fr Guy O.M.I., of Ottawa University, be hereafter acknowledged and considered by said Department as their official representative in all matters dealing with the education and betterment of Indians at large.\n\nAn official petition from our Right Reverend Bishops and Provincials will follow in due course to support the above resolution.\n\nTogether with the resolutions adopted at our Convention the following requests are also respectfully submitted to the Department:\n\nREQUEST No 1:- It seems but fair that copy of the report of the school inspectors be sent to the principals, in order to enable them to judge the efficiency of the teachers and the progress of the pupils and if necessary improve the situation.\n\nREQUEST No 2:- In the case of a school not having sufficient land for farming purposes, the Department is requested not to be unfavorable to recruiting, in order not to deprive some Indian children of the benefits of education.\n\nREQUEST No 3:- In the interest of the Department and that of the schools, we request that in cases of repairs and alterations, invoices for material supplied and labour sheets be signed by the principals before payment.\n\nREQUEST No 4:- For the same reasons as set forth in request no 3, and also in order not to estrange the inhabitants of a place where a school is situated, would it not be preferable to hire people of said place for certain works, when such people are well qualified? We deem that the advice of the principal should taken into consideration.\n\nREQUEST No 5:- In order to help us to have an exact census of Indians, would it be possible to have a copy of the official lists kept by the agents given to the missionaries and school principals?\n\nREQUEST No 6:- It is our desire that a competent doctor be placed in the proximity of the reserves and that one of his duties be to examine regularly our children in the different schools.\n\nREQUEST No 7:- In consideration of Commissioner Graham's and many agents' efforts, we reiterate our request for the suppression of the Sun Dance. We would also welcome the prohibition of pool rooms and gambling places to Indians.\n\n---\n\nI hope that action along the lines indicated in the above resolutions and requests will be taken by the Department, and I wish to emphasize the desires of the Principals for closer and more effective cooperation with the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph Guy O.M.I.\nProgramme of Studies for Roman Catholic Indian Schools.\n\nFirst Year\n\nChristian Doctrine: Prayers and Illustrated Primary Catechism Chart.\n\nReading:\nDe La Salle Phonic Chart,\nDe La Salle Phonic Primer Part 1,\nDrill in phonics and word recognition.\n\nSpelling:\nEasy words from the textbook.\nAccuracy in pronunciation.\n\nArithmetic:\nDrill on numbers up to ten, with their combinations, using objects or figures on the blackboard.\n\nWriting:\nWriting on the blackboard or copying from the blackboard.\nCareful attention to head, arms, etc.\nFormation of letters.\n\nLanguage:\nDrills on common sentences and phrases.\n\nSecondary Subjects:\n\nDrawing:\nDrawing simple objects.\nRecognition of the primary colors.\n\nMusic:\nRote singing.\n\nHygiene:\nFormation of good habits.\n\nPhysical Training: Easy exercises from the manual.\n\nKindergarten Work: Paper cutting and folding.\nPlastic figures (Plasticine).\n\nSecond Year\n\nChristian Doctrine: Prayers,\nIllustrated Primary Catechism,\nOral stories from the Bible.\n\nReading:\n\"De La Salle Primer, Part 2\",\nMemorizing nursery rhymes.\nReading and transcription of short easy sentences from the blackboard.\n\nSpelling:\nEasy words from the textbook.\n\nLanguage:\nCareful attention to correct forms of speech.\nConversations based on the lessons and the experience of the pupils.\n\nWriting:\nProgressive continuation of first year's work.\n\nArithmetic:\nThe numbers up to 20 with their different combinations.\nCounting objects up to 50\nDrill on facts already known.\nSymbols +, -, X, =, .\nRecognition of common units, as inch, foot, pint, quart, 5, 10 and 25 cent pieces.\n\nSecondary Subjects: Progressive continuation of first year's work.\nThird Year\n\nChristian Doctrine: Prayers.

You realize that we have gone through great inconvenience and heavy expenses to hold those meetings for the last two years and it is but legitimate on the part of those interested to ascertain the Department's opinion and even cooperation.\n\nHoping that it will be possible for the Department to allow me to give my correspondents a satisfactory answer, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nOttawa, April 17, 1926.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th ultimo, I wish to assure you that the recommendations of last year's Convention of Principals of Roman Catholic Indian Residential Schools have engaged the serious and studied attention of the Department. You may inform the Very Rev. Fathers Beys and Blanchin, Provincials of the Oblate Fathers for the Prairie Provinces, that I consider much good will come from these general meetings and that I welcome from time to time any suggestions for improvement in our educational work.\n\nThe Department is sympathetic to the request that a special programme of studies be adopted for the R.C. Indian Residential Schools. I should be grateful if you would discuss with Mr. Ferrier the content of the programme you have prepared. I do not want to depart from the grade system of grouping pupils and I wish to be sure that all texts authorized are suitable for Indian students of the West.\n\nI have noted the second resolution of the Convention and I wish to assure you that day schools will be established only when they appear to have a definite, independent usefulness. With reference to compulsory education of the Indian children of Canada, I may say that, from time to time, as the Indian communities in different provinces are ready for such action, Section 10 of the Indian Act will be enforced.\n\nI am very interested in Resolution No. 4, but I hesitate to name one Indian residential school as a centre for higher education and another for vocational training, until developments warrant such definite selection. For the time being, individual pupils, who show promise in any phase of their training, should be the subject of particular recommendations. I trust that, in the not distant future, there will be many children qualifying for more advanced education and training. At that time, the establishment of suitable institutions will be considered.\n\nResolution No. 5 has to do with the most important phase of Indian education. The Department has always recognized that the general success of our work depends to a large extent on the continued supervision of the ex-pupil on the reserve. Our staff of agents and farm instructors are in a position to do much towards making the Indian self-reliant and economically independent. I propose\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nto stimulate our officers' interest in graduates, by insisting upon proper emphasis on the discharge of a pupil and on regular reports concerning the progress of each. Material assistance will be granted whenever there is reasonable promise of permanent helpfulness.\n\nConcerning Resolution No. 6, I agree that the treatment of tubercular children presents a most serious problem. I believe, however, that pupils in an advanced stage of the disease are best cared for in sanitariums.\n\nI am very pleased to learn that the Convention of Principals has asked that you be their official representative in all matters concerning the education and other wellbeing of the wards of this Department. This resolution is evidence that the unofficial relationship and centralized control has been successful. An intimation from the members of the Church Hierarchy that are interested in Indian work and from the Provincials of the Oblate Order will make our satisfaction in this matter complete.\n\nI have examined the requests of the Rev. Principals in convention, and I wish to state that, whenever a report of a public school inspector is such that any action is necessary, extracts will be directed to the principal of the school in question. In reply to request No. 2, I may say that the Department, when funds can be found, will always give favourable consideration to increasing the pupilage at a school, if the management is doing the best possible with the farm and the other physical equipment at its command. We expect, however, that all residential schools with facilities for teaching farming and other vocational work will give a systematic training that will fit pupils for the future.\n\nConcerning request No. 3, I beg to state that, as far as is practicable and necessary, invoices for material supplied and time sheets for labour will be presented to the Rev. Principals for signature before payment. When building activity on the day labour plan is contemplated, the Department will secure the advice of the principal of the school before engaging labour, which will be local as far as possible.\n\nRequests No. 5, 6 and 7 are being given consideration. May I thank the Rev. Gentlemen associated with you in Indian work for their expression of willingness to actively cooperate with this Department. Will you kindly assure them that my constant endeavour will be to develop the usefulness of schools established for the Indians.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n59 Blackwood Street,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\n\n22nd July 1926.\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI respectfully beg to submit for your approval the following appointments -\n\n1. Rev. J. Duplanil, O.M.I., Principal of the Cariboo Indian Residential School.\n\n2. Rev. V. Rohr, O.M.I., Principal of the Sechelt Residential School.\n\n3. Rev. H. Barney, O.M.I., Principal of St. Mary's Mission.\n\nFathers Duplanil and Rohr are well known to the Department.\n\nFather Barney is a Canadian, 43 years of age, very competent and has had considerable experience in the Cariboo Residential School.\n\nTrusting you will accept these nominations dating from 1st August.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Welch, O.M.I.\nVicar of Mission\nOttawa, July 29, 1926.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 22nd instant, with reference to changes in the principalships of three Indian residential schools in your ecclesiastical province. The transfer of the Rev. J. Duplanil, O.M.I., to the Gaxihoo Indian Residential School is approved and the appointment of the Rev. H. Barney, O.M.I., to St. Mary's Mission is also satisfactory to the Department. I shall write a further letter with reference to the principalship of the Sechelt Indian Residential School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster,\nB. C.\nNovember 4th, 1926.\n\nDear Archbishop Sinnott,\n\nIt was my privilege last week to have a conversation with you on the administration of our residential schools in the West and I thought I should like to write you particularly on the subject of the qualifications of our teachers in these schools.\n\nIt is my policy to only recognize qualified teachers for all class-room work, that is teachers who are the holders of Provincial certificates. We are meeting with a fair measure of success I am glad to say, and I think the quality of our teachers generally has been much improved. As you are aware we have the benefit of inspection by the inspectors of the Provincial school system and this gives us independent criticism of our work and is being productive of good results.\n\nI beg to thank Your Grace for your interest in educational matters.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nMost Rev. Alfred A. Sinnott, D.D.,\nArchbishop of Winnipeg,\n353 St. Mary's Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNovar, Ontario\nOct. 29/26.\n\nSupervisor of Indian Schools,\nDept. of Interior,\nParliament Bldgs.,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nKindly forward me with a list of the names and location of the Residential Indian Schools of Canada which are Catholic.

Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. G. Falher, O.M.I.,\nSt. Joseph's Church,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nDeputy Minister of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have just been informed by Mr. Russell T. Perrier, that from April the 1st 1927, a change has been made in the per capita grant for a number of the Residential Schools.\n\nI fail to understand why there is such a difference in the grant for some of the schools under our administration. May I ask you to let me know on what basis the Department has established these rates? In the meantime allow me to submit some considerations. I fail to see why the Blood School should not get the same grant as the Duck Lake School, viz., \u00a3170.00.\n\nAt the Blood School, the new building is a duplicate of the one at Duck Lake, with all modern equipment and same general high expenses, having the same number of staff, cultivating a large farm and raising a good number of stock.\n\nAgain, why this difference between Ermineskin and Thunderchild, \u00a3170.00 each, while Crowfoot and Piagans only \u00a3155.00. For at Crowfoot and Piagans there is a modern, new and well equipped school, and they are doing Farm work more extensively than at Ermineskin and Thunderchild, and in my opinion should be entitled to the same grant, viz., \u00a3170.00.\n\nAnd for the Piagans School, in particular, I might draw your attention that though the accommodation is only for 50 pupils, nevertheless this new school will now be under heavier running expenses; they have a Farm Instructor, an Engineer and a Carpenter. In their new location they will be able to do farming which work has already been well started. Moreover the School is farther situated from the Railway than in the case of the other two schools mentioned, viz., 5 miles from Brochet.\n\nTherefore, dear Sir, I would ask you to reconsider this per capita grant, and would suggest a more uniform rate than mentioned in the letter of Mr. Perrier, No. 160-5, of May 4th 1927, and I would strongly recommend a uniform grant for any new and modern school built by the Department.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nProvincial,\n| Location     | 1927 | 1928 | Own Revenue |\n|--------------|------|------|-------------|\n| Blue Hills   | 170  | 165' | CH          |\n| Blood        | 155' | 140  | State       |\n| Comfort      | 155' | 140  | State       |\n| Duckhalle    | 170  | 140? | State       |\n| Muskeg Lake  | 170  | 165' | CH          |\n| Orono-belle  | 155' | 140  | State       |\n| Sacred Heart | 155' | 140  | State       |\n| Thunderbird  | 170  | 165' | CH          |\n\nLibrary and Archives Canada / Biblioth\u00e8que et Archives Canada\nwww.collectionscanada.gc.ca\nMay 27, 1927.\n\nDear Father Beys:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, with reference to the per capita grant rates at Indian residential schools in your province. This year, the Department made an adjustment which, I believe, will result in a more fair scale. The old classification did not do justice to the small institutions and I am trying to increase their grant gradually so that it will equal that of the larger schools. Prior to this adjustment, the Duck Lake institution had been placed in the old \"Industrial School\" group. The Blood school received only $140 until lately but, commencing this year, the grant will be at the rate of $155. In the near future it may be possible to make it $170.\n\nYou ask why the Crowfoot, Onion Lake and Sacred Heart schools receive only $155, while Blue Quills, Ermineskin and Thunderchild draw $170. The last named institutions are church owned and I feel that where the capital expense has been met by the Church, the Department should allow the higher grant.\n\nThis question of per capita grant rates has engaged the attention of the Honourable Mr. Stewart and myself for some time and I wish to assure you that we shall not rest until the scale is made as fair as possible.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. J. B.

You need not be told we do the very best for you...and God knows there are times when you must feel the necessity of having someone on whom you can depend for support. But in order to give us of their best, as our public men try to do, you would be greatly aided by a central bureau of information. This is what Father Guy was trying to supply. We owe you that aid, Doctor; we are willing to give it to you. Our superiors will not see the idea perish.\n\nWe regret your loss.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJames McQuire S.M.I.\n\nDr. Duncan E. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nMay 28, 1927.\n\nDear Father McGuire:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, concerning the departure from Ottawa of that good friend of Indian schools - the Rev. Father Guy.

I visited many of your schools and was well treated everywhere.\n\nI was deeply stirred by the tragedy at Lac la Plonge. I read of it in Winnipeg and wired immediately to Bishop Charlebois expressing my sympathy and offering our best aid. I also wired to Mr. Graham telling him to be prepared to send supplies which might be useful from our stores at Regina. We desire to give every possible assistance, and I hope nothing has been overlooked which might be of service.\n\nI heard in the West that you intended to be in Ottawa before long to discuss next year's school estimates, etc. I hope this is true because there are many things I wish to speak to you about when we are face to face.\n\nI found Archbishop Mathieu in the hospital at Regina and had a few words with him. He had rallied and they were hopeful then of his recovery.\n\nWith best regards, I am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nRector, Mathieu College,\nGravelbourg, Sask.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDecember 28, 1927.\n\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that the expense of education for the native population is upon the increase, and while the Department desires to provide a reasonably adequate system, it is essential that the outlay should be controlled. It is thought that the denominations should respect the zones of interest which have been established and not encroach upon them by the extension of missionary effort upon which a demand for separate educational institutions might be afterwards based. This view seems entirely reasonable, and in future the Department will not recognize requests for aid to educational institutions unless by pre-arrangement, and assistance must not be expected for institutions which encroach by the extension of missionary effort upon territory already provided for. Would you kindly advise the ecclesiastical authorities interested in Indian education of the contents of this letter?\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nMathieu College,\nGravelbourg, Sask.\nOttawa, 6th March, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. MacKenzie,-\n\nIn the past, all cheques in favour of the Roman Catholic Missions in the Mackenzie District have been made payable to my order. In future, I shall be glad if, instead of making them to my order, you will make all cheques payable to the Roman Catholic Episcopal Corporation of Mackenzie and until further notice have same sent direct to the Banque Canadienne Nationale, Jasper Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta.\n\nI shall also be glad if you will address all communications to me at Fort McMurray, Alberta.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. F. MacKenzie, Esq.,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe removal of Rev. Father Guy has left us without any representative in Your Department. I regret it as from time to time misunderstandings occur which are better settled in an exchange of views made orally rather than by correspondence.\n\nWe have at present several grievances of that kind and I therefor asked Rev. Father A. Th\u00e9rien O.M.I., my first advisor, to go to Ottawa, in order to expose to You these rather intricate questions.\n\nI must say that I received many appeals from our Principals, in regard to their relation with Your Department. I had some of these cases submitted to very reliable legal advisors.\n\nYou will see from these that there is some ground for their complaints.\n\nAs a consequence the officials on the reserves, inspectors and agents, are tempted more and more to disregard the rules of impartiality which must be foremost in a Government official. The appeal to the court in Blood Reserve is an instance of it but only one of many similar cases.\n\nWe feel sure that most of those things happen through some other official and without your being acquainted with the facts. The expense of sending one of our Fathers to Ottawa is heavy; but we felt that we had to let You know about all these facts, rather than take another procedure. You have always experienced your absolute fairness, impartiality and devotion to duty.\nWe therefore shall prove our confidence and gratitude towards you, in coming openly to You to settle our difficulties and we feel sure we shall receive your kind attention to same and a fair settlement.\n\nIn my name and in the name of the Oblates, permit me to express to You our deep esteem and appreciation and with these sentiments, I remain, Dear Mr Scott,\n\nYours very devotedly.\n\nJ.B. Beys O.M.I Provincial\n\nTO MR. DUNCAN C. SCOTT\nDEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL\nINDIAN DEPARTMENT\nOTTAWA ONT.\nMay 28th, 1928.\n\nReverend and dear Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 4th May. I was glad to receive Rev. Father Therien and we have had several interviews which have been most cordial and satisfactory.\n\nIt is true that difficulties sometimes arise in the drafting of children to our residential schools, but when we consider the number of pupils that are admitted each year, the almost total absence of friction is indeed remarkable. The Department and its officers both in the field and at headquarters are, I am persuaded, actuated by motives to be fair and just. I beg to assure you of my continued interest in your schools, the efficiency of which I am endeavouring to promote in every possible way.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. B. Reys, O.M.I.,\n10188 107th Street,\nEdmonton, Alta.\nNovember 30, 1928.\n\nMy dear Father Guy:\n\nAs I have for the last week or two been giving serious consideration to the estimates for the approaching fiscal year, 1929-30, I thought I should write you in connection with two items which you very strongly urged upon my attention: namely, an appropriation for a new school building at Lestock (Muscowequan) and for an addition to the McIntosh Residential School.\n\nFrom your long association with this phase of our work, you will understand that I have to give attention to claims of this nature from all parts of the country, and it has been the policy to endeavour to so apportion the grants to be allowed by Parliament, that the most deserving cases should be dealt with first. I find that my difficulty in dealing immediately and favourably with the above demands is that necessities of the work conducted by your Church in other parts of the country are more pressing and must be given the earliest attention.\n\nIt would not be proper for me to make any definite promises on behalf of the Honourable the Superintendent General or to forecast what Parliament may appropriate in future; but, so far as I am concerned, I am hopeful of being able to give more favourable consideration to these representations a year from now.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O. M. I.,\nOttawa University,\nOttawa, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to thank you for the kind reception you have given Reverend Father Guy and myself at the time of our last trip to Ottawa.\n\nThough I have been sorely disappointed about the main items, I understand you could not, in the present circumstances, give more favourable consideration to our pressing requests. At least, I have noticed with great pleasure that the near future looks brighter.\n\nWishing you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year, I remain,\n\nYours devotedly,\n\nJ.

I must admit that since my arrival here on May 3rd, I have been simply overwhelmed with work (have no secretary nor help of any kind) leaving no possibility for correspondence outside of strictly college business.\n\nHowever, I am pleased to let you know that in spite of such heavy duties I feel perfectly at home as my position involves duties with which I am conversant. The surroundings are quite pleasant and everybody highly sympathetic with our work and those in charge.\n\nThough at a distance, I will continue, until an appointment is made, to look after the most important part of my former work with the Department. In fact, you may expect some letters from me even if not signed by myself as will be the case with a coming letter from His Lordship Bishop Breynat.\n\nHoping that you still enjoy a perfect health and asking you to kindly remember me to Mrs Scott, I remain\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJoseph [signature]\nDear Father Guy,\n\nI was glad to hear from you, under date of June 24. I sent you a long telegram to Le Bret the other day, which I hope you received.\n\nI trust the meeting this year was as successful as usual.\n\nI have been very busy since you left. Mr. Stewart is in the West now and perhaps business is falling off a little bit.\n\nOur plan for a residential school in Nova Scotia is developing slowly but surely. Mr. Stewart and I looked over a possible location at Shubenacadie, and I think the school will be located there; the ecclesiastical authorities appear to be favourable, and Mr. Ferrier and Mr. Orr are going down to view the site and to interview the Archbishop and probably the Sister Superior, whose Order is to be associated with the work. When we have this school established, one of the desires of my official life will have been accomplished. It will likely be located within full view of the railway and highway, so that the passing people will see in it an indication that our country is not unmindful of the interest of these Indian children.\n\nI note that you are still working hard, it was always a bad habit of yours, and I presume if your superiors were to put you in a sinecure you would still be able to work hard.\n\nWith very kindest regards, I am,\n\nRev. Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nCollege Mathieu,\nGravelbourg, Sask.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nSir,\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that the expense of education for the native population is upon the increase, and while the Department desires to provide a reasonably adequate system, it is essential that the outlay should be controlled.

While the activities of the Churches interested in the evangelization of the Indians are a matter of interest to the Department, they sometimes involve educational developments, and I think it advisable to state that the Department cannot recognize any application for the support of educational institutions amongst the Indians unless the erection of buildings and the foundation of an establishment has been previously authorized. An understanding of this kind seems to be necessary, as it is not desirable to add to the expense of Indian education, particularly in districts which have for some time been given up to the activities of a single denomination.\n\nOK Have Dr Scott sign the letter.\n\n[Signature]\n\nB.S.\nD.I.A.,\nOttawa, Dec. 29/27.\n\nA copy of this letter sent to:\n\nRt.

All in the Department are sorry that you had to rush west on account of the illness of Bishop Grouard. It is with regret I learn you cannot visit Ottawa in connection with the Estimates this year. You had better have them compiled and in the Department not later than November 20th.\n\nWith warm personal regards,\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T.

December 4th 1930\n\nDear Mr Ferrier,\n\nPlease find enclosed lists of requirements of Pine Creek, St. Philip, Sandy Bay, Kenora and McIntosh Indian Res. Schools. Unless Sandy Bay School is transferred elsewhere in a near future, it will need extensive repairs. It is simply in a miserable condition. I respectfully insist that something should be done in 1931.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S. I hope Rev. Fr Plourde did not forget to return set of Auditor General's reports. Kindly send to Rev. Fr Baillargeon, Kenora School, \"Requisition for Transport\".\n\nMr Russell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nSaint-Boniface, Man. December 2nd 1930\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nOn October the 27th, I have informed you of the sad accident that has taken place at Pine Creek, and to avoid, as far as possible, its recurrence, I have petitioned the Department for a special allowance to hire a night watchman in every Indian Res. School under our management. Since then, that boy McKay has confessed having set the church on fire and another boy has tried to do the same to the School. More than ever I believe it is a necessity to have a night watchman in every school.\n\nAs you have granted my request only in part, you will kindly allow me to make a new attempt. If you read over again my letter you will notice that my request was general, concerning all our schools, all being in the same predicament, namely: Lebret, Conesses, Pine Creek, St. Philip, Sandy Bay, Fort Alexander, Fort Frances, Kenora and McIntosh schools. The new Muscowequan School, being fireproof, has not the same need. For all these schools, I ask the same allowance that has been granted to Pine Creek School.\n\nMoreover, to make sure that every night watchman will fulfil his duty it is essential to supply each of them with a watchman clock, costing about $30.00 more or less, according to the number of keys wanted.\n\nAnticipating a favourable answer, I have advised our Principals to look, in the meantime, for a reliable man in order to be ready as soon as I have your answer.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott, D.Litt.\nDeputy Dept. General.\nOttawa, Ont.\nDecember 9th, 1930.\n\nDear Father Magnan,\n\nI have your letter of the 2nd instant, with reference to night watchmen for the Indian residential schools in which you are interested. The situation at Pine Creek was so serious that the Department felt that a night watchman was advisable and offered to pay a grant towards the cost from Parliamentary Appropriation. It is not the intention, however, to pay for the services of a night watchman at all our institutions. Such an officer, where necessary, should be paid from the per capita grant or other school earnings. I know that, at Qu'Appelle, there is a night watchman who constantly patrols the buildings. At smaller schools, the Department issues instructions for a member of the staff to make a thorough inspection at ten o'clock at night and again at midnight and, further, that there should be an hour's patrol following the laying of fires in the early morning.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nVery Rev. J. Magnan, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\nOblate Order,\n240 Provencher Ave.,\nSt. Boniface, Man.\nMarch 28, 1931.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nDr. Scott and I have promised Father Flourde that the whole question of night watchmen at Indian residential schools where there is a general fire hazard will be given very favourable consideration a year from now.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoveshell Terrier\nOttawa, March 28, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you Dr. Scott has promised that favourable consideration will be given, a year from now, to the question of night watchmen at Indian residential schools where there is a general fire hazard. In the meantime, we are asking the churches to assume the responsibility and to see that proper safeguards are taken.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier\nSupt. of Indian Education\nParliament Buildings\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn visiting the Catholic Indian Reserves in British Columbia it was brought home to us in a remarkable way the influence of the personality of the teachers appointed to these reserves.\n\nSometimes teachers are appointed who are Catholic in name only and who are really unsuited for work among the Indian children on account of their own unstable lives.\n\nRealizing the great benefit to the children of having teachers of sterling character and especially practical Catholics in Catholic Reserves it would be a great benefit to all concerned if the department would notify me of intended dismissals and appointments so that with close knowledge of the case in hand our advice might help the department in the great work they are carrying on for the Indians.\n\nWith gratitude for any kind consideration you will be able to give to these suggestions,\n\nI beg to remain,\nVery gratefully yours\n\nW.M.

In the past, Indian agents, generally with the assistance of the Inspector of Indian schools for the province and with the advice of the local Catholic missionaries, have recommended appointments and dismissals. As far as the Department is aware, this arrangement has been quite satisfactory, but there is no reason why Your Grace should not be consulted in most cases.\n\nPerhaps the best method of dealing with appointments would be for the Department to insist on the cooperation of Indian agents with the priest in charge of the particular reserve. The priest could then communicate with Your Grace, particularly when in doubt regarding the suitability of an applicant. This is the usual practice in Canada as far as appointments to Indian day schools are concerned. If a special arrangement is desirable in British Columbia and you would like the Department also to notify Your Grace of appointments and dismissals, there is no reason why this cannot be done.\n\nI am enclosing a list of the Catholic Day Schools in British Columbia, showing the post office address, the name of the teacher, the present salary and the date of appointment.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nMost Rev. W. M.

Indian patients are admitted at a set charge to the Department.\n\nWith reference to the Schools the Department has contributed both in the way of furnishing equipment and in paying for repairs, additions and improvements to the buildings, and in some cases grants have been made towards the construction of the Schools.\n\nThe following is a list of the Residential Schools in Northern Alberta and the North West Territories with the amounts contributed by the Department for each School. There is also attached to this memorandum a statement showing in detail how these amounts are made up.\n\n**Fort Chipewyan Residential School.**\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $1,582.65\nImprovements to building and grants $2,217.25 $1,540.10\n\n**St. Bernard Residential School.**\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $1,718.21\nImprovements to building and grants $10,357.91 $12,076.12\n\n**St. Brigid's Residential School.**\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $10,632.21\nImprovements to building and grants $20,978.45 $310,810.66\nSPURGEON LAKE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $2,039.15\nImprovements to building and grants $8,000.00 $6,000.15\n\nVERMILION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $1,425.61 $1,425.61\n\nWABASCA RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $3,205.45\nImprovements to building and grants $19,580.65 $21,785.90\n\nATLAVIK RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $2,035.17 $2,035.17\n\nFORT RESOLUTION RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $3,455.25\nImprovements to building and grants $5,075.77 $8,531.02\n\nPROVIDENCE RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nFurnishings and equipment supplied $5,754.11\nImprovements to building and grants $50,192.65 $55,946.76\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nIndian Department,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThis is to certify that Reverend Father F. Lardon, O.M.I., will represent before your Department the Oblates of Mary Immaculate of British Columbia.\n\nI feel that he will be of great help in any difficult questions that may arise, as he is well acquainted with the Indian schools in British Columbia.\n\nI beg to remain\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nD. Finnegan\nProvincial.\nWinnipeg, December 31st, 1932\n\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA,\nOnt.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe following is a list of the requirements (for 1933-34) for the Indian Schools under our jurisdiction.\n\nMusconweguan School\n\n1- Installation of electric wiring in barn and granaries. The Inspector of the Province of Saskatchewan reported the present wiring as defective. The authorities of the School will furnish labor if the Department provides the materials.\n\n2- An air compressor for water pump Curtis, Model B, No. 3, 3\u00bd x 3. We understand that Ashdown's of Winnipeg are the agents for this make of pump. We consider this improvement very necessary. On four different occasions last winter, we had to haul water for the needs of the School. As the nearest supply is one mile away, considerable inconvenience is experienced every time the water system of the School goes out of order.\n\n3- Dormitories, recreation halls and dining room need to be painted and varnished. The School will provide labor if the Department will supply the paint and varnish.\n\n4- We are told that linseed oil hardens cement floors. We would like the Department to supply one barrel of good quality oil so that the floors of the School may be treated.\n\n5- There is no extractor for the laundry. As this is considered a very necessary piece of laundry machinery, we ask the Department to supply one.\n\nThe School is still without a laundry house, but in view of the present depression the School authorities will continue to use the present temporary building.\nSandy Bay School\n\n1- This is a very old school and temporary repairs are continually needed. For the coming year, the Principal would like 1500 feet of flooring for general repairs to the chicken house and ice house.\n\n2- The stable which is a very old building and which the Department had agreed a few years ago to replace with a new modern building is in need of repairs and the School authorities would appreciate a visit from the Inspector in that connection. The Inspector could recommend such repairs as in his estimation are necessary to prolong the usefulness of the building. In 1932, the Principal spent $59.68 in the purchase of materials for this work and would like the Department to assume the expense in this connection.\n\n3- The water supply of the School is very defective and whilst it may not be practical to spend any large amount of money in view of the fact that a new site will most likely be selected for this school when it is rebuilt, something nevertheless should be done along the lines suggested by the engineer of the Department of the Interior, Mr. Gow.\n\nKenora School\n\n1- The Principal has complained on several occasions of defective heating. The matter was previously taken up with the Department and action was promised but so far nothing has been done. It is possible that for a relatively small amount the heating could be improved to a point where there would be no further reason for complaint on the part of the staff.\n\n2- There is very little land suitable for farming. The Department in the last few years has spent some money in clearing land for that purpose. An additional grant of $1200.00 would be of great assistance in this connection.\n\n3- The present store house is too small and an addition of 16 x 16 would be greatly appreciated. The Principal estimates that this could be done for $600.00.\n\n4- The painting of the outbuildings is not complete and an estimated amount of $150.00 is asked for this purpose. The interior of the\nbuilding was painted only in part last year and it is estimated that $300.00 more are required for this purpose.\n\n5- The fence between the School property and the land adjoining it to the north was not properly laid out in the first place and a correction of the fence line is desired. It is estimated that this would cost $300.00.\n\n6- The road from the village to the school is in very bad condition and during bad weather is almost impassable. Drainage and grading to the amount of $800.00 is asked in this connection.\n\nMcIntosh School\n\n1- This School has no root cellar and although one has been promised for several years past nothing so far has been done. A sum of $600.00 would be sufficient for this purpose.\n\n2- The School is situated about 2\u00bd miles by water from the railroad station and materials and supplies have to be freighted on a barge. The present one is too old and dangerous to be used any more for this purpose. If the Department will supply the sum of $400.00 for the purchase of materials required the School will provide the necessary labor.\n\n3- This School has a very small acreage for farm purposes and more is urgently required. The sum of $1200.00 would go a long way towards clearing more land.\n\n4- This School has no implement shed. The sum of $300.00 would suffice for this purpose.\n\nLebret School\n\nThe rebuilding of this School is of course a necessity of the first order. The children, as the Department knows, are now housed in the Seminary of the Oblate Fathers and in the Town Hall. School accommodation is provided in the old parish Church of Lebret. It is hardly possible to describe the hardships experienced by the Principal and the staff in the conduct of a school as large as that of Lebret under such trying circumstances.\n\nThe Department last December agreed to build a temporary structure on the foundations\nof the old administration building, but the Principal preferred to keep whatever money would have been spent in this connection for the new buildings.\n\nIt is hoped that the Department will be able to make a very early start in the reconstruction of the Lebret School this coming spring.\n\nPine Creek School\n\n1- The house that was used by the hired help was destroyed by fire two years ago and has not been rebuilt. If the Department will supply the sum of $2000.00, the School authorities will provide the necessary labor.\n\n2- General repairs, $500.00.\n\nFort Frances School\n\n1- Inside and outside painting, $1500.00.\n\n2- Repairs to laundry building, $1200.00.\n\n3- Repairs and alterations to dormitories so as to give more air space. This work was to have been done last year, but the money originally intended for it was set aside for the payment of salaries of night watchmen in non-fireproof schools. We respectfully request that this amount be included in this year's estimates so that the work may be proceeded with.\n\nSt. Phillip's School\n\n$1000.00 for general repairs and decorating.\n\nFort Alexander School\n\nTo provide additional dormitory space for the large number of children that were clamoring for admittance, the Principal has spent a considerable amount of money in making necessary alterations to an adjoining building which is now used as a dormitory and which has received the approval of the Inspector. A sum of $500.00 would be necessary to complete the work.\n\nThe School is authorized to receive 90 children but has actually 120. There is no over-crowding. The Principal requests that he be paid for at least 110 children.\nThe Oblate Fathers of St. Boniface have ten schools under their jurisdiction. In view of the fact that Lebret School was destroyed by fire they have limited their demands for these schools to such repairs and improvements as they thought absolutely necessary so that the Department would have more funds for the rebuilding of the Lebret School.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJOP/F\n\nPer-\n\n[Signature]\nJanuary 9th, 1933.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 31st ultimo, setting forth the requirements for the coming fiscal year for each of the Indian residential schools under the auspices of the Rev. Oblate Fathers of St. Boniface.\n\nIn this connection I have to say that these requirements have been noted and are receiving consideration. At the present time, however, I am unable to state what provision it may be possible to make in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot St.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nHon. H. Mac Gill  \nDeputy Superintendent General  \nDepartment of Indian Affairs  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHonorable Sir,\n\nIn the absence of Rt Rev. Bishop Breynat, I beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of February 22nd, re - the new and severe cut under the circumstances of all per capita allowances made to Indian residential schools for the fiscal year 1933 - 1934.\n\nRt Rev. Bishop Breynat will be advised as soon as possible about this communication.\n\nI expect him to be at Ottawa towards the end of next month and to meet you or the other officials of your Department.\n\nYours' truly\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Thumuis  \nassistant of the Mackensie diocese.\nGROUARD, ALTA\nMarch 26th, 1933.\n\nMr Harold W. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nUpon my return from my Northern Missions I have been made aware of the new reduction of 5% in the appropriation for our Indian Schools. Needless to say that we feel more than sorry for this reduction as in our Northern country heavy expenses are entailed in the freighting of supplies. If the cost of some of the latter has diminished\u2014a fact which is hardly noticeable here\u2014the freight rates are the same and very high at that. I therefore wish to enter in a very respectful though firm manner my protest against this cut in the per capita grants.\n\nYou are perhaps aware that one of our Indian Residential Schools (girls and staff quarters and hospital for the Indians) that of Fort Vermilion has been destroyed by fire on October 6th, 1932. It has been a complete loss for us as at such a distance Insurance Companies were opposed to insure. Outside of the building itself and the equipment, the clothing, bedding, linen, etc have been lost. I have been thinking that your Department could in a way make up at least partly for such loss by a special grant to cover same and I am coming at the end of the fiscal year in case funds would be left over that you could apply to such purpose. And then, I wish to add that I have made application for a sum to be included in the Estimates in view of reconstruction. I hope that you have in due time given consideration to such a legitimate request.\n\nSame effective consideration has been given I hope to other requests made in favour of our schools.\n\nWith best wishes for the success of your important work, I remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nMarch 29th, 1935.\n\nDear Bishop Guy,\n\nYour letter of March 25th came to hand this morning, and I have taken note of Your Lordship's protest in respect to the further reduction of 5\u00a2 in the per capita grant for Indian schools. May I say in reply that we deeply regret the necessity of this being done, and even now we are not sure that we shall not be called upon to make still further sacrifices. If we are required to cut our estimates for any other substantial amount, it may be that we shall be compelled to consider the question of closing some of our schools, as well as reducing the activities of other branches.\n\nThe work of administration in Government departments is no sinecure in these times of financial stress. Instead of planning expansion and development in the way of education or in other respects, we feel that we shall be doing extremely well if we are able to hold our ground. Consequently I can offer no assurance that anything can be done in the way of building new schools or rebuilding those that have been destroyed by fire. It is true that we have placed an item of $50,000 in the Estimates for rebuilding the Lebret school, but consideration of all other requests for financial assistance for such purpose must be deferred.\n\nWith best wishes for your continued success and with kindest personal regards, I am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Reverend Joseph Guy, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Grouard,\nGrouard, Alberta.\nSt. Joseph's Rectory\n101 Laurier Ave. East,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nJune 1st, 1933\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Department,\nBooth Bldg.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nSince coming into contact with the work of the Indian Schools in my capacity of Provincial Bursar of the English Oblates of Canada, I may state in all seriousness that I never could comprehend the exact status we hold in relation to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nYou will probably recognize that sound business demands some sort of agreement existing between two persons, one of whom is working for the other, and working on this hypothesis you will no doubt conclude with me that due to the rather extensive financial obligations we have undertaken, and the ensuing risk we assume, it is necessary that we have an understanding of such a nature that the Department of Indian Affairs would recognize the work committed to the care of the English Oblates as a work being done by them for the Department of Indian Affairs. Therefore I would certainly appreciate having some document that I might have in my record that would satisfy me and my Superiors, that what we are doing is being done directly with the Department of Indian Affairs, and not indirectly through some third party.\n\nI trust that you will agree with me that such a document is necessary, and so agreeing you will forward it to me at your earliest convenience.\n\nThanking you in anticipation for this favour which after all is only one added to the very many we have been fortunate enough to experience from you in the past.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nRev. W. V. Doran, O.M.I.\nProvincial Bursar.\nOttawa, August 14th, 1933.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nReferring to your communication of June 1st last, I assume your letter refers to the association of the English Oblates with the Department of Indian Affairs in the conducting of the Indian residential schools known as \"Cariboo\", \"Kamloops\", \"Kootenay\", \"St. Mary's Mission\" and \"Sechelt\".\n\nIn connection with these schools, I may say that, until further notice, the Department is prepared to allow, for those Indian children whose admission is authorized by us, the per capita allowance previously granted, subject, of course, to those deductions found necessary owing to present economic conditions. In addition, the Department will supply the books, etc., required by the children, as well as the drugs. Medical attention is also provided by the Department, it being understood, however, that no extensive dental work or extraordinary doctors' accounts will be incurred without our authority. This Department is also prepared to make necessary repairs and improvements from time to time when we have funds available for this purpose. It is understood that these schools are subject to departmental inspection at any time.\n\nThe Department expects the English Oblates to have the general management of the schools mentioned. This includes the nomination of the Principal and staff and the direction of the work at the school. If financial obligations are incurred over and above the amount provided by the Department, it will be the duty of the English Oblates to provide the necessary funds as this Department cannot consider paying more than the amounts mentioned in the preceding paragraph. The Department will be pleased to assist you in any manner possible in the conduct of these schools and the officers of the Department are willing to meet your representatives at any time to discuss matters relating to the schools under your charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Bishop Guy, I understand, is considering this suggestion. If, and when, a new building is erected, it should provide accommodation for approximately 175 pupils.\n\nThe above requests of His Lordship will receive consideration when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared. However, I am unable to state what amount will be approved for carrying out the work requested by Bishop Guy at any of the above named schools.\n\nSgd H W McMillan\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nNovember 30th, 1934.\n\nMr Harold McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nIn the matter of preparation of the Estimates for the next fiscal year I wish to make an application for the following covering the Residential Schools under my jurisdiction, viz:\nSt Bernard's at Truari, St Bruno's at Joussard, St Martin's at Desmarais, Sturgeon Lake at Celais, Fort Vermilion at Fort Vermilion.\n\nST BERNARD: Of your letter of the 2nd inst. If plan is not proceeded with I would renew my request for $50,000.00 covering work material to be supplied at different points. In Grouard, we need absolutely a school house and accommodation for older girls, a laundry, a ice house. The latter have been destroyed by fire on November 20th, 1933.\n\nST BRUNO...: Cow Barn. Imperative as you have found out personally. Approximate cost: $.500.00\n\nThe floor and basement must not be lost sight of. If immediate attention is not given I will assume no responsibility in case of accident.\n\nST MARTIN.: Stable and Barn, approximate cost: $3,000.00\n\nSTURGEON LAKE: Of your letter of the 2nd inst. Otherwise of my own letter of May 8th asking for Girls' residence: $15,000.00\n\nRepairs \" Boys\" : $5,000.00\n\nFORT VERMILION: I would ask for a compensation to replace building destroyed by fire October 6th, 1933., viz, girls' residence. Approximate cost would be at least $15,000.00.\n\nI also ask for increase in pupilage for the following schools:\nST BERNARD'S: 75 to 100\nST BRUNO'S: 125 to 130\nST MARTIN'S: 100 to 110\n\nFinally, I wish to ask officially that the cut p grants be removed and therefore grants be restored to their former amounts.

In the Yukon District, the \"per capita\" grant is $250.00. This grant is substantially above that of the schools in our district. It is difficult to see how this discrimination can be explained. It may be argued that the cost of living and transportation justify this grant to the Yukon schools. This very same reason can evidently be applied to the case of our schools, and more so.\n\nIn view of a solution of the whole question, I would therefore, to conclude, suggest one of the following alternatives:\n\n(1) that the Government buy the actual schools from the Churches and see to the necessary repairs, improvements, etc., or rent them, providing thus a sufficient revenue for repairs, improvements, etc.;\n\n(2) that the \"per capita\" grant be raised to $250.00, an amount which should be sufficient to maintain the schools in satisfactory conditions.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 60A1, file 160-5, part 2)\nDr. H. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nFollowing our conversation of yesterday, I beg leave to summarize as follows the views and suggestions I expressed concerning the Indian Schools in the Northwest.\n\nIn all the Provinces of Canada the Government is spending large sums of money for the maintenance of Indian schools. It has built or bought buildings that are in keeping with actual requirements. It not only pays \"per capita\" grants, but also supplies the occasional funds necessary for repairs, improvements, etc. These schools are under the management of the Churches.\n\nSuch are not, however, the conditions of the schools in the far North. There, the Churches have assumed the burden of building these schools. They maintain them at the cost of much exertion and must depend only on the \"per capita\" grant and a few occasional extra grants, not always easily obtained.\n\nThese grants are evidently inadequate. They are not sufficient to meet the exigencies of the standard of education required today. The actual conditions of the schools may have been satisfactory in the past, but the gradual opening of the country is bringing in changes that demand improvements from many points of view.\nMarch 16, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 9th instant, referring to your recent conversation, concerning matters in connection with the Indian schools in the North West Territories.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion, that the Government purchase the Indian school buildings administered under your auspices, I might say that this is a matter that has already been given some consideration. It is doubtful, however, if the Government will be in a position, for some time, to finance the purchase of these properties. I should be pleased if you would furnish, at your convenience, the amount of the remuneration you would ask for each of the Aklavik, Providence Mission and Fort Resolution School properties. This information will be most useful when further consideration is given.\n\nRegarding your request that the per capita grants be adjusted to the same amount as provided for the residential schools in the Yukon, I would say our Estimates for the coming fiscal year have been submitted to Parliament, and I regret it will not be possible to give further consideration at the present time.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

McCull M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nreferring to my letter of March the 9th inst., I hope that Your Department has taken into serious consideration the propositions therein contained regarding the schools of my Vicariate.\n\nAllow me to insist again on the earnestness of my propositions. With the \"per capita\" grant actually allowed us for our Indian Pupils, we feel unable to make the necessary improvements or even repairs on such buildings, especially under the present economical conditions.\n\nSuch a grant is hardly enough at any time to enable us to support the children and the Members of the Staff; it is out of question, therefore, to reckon on it for the much needed repairs and improvements of our buildings.\n\nConsequently I earnestly trust that Your Department will seriously consider the possibility of buying or renting those Schools from the Churches, as was done almost everywhere in the Provinces.\n\nHowever, as the solution to this problem may need to be further discussed before we come to a definite agreement, may I insist meanwhile that our \"per capita\" grant be at once raised to $250.00 through the Supplementary Estimates... In the recent conversation we had together at Ottawa, you admitted of your own accord that the reasons justifying such a grant to the Indian Schools of the Yukon were of a still higher weight in the case of the Schools located in my Vicariate, on account of the difficulties of communication and of the high cost of living prevailing in the North West Territories.\n\nHoping to have a favourable and speedy answer to my requests,\n\nI beg to remain,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nrespectfully Yours\n\nG.E. Breynat O.M.I.,\nBishop of Adramytius\nVicar Apostolic of MacKenzie\nApril 4, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letter of the 26th ultimo, addressed from Edmonton, Alberta, concerning the request made in your communication of the 9th ultimo, for an increase in per capita grants to the Indian residential schools in your diocese.\n\nYour letter crossed my communication of the 16th ultimo, addressed to you at Fort Smith, which was in reply to yours of the 9th ultimo.\n\nThe per capita rate allowed to the residential schools in the Yukon was set at the time there were very inadequate transportation facilities and is now, doubtless, too high, in comparison with grants allowed to our other schools at outlying posts. As I stated in my letter of the 16th ultimo, our Estimates, including Supplementaries, have been submitted to Parliament and I regret that it will not be possible to give consideration to your request at the present time.\n\nRelative to your request that the Department consider the possibility of buying or renting the Indian residential schools under your auspices, I should be pleased if, as requested in my letter of the 16th ultimo, you will state, at your convenience, the price required for each of the Aklavik, Providence Mission and Fort Resolution School properties. In this connection, it should be kept in view that, even if these properties are acquired by the Government, their future management would still remain under church auspices. Consideration should also be given to the expenditure incurred by the Department towards the supplying of equipment and any amounts paid towards the construction of the buildings. Your Lordship will remember that, during the fiscal years 1929-30 and 1930-31, the sum of $30,000.00 was paid by the Department towards the reconstruction of the school at Providence Mission.\n\nEven if satisfactory terms for the purchase of the above named schools were agreed upon, it is very uncertain when the necessary funds could be obtained from Parliament to complete the purchase.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\nFort Smith, N.W.T.\nMission Saint-Isidore\n\nFort Smith, N.W.T., March 28, 1935.\n\nYour file No. 160-5.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour communication regarding the proposition that the Government purchase the Indian School Buildings administered under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Missions in the North West, has been duly received. I am pleased to acknowledge receipt and thank you for the interest taken in the question. As His Excellency is not actually at his residence, I shall endeavor to forward the document by the next mail so that he shall be able to give it his full consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

McGill M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Doctor McGill:\n\nYour letter of the 1st inst at hand.\nI wish to thank you for same and remarks contained therein.\n\nI quite agree with your opinion concerning the consolidation of two or more schools in our district and will not raise any further objection along those lines.\n\nThe paragraph on page two relative to \"missionary activity\" has highly interested me for I must confess that more than one of my requests in the past have been met with by the late Russell Ferrier by those words: \"Missionary activity\" which meant that, probably on account of remoteness and other reasons, the Department would not do anything in the way of capital expenditure and would therefore leave the construction of schools to churches, allowing at times a small grant. The case of our Wabasca school is typical. We were granted a sum of $15,000.00 on the condition that the school would cost double the amount. We reached triple the amount and over. We had borrowed the $15,000.00 from the Provincial Bank in Montreal at 7% and through a misunderstanding we had to wait for two years to get the grant, making an expense of $2,100.00 only in interest before receiving the money. Of course we had to borrow the balance of the money used for the total construction and sad to say is still owing. Details can be seen on File 131-3-5, after 1930. Another instance is the boys' building at Sturgeon Lake where $3,000.00 were allowed for a building which cost over $8,000.00. I have remonstrated with the Department at the time but to no avail. Of course, I do not wish in the least to criticize the attitude of Mr Ferrier who has always been so kind and obliging. I only wish to draw your attention to a difficulty from which we have suffered and are still suffering. Unless the Department comes to our rescue some day by way of a grant to cover such expenses I do not see the end of said debt. You will also realize how the 15% cut in annual grants has affected us who had and still have to pay interest on money borrowed for the above mentioned purposes and, if I were allowed to dig up the dead, also for the building of the following schools: St Bernard's at GROUARD (girls', first boys'\nbuilding, school house-three class rooms in two buildings-, laundry, ice-house, barns, stables, warehouse, shops, power building and of course principal's and staff building), St Bruno's at JOUSSARD(first building, salaries for first part of second building, barns, outbuildings), St Francis Xavier at CALAIS(girls' and first boys' buildings, outbuildings), St Henry at FORT VERMILION(first boys' and girls' buildings destroyed by fire, then the boys' building and annex, and also the girls' building again destroyed by fire in 1832, outbuildings of all descriptions, staff building), St Martin's at WABASCA(first school and annex, first and present hospital, outbuildings now being replaced by more modern ones), St Augustine's at PEACE RIVER(replaced by St Francis Xavier's in 1807). Such a list will give you just a feeble idea of expenses entailed and debts incurred(no surprise that we still owe $132,000.00).\n\nI must say to your credit, Doctor, that you have understood our position and proven in a practical way your cooperation in having the grant of $10,000.00 voted for Fort Vermilion. Thanks again for said amount! May you find your way to continue along the same lines-it is never too late-to reimburse us for moneys spent on at least part of the above schools, specially those of late years, Wabasca and Sturgeon Lake.\n\nI appreciate the more your stand in the matter as it is in perfect harmony with my own views when I was discussing the question of grants for the last named schools. I therefore wish to thank you for expressing your opinion in such a clear and forceful way.\n\nI would therefore ask you not to consider the arguments put up on the grounds of \"missionary activities\" in the face of your expression of opinion and of my explanations. I hope in the very near future(this month or next)to take up the matter again personally in your office.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nEdmonton, Alberta, May 1st, 1955\n9916 - 110th St.\n\nDr. H. McGill, M.D.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 4th of last month, in answer to mine concerning a request for an increase in per capita grants to the Indian residential schools of my diocese.\n\nI was sorry to learn that this request came too late to be included in the estimates or supplementaries presented to the Parliament before Easter. But surely there will be some other supplementaries presented at the reopening of the session this month, and could not then the question of an extra grant to our schools go in with them? I know that you will do your best for us, and I trust that you will be successful.\n\nI do not think, that we are unreasonable in our demands. You state, in your letter, that the rate allowed to residential schools in the Yukon was set at a time when transportation facilities were inadequate in that district; yet, the school at Carcross, if I am not mistaken, was not built before 1900, and the railway from Skagway to White Horse was then already in operation. We have not the same facilities in the MacKenzie, even today. If the $250.00 grant for the Yukon schools may be considered too high at the present moment, I think that $175.00 for the MacKenzie on the other hand is too low. Besides, we have run some of our schools, like the one in Providence for 40 years, before we received any grant at all. Therefore, I do not believe, anyone could say, that we have been favored at the prejudice of other schools, and perhaps this fact may carry some weight in the consideration of our present needs.\n\nHowever, I am very glad to note your willingness to discuss the possibility of the Department buying or renting the Indian residential schools under our auspices. You ask me to state the price I would set for each of the Akklavie, Providence and Fort Resolution school properties. I am quite willing to do this, but as I have not all the details at hand, I must wait till my next visit to those missions to gather all the particulars necessary for a true estimate. May I suggest, that, at the same time, the agents at each of those points be asked to send in to the Department their own estimate, or if, you prefer, I could, when making my visit in June and July, work it out with them, and then we could send you a joint report. In making this estimation, it would only be fair to deduct the sum paid for the reconstruction of the school at Providence, as you point out in your letter. On the other hand, we hope the Department shall not fail to take into account all the money we have disbursed in late years, for the establishment of farms in connection with our schools, or the developing of the same.\n\nBut, I know enough of the spirit which characterizes the Department, to have no fear on this subject, and to feel assured, that, when the time comes, we shall receive a fair deal at your hands.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVic. Ep. of MacKenzie\nDr. McGill, M.D.\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nAfter mailing you my letter of the 1st instant, I went once more over yours of the 4th of April, and again noted its contents carefully.\n\nOn the one hand, of being able to obtain this year, for our schools, a per capita grant equal to that allowed in the Yukon district, you are far from giving me great hope; the less so, that you say the Department is beginning to find the same rather high. Even the fact, that our transportation facilities are in worse conditions today than those of the Yukon 30 years ago, may not be fully appreciated, at a time when economy seems to be the order of the day.\n\nOn the other hand, although, you declare yourself willing to discuss the possibility of buying our schools from us, you do not fail to point out, that should we even come to satisfactory terms at once, yet a considerable time must elapse before the actual purchase is completed, as the necessary funds must first be obtained from Parliament.\n\nThus we are caught in a dilemma, from which there seems to be no issue. If a raise in the grant is to be considered as an impossibility, and the purchase of the schools, although a possibility, is only a remote one, what are we to do? To carry on the work, on the meagre allowance we are receiving is too heavy a burden, almost an unbearable one, as we found out last year, when we had to try and do without any supplementary grant. The Department must be aware of this, it has only to consider the grants allowed to other schools through the Dominion, and it will see, at once, that although we are working under the most adverse conditions, yet we are far from being the most favored.\n\nMay I therefore, make another suggestion, the following:\n\nthat, pending the discussion of the terms of the purchase of our schools, and while waiting for the transaction to be completed, a temporary arrangement be made, according to which the Department would rent our four schools of Aklavik, Providence, Fort Resolution and Chipewyan, and pay us yearly, let us say, a round sum of $6000.00. This would amount to a small rental of $1500.00 for each school, as an average. I feel that I am not here asking for much. Six thousand dollars hardly represent a 2% interest on the capital invested. I am, of course, making only a rough estimate offhand, not having all the particulars before me, but which, I am confident, will not appear exaggerated, if we take into account every dollar and cent, that has been spent from the beginning. It would only be a small, very small revenue from our investment, and yet one which would tend to make things more bearable.\n\nThis shows, once more, that while keeping in view what, I would call not so much our own interests as our pressing needs, we are also aware of the difficulties of the Department, in trying to meet all the requests made from different parts. That you cannot, no matter how much you would like it, give full satisfaction at once even to the most reasonable demands, we understand. Meantime, we are ready to accept and appreciate any help, however small, you feel in your power to give at the present moment.\n\nTrusting that this new proposition may be found worthy of your kind consideration and acceptable to the Department of Indian Affairs, I am,\n\nYours truly,\nMay 16, 1935.\n\nRight Reverend Sir:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letters of the first and third instant, with reference to the request made by you for an increase in per capita grant to the four Indian Residential Schools in your diocese; also with reference to the purchase of these school properties by the Government and that, pending the matter of their purchase, the Government pay an annual rental.\n\nI have to say, regarding these requests, that the total amount appropriated in our Main Estimates for Indian Education for the current fiscal year has been entirely apportioned. It will not be possible to add a further item to our Supplementary Estimates, which have already been passed upon by the Treasury Board and are now ready to be presented when Parliament re-assembles. I regret, therefore, being unable during the present fiscal year to meet your wishes in providing an increased per capita grant. However, the matter will receive consideration when our Estimates for the next fiscal year are being prepared.\n\nI am unable to give favourable consideration to the payment of rental for these school properties, pending their purchase by the Government. This is a question\n\nRight Rev. G. Breynat, O.M.I., D.D.,\nVicar Apostolic of Mackenzie,\n9916 - 110th St., Edmonton, Alta.\nquestion requiring careful consideration. I would point out that a number of the Indian residential schools are church-owned, and it would create a precedent, should rental be paid for the schools in your diocese, as, no doubt, other church-owned institutions would demand similar consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, October 25, 1936\n\nDr. H.M. McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nAt the request of His Excellency Bishop G. Breynat, O.M.I., I beg leave to write concerning a matter which has already been brought to the attention of your Department: the \"per capita\" grant to the Indian Boarding Schools of His Excellency's district. The question has been the subject of correspondence and interviews during the past year and I rather hesitate to mention it again today. However, as your Department will soon study the estimates of the coming fiscal year, I hope it is not out of place to state anew the legitimate needs of H.E. Bishop Breynat.\n\nFirst of all, it seems quite reasonable that the Bishop's schools be placed, from the \"per capita\" point of view, in conditions parallel to those of the Yukon. I am informed that the average cost of transportation, for instance, is higher in the Northern Mackenzie.\n\nMoreover, the schools of His Excellency, except that of Providence, have been built without any help of the Government. Being the owners of these schools, the missions are deprived of the numerous substantial grants made to the schools of the Government, in which all expenses, even minor, such as the supply of tools, etc., are paid by the Department. The missions must make these purchases themselves, and besides...\npay for all necessary repairs and improvements. As the general revenues are quite restricted, it follows that a part of the \"per capita\" grant must be diverted for expenses which normally should be paid through supplementary grants. The financial conditions of our schools are thus inferior to those of the schools owned by the Government.\n\nThe nature of the soil and the severity of the climate make the revenue of the farms considerably lower than elsewhere. At Fort Resolution, for instance, hay has to be transported 40 miles on the Slave River. In the prairies floods occur frequently and render the hay supply difficult; this year, at Chipewyan, all the cattle had to be killed. A carload of hay was ordered from Edmonton in order to save two cows. At Aklavik, a meagre supply of potatoes and vegetables comes from other missions 700 to 800 miles distant.\n\nBesides, the members of the staffs\u2014lay employees excepted\u2014never receive any salary, while in other schools all are salaried. His Excellency does not ask for salaries, but I think that this point should be considered in the question of a higher \"per capita\" grant. It is indeed quite unfortunate that more favorable conditions were not established long ago. Mgr. Breynat could be justified in asking for some compensation in return for the sacrifices of the past.\n\nI feel confident that the Department will not hesitate to give a favorable answer to His Excellency's desires as expressed here and in previous correspondence and interviews.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nF. X. Marcotte, O.M.I.\nOctober 30, 1935.\n\nDear Father Marcotte:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, requesting, on behalf of His Lordship Right Reverend G. Breynat, O.M.I., that an increase in per capita grant be provided to the four Indian residential schools in his diocese, to make the rate uniform with that of the residential schools in the Yukon.\n\nIn this connection I may say there are many demands before the Department, for new school buildings, repairs and equipment and for increased pupilage. It is a matter for Parliament to decide as to the amount of the appropriation that will be granted for carrying on the Indian school work during the coming fiscal year.\n\nThe request of His Lordship has been before the Department for some time and will, with other requests from the churches associated with this Department, be given consideration when the Estimates are being prepared. At present, I am not in a position to state what amount will be available for the coming fiscal year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. F. X.

BRUNO'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\n(1) Barn equipment .................................. $1,000.00\n\nThis barn is being built this year and I would request that an amount of $1,000 be included in the Estimates for the coming fiscal year to cover the cost of the equipment which is to be installed in it.\n\n(2) Vegetable cellar .................................. $1,000.00\n\nThis has been built this year as it was an absolute necessity. I would recommend reimbursement of part of the expenditure incurred and would be satisfied with $1,000.\n\n(3) Reimbursement in connection with erection of cow barn and stable ......................... $2,000.00\n\nIn this year's Estimates, $1,500 was voted for the erection of the above but the amount proved quite insufficient.\n\nThis year, we built a combination cow barn and stable (78 ft. x 36 ft.) with loft, etc., at an approximate cost of $3,500., and I would, therefore, welcome the balance upon presentation to the Department of all invoices and labour returns.\n\n(4) Ice house ........................................... $1,000.00\n\nWe have had difficulties with our ice house, which is of a very primitive nature and I would ask that a modern and permanent one be provided by the Department.\n\n(5) Addition to kitchen .................................. $1,386.95\n\nAs the Department is aware from correspondence on file, this addition has already been erected under the supervision of Mr. Gardner Smith. His work in this regard has been extremely satisfactory. Upon my return home, I will forward vouchers, invoices and labour returns in connection with the cost of the erection of this building. We borrowed the money for this purpose and I would, therefore, appreciate reimbursement of the above amount.\nVERMILION INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL:\n\n(1) Laundry equipment - $2,000\n\nAt the present time, we are building a laundry for this school and would request proper equipment for it. The latter, of course, would not be of the elaborate type used in other schools, as this would entail more than double the expenditure mentioned above.\n\n(2) Ice house (40' x 20'); general stores; refrigerator, etc. - $4,000\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop Edward\nWABASCA R.

Last year, a suggestion was made to combine the Sturgeon Lake and St. Bernard's Indian Residential Schools but, in view of the fact that St. Bernard's has been almost completed as a splendid unit, we did not find it advisable to proceed with this combination. I would, therefore, suggest that the Sturgeon Lake Indian Residential School be replaced with a fireproof structure.\n\nI would draw your attention to the fact that Sturgeon Lake is 65 miles from the first railway station and freighting facilities are available only during certain periods of the year. This fact has to be taken into consideration when figuring the probable cost of the building.\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop of Edmund\nOttawa, Canada,\nOctober 29th, 1935.\n\nH. W. McGill, Esq., M.

These requirements cover the Sturgeon Lake; St. Bernard's; Wabasca R. C.; Vermilion and St. Bruno's Indian Residential Schools - all situated in the Peace River District and under my jurisdiction.\n\nI trust that you will give these requests your most judicious attention with the hope of favourable results.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nNovember 12th, 1935.\n\nMr Harold W.

I would submit my suggestions after having received quotations from Stanley Brock in Calgary. After the fire which destroyed the Laundry at Grouard you kindly replaced destroyed equipment which however has not been used at all since and is practically new as we would travel over to St Bruno's School on washdays. I would suggest sending this complete equipment to Fort Vermilion which has only 65 children and have a more elaborate and modern one for Grouard.\n\nST BRUNO'S SCHOOL:....I would ask for an additional $2000.00 for out buildings(hen house, implement sheds, etc)which are really urgent.\n\nI hope that you will find the way to consider the above and include same in the Estimates for next Session. The officers in the Department(I mean the School Branch)are in a position to state that my predecessor never(except once)asked for anything from the Department for the Indian Residential School with the result that I am burdened with the past debts contracted for the building and equipment of said schools. That consideration might be of some value to assure my requests more favorable attention.\n\nYours very truly\n\nBishop of Grouard.\nNovember 19, 1935.\n\nDear Bishop Guy:\n\nI have Your Lordship's letters dated the 29th ultimo and the 12th instant, containing a list of requirements for the five Indian residential schools under your jurisdiction.\n\nIn this connection I have to inform you that as favourable consideration as possible is being given to providing, in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, 1936-37, the funds required in carrying out the repairs and supplying the equipment, as requested by you at each of the schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRight Rev.

I have already outlined to you the heavy expenses entailed in the freighting specially the first two, the Fort Vermilion costing over $2,000.00 and the Wabasca freight $2,500.00 every year. I hope that you will see the point and give my request consideration.\n\nI also ask for an increase in pupilage for:\nSt Bernard's School from 85 to at least 100\nSt Bruno's \" increase of five\nWabasca \" same increase or ten as Mr Phelan will be able to say.\nFort Vermilion School would also welcome a similar increase if I judge by reports from Rev.

This would be a very expensive food if we have to buy all the feed as we are now doing. Had we more land I feel we could raise most of the feed we need for the animals and also our own rolled oats and crushed wheat for the children and could give the boys better instruction in farming.\n\nAll our irrigation ditches are in very poor shape as practically nothing has been done for years except the very necessary repairs but now the wooden piping to the garden is beyond repair and must be replaced this spring otherwise we shall not be able to make use of our garden and all our fruit trees will be lost. We have a special system for irrigating the garden which is quite expensive and I would like to see this system joined up with the general system in which case we could increase the size of the garden and take in a few extra acres not yet under cultivation. Something must be done at once or we shall have to abandon the garden and this will be quite a loss to the School.\n\nThe School building is in need of a number of repairs. The walls should be cleaned: painted, white washed or kalsomined. I understood that a little over \u00a3120.00 was set aside for this purpose but nothing has been done.\n\nWhen Mr. Phalen was here he asked me to send in a requisition for story books for the children. I did so but the books did not come. I thought there may have been an oversight in this matter and if the officials of the Department were reminded, we might get a supply of these books.\n\nAs we have a certain number of children in school who are over the age of sixteen, I would like to obtain permission from the Department to keep them out of class during the last three or four months of their stay in School. At that age I feel that the instruction they receive in class is not so important as the instruction they will get on the farm or in the kitchen. Again if they had to put in a whole day at work they would be in a better position to do a day's work when hired out and we would not be so apt to get the complaint that our School children are lazy when they leave the School.\n\nI would be grateful to you if you could take up these different matters with the Department as I feel that they are all of sufficient importance to be given consideration.\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThos.

Father Scannell, O.M.I.,\nProvincial,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nVery Rev. and Dear Father:\n\nI promised to write to you with regard to a number of improvements which I feel are urgently needed at the School. Their need has been admitted by the Officials of the Department who have visited the School and help was promised but outside of that very little has been done.\n\nNew Machinery has been obtained for the Laundry but is stored in the Laundry as we are still waiting directions from the Department.\n\nIt has been admitted that the Septic Tank is not of sufficient capacity and in consequence is a source of danger to the health of the children especially in the Spring.\n\nThe Poles bearing the Electric Power lines have been judged to be unsafe and should be replaced. If the Power should be interrupted, we would be without water, light and heat.\n\nAt the present time we are milking twenty-five cows and the capacity of our barn is for only twenty-two. Most of our young stock has to be wintered in the out-buildings none of which are in very good condition. To milk twenty-five cows we need room for at least thirty besides the younger stock. We need milk even more milk for the children. For this we should have another barn.\n\nWe need more land. There are eighty acres belonging to the School but not more than forty or fifty acres can be used for cultivation. There is a piece of land located to the West of the School and close by. This land belongs to the Indians. It is rented to Chinamen and irrigated by the School. Father Plourde told me that some years ago there was question of obtaining this land in order that the ex-school children might settle there. That might be a good plan and even if this land were transferred to the School that plan might be followed out if it were considered practical. We might be able to help them through the technical school in putting up small buildings and in return they might sell their produce to the School. This would give them a start and experience after which they might be in a better condition to take up their position on the Reserves.\nKamloops Indian Residential School\nFOUNDED IN 1889\nIN CHARGE OF THE OBLATE FATHERS\n\nKamloops, B.C., Feb. 2, 1936.\n\nVery Rev. and Dear Father:\n\nI am enclosing a letter in which I enumerate some of the most important needs of the School. I hope the Department does not consider that the grant is sufficient to cover these improvements some of which are really essential. I did not go into any very great detail for all the officials who have visited the School have admitted that these requests are reasonable.\n\nI have finally gotten over my cold and am now in fairly good condition. I was not at all well after my return but am feeling much better.\n\nThings are running nicely here. The children are well and seem as happy as ever. They were all anxious to know where I had been and what I had been doing.\n\nWith the very best of wishes and thanking you for whatever you may be able to do with the suggestions in the enclosed letter, I remain\n\nYours devotedly, in J. & M.

As you are doubtless aware, the Oblate Fathers have during the past year spent a considerable sum of money improving the buildings, providing accommodation for increased pupilage. At the present moment there is accommodation for 220 children whilst the Indian Dept. only recognises pupilage for 152 children. One could understand this state of affairs were there no children in the various Indian Reserves around seeking admission to the school. The fact is that not only are there large numbers of children eligible for school but the condition of these children is such as to cause even the Indian Agent himself to remark on their deplorable condition. These children are oftentimes the victims of sad circumstances and it is not at all uncommon, (my authority is Rev. Fr. Patterson who works on the Indian Reserves), for these children to be seen drinking with adults. Anyone interested in the Indian question and seeing the deplorable effects upon the lives of these children, will readily see what inestimable benefits would accrue to them if the Indian Dept. would, by sanctioning their entry into the Residential School, afford them the protection and care they need so urgently.\n\nKAMLOOPS INDIAN SCHOOL. I am enclosing correspondence received from the Principal of this school. I need only add that anyone who has visited this school must agree with the officials of the Indian Dept., that these improvements etc. are very necessary.\n\nCRANBROOK INDIAN SCHOOL. I view of all circumstances and particularly in view of the fact that the Oblate Fathers have expended such large sums on this school, I feel certain that you will give an sympathetic hearing to any demands made in its favour. At the present moment there is a repeated demand for storage batteries. Unless the engine is maintained at full running power there is no means of lighting this school.\n\nThanking you in anticipation,\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nREV. J. SCANNELL O.M.I. PROVINCIAL.\nFebruary 17, 1936.\n\nDear Father Scannell:\n\nI have your letter of the 7th instant, with reference to the requirements at the St. Mary's Mission, Kamloops and Kootenay Indian Residential Schools and enclosing a communication which you received from the Reverend Principal of the Kamloops School.\n\nRegarding the request for an increased pupilage at the St. Mary's Residential School, I would say that, owing to a drastic cut in our Estimates, it has not been possible to provide for an increase in pupilage at this school for the coming fiscal year. I have noted that there are a sufficient number of children eligible for admission to fill the school to its present accommodation.\n\nWith reference to the request contained in the communication from Reverend Father Kennedy, Principal of the Kamloops Indian Residential School, I would say that the laundry machinery has been supplied and instructions have recently been issued to make the alterations required to the laundry and install the machinery. Certain funds will be available in our appropriation for the coming fiscal year to carry out repairs, painting, etc., and to repair the sewage disposal system. I regret that it was not possible to proceed with the erection of the barn. A supply of supplementary reading material has recently been sent the Principal, and he will be advised with reference to retaining in the classroom a number of the pupils who are over 16 years of age.\n\nRegarding the supplying of storage batteries for the lighting system at the Kootenay Indian Residential School, I would say that this matter is now before the Honourable the Minister to approve the expenditure required, and we are awaiting his directions in the matter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev.

Vous savez avec quelle peine et par quels prodiges d'industries de toutes sortes, nos Principaux parviennent \u00e0 boucler leurs budgets m\u00eame dans les plus favorables circonstances et quand les allocations sont vers\u00e9es en leur entier. Cette mesure appara\u00eet \u00e0 tous comme une injustice criante \u00e0 l'encontre du personnel des \u00c9coles et du travail de civilisation, de christianisation des races indiennes, qu'il poursuit avec tant de d\u00e9vouement.\n\nDu fait de cette r\u00e9duction, vous mettez certaines \u00e9coles dans l'impossibilit\u00e9 de continuer leur travail avec succ\u00e8s, et je pense en ce moment tout particuli\u00e8rement \u00e0 l'\u00c9cole du Lac d'Oignon dont le R\u00e9v.

Vous n'ignorez pas combien sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s les frais de transport dans cette r\u00e9gion; aussi je me permets de vous supplier de ne pas appliquer la r\u00e9duction \u00e0 cette \u00c9cole, \u00e0 supposer que vous soyez forc\u00e9 de la faire pour les autres, ou du moins de trouver quelques moyens de compenser la perte qu'elle va subir. Les frais de remplacement sont toujours consid\u00e9rables dans le nord de nos Provinces, ce qui ajout\u00e9 aux transports si co\u00fbteux va rendre presque surhumaine la t\u00e2che de nourrir, d'habiller et de traiter les enfants comme le D\u00e9partement l'exige.\n\nCher Dr. McGill, je reviens donc encore une fois \u00e0 la charge et vous prie d'accorder la requ\u00eate que je vous adresse en faveur de l'\u00c9cole du Lac d'Oignon.\n\nVeuillez agr\u00e9er l'expression de mes meilleurs sentiments,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEl.

McGill, General Superintendent,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Dr. McGill,\n\nYou will not be surprised to learn that it is with astonishment and deep regret that I heard of the 10% deduction which the Department has decided to reestablish in the allowances per capita made to Indian schools.\n\nPlease allow me to add my protests to those already made against this measure. You are aware of the hardships and the extraordinary efforts our Principals have to put up in order to balance their budgets, even in the most favourable circumstances and when allowances are paid in full. This measure appears to all concerned as a crying injustice towards the teaching staff and the work of civilisation and christianisation among the Indians, which they accomplish with so much devotion.\n\nOn account of this deduction it is impossible for some schools to continue their work with success and I mean the school of Lac d'Oignen, in particular, of which the Rev. Father Pratt is the Principal. You are fully aware of the high transportation charges in that region; so I am taking the liberty of asking you not to apply the deduction to that school, supposing you must do it for the others, or at least to find some means of counterbalancing the loss it will have to bear. The recruiting cost is always heavy in the north of our Provinces, and this, added to excessive transportation costs, will render almost superhuman the task of feeding, clothing and treating the children in the manner required by the Department.\n\nDear Mr. McGill I insist once more and I beg of you to grant the request I am making in favour of Lac d'Oignen school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) U.

In order to carry out this request, it was necessary to reduce per capita allowances. I may add, however, that the Government is at present considering restoring the 10% cut in the grants. It is hoped that an item will be included in the Supplementary Estimates to provide the amount necessary. I am, however, not in a position at the present time to state definitely if the restoration of the 10% will be made. The question will likely be decided by Treasury Board in the very near future. You will be informed when a decision has been made.\n\nIn the event that the cut in the grants is not restored, it would not be possible to make an exception in the case of the Onion Lake R.C. Indian Residential School, either by continuing the grant at the former rate or providing other means of counterbalancing the loss. It is necessary that all residential schools be placed on the same basis as regards any deduction in grants.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nVery Rev. U.

The situation has reached a very serious point as buildings are caving in with consequent danger to lives of staff and children. The buildings are very old and worn out. They have outlived their utility by many years.\n\nI would suggest that the Department vote a sum for construction and leave matter in our hands. We will promise to build according to plans and specifications to the complete satisfaction of the Department.

At the present time, it is not possible to recruit this number.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pine Creek, McIntosh and St. Philips Indian Residential Schools, all of which are paid at the same per capita rate as Muscovequan, can obtain more pupils than the number for which grant is provided.\n\nWe would, therefore, appreciate if the Department would decrease the pupilage allowed at Muscovequan from 120 to 105 and allow an increase of 5 in the pupilage at Pine Creek, McIntosh and St. Philips. This would mean that the pupilages at the schools mentioned would be as follows:-\n\n|             | Decrease | Increase |\n|-------------|----------|----------|\n| Muscovequan | reduced from 120 to 105 | 15       |\n| Pine Creek  | increased \" 100 \" 105    | -        |\n| McIntosh    | \"         \" 105 \" 110     | -        |\n| St. Philips | \"         \" 65 \" 70       | -        |\n\nAs mentioned above, the per capita rate at all four schools is the same and, consequently, there will be no increase in the Department's expenditure.\n\nHoping that you will consider this request favourably,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, November 19, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 17th instant, it has been decided to reduce the number for which grant is allowed at the Muscowequan Indian Residential School.\n\nIn view of this decrease, the following increases are being allowed:\n\nPine Creek - 100 to 105\nMcIntosh - 105 to 110\nSt. Philips - 65 to 70.\n\nThe grant for the increased number will be paid from January 1, 1937.\n\nThe Agents concerned are being written and requested to inform the reverend principal of each school accordingly.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Ave.,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nNovember 20, 1936.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nThe Representative of the Treasury:-\n\nI have approved of the following re-\narrangement in the per capita grants for pupilage, as\nfrom January first, 1937:-\n\n|                | Decrease | Increase |\n|----------------|----------|----------|\n| Muscowequan    | reduced from 120 to 105 | 15        |\n| Pine Creek     | increased \" 100 \" 105    | -         |\n| McIntosh       | \" 105 \" 110              | -         |\n| St. Philips    | \" 65 \" 70                | -         |\n\nThis adjustment in pupilage will not involve\nany increase in the amount provided for per capita grants.\nThe Muscowequan Indian Residential School, for which grant is\nprovided in the Appropriation for 120 pupils, has been unable,\nfor some time, to recruit that number of pupils, and the\nChurch Authorities have requested that the grant be decreased\nby 15 pupils and distributed among the other schools, as\nmentioned above.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMEMO\n\nOn the physical and economic conditions of the North West Territory Indians.\n\nHaving lived among the Natives of the North as a Missionary for well over 40 years, I feel that I am reasonably well qualified to give an opinion as to their physical state and their means of support of life.\n\nConvinced as I am that their conditions are so serious, I would be remiss in my duty towards them and the Government of Canada if I did not make an effort to bring it to your attention.\n\nEDUCATION\n\n1. The schools in the North West Territories, notwithstanding special and great difficulties, have achieved quite satisfactory results. The children who have spent some time in schools are stronger, they, especially the girls, have brought home principles and habits of cleanliness, hygiene and housekeeping to such an extent as to cause a real surprise to the whites and to be a credit to the Government and to the Churches.\n\nBoys, when they have not been kept too long in school, generally are better trappers and better hunters and are pretty hard to cheat in business and quite a few of them occasionally prove to be intelligent interpreters.\n\n2. Yet, owing to the nomadic character of the life our Indians have to live and the difficulties of communication, it is not an easy job to induce the parents to send their children to school, although they gradually realize the advantages of a good school training.\n\nBetter results would be obtained if all the Agents would give a little more of their time and of their heart to recruiting, or at least to help the recruiters.\n\n3. Until lately, the Department of Indian Affairs has been rather slow in helping for better equipment of the schools. It is to be hoped that in the future the Northern schools will receive a more fair share in the funds of the Department disposed for that end.\n\nIt should not be any more objected that the schools are owned by the Churches and that the Department cannot spend money on improvement of schools which are not its property. On the very contrary, the Department should be the more generous, as the Churches have done, for many years, at their own cost, what should have been done by the Government, as promised at Treaty time.\n\n4. Day schools would be of no satisfactory avail in the North West Territories. Indians do not stay long enough at the trading posts. When they do ask for such a school it is generally on the suggestion of some white men who have some children of school age. (Another Department should attend to the needs of the increasing white population.)\n\nWhenever some Indian family is resident at the Fort, the children could attend the school, the Indian Department paying for the attendance, as it is done in other places under the same conditions.\nThere are enough residential boarding schools in the districts, which this Memo is covering, to reasonably meet all the actual needs. The upkeep of small boarding schools is too great on account of the general expenses, and experience shows that should the Indians have a boarding school near to every trading post, they would still feel slow in sending in their children, especially when they have plenty of Cariboo around their camps. There always will be the difficulty of transporting the children on account of the great distances where the parents live and the difficulty for the latter to visit them as often as they could wish - one or two hundred miles, more or less, would not make a great difference. No school is actually filled to capacity.\n\nUnless the Government is ready to enforce compulsory education, a system which I would not recommend, before opening new schools it would seem wise to wait until such time when our Indians show a better appreciation of education.\n\nA good system of encouraging parents to send their children to schools would be to give some post scholar assistance to those who have been giving satisfaction and have stayed five years in the school. The boys would be given a rifle or a gun, with some traps, the girls, a hand sewing machine etc. As a rule the children should not be kept in school, the boys when they are over 13 or 14 years of age, the girls when they are over 16, unless when they are orphans and they ask to be kept until they are married.\n\nWhen the children are sent home for holidays, the Agents should adopt the practice, which is generally followed in the southern districts, to see that the children are sent back in time to their school, unless their parents are in a real need of their assistance.\n\nToo often poor orphans are kept in the camps as servants to greedy Indians, they are half clothed, even in winter time. They are also the last to be fed and they never are given any chance to enjoy any sympathy around them. They do not even draw one cent out of the Treaty annuity they are entitled to and which is fully claimed by their guardian.\n\nIn order to remedy such a pitiful condition, education should be made compulsory for all the orphans of school age and the Treaty annuity should be directly given to them as pocket money for little fancies.\n\nWhen they leave school, the Agent or the Church should see that they are placed with some reliable and good people who would train them to make their living by fishing, trapping and hunting.\n\nA few years ago, on my recommendation, the Department of Indian Affairs sent a circular to that effect to his agents in the North. The circular has been a dead letter so far.\n\nG. Breynat, O.M.I.,\nBishop of Adramyte,\nVic. Apost. of Mackenzie.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\n160-5\n\nOttawa, March 1, 1937.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Hoey,\n\nAs it is necessary to furnish a report to the Minister I should be obliged for the further observations of your Service in regard to the extracts from memo received from His Lordship Bishop Breynat on file hereunder.\n\nT.R.L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nMarch 3, 1937.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. MacINNES,\n\nA few weeks ago, I discussed with Bishop Breynat certain proposals submitted by him in a memorandum to the Department on December 8, 1936.\n\nBishop Breynat informed me at that time that he had given a great deal of thought to the preparation of a course of study designed to meet the peculiar needs of the school population of his district. I learned that the Bishop and Bishop Guy would submit a revised curriculum to me for consideration, in due course. I expressed the opinion that his proposals for additional vocational or semi-vocational instruction were very much in accord with my own views and that their adoption would be recommended by me, if I considered them at all practicable.\n\nIn paragraph 6 of his memorandum, Bishop Breynat suggests that promising pupils be given some post scholar assistance. I can see no objection whatever to this suggestion. Should we decide to do so, we shall be simply extending the help now given to Indian pupils entering high school to pupils in the North West Territories who are seeking to establish themselves on a self-supporting basis during the years immediately following their departure from school.\n\nIt is our intention to send out circular letters to our Agents in Bishop Breynat's district, asking them to take immediate steps toward the enforcement of Subsection 4 of Section 10 of the Indian Act. I heartily agree.\nagree with the Bishop when he insists that an earnest effort should be made to save Indian orphans from exploitation. We have at the moment under consideration a \"follow up system\", which it is our intention to work out and adopt, in cooperation with the churches. If we are successful in the creation of an effective system of this kind, there is no reason whatever why it should not be extended to the North West Territories. I am personally convinced that the extension of this policy will correct a great many of the abuses to which Bishop Breynat refers.\n\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr H. A. HOEY,\nDirector welfare and training,\nINDIAN AFFAIRS Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nMy dear Mr Hoey:\n\nVery reverend Father Edouard Lamontagne, O.M.I., Provincial of the Manitoba Oblate Religious Province, has requested me to write you regarding the pupilage in the ten Indian residential schools under his jurisdiction. I might point out as a matter of information that the territory over which Rev. Fr Lamontagne has jurisdiction comprises the western part of Ontario and the southern parts of Manitoba and Saskatchewan. Your Department maintains with the cooperation of Oblate Fathers under Father Lamontagne's jurisdiction the following schools:\n\n| School          | Pupilage |\n|-----------------|----------|\n| PORT FRANCES    | 85       |\n| KELOWNA         | 85       |\n| McINTOSH        | 110      |\n| FORT ALEXANDER  | 105      |\n| FINE CREEK      | 105      |\n| SANDY BAY       | 75       |\n| LEBRET          | 225      |\n| ST - PHILIPPE   | 70       |\n| MARIEVAL        | 85       |\n| LE STOCK        | 105      |\n\nFrom the experience gathered in the operation of residential schools over a period of more than fifty years, we have come to the conclusion that residential schools with a pupilage less than 125 are economically unsound. It is probable that a pupilage of 150 would come closer to the ideal school.\n\nThe following schools: Fort Frances, Kenora, Fort Alexander, Fine Creek, Sandy Bay, Marieval, have been in operation under our management for more than 30 years. The experience that we have gathered in their operation should be fairly conclusive. During that period, we have had principals possessing fair ability. Some of them were considerably above the average and none, we believe, were so inferior in ability as to be unable to discharge their duties creditibly. Nevertheless, the operation of this group of schools shows a marked difference in increased cost as well as in lesser efficiency compared with schools having a larger pupilage.\nThis statement can be verified, we believe, by your inspectors and agents as well as by the officials of the Department in Ottawa.\n\nBearing this in mind, Father Lamontagne desires me to officially request the Department of Indian Affairs to increase the pupilage of the schools under his jurisdiction to the point where they will be placed on a sound administrative footing, so that those in charge of them may be able to render to the wards of the Government the services that these schools are expected to produce and that this will be done with the greatest efficiency possible and at a cost commensurate with such services.\n\nMy experience with residential schools leads me to believe that Father Lamontagne is quite justified in making this request and I hope that you will give it serious consideration.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, March 7, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 4th instant, in which you refer to a request received by you from Father E.

In view of the fact that this is a matter of government policy and one that can only be decided by the Minister, it is the intention of the Director to bring the matter to his attention, just as soon as he can conveniently do so.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

As the Department fully knows this location is to say the least of the matter\u2014a trouble spot. Even this year whilst Bishop Coudret was down that way, another bad break out of drunkenness took place. This attracts all the Indians who can come from other Posts, and this summer they all congregated here. Therefore His Lordship saw many Indians and many children, mostly of the McAmes district. Really there are very few Indian children located at this spot, who can be stated as Liard Indians.\n\nAt the time the McAmes School was started, Father Allard was in charge, that was about 8 years ago. After the building was three parts finished Father Allard turned his attention to Liard Post, at the end of each summer. Then the white men who were married to Indian women requested to have a school started and offered to build and help same along. Watson, LeGormier and Hazelburgh being the prime movers. Father Allard on this obtained a plot of ground outside the Reserve, and matters were started up. But no help was given and matters took on the coating that the Indian Department should do all this, and that it was their business to do so. After the R.C.M.I. Detachment had been moved away, much drunkenness came about, and it has been going on ever since. This in itself has induced many more Indian families to spend their summers at Liard Post.\n\nHowever it was decided by the R.C. Missions to build a church at Liard Post on their own compound, and this they have accomplished. His Lordship stated that here would be a very fine place to establish a winters school. This Office would rather not say as to if this would be a success or not. It can be seen that there would be trouble ahead, for Liard Post is only 6 miles south of the Yukon Boundary Line and nearly all the real Liard Post Indians are really Yukon rappers. It can be seen that most of the Indian families would at once request Relief, they would not trap for a living but would trap for luxuries only. The cost would be great at this remote location and it would certainly draw Indian families from other points, in fact McAmes Creek Indians would no doubt go to Liard Post.\n\nAnother point to be considered is that of Law & Order, it is hopeless to try and do anything down there until some Detachment of Police is allowed.\n\nAgain, the Edmonton Air Pine Mail Service has just established a base on Watson's Lake, a very suitable point 30 miles within the Yukon, and it is now understood that Mr Watson is running a Store. If this is so, and it will be checked later on in the season, Liard Post as it is today, will go back to just a small trading spot, a meeting place of the Dease River and the Liard River proper.\n\nThe matter seems to be a real problem at the present time but will be looked into and reported upon when the summer's visit to here has been completed.\n\nFrom the Office point of view all these schools must be taken in conjunction with the Indians Trapping Affairs\u2014otherwise it results into a mere question of Rations and Relief. One thing is certain\u2014if the Nomads give up or do not use their trapping grounds they will be entirely lost to the Indians in the near future.\n\nAll of which Sir, is a summary of the R.C. Mission work up to the present time, which it was thought correct to submit in view of the visit to these parts just completed by His Lordship Bishop Coudret.\n\nO.M.I.\n\nI am,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nHarper Reed\n\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nThe Secretary\nCaribou Hide School PROPOSED. Much has been written regarding the needs of a school for this Band of Indians. The whole trouble in the way of this being accomplished, is the fact that these Indians live about 250 miles away from any place at all. The expense is very great in getting even flour out to these nomads.\n\nBishop Coudret has not visited this Band, but did just happen to meet one or two of their members\u2014and of course they wish a School\u2014at the Department's expense. This means a full load of a Plane, if not two runs. The \"sachem\" would expect to be taken in, with his supplies. The matter could be considered, but is quite out of the question to fix up in any proper way, this Summer. Books have been sent out, and no doubt some good work could be done if a Teacher would go out and start up. Mr Anglin now of Mo Dames has offered to go, and perhaps with some extra pay allowance, would undertake the work this winter. But a school house should be built here, and that takes time. However in this respect, during the last year an Air Mail Route is in operation up to Fort Ware (Old Whitewater) on the Finlay River, on the top end of which the Caribou Hide Band lives. It would mean \u00bd of an hours run\u2014extra\u2014or from Fort Ware to reach the Indians location. These Planes are run by Mr Chonicky (?) of Edmonton Alta. Prices could be obtained if the matter is considered.\n\nDease Lake Summer Day School. This school was rather a venture for a small set of Indians living at Dease Lake. It was thought proper to start a school especially as Inspector Emmell was requested to do so by these Indians, and they gave their promise to attend. Therefore Father Bosse went out there and started a school in an old cabin, much too crowded, but preferred to do that than use a special tent that was supplied. In the meantime the Church House was being erected, and last Fall completed. This Spring it is in use, being a very fine building. However it seems that some sort of difference in views has come about between the Indian Families, cause not known, but which can no doubt be settled. Here His Lordship seems to think another winter school could be established which would do much better than the present summer school. This Office is inclined to agree to this, taking into consideration the trapping affairs of these families, which are situated all around that Dease Lake District. This matter will be taken up with the Indians later this season when that area is inspected. However the school has done some good work up to now.\n\nMc Dames Summer Day School. This was the Agency's first venture and was started by the late Father Allard\u2014it was a success from the start, and went along fine until we lost Father Allard by drowning. Father Bosse then took charge and the change was noticed. Father Bosse gave this attention and also Liard Post visitations at the same time and it was really too much. Lately we have had separate Teachers and the school has shown good results until this year. This season owing to several reasons the Indians have all side slip'd to Liard Post\u2014there is more excitement at that point. Also owing to sickness in two families, and the fact also that they were questioned last summer in regard to the Mc Donald Murder Charge, undertaken by Cpl Blatta of the R.C.M.P., these two families with a lot of school youngsters, have not reported in to Mc James Creek this summer. It has all meant that the attendance is low. However it is most certainly expected that all the Mc Dames Indians will return again to that point\u2014next summer. His Lordship thought that a winter school here also would be perhaps good. The Office point of view is that it is not quite possible. Should this take place these real nomads would just come in to the Post and sit down, and beg Rations\u2014it would eventually be very expensive, and wind up in trouble with the Indians going away again to the \"woods\". Mc James is the centre of the cart-wheel arrangement of trapping grounds around that district, but is too large for Indians to be running in and out during the trapping season. This school should be retained as it is.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit a summary report hereunder on the general affairs of the R.C. Mission now operating in this southern end of the Stikine Agency. The reason for this being that His Lordship Bishop Bunoz, O.M.I., of Prince Rupert has recently given over this area for inspection to His Lordship Bishop Coudret, O.M.I., late of the Mackenzie River District, who might perhaps think matters in the Cassiar are indeed too rough.\n\nBishop Coudret arrived here on the 10th of June and along with Father Carpentier, newly arrived proceeded to inspect the Cassiar. He was met returning to Telegraph Creek on July 3rd, on the Dease Lake Trail, and then he stated that Mission Affairs were not as he thought they would be. The afternoon of July 6th, was spent within the Indian Office with His Lordship, and Father Carpentier, when all matters were talked over and gone into.\n\nTherefore it is considered that a summary of this interview should be submitted, as so many points of interest are involved, which if not looked at with care might lead to useless expense and trouble.\n\nTo-day the following are engaged upon R.C. Mission work. Father Leo Boss\u00e9, O.M.I., who it is stated is \"in charge\" of general affairs. Father Pouletto with Father Drea are at Liard Post, whilst Father Carpentier is visiting around, and it is thought intends to settle at McPames Creek. In addition to the above Mr Moran is a Teacher, who was at the Klappan Winter School last winter but who now is teacher for the Dease Lake School (Summer). Mr Anglin is the Teacher for the McPames Summer School in operation now. It will be seen that there are now 6 persons engaged upon the R.C. Mission work, which considering the number of Indians within this area is really more than sufficient - it is thought.\n\nThe various points will now be taken in their trail order.\n\nThe Klappan Winter Day School. Klappan District south of Telegraph Creek. This was a new venture started some three summers ago, and as reported is no doubt a success. Bishop Coudret thinks highly of this idea, and goes so far as to say that all schools should be \"winter Schools\". However he intends to let Mr Moran return to this point for next winter, and all the Indians wish this, from the Office point of view it is a fine idea. Supplies have been submitted by Requisition, it is hoped that same can be allowed. They might seem to be much, but it must be remembered that the old Cabin was not too big, and now the school is working, it could be set on its feet once and for all. The School Masters job is not a nice one, and some comfort should be allowed him.\nSir:\n\nI beg to submit hereunder a report covering the month of June 1938.\n\nOn the 10th instant there arrived His Lordship Bishop Goudret, O.M.I., with Father Carpentier, O.M.I., both going \"inside\" to look over their affairs regarding the R.C. Mission work. They were good enough to pay this office a visit, when the files were produced and all questions asked answered. His Lordship was told that matters within the Cassiar were much \"rougher\" than what he had been accustomed to in the Mackenzie River district, and that we were not nearly so civilized. This he did not quite believe then, but upon his return in July, fully assented to. A special report covering the various points visited by him, is being submitted; but he no doubt found matters rather upset all along the line. One bright event he was pleased with, and that was the successful operation of the Klappan Winter Day school. This has proved its worth. More fur was obtained by allowing the large families to come to rest at the school - all under supervision and correct order. The families this spring were found to be more orderly - cleaner, and above all - looking forward to next winter's schooling.\n\nIt was explained to His Lordship that the winter schooling and family arrangements were mixed up with the Indians trapping affairs, that one helped the other; and also that it was almost impossible to move families around the district if their trapgrounds were not in that same locality.\n\nAt Liard Post, which has always been a trouble spot; His Lordship found matters not at all to his liking. The run of events at this interior Post have greatly changed during the past three years, in fact even since the late Father Allard, O.M.I., decided to buy a plot of ground and establish a Church. About every four years the Indians of McDames Creek will trail back from their trapping grounds, and, for a change, go to Liard Post, in spite of the fact that the prices at Liard are much higher than they are at McDames Post. This summer this has happened once more. The reason for this is partly due to the fact that a plans calls at Liard from Edmonton. Also Mr. Strong of the Taku Trading Coy. has now made a very strong bid for his store at that point as against the H.B. Coy. and a small free-trader called Cormier. The Indians have a good time with such a state of affairs, as can be expected. But of course this will not last, and the McDames Indians with their families will return again next summer to McDames, leaving much \"credit\" at Liard Post.\n\nAlso on the top of all this excitement the Upper Liard is now being settled by white trappers, and plenty of provisions can now be obtained by \"air\" and so the halfbreed families who live up that way, do not now report at Liard Post. However, as stated a report of these affairs will be submitted under separate cover.\n\nHarper Reed,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, December 22, 1938.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have been instructed by the Minister to send forward to you copy of a letter addressed by him to Reverend Dr. Westgate.\n\nThe subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR.

Should you desire additional information, however, I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. W. V. Doran,\nSt. Patrick's College,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMr. R.A. Hoey  \nDepartment of Welfare and Training  \nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI had occasion to meet His Excellency, Bishop Langlois of Grouard, last Saturday when he passed through Winnipeg on his way to Alberta. He told me that he was very sorry he could not see you when he passed through Ottawa prior to his leaving for the West as there were two problems that he wished particularly to place before you for your early consideration.\n\nThe first concerns the water supply in the five schools of his Vicariate. Your Department promised to thoroughly investigate this whole question and I understand that you have already sent one of your engineers to report on same. Unfortunately nothing seems to have been done since the engineer's visit. The season is fast advancing and if anything substantial is to be accomplished this year, immediate steps should be taken. His Excellency says that, since the money for these projects has been voted, the Department should proceed immediately with the work.\n\nThe other problem in which as you know His Excellency is taking particular interest is the establishment of a general Training School for Indian children when they leave the boarding schools. With the age regulation which has been enforced for several years past, the period between the time that the children leave the boarding schools and the time that they become established is, in most cases, very long and no particular kind of employment seems to be available for these boys and girls during that period.\n\nHis Excellency has in mind the establishment of a training or technical school which would receive and train the girls from the time they leave the boarding school until they could be safely sent back to their homes or duly\nand honorably married. The boys are not exposed to quite the same dangers as the girls, but they also need to have training. It is impossible to do so in the ordinary Indian Residential Schools because the staff is either insufficient or not qualified for this purpose.\n\nEventually the school which His Excellency has in mind would provide training for boys in agriculture, carpentry and general mechanics but for the time being girls only would be accepted. Two nuns of the Order of Providence are now available for this school. Both are technical school graduates. If the Bishop cannot give them employment now they may be transferred to another part of the country and thus their services would be lost for Indian work.\n\nFor the purpose of establishing this school, His Excellency will place at the disposal of the Department, free of charge, for at least a few years to come, a substantial building situated at St. Augustine's, about ten miles from Peace River. This building is suitable and sufficiently large; it being used at the present time as a boarding school for white children of the district. If the sum of $3,000.00 could be set aside by your Department, the Bishop would undertake to assume all other expenses in connection with the opening, furnishing and operation of the school and agree to give training for one year at least to twenty Indian girls.\n\nAnother reason why the Bishop is very anxious to open this school for Indian girls immediately is that the Government of Alberta is pressing him to accept the wayward children of the district. Should the school once accept these children it would become almost impossible for the Bishop to dismiss them and his project as far as the Indians are concerned would be postponed almost indefinitely.\n\nYour early consideration of the Bishop's request is, therefore, most earnestly desired.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, June 3, 1939.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 30th ultimo, in which you discuss certain suggestions made to you by His Excellency Bishop Langlois when he interviewed you at Winnipeg a few days ago.\n\nYou will be glad to know that we have received a full and complete report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch in respect to the water supply at the five schools in which Bishop Langlois is interested. I have today issued instructions to the Engineering Branch to proceed immediately with the work. Provision has been made also for the transfer of the funds necessary for material, labour, etc.\n\nI have discussed with Mr. Phelan who is at this date absent from Ottawa, ways and means whereby we might help Bishop Langlois to provide a worthwhile course of vocational instruction for the girl graduates of his schools. I regret to state, however, that we have not been able to discover a source from which the amount of money necessary could be secured. As a matter of fact, the requests already received for repairs and maintenance at residential schools will far exceed the amount provided in this year's appropriations. In view of this fact, I feel confident it would be simply a waste of time to prepare an Order-in-Council making provision for this grant and submit it to the Minister in the hope that he would approve it.\n\nMr. Phelan, I understand, has already -\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nalready intimated to Bishop Langlois that we would be prepared to arrange for a certain amount of the equipment necessary to provide vocational courses at the five schools. This help, of course, would be somewhat limited but is the only help we can render during the present fiscal year.\n\nYou are aware, no doubt, that the Dominion and Alberta Governments are at present discussing ways and means whereby a large area in northern Alberta will be set apart for the exclusive use of Indians and halfbreeds. It is just possible that when this scheme is worked out the school to which the Bishop has referred might be utilized as a vocational school for the training of Indian and half-breed girls. This is merely my own thought. I have taken no part in the negotiations and consequently am not in a position to state when a decision is likely to be reached.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nSuperintendent of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI have heard from the Reverend Father Plourde that in the supplementary estimate recently passed provision was made for the restoration of the 5% which had been deducted from the Per Capita allowances of Indian Residential Schools.\n\nPlease permit me as the English Speaking Provincial of the Oblates of Canada to thank you very sincerely and very warmly for the part you have played in the restoration of this grant to its former level. I can assure you that the schools under my charge will appreciate very sincerely your kindly interest in this matter.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJ. Scannell O.M.I.\nProvincial.\nMr. R.A.

Your efforts and influence in this matter are considered by me as very beneficial to the welfare of the Indians, and as of very great credit to yourself.\n\nThe practical guidance you have\nbeen giving in the matter of Indian Education deserves also high commendation and shall be followed by our school staffs to the utmost of their ability. Much has been done in this direction, and more progress is anticipated.\n\nSincerely and gratefully yours,\n\nFather Henri Belleau O.M.I.\nVicar-Provincial of the James Bay Catholic Missions.\nTwo Fort George Indians Attend Consecration Here\n\nTwo of the most interested spectators at the consecration of Mgr. Henri Belleau, O.M.I., apostolic vicar of James Bay, at Sacred Heart Church in Ottawa, were two Indians from Fort George on the shores of James Bay, who came to Ottawa to witness the colorful ceremony.\n\nThe two representatives of the Cree Indians were Peter Waaskahigan, 31 years of age, and Wally Rupert, 25. They were accompanied by Rev. Father D. Couture, O.M.I., Fort George missionary. Both are catechumens who are being instructed by Father Couture in the principles of the Catholic faith. When informed that Father Belleau was to be made a bishop, they expressed the wish to be present at the ceremony and paid part of their fare to Ottawa.\n\nThe missionary put up the balance.\n\nIt was their first visit to the civilized world. After counting by degrees the distance of 300 miles separating Fort George and the railway terminal of Moosonee, they saw a train for the first time. Neither of them speak English nor French and although very bashful over their new experience seemed to enjoy every bit of their maiden voyage to civilization.\n\nFather Couture told The Citizen that they were highly impressed by the consecration ceremony which was presided over by His Eminence Cardinal Villeneuve. During their stay in Ottawa, the two Indians are the guests of the Oblate Fathers at St. Joseph's Scholasticate.\nWinnipeg, Ottawa, June 12, 1940.\n\nHonourable T. A. Crerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nMy dear Mr. Crerar:\n\nThe lot of Church owned Indian Residential Schools is becoming more and more difficult every day, and it occurred to those interested that some special regulations should be adopted by the Department of Indian Affairs for the administration of these same schools.\n\nWhen the various Church organizations working in conjunction with the Department of Indian Affairs decided, years ago, to build Indian Residential Schools at their own expense, they conferred a favour on the Indian Department and Canada at large. It now seems that they are unwittingly penalized for this special contribution to the welfare of the Indians of Canada.\n\nWhilst Government owned Indian Schools receive yearly a fair proportion of moneys for repairs, alterations and general upkeep without any undue obstacles being placed in the spending of such funds, Church owned Schools, the original cost of which was borne solely by the Churches concerned, find that on every occasion where funds are necessary for their upkeep, so many regulations have to be observed that the spending of the money voted becomes a more involved problem than the obtaining or the voting of it.\n\nThese Church owned buildings were originally erected solely for the accommodation of Indian children, and there has never been any departure from this principle, nor is it the intention of the Churches to use them in the future in a different manner than in the past.\n\nTaking the above facts into consideration I feel that when requests are forwarded for repairs and improvements to these Church-owned schools the Department should not hesitate to assist simply because the buildings were originally erected from Church funds. When all is said and done these Church-owned schools are an integral part of the Indian educational system and as a consequence are entitled to receive the same fair consideration that the Department accords to the buildings which they themselves have erected.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRev. J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nTHE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nChurch-owned Indian Residential Schools\n\nJune 17, 1940\n\nI enclose a letter to the Minister from the Rev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I., written from Ottawa, June 12, submitting that some special regulations should be adopted by the department for the administration of the above mentioned schools, for the reasons given therein.\n\nI quote the closing paragraph:\n\n\"Taking the above facts into consideration I feel that when requests are forwarded for repairs and improvements to these Church-owned schools the Department should not hesitate to assist simply because the buildings were originally erected from Church funds.

Jackson.\n\nOttawa, July 9, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde,\n\nI wish to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo, in which you refer generally to the monies provided by the Government for repairs to church-owned Indian Residential Schools. So far as I am aware, the Indian Affairs Branch adopts the same practice for all the Residential Schools whether they are church-owned or not. It is true, of course, that in the Government-owned schools the expenditures are made in accordance with the usual Government regulations covering the spending of money. As to church-owned schools, it is necessary to see that the money is spent for the purposes for which it was voted. In this respect there is no difference between either class of schools, except that in one case the church authorities spend the money under Government supervision.\n\nYou are aware of the difficulties we have had in the past in connection with repairs made to some of the church-owned schools where the expenditures have greatly exceeded the amount estimated. This, of course, should not be permitted and is probably the reason why the officials in the Branch may be more strict now than they have been in the past. As I said before, we do not make any distinction between the cost of repairs to either class of schools; in fact, I understand this year the amount set aside in the Estimates for repairs to church-owned schools is almost twice what it is to those owned by the Government.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nReverend J.O.

Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOctober 11, 1940\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAmong the numerous letters which I have received from the Principals of the Catholic group of Indian Residential Schools, I find that all those that come from the small schools with an average attendance ranging around 75 and below, strike the same note of complaint; i.e., the cut in the per capita grant, or rather in the attendance, is particularly difficult to cope with in small schools.\n\nThe overhead is almost the same as in a school where the grant is allowed for 100 or more and the receipts are from 25% to 40% less. The only saving effected is in the matter of clothing and food. Clothing of course is always cash disbursements, but food is sometimes provided in part by the school farm so that as a matter of actual expense almost the only difference between the small school and the medium or larger one is the question of clothing.\n\nThat being the case would it not be possible in the coming estimates to consider the case of these small schools in a more favourable way than was done last year, and to exempt them from the cut in attendance. You have often spoken to me about the handicap that these small schools have to overcome on account of their small attendance; my present appeal will therefore fall on willing ears.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nOctober 15, 1940\n\nREGISTERED\nOttawa, October 18, 1940.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 11th instant, written by you on behalf of a number of residential schools where the pupil enrolment in each case does not exceed 75.\n\nI fully appreciate the position in which the Principals of these schools find themselves and I have intimated to my associates here that the coming year is likely to be a very critical one for the people of Canada.\n\nOur 1941-42 estimates were reviewed by the Director and the senior officials at the Minister's office on the afternoon of October 7. In response to instructions, almost every appropriation has been reduced. In view of this fact, I do not consider that there is even a remote possibility of securing for these smaller schools an amount greater than the per capita grants paid them last year.\n\nHowever, this is a matter that in my judgment you would be well advised to take up with us when you visit Ottawa.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nOttawa, February 4, 1941.\n\nDear Father Routhier:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the first instant, in which you discuss again the eligibility of Allan Hunter for enrolment at the Blue Quills School.\n\nYou may be interested to learn that I have this morning discussed the subject matter of your letter very fully with the Reverend Father Plourde. This is a matter which, in my judgment, requires a great deal of careful consideration. Father Plourde is anxious to have an opportunity to discuss it with a number of residential school principals and with the members of his Indian Missionary Committee. It is altogether likely that you shall hear from either Father Plourde or from the Department, just as soon as a definite decision has been reached.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend H. Routhier, O.M.I.,\nOblate Fathers' Provincial House,\n9916 - 110th Street,\nEdmonton, Alberta.\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI am sending forward herewith, for your information, copy of a letter received by me from the Reverend Father H. Routhier, Provincial of the Oblate Order, Edmonton, Alberta. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt has been the policy and practice of the Department to define Catholic children for enrolment at our residential schools as children of Catholic parents and non-Catholic pupils as the children of non-Catholic parents. It would now appear, however, that a number of the principals and at least one or two of the church authorities would like to see the policy changed and an opportunity extended to the parents of Indian children to determine the institution in which their children should be educated, that is to say, whether this institution should be conducted under Catholic or non-Catholic auspices.\n\nAs I pointed out to you in our conversation of this morning, this is a question that requires a great deal of careful study. It is just possible that you may desire to discuss the matter with a number of the principals of your residential schools and also with the members of your Indian Missionary Committee. It is scarcely necessary to add that I shall be glad to hear from you again, when you have had an opportunity to consider the matter more fully.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training.\n\nReverend J. O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nDear Friend of the Missions,\n\nWith the war draining so great a share of our country's resources for its work of destruction and death, will a few pennies remain in the pocketbooks of our friends, and will a bit of generosity be found in the depths of their hearts for the work of the Missions?\n\nAll Christians know it; this work must continue, and continue unceasingly. Our Saviour tells us so in Chapter X of St. John: \"Other sheep I have: they MUST be brought to the fold.\"\n\nThese words are imperative and apply to each one of us who has received the gift of faith. Let me repeat them on behalf of the poor Apostolic Vicariate of Grouard, for nothing but this command would be potent enough as to make me extend today a begging hand.\n\nDURING THIS LENTEN SEASON OF 1941, WILL YOU GIVE US A SMALL SHARE OF YOUR ALMS?\n\nThe fact is that our 18,000 Catholics, Indians and newly established settlers, are unable, in most cases, to provide for the upkeep of their Missionaries. This heavy task falls upon the Vicar Apostolic, who, besides providing for these Missionaries in sickness and in health, constructing numerous urgently-needed chapels etc., is often called upon to pay the travelling expenses of his priests from one Mission to the other, so that the ministry of souls be not neglected, and to obtain for them Mass stipends to maintain these priests at their posts of duty. Our Missionaries, I am happy to acknowledge, are not exacting; nevertheless, they must have the indispensables.\n\nWere it not for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, and the aid of friends living afar, the Vicar Apostolic would be practically without funds at his disposal. Judge for yourself: the collections taken up in 1940 in the Mission Church which serves as Cathedral (until more favourable circumstances permit us to build a church and a modest residence for the bishop in a more central and accessible location) have amounted to an average of seventy cents a Sunday. Our good people do their best, but they cannot give that which they have not.\n\nTherefore, in the name of our Vicariate, in the name of my Missionaries who toil hard and of our institutions that should multiply, we confidently turn towards the friends of the Missions and ask them: \"Will you give us a small part of your Lenten almsgiving?\"\n\n\"To Saint Joseph, special Procurator of our Missions, to whom this month is consecrated, we confide this request. We beseech him to inspire you with all the generosity your means allow, and to grant you in return all the choice Blessings and favours you desire to obtain.\n\nPlease accept the anticipated expression of our deep gratitude and of our best sentiments in Christ.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGROUARD, Alta.,\nMarch 12, 1941\nOttawa,\nMay 3, 1941.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 26th ultimo with reference to the desire of Rev. Father Lamontagne to place insurance on certain of the schools conducted under the auspices of the Manitoba Oblate Province.\n\nMr. Hoey and I have discussed this suggestion very carefully and several insurmountable difficulties appear. The schools in question are owned by the Government and if insurance were placed on them by the Oblate Order it is extremely difficult to foresee what action the insurance company might take in the event of a fire.\n\nAs far as we are aware no such procedure has been taken in the past and consequently to allow you to place insurance on these buildings appears to me to be a matter of Government policy. This could only be finally decided by the Minister. Possibly you would feel disposed to discuss the proposal with him on the occasion of your next visit to Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Philip Phelan  \n161 Holmwood  \nOttawa\n\nMy dear Phil:\n\nRev. Father Lamontagne, Provincial of the Manitoba Oblate Province, is very anxious as to the security of the Residential Schools in his province, which are not fireproof. These include St. Phillips, Marieval, Fort Alexander, Pine Creek, Sandy Bay, McIntosh, Kenora and Fort Frances.\n\nHe feels, like so many others now engaged in Indian work, that with conditions as they are, if any of these schools was destroyed by fire, the Government would refuse to rebuild them, and this might last until after the war and possibly for much longer.\n\nHe would be prepared to place a fair amount of insurance on each of these schools if it could be done legally; or at least with the consent of the Department. His purpose in this would be to provide funds for the rebuilding of the schools in case any of them was destroyed by fire.\n\nKnowing the sentiment that prevails in some sections of the Department, I do not want this to be discussed too openly, but if you could secure an opinion as to the possibility of our insuring these schools, I would be very much obliged if you would transmit it to me on as early a date as you can.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nMay 21st, 1941\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nEnclosed is a letter that I received from our Auditor Mr. Lawrence Ryan in which he is asking for certain information that you were kind enough to obtain for us in past years.\n\nWould you be kind enough to obtain this information for us again and send it to me or directly to him at the address on his letter-head.\n\nWith many thanks for this and past favors, I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nReverend W.V.

In discussing the matter of the Indians, we felt that a knowledge of the financial affairs of the Indian Residential Schools was necessary for our approach to the different problems which this work in the Archdiocese presents.\n\nIf the Department will supply them, therefore, I should like to ask copies of the financial reports of the Indian Schools in the Archdiocese for the last three years,- Sechelt, N. Vancouver, Mission City, Kamloops, Cariboo.\n\nThanking you for your kind attention in this matter,\n\nI remain\n\nVery truly yours,\n\nE. Q. Jennings  \nAuxiliary Bishop of Vancouver.\nAll money raised by work must be used for the Indians' Extra School.\nOttawa,\nDecember 10, 1941.\n\nDear Bishop Jennings:\n\nI received your letter of the 25th ultimo regarding the financial affairs of the Indian residential schools in the Archdiocese of Vancouver. I regret that it is not our practice to supply copies of our audited statements of financial transactions at residential schools. These are prepared solely for the information of Departmental officials and the Principal of the school concerned.\n\nFor your information I may add that these statements indicate that our residential schools are finding it extremely difficult to finance on the per capita allowance which we pay. As you may suppose, this is due to advancing prices on all lines of goods and the further fact that a year ago it was found necessary to reduce the pupilage for which grant is allowed. This latter action had to be taken by the Department due to war conditions. We realize that it has worked a hardship on our schools as it is not easy for the school management to reduce overhead expenses.\n\nFor the per capita allowance paid to each school the management is required to feed, clothe and educate the Indian children in their care as well as provide heat, light and other expenses incident to the operation of large buildings. Our reason for auditing the accounts is to assure ourselves that the per capita allowance paid to each residential school is expended only at that school for the welfare of the children who are in attendance. Reports that we have received indicate that the Indian residential schools in the Archdiocese of Vancouver are complying with the Department's wishes and no funds are being diverted to any other project.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRt.

O. Jennings  \nAuxiliary Bishop of Vancouver\nWINNIPEG, March 11, 1942\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith very few exceptions all the schools that are conducted by the Reverend Oblate Fathers are asking for paint either for interior or exterior renovating. Judging from what I have seen as a result of personal inspection of these buildings, I am inclined to believe that the request of our Principals is quite justified.\n\nI was given to understand that in all cases labour and wages would be supplied by the school management either out of grant, or out of missionary funds.\n\nAs your fiscal year will come to a close soon, I am of the opinion that funds that may still be available would be well spent if employed for this purpose. After all, it might be remembered that nearly all these schools are the property of the Government and in requesting paint for their proper upkeep, the Principals are cooperating in a generous manner towards eliminating waste and deterioration.\n\nIn making this request I have no particular school in mind, but it is possible that all the buildings would be materially improved by a liberal use of paint this coming Summer.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa,\nMarch 19, 1942.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to paint required at the residential schools conducted under the auspices of the Catholic Church. We have received several requests recently for paint from some of the schools to which you refer and favourable consideration has been given to such requests. As you are probably aware, new regulations have been issued recently restricting the sale of paint and it is quite possible that this article will be difficult to secure during the coming year. However, we will keep your recommendation in mind and all requests for paint will be favourably considered, provided it can be secured when funds are available.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\n4.- Re Treatment of T.B. cases in our local Hospitals of the Prince Rupert district. I beg to say that I received lately a letter from Father M. Murie, our Vicarial Bursar, stating that \"the local Indian Agent Mallinson has recently caused much trouble to the Sisters of St. Ann. at their local Hospital in Smithers; he absolutely insists that Indian T.B. cases ought to be sent to the Hazelton Hospital (which is under the auspices of the United Church and is not better equipped for the treatment of T.B. cases than any of our local Catholic Hospitals of Smithers and Vanderhoof)\". So, the persecution and other petty annoyances of Dr. McQuarry go on; Dr. McQuarry had the audacity to tell me oneday, right to my face, that \"if he had anything to say in the matter, no Catholic Sisters would be allowed to work in any of the Hospitals run by the Department for the treatment of Indian patients\" ... When shall the Department do justice to our Catholic Indians and allow them to be treated in our Catholic Institutions? We are getting fed up with such methods on the part of the Officials of the Indian Department.\n\nYou may communicate this letter to the Department in the hope that we may get a fair deal in our work; we ask for no favors but simply for what is due us and to our Catholic Indian Children and Patients.\n\nCould you please let me know as soon as possible what can be done to meet the wishes of His Excellency.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMarch 26/47\n\nWINNIPEG, MANITOBA\nthe North in our School of Lejac; those children have been sent to Lejac partly at our own expenses and partly at the expense of the Department; owing to the exorbitant price of transportation to Lejac and to the isolation of those children from their parents and tribe, the present arrangement is very unsatisfactory; a school of some fifty or sixty children in the North, at Tagish Lake or elsewhere, would be filled overnight; I insist, therefore, that the Government give due consideration to our very legitimate request.\n\n3.- Re District Nurse for the Summer Months at Teslin and Lower Post.- After the experience I had in Lower Post last Summer for three weeks, I urgently beg the Department to do something for the physical welfare of the Indians in such isolated districts as Lower Post, McDame and Teslin Lake. There was no medical help of any kind available at Lower Post last Summer during the three weeks I spent there, whilst over 120 Indians were sick with the flu and various infections and eye diseases: I had to spend most of my time visiting the sick, making dressings and giving out medicines from a ridiculous supply which was practically exhausted and dirty and old.- Referring to a former request I made through you to the Department on the same matter as early as the Fall of 1939, to which you replied on Feb. 10, 1940, I beg to say that Miss G. Beaudoin, a fully qualified nurse, is now here with us at Whitehorse, and willing to go and spend one month at Teslin Lake and one month at Lower Post next Summer, whether the Department helps defray her expenses or not. I would suggest that the Department give her, to start with, a grant of $75.00 per month for the two months she intends to spend at such points so as to cover her travelling expenses by plane.\nDr. H. W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMy dear Dr. McGill,\n\nHis Excellency Bishop Coudert, the Co-Adjutor of the Prince Rupert Diocese, wrote me, on November 27th last, a lengthy letter regarding the needs of the Catholic Indians in the Yukon Territory. Unfortunately the letter has just reached me and it is only today that I am able to call your attention to its contents. I can think of no better method of doing so than by quoting the Bishop's letter itself:\n\n1.- Re Teslin Catholic School.- You will find herewith a letter of father A. Drean O.M.I., our school teacher and resident missionary at Teslin; this letter is a copy of a recent communication sent to Mr Jeckell, the now acting Indian Agent for the Yukon. I think that father Drean has been far too modest in his request; I would insist that the Federal Government supply our school not only with books and stationery, but also officially approve such a school, pay a reasonable salary to father Drean and give us a grant to erect a decent building wherein we may conveniently conduct a school; as things stand at present, we have to conduct the school in our residence.\n\n2.- Re Catholic Boarding School for the Catholic Indians of Northern B.C. and the Yukon. The former Indian Agent of Telegraph Creek has recognized the necessity of such a school and has written to that effect to the Department on April 14th of this year; we have now a dozen Indian Children from\nOttawa,\nApril 4, 1948.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 26, I am referring to the Welfare & Training Division the request from Bishop Coudert for recognition of a Catholic day school at Teslin Lake and the establishment of a residential school in Northern British Columbia.\n\nThe other two matters mentioned in your letter are being referred to the Medical Division.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDirector.\n\nRev. J.O. Plourde, O.M.I.,\n619 McDermot Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nOttawa, April 17, 1942.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to paragraph three and paragraph four of your letter of March 26.\n\nWith reference to paragraph three and the request of Bishop Coudert that the Department employ a nurse for the summer months at Teslin and Lower Post, Yukon, I regret that the Department will be unable to make any grant such as is suggested.\n\nParagraph four refers to treatment of cases of tuberculosis among the Indians of the northern part of the province. I wish to state that the Department will not be able to extend its present policy in this area.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\n\nRev. J. O.

W.V. Doran I enclose the following statements:\n\n1. Statement of per capita payments made to the six Indian residential schools conducted under the auspices of the English Oblates of Eastern Canada. You will note that this statement shows the per capita earned for the quarter ended December 31, 1942. These amounts were not paid until 1943. At the extreme right of this statement are shown the amounts paid to each of the schools last year as a special grant. This was sent to the schools just previous to the close of March, 1943.\n\n2. Statement of payments made for night watchmen's services at three of the schools.\n\n3. Statement of payments made to the six schools in connection with employment of manual training instructors. In this case also the payments for the quarter ended December 31, 1942, were not made until 1943.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. Lawrence S.

I am sorry that due to the pressure of business I was unable to write to you sooner.\n\nIt is confidently hoped that with this additional revenue the group of schools conducted under the supervision of our Commission will be able to meet all current expenses and maintain the high standard of efficiency which they have had continually in mind since they were placed in their care by the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nOnce more, please accept our heartfelt thanks for your sympathetic cooperation in a matter so vital to the welfare of our Indians.\n\nVery truly yours in Christ,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMinister of Mines and Resources\nAUG 12 1944\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nIndian Residential Schools\n\nYou will be interested to note the attached letter to the Minister from Rev.

June 14th 1945\n\nMr. Philips Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nIndians Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nI have your letter of June 5, granting us permission to close on June 20, the Indian Residential Schools conducted by the Oblates, so that the Principal and staff may attend the Centenary celebration in Winnipeg.\n\nI appreciate greatly this permission, and wish to thank you, especially for your very prompt consideration and reply.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\nProvincial\nNovember 1st, 1945\n\nRev. Father O. Plourde, O.M.I.\nGeneral Superintendent,\nOblate Commission for Indian Affairs,\nOttawa University.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your communication dated Oct. 27 and which I found yesterday upon my arrival here.\n\n1.-Re Salary Cheques to be paid to our Missionaries teaching in our various seasonal schools, I think that the new arrangement will be more satisfactory, as it will allow me to follow more closely amounts paid to our individual missionaries. I will see that said cheques be forwarded to them without delay.\n\n2.-Re rent of our buildings for school purposes, I will send the account in duplicate at the end of each year for each school. The amount mentioned is satisfactory to me, and all in all will cover the expenses of fuel and janitor, if paid by the Branch both for our summer as well as for our winter school.\n\n3.-I take note of what you say regarding cheque to Father Poulet for the transportation of the children to Grouard School, and the promise to repay father A. Dream for the transportation of five children from Teslin Lake to Lower Post in connection with same.\n\n4.-Regarding Evelyn Reid, born on June 15, 1929, and who should have been discharged from Lejac School last Summer, I understand the difficulties which Mr. Phelan may be up against at such time of the year. My advise for him is to let things go until next summer, but to remind both the Indian Agent Samson and the Principal Father Simpson not to keep the children of Norther B.C. and the Yukon over the time allowed by the School Regulations without referring the matter to the head of the Branch and to me; he may add that he knows positively that Evelyn Reid was anxious to go back north last summer and that her sister Mrs Henri Taku of Atlin Lake, B.C., was anxious to have her and to provide her with a good home, and, therefore, he does not understand why such a child was kept in Lejac School for another year. If the child was to be discharged now, the Branch would get in touch with Agent Samson and find out through him whether at such a time the Indians of Atlin Lake (especially Mrs. Henri Taku) are in town or on their trap line and can easily be reached.\n\n5.-In my next Circular Letter to our teaching Missionaries I am going to insist on the necessity of sending in their school reports at the end of each month, if they want to be paid at once.\n\nN.B.-Iskut Lake School is the same as Klappan (wrongly called so by the former Indian Agent Harper Reid). The school is located on Iskut Lake, but the Indian Band is called the Klappan Band.\n\n6.-Re Indian Residential School at Teslin, I found your report to Mr. Hoey quite satisfactory, and hope it will soon bring a definite line of conduct on the part of the Officials of the Branch.\n\nThanking you for your kind services, I remain, dear Father Plourde,\n\nYours very sincerely in O.L. and M.I.\n\n(signed) J.L. Coudert, O.M.I.\nJ.L. Coudert O.M.I.

Hoey,\nDirector,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Mr. Hoey:\n\nFurther to my letter of October 27th, 1945, which I wrote at the request of Bishop Coudert, I beg to communicate to you copy of the one which he wrote to me from Lebret, Sask., where he is staying for a few days. Bishop Coudert's letter confirms in every respect the various demands which I made either to you or to Mr. Phelan, regarding the needs of his diocese.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.O. Plourde, O.M.I.\n\nEnc.\nIt may be said that the crying need of Residential Schools is qualified personnel. This brings up many angles and points of view. I am merely pointing it out here, for, in my mind, it will break through sooner or later. The quicker it is tackled the better for all concerned. I do not wish to say that there are no qualified employees at the Residential Schools. On the contrary, many admirable men and women, of all denominations, fully qualified to take their place in any community, are working for the welfare of the Indian. But the schools must be able to attract more of these and in order to do so, must offer more attractive positions.\n\nA second need for the Residential School is to eliminate as much drudgery, as is possible, leaving more time for valuable training.\n\nA.J.

HEBY.\n\nUpon instructions received from you, I have included the following sums in our draft Estimates for the purchase of residential schools which are at present owned by the Churches:-\n\n(a) Church of England Schools:\n   Fort George - $33,000.00\n   Moose Port - 49,000.00\n   Carcross - 30,000.00\n\n(b) Roman Catholic Schools:\n   Fort George - 33,000.00\n   Albany - 49,000.00\n\nIt has been difficult to assess the value of these schools and the above figures are rough estimates only. However, when the official evaluator has set the amount which should be offered for these schools, then transfers can be effected between the funds involved.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, October 29, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\n- Colonel Neary -\n\nI am sending forward herewith a letter dated October 24, 1947, with certain statements relating to a number of residential schools the property of the Church of England in Canada. This letter and these statements were left at my office by Doctor Alderwood a few days ago.\n\nMay I suggest that you place in the estimates now under consideration an amount sufficient to purchase the Moose Factory and Fort George schools, and an amount which you may deem necessary to purchase the Albany and Fort George residential schools, now the property of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nIn addition to this proposal, it is my intention to discuss with the members of the Northwest Territories Council the desirability of having the Council, as such and from its own funds, purchase the Roman Catholic and Anglican residential schools at Aklavik. Just what the reaction of the members of the Council will be to this suggestion, I am not of course at this moment in a position to state.\n\n[Signature]\n\nRAH/CH\nOttawa, April 3, 1947.\n\nDear Father Plourde:\n\nThe Church of England has offered to sell certain of their residential schools to the Department. In preparing the appropriation for the current fiscal year we included an amount which would enable us to purchase the Fort George and Albany Residential Schools which are conducted under the auspices of the Oblate Order. Please let me know at once if your Order would be interested in selling these buildings to the Department.\n\nIncidentally, we have a letter from the Indian Superintendent in Hobbema which reads as follows:\n\n\"The reverend principal of the Ermineskin Residential School has recently contacted Archbishop MacDonald and his superiors in Edmonton. Father Adams says he is in a position to state the Ermineskin Residential School can now be transferred to Government ownership. They are, of course, interested in maintaining the present administration.\"\n\nWe would appreciate having your comments on this offer as it is the first time that there has been any intimation to the above effect.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F.

Your agent, knowing all Indians would be home for the religious retreat, has chosen this time to visit them in company of doctors and dentists.\n\nWe appreciate very much the medical cares given to our Indians, but the missionary does think that it is not necessary for the Medical Corps to choose the same time which he has chosen for the retreat.\n\nThanking you in anticipation, I remain,\n\nJ.O.

I ask only one week a year.\n\nYour employer, Mr. Lariviere, as he knows it, as he knows that the Indians being good Christians Catholics obey to their missionary in coming to that one week's Recollection comes to \"break\" my work, to disturb the Spirit of that recollection.\n\nThe Spirit of that recollection is whole against with an absolute character, he himself has the right to...\nBesides himself, he has a dentist and a photographer...\n\nImpossible to do my spiritual work.\n\nWould it be necessary that I should bring this complaint to the Council of bishops, the archbishop and bishops of Canada?\n\nI am quite certain that he will do again the same thing at Westmount, because he knew that then I will be there from the 4th to the 11th of September.\n\nPlease, give us justice & fair play.\n\nYour all truly,\n\nEd.

For your information the following payments were made for this school:\n\nMarch $4,192.50\nJune $4,682.81\nSeptember $6,021.56\nDecember $8,383.13\n\nTOTAL: $23,280.00\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nMay 29th, 1952.\n\nReverend G.

There are, of course, more pupils enrolled in almost all of these schools than is shown by the authorized enrolment.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education\nOttawa, June 24, 1952.\n\nMEMORANDUM TO THE DEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Maintenance of Church-owned Indian Residential School Buildings\n\nAs requested by you following the school construction conference, I submit the following comments with regard to several proposals for the allotment of funds for maintaining residential school buildings not owned by the departments:\n\n1. The present system is to include in the estimates an amount for each Church-owned residential school in accordance with the request of the Church authorities concerned and the recommendation of the Superintendent of the Indian Agency in which the school is located. Normally, this amount does not exceed $5,000.00 in any one year. Difficulties arise with this arrangement because occasionally requests are delayed until it is too late for the work to be done or the equipment purchased before the end of the fiscal year. However, this method has the following advantages:\n\n(a) It ensures that funds are expended for the purpose for which they were intended.\n\n(b) Technical advice is made available to ensure that the work undertaken or the equipment purchased is suitable.\n\n(c) Equipment and materials are secured through the Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\n2. The payment of a rental which would enable the Church authorities to maintain the building, would afford no assurance to the department that the money so provided would be used for maintenance. It is also unlikely that...\nthe Church authorities would receive the technical advice which is now made available to them through the department.\n\n3. Purchase of Church-owned buildings by the department would result in the department taking over the maintenance of these schools. With the acquisition of the buildings, the department would have to insist that only Indian children are admitted. It is probable that there would be some objections from the Churches concerned to this arrangement. The list below gives the names of the schools in Bishop Trocellier's diocese and shows the authorized pupilage, the enrolment at the end of March, 1952, and the number of non-Indians in attendance at two of them. No information is available as to the number of non-Indians enrolled at the other two schools.\n\nFort Resolution, Fort Resolution, N.W.T.\nAklavik, Aklavik, N.W.T.\nProvidence Mission, Fort Providence, N.W.T.\nHoly Angels, Fort Chipewyan, Alberta.\n\nFort Resolution\n\n| Authorized Indian enrolment | Actual enrolment |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| - 80                        | - 85             |\n\n| Indians | Half-breeds | Eskimos | Others |\n|---------|-------------|---------|--------|\n| - 63    | - 22        | - 0     | - 0    |\n\nAklavik\n\n| Authorized Indian enrolment | Actual enrolment |\n|-----------------------------|------------------|\n| - 40                        | - 98             |\n\n| Indians | Half-breeds | Eskimos | Others |\n|---------|-------------|---------|--------|\n| - 35    | - 9         | - 54    | - 0    |\n\nI have refrained from making a definite recommendation as you asked to receive this information as a basis of discussion.\n\nDirector.\nMajor D.M.

All field officials have been so informed on many occasions. At the present time the Department is preparing regulations for Indian day schools. These will be issued shortly and will contain the following instruction regarding the teaching of religion:\n\n(a) A period of not more than one-half hour a day to be devoted to religious instruction may be included in the time table for classroom instruction.\n\n(b) Religious instruction may be given by any person assigned for such purpose by the religious denomination in the faith of which pupils are to be instructed.\n(e) A pupil shall not be required to receive instruction in the faith of any religious denomination contrary to the desire of such pupil's parent or legal guardian as expressed to the principal or teacher-in-charge of the school and recorded in the school register.\n\n(d) When it is necessary to conduct religious instruction in the faiths of more than one religious denomination and the accommodation is inadequate for simultaneous instruction in the different faiths, the Superintendent, Indian Agency, shall apportion the use of the school premises and school time for the religious denominations concerned.\n\n3. \"That when teachers are to be appointed for Catholic Indian Schools, the name of the teacher in each case be first submitted for approval to the interested Bishop\".\n\nThe supply of qualified teachers at the present time is limited. It has been our practice to advertise in both daily and weekly papers and when an applicant is interested in securing employment in an Indian school it is necessary to take immediate action, otherwise such applicant will obtain employment elsewhere.\n\nTo submit to the interested Bishops the name of the teacher being considered for a Catholic Indian day school would involve considerable time and this would result in our losing teachers as they would have obtained other employment in the meantime. Our Indian Superintendents and Regional Inspectors of Indian Schools are aware of the Indian day schools at which a Catholic teacher should be engaged and we have received no complaints to the effect that Catholic teachers have not been engaged at the schools where their services are required. However, if any of the members of the Canadian Catholic Hierarchy are aware of qualified Catholic teachers whose services are available, we would appreciate it if the names and addresses of such persons would be submitted either to the Indian Affairs Branch at Ottawa or the local Regional Inspector of Indian Schools. Such recommendations will receive very careful consideration.\n4. \"That the salaries of all qualified teachers in the Indian Residential Schools be paid by the Federal Government.\"\n\nEver since 1892, when the principle of payment of per capita grants to residential schools was adopted, it has been definitely understood, both by the Department and the Churches concerned in the operation of residential schools, that the per capita grant included payment of teachers' salaries. If the Department took over payment of teachers at residential schools, it would be necessary to make a deduction in the per capita rate. At a few of our residential schools we are experimenting with the system of paying the salaries of qualified teachers. It is hoped to obtain, during the next year, sufficient information to enable us to make a decision with reference to paying the salaries of qualified teachers at all Indian residential schools.\n\n5. \"The Catholic Archbishops and Bishops of Canada request the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration to take into account, in Article 117 of the Indian Act, the phrase 'Except by written direction of the parent' in such a way that this expressed wish of the parents may effectively serve as the method of procedure in determining the choice of the school by the Minister in disputed questions.\"\n\nIn cases of dispute regarding the religious auspices under which an Indian child should be educated, the Department makes every possible endeavour to ascertain the religious denomination of the parents and careful consideration is also given to the wishes of the parents.\n\nDirector.\nVICARIATE APOSTOLIC OF WHITEHORSE\n\nList of Catholic Children in Protestant Schools in the Yukon\nin 1952-1953\n\nA.-In the Baptist Indian School of Whitehorse,Y.T.-\n\n# 35 1.-Paul Stanley James, child of Andrew James of Carcross, born Sept. 11,\n1937, baptized August 24, 1938, by Rev.

All honor to them.\n\nRev. Mr. Macdonald of Prince Albert and Dr. Duffield of Bella Bella met me at the boat landing and assisted in my transfer to the steamer which was to take me to Fort McPherson. And so I started on my long trip East.\n\nThe scenery along the Skeena River, as seen from our car window, was rarely beautiful. The water, crystal clear, runs among precipitous cliffs, while the pale foliage of whose trees makes a charming contrast to the dark green of the fir and pine and snow-capped mountains as a background.\n\nWe passed salmon canneries where, I believe, the Indians were only put up. Busy preparations for the fishing season, now close at hand, were in progress.\n\nEarly the following morning, being somewhat restless, I leaned up on my elbow to look out over the river. To my delight, I found we were passing through our great Rocky Mountains, and what a sight! The world, not seeing which, the Alps, can equal for grandeur. The rugged outline of their summits was silhouetted against the immense sky of ever-changing splendor, for the sun was just peeping above the horizon, casting shadows all around, making it all mysterious and beautiful. The mountain, with its fourteen thousand feet, towered above all, while not far away Mount Cheam, with its snow-capped height, reared its snow-capped crest.\n\nRev. Mr. Kinney, of British Columbia, some years ago named Mount Chown when scaling Mount Robson and named it after the Superintendent of the Methodist Church, the name being afterward ratified by the Dominion Government at Ottawa. He very kindly sent us a picture of its peak, done in sepia, which hangs in our home today and reminds us of our trip.\n\nIt were futile to attempt in an article such as this, even a slight description of the magnificence of the scene not seen in three days\u2019 journey across our great North-west.\n\nSuffice it to say that at an unearthly hour one morning I was set down at Brandon, Manitoba, the seat of Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Indian Missions in Canada and Principal of the Indian Residential School of that city. The hour, however, was not too early for Mr. Ferrier, who, with his wife, Mrs. Ferrier, gave me a warm welcome when we reached their home. I was grateful indeed to a tired traveller.\n\nMy stay of a few hours was all too short to enable me to get anything like an accurate description of the work carried on by Mr. Ferrier and his wife. But I will try to give a brief indication. First, the site. The buildings stand on a commanding rise of ground, surrounded by fine trees, well trimmed hedges and cultivated fields. Beautiful beds of flowers on each side of the road draw aside the grounds. I know of nothing lovelier than the site of the Industrial School at Brandon. Next, there is the farm. While it trains the boys in the sciences of farming, it is also a school for life. Mr. Hamilton is the capable farm instructor. There are nine hundred acres under cultivation, and there is wheat, barley, hay, oats, barley and rye. Noting the rye and remembering that these are prohibited, I asked, \u201cWhy the rye, Mr. Ferrier?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d he replied with a smile, \u201cjust to feed the hogs.\u201d\n\nSeventy acres of corn is grown for silage purposes.\n\nAt the Hudson Winter Fair seventy-five fat cattle were sold this year; also many hogs of fabulous size and stock.\n\nOne hundred eighty-three chickens flourish in modern hen-houses and up-to-date \u201cruns.\u201d\n\nLast year the sum of $8,000 was turned in as an asset to the Institution. The school itself has in residence eighty-five boys. Mr. Ferrier believes in co-education. He is an enthusiast in his work and is well fitted to carry on efficiently and executive ability. While he has a most capable staff, his is the directing mind in all operations pertaining to the school and farm.\n\nI was struck with the opportunity offered first-hand, in vastly diverse fields, something of the Indian work as carried on by the Methodists in Canada. We should wish that more of our people would visit these homes of training for our Indian children, the future citizens of this country.\n\n\"He Refused to Quit\"\n\nON THE campus of one of the large universities of France there is a monument has been set in honor of one of the students who died fighting for France during the first World War, but sealing inscription: \"He played on the battlefield three years he refused to quit. During that day the hero\u2014Hammond by name\u2014went out and played with the 'scrub' to help the 'variety.' Hammond summoned the boys to a game on the fields of France, took him to the battlefields.\"\n\nOn the battlefield he exhibited the same fidelity as on the football field. One day his owner called Hammond for a hazardous bit. Hammond went out with the boys, never looked back. Hammond's little inscription on the monument calls to the burying ground of the dead: \"He refused to quit.\"\n\nA tribute can be given to Hammond for the qualities which he displayed, essential in a Christian, in the service of God, and he closed His life with the solemn words: \"No man shall come to the plough without first being a learner for the King's Companions.\"\nIn Another World\n\nSAT the other afternoon with a salesman from Chicago who had been homeward bound by the train. We discussed the European situation, Japan, and the mine situation in West Virginia. I asked him if he had ever read the Sermon on the Mount? \"Not for many years! What is it about?\"\n\nI tried to tell him. It is hard to give any one an adequate idea of what that sermon covers. It is too big for words. \"No, no,\" he replied finally; \"that won't work in this world. It is not right to hold such high ideals. It is not a hopeless ideal. It will only work in another world.\"\n\nWe have expected it to work in this world. He gave it as the charter of a new world which would be built in the Kingdom of God. It is not in the clouds, nor in the future. His golden doctrine is that we must think and act to-day. The new world is the old world made new. It is with us now. We are living in it. We walk its streets. We are naturalized into its citizenship when we accept the lordship of Jesus Christ.\u2014Hubert C.

The total cost must be tremendous, with 60,000 locomotives working many times a day.\n\nPrivate dispatches have brought word of the intention of the African Inland Mission to set up a radio station in the Kafir land from which they will broadcast Gospel messages in the languages of the various tribes in the territory round about.\n\nAn underground river passing under Mont Blanc has recently been discovered and may prove to be one of the sources of the Seine. The river is known as the Arve, and is said to contain many fine grottos and cascades. It is thought that the underground river is the source of many rivers flowing through Switzerland, Germany and Austria.\n\nAn avalanche that swept across a road near Rochetaill\u00e9e, France, not long ago, buried a herd of cattle and carried away the carcass of a wild boar. Just before the avalanche came down, the bear became imbedded in the snow, and although it was buried in the slide, and the mass of earth moving round it, solidified into a block, it was still alive.\n\nIt will surely be one of the most striking sights of the world will be the mighty waterfalls of Niagara, illuminated at night by electric light alone.\n\nThe power for the illumination is generated by the United States Government, which pays one-third of the cost of the project, which is to be completed next year.\n\nA primitive sugar mill on the Island of Pico, where sugar cane is turned into sugar by evaporation.\n\nSUGAR REFINED\n\nA primitive sugar mill on the Island of Pico, where sugar cane is turned into sugar by evaporation.\n\nLooking back upon some of our experiences in life, there is one form of sentiment which I recall vividly, because it was in the world of my childhood. It was the old-time sentiment which is expressed in the old-time song, like this: \"Boys did do things in those days. I was very deeply impressed by the time, or inspired by the sight of a little boy who was a man in his indignation, or some visiting relative who seemed to have some significant side-glance in his eyes. I have no doubt those boys were merely reproducing what had been a commonplace observation before, and, now that we are growing old ourselves, we see something of the same thing all around us. Beyond that there is a good deal of truth in the old adage that there is a good deal of truth in what is said about the younger generation being changed wonderfully in a hundred years\u2014yes, in fifty years. Things have changed, too, habits of life, and the way people think. It would be absurd to expect the boys and girls of today to do the same things which we did, or the same girls, or even the same boys, years ago, and to do them the same way. Their surroundings and circumstances are different, and that accounts for great deal which the eye of experience views askance.\n\nSo far as I can see not much is gained by attempting to prove that the world is growing better all the while, nor yet by attempting to show that it is slowly, but surely, getting worse. Personally, I doubt whether either contention is true. If we believe in God, we believe that He is the author of all\u2014somehow, sometime\u2014but no evolution goes straight forward to its goal. There are setbacks, and delays, and it happens again and again that we are left in doubt whether the tide is flowing in this direction or in that, or whether it is flowing at all.\n\nThe world is at its best when we are at our best ourselves. I have put this statement in parenthesis, for emphasis and special emphasis. The world where day dawned for me, where the morning sun shone upon my soul, where my spirit was still the great adventure, full of promise and mystery, will always be the best world that I shall ever know. That in mind, young reader, when you feel discontent and restlessness, when you long for the \"good old days,\" and bear it in mind, too, when you stoutly contend that the world is going to pieces. There is a trifle of exaggeration in both judgments, for sentiment has its say.\nThree Splendid Institutions\n\nBy Mrs. S. D. Chown\n\nON MY way home from a delightful stroll in the enchanting valley of the Fraser River, I turned aside, upon reaching our own country, to visit some of the institutions which are fostering and cultivating our Indian children.\n\nAs is everywhere known, these institutions are the means by which we are teaching the children of the aborigines of this country to be liberal education; fitting them to become citizens of their race.\n\nAnd in the enchanting valley of the Fraser River, at the Canadian Institute, overlooking off from Vancouver one glorious day, I met a friend and took an auto-tour for New Westminster. If we made record time over the sixteen miles between the cities, this was because we were burdened with wide-spreading and well-cultivated fields, interspersed with way cottages, their tiny front gardens aglow with blossoming flowers, and happy little children frolicking happily. On we sped, now in the open, now passing under trees, and now crossing bridges, traversing three over whose grateful shade, until we reached New Westminster.\n\nThe air was exquisite, stiflingly warm, upon a hill, like a queen upon her throne, looking down into the blue-green waters of the river.\n\nHere we alighted and immediately transferred to well-appointed train cars. Having passed the great bridge spanning the river, we were off for our further two hours ride into the country. There we arrived, and after a stroll around the base of great mountains we journeyed until we pulled up at a picturesque mission school, the name of which, in stentorian tones, had previously informed us was \"Sardis.\"\n\nAt the outset when we reached the delightful home of Mr. and Mrs. Raley, whose hospitality was so generous. After supper we pulled our chairs up to the blazing grate fire, for the weather was still cool and crisp.\n\nIn the morning we found boys and girls, to the number of about one hundred, dressed in fine assorted dress, for worship. They were singing heartily when we entered, and the volume of sound which arose would have done credit to much larger assembly.\n\nAs Mr. Raley addressed the scholars I stood there and listened to their upturned faces and was deeply impressed with the high grade of intelligence depicted therein.\n\nAfter a kind introduction by the Principal, there was a few words of prayer and then we sang together that soul-stirring hymn, \"Faith of our Fathers.\"\n\nAfter prayers the teachers and pupils followed, after which we were free for a walk around the grounds.\n\nOur next stop was destined to record how gratified I was, in this day and age, which seem to attune so little importance to the training of the younger generation in etiquette, to observe the air of politeness and correctness in deportment which pervaded every movement. There is no doubt that this is due to the cultured atmosphere created by the Principal, who is ever ready to lavish his rare courtesy to every one. It is still a truism, as we used to write in our copy books in our youth, that \"example is better than precepts.\"\n\nIt was quite a Sabbath Day's journey to reach the splendid building recently erected by the Dominion Government, but one full of interest. As much has appeared recently in newspapers and other things telling, I shall only say that it is imposing in appearance and complete in facilities afforded the work will receive fresh impetus.\n\nIn connection with the Institute there is a farm of ninety-two acres; a dear old orchard still bearing well and a variety of trees in the garden, where every known variety grow thriftily. The school has clever pupils, those of the Haida tribe being especially brilliant. This year one of the girls took ninety-six per cent. in French and ninety-five per cent. in Latin at the high-school examinations. Eight years ago she did not know the alphabet. She has also good high school examinations, taking ninety-one per cent., with an average superiority per cent.\n\nThe pessimistic cry that our Indians will not stand in the light of such educational records as these, seems to have lingered longer in this peaceful valley, but all delightful things must come to an end; so, bidding farewell to my kind hosts, we embarked aboard the train for my return journey. Two young ladies gave me, in parting, a most touching gift, which is fondly cherished in memory of my happy visit to the Coqualeetza Institute.\n\nThe Mission Girls' Home at Port Simpson was my next objective\u2014a jump of six hundred miles north from Victoria.\n\nOur route, inside the channel, is part of the famous route of the old steamer, Rupert, palatial in its appointments, was a most comfortable boat for two days and nights we were on board.\n\nUpon arriving at Prince Rupert I learned to my disappointment, that no steamer touching at Port Simpson was due for two days. Hoisting however the sails of the Tug, which tug was in for supplies, I decided if possible to make the trip that way. Making my way to the dock, however, I was glad to see there were many small craft tied alongside, and I found the owner had got in touch with the owner, who kindly said I might go with them.\n\nI had a most varied and enjoyable experience, that three hours' run, with the sea at our feet and snow-crowned mountains behind us. Once or twice a while a huge wave dashed its spray over us, as our powerful engine sent us through the water at a rate. On the earlier days, on the Ottawa River, I have seen just such a tug towing a boom of logs, but this little vessel, though small as an irate rat takes a naughty boy by the ear and drags him along wildly niftily, the tug-changer owning himself a path through the foamy brine until we arrived at the wharf.\n\nAt the landing dock a difficult arose. The tide was out and we were many feet below the top of the wharf. I looked below and saw a small ladder nailed flat against its side.\n\n\"Can you make it?\" asked a bystander with a laugh.\n\n\"I'm not sure,\" I replied, \"but I'll try;\" and forthwith began my ascent laboriously until nearing the top when I heard a glimmering of sunlight and felt nearly so brave just then, and needed that some one come up behind me for encouragement, at a second attempt. More I was at the top, with my old friend, Miss Myles, giving me hearty congratulations.\n\nMiss Deacon and Miss Myles are two devoted workers of the Western Mission, who have worked hard and long day and all the time for twenty little bright-eyed Indian maidens, ranging in age from three to fifteen years.\n\nThe mental, moral and physical health of these children is their constant concern. They are taught reading, writing, spelling, arithmetic, sewing; indeed everything that goes to the making of a house; it is interesting to see the little ones set out for school each morning. Two or three times they may be seen in front of the gate, accompanied by Miss Deacon or Miss Myles. The picturesque winding path leads to the Haida Indian school, very well trodden. I had the great pleasure of meeting Miss Roche, the capable teacher of the Indian school.\n\nIt is not, however, a study and work at the school. There is a lovely playground where they laugh and shout to their heart's content. In rain or shine, they are always fully constitutional of a mile or more.\n\nAt the devotional hour they repeat parts of the church service. Miss Billy noticed that, unlike some with greater opportunities, there was not the slightest indication of any lack of faith.\n\nI attended a meeting of the Crosby Girls' Circle, offered entirely by native girls. The premises with grass and dignity, a sand pit and a pond for them, while seemed to give them pleasure, was a little disappointing for me a bouquet of wild flowers. Among them I noticed many butterflies, which Browning beautifully describes as the little things that live and die.\n\nThe new Home is well appointed and, though not so large as the old one, is very comfortable. The dining-room is lighted by electricity, furnished by a small plant on the premises, which Miss Pearson with great courage, manipulated herself.\n\nOne little hardship, or so it would appear to others, is that the nature of the land cows cannot conveniently be kept. If they wander away, the people there are obliged to pay to be helped out; so the missionaries have to purchase milk. They assure me they cannot milk it, so they buy it. An acquired taste, I could not truthfully endorse the sentiment, and laughingly suggested with a smile, \"Well, I suppose you would certainly have a goat; that animal enjoying the reputation of being able to extract milk from anywhere.\"\n\nPort Simpson itself is a pretty town, having been built more recently than Prince Rupert; though both have a wonderful outlook to sea. The ground being a slight slope, the streets are paved, and gravel paths are used for walks through the town. Beautiful moss and wild flowers grow in profusion, and there is the penalty of trying to gather them.\n\nThere is much rain, but no one seems to mind it. The Indians come out as if the sun were shining\u2014a beautiful and picturesque frame of mind to acquire and one which is very agreeable to the casual visitor.\n\nOn account of the character of the soil, there are not many gardens, though I saw rhubarb, forget-me-nots and pansies, which were evidently to the best of nature's market gardener.\n\nThere are about five hundred and fifty natives at Port Simpson. In the fishing season they go to Prince Rupert, to Port Essington, Bella Bella and other fishing centers. I was told that a man who had visited my village could not be an able-bodied Indian left in the village.\n\nI spent these two days at Port Simpson, 25th of May. From far and near, Indians with their families came to the little port, eager to participate in the day. Everybody came\u2014from the smallest tot to the deeply-wrinkled grandmother. In the center of the village was the rallying ground; where an Indian band, in their Sunday dress, danced and sang, alternating from opera to the very latest jazz, to the evident delight of the assembled crowd, who gave loud approbations by the closest attention. Little groups dotted here and there, attired in bright colors, added a picturesque note to the scene.\n\nIndians are artistic. They love music and dance. The girls do fine embroidery well and sew neatly.\n\nI enjoyed every moment of my stay in this place. The Indians were much occupied, they took time for an occasional chat\u2014and there was always Mrs. Sager, my life-long friend, for company.\n\nWe were kindly entertained by Rev. Dr. Mrs. Sager, proprietors of Mission House and Dr. and Mrs. Sager, of the Hospital. Miss Deacon and Miss Myles also made a \"tea\" for me, at which I enjoyed myself immensely.\n\nOne rarely beautiful morning, the sun sending its beams athwart the landscape, we started for Prince Rupert, on the Cariboo, which was to take me to Prince Rupert, from which point the Canadian Pacific steams east on its long trans-Canada trip.\n\nA group of missionaries, who are in the doctoring line, I could not but think, as the boat receded, of the devotion of men and women of education and culture, who are engaged far away, who live in isolated places such as this.

Thomas. But they are very familiar with Jack Miner, for he has them printed on one corner of his stationery, on which he writes his letters. Jack likes to share up everything good with his friends.\n\nTwo things impress one as he reads this little poem. The first is, that God can't make a garden alone. He needs the help of man. \"Man plows and plants, and digs and weeds,\" but God sends the rain, the sunshine and the genial air. If we would allow ourselves to think for a while, we would be impressed with the many things God can't or won't do, without our help.\n\nThe second thing which impresses us is, that when we are working with nature we are working in partnership with God. None should feel this more than the farmer who till the soil. The farmer's life is essentially a life of faith and obedience to law. Every man's life should make him a partner with God, but in no place is it more evident than in the life of the farmer or gardener.\n\nThe Better Way\n\nA FEW weeks ago, outside a church in a large Canadian city, there was a sign with the pastor's text for the following Sunday: \"Then God said me.\" Then followed the words: \"Enormous eye. That eye looked awful, and passer-by seemed to shudder at its uncanniness.\"\n\nThe intention of those responsible for the sign evidently was to remind folks of the fact that the whole of life is seen by God, but one wonders whether the conception of God as a great \"eye\" is the right view to take. There is more than a suggestion here that God is kind of detective, eternally on the look-out for wrong-doers, and rather glad when He finds such.\n\nIt is true that God sees, and knows and understands, His glance is kind as well as searching, and surely the truth to be emphasized is that God's knowledge of human nature is that of a parent for a child. He sees the secret sorrows and the secret hangings. He knows how heavily burdens bear, and how frail human nature is. It is a great mistake to imagine that all God sees are the mistakes that people make, and the sins they commit; and furthermore, it is an error to assume that the perception of God as a mighty eye will win for Him the devotion and affection of His children.\n\nBishop Mclyntyre used to tell of an occasion when his father lay dying. One by one the members of the family were removed from him a few parting words. Then George Mclyntyre, who at that time was a lad of fifteen, went into the room while his heart was beating violently. It seemed to him at that moment that he had beyond reason and mischiefness and loomed up large. The dying man said to the boy: \"George, you have been a good boy, a good son. The tenderness of your love was very precious for the lad. He could not speak, but he left the room determined to be worthy of that eulogy. It is the goodness of God that leads men to repentance. It is His love which makes them ashamed of sin.\n\nI am I\n\nHELLO, Jock,\" says a lady as she enters a room. Jock had been singing. He stops, steps a little forward, bends his head in an expectant attitude, his eyes beaming with gladness. Jock is a pet bird, with his name responds to his name. Dogs, horses, oxen, know their names. \"I am I\" is a fact recognized very early by the little child. To every living soul, young or old, there is a strong and vivid sense of individuality. Theosophy, with its doctrine and reincarnation, teaching that we have been some one or something else in another state of existence, contradicts a primal cognition of the human soul.\n\nEvery young person must work out his or her own destiny. The soul speaks to itself by name; recognizes its duties and responsibilities. The world about us singles us out, refuses to lose us in the crowd, opens up some special road for us, points to some personal objective. Friends, acquaintances, know our names, strangers wish to know them; God individualizes us. No truth in the Bible is more striking than this. \"Jesus calleth His own sheep by name. He knoweth them, and stretcheth out His hands unto them. They follow Him because they know His voice.\"\n\nChanging One's Mind\n\nWE ADMIRE consistency; stability of character is of inestimable value. The constant, habitual, dependable, as it were, in matters of opinion, is one of the good things. What a chaos would result if we awake some morning to find everybody overnight had changed their opinions about everything\u2014it would be a world of tumult! The sanity of the world is preserved by the constancy of human thought. Yet apart from certain exceptional individuals who hold his right to change his mind, it has been a marked characteristic of many of the world's most eminent thinkers that their opinions have undergone radical changes. We may take Gladstone with advocating measures which he had opposed twenty-five years before, when a young man at college, and the latter defended himself in terms of his former eloquent and effective speeches. On questions of political and social reform, Gladstone's views have been tremendous changes, and the facts have often been most conclusive in human progress. In reading biography it is most interesting to note how noted people, as for instance Charles Kingsley and Henry Drummond, have felt their way to clearer light and larger spaces.\n\nThere is more than humor in the prayer attributed to a Scotchman, \"O Lord, start me right, for Thou knowest, Lord, Thou canst not change me. When the desire for consistency outweighs the sense of right and wrong, when men deliberately take their own way in reference to the indications of providence and the Spirit of God, the capacity to change one's mind is surely most desirable.\n\nFamous Invalids\n\nBy R. WALTER WRIGHT\n\nIX William Cowper\n\nFROM the viewpoint of physical affliction there is nothing to compare among the famous men of the world than that of William Cowper, characterized as he was of English letter-writer, and poet, and diarist, and invalid of this day. Born nearly two hundred years ago, in 1731, his father was an English clergyman, a chaplain to George II. His mother, of whom he was passionately fond, died when he was nine years of age. His memory was affectionately cherished, and this fond expression manifested itself in many tender, beautiful lines addressed to her picture. Shortly after he was sent to a boarding-school, where he suffered severely from the blows and persecution of a bullying headmaster. It appears that he had cried so frequently that his schoolfellows became inflamed and he had to be removed from the school for treatment. At this early age he showed a weak and feeble constitution, and his life-long dependences.\n\nAt ten he went to Westminster School, where he remained for eight years. Here his surroundings were brighter, yet his unconquerable shyness isolated him home with the Rev. Mr. Truspin, who with his wife, treated him with affectionate care. Here he met with John Newton, the hymn-writer, at whose suggestion Cowper commenced to write his letters. This sudden illness already returned, reducing him to almost eminently immobility. Gradually he recovered, and took up seriously again his great vocation as a poet; he was then thirty-five years of age. His first volume was published. Again, for some months in 1787, he suffered from mental derangement, but recovered. He rallied, resumed his literary labors and accomplished a great deal of solid work for some years. His best poem, \"The Task,\" was published in 1785 and gave him great reputation.\n\nBut his mental troubles came back seriously once more, and the darkness continued with light gleams of light for some time. His friend, Alexander Pope, visited him in his wretched existence.\n\nSurely few have ever spent severer years of life under more discouraging circumstances than William Cowper, and yet he carried them as the inspiration that even the most difficult existence can accomplish something of real value. His writings are full of sincere views of religion which found credence in his day, and which tended to exaggerate the importance of religious duty much to do with influencing his mind in a wrong direction. Let us be thankful that God has given us His own joyous evangel, which recognizes our Heavenly Father's abounding mercy and has filled countless hearts broken upon the harrowed soil of Cowper as a glad revolution, and we should find his very complaints, after death, were an expression of holy surprise. Some of his best poems, such as \"The Task,\" are sung in Christian congregations to the end of time. \"O for a closer walk with Thee, dear Lord,\" \"The task is done,\" \"Blood, shed for man,\" \"Sometimes a light surprise,\" are precious gems. To his credit stand also his poem, \"The Divine Providence,\" written as he was relapsing into insanity in 1773\u2014\"God moved in mysterious ways.\"\n\nWhile Cowper does not rank among the chiefest of English poets, his genius is acknowledged by all who study, acknowledged. Poetry had degenerated in England into glittering artificiality. Cowper's poetry was simple. Cowper brought back nature to poetry; and his influence has been extensive and enduring. He opened the way for Wordsworth and Tennyson. The mighty nerve that was needed to bring poetry once more in the air\u2014Cowper gave it expression. He sang of men as the children of a Father's Favour, as the natural heirs of God's nation and having a work to do for man. His expanding spirit conceived that conditions of life and the rights of man were inalienable and extended to slave and savage as well as to the Englishman. The sentiment of international union rose before his mind, a mighty dream which was to become its fulfillment in the kingdom of Jesus Christ. Thus he anticipated the spirit of the internationalism of the present day. \"The most exalted heritage of man is liberty, and as Stopford Smith says, 'Liberty is the root of human wrong, begins, that long, long cry against oppression and evil done by man to man, which is the petition of the priestly tyrant, which rings louder and louder through Burns, Wordsworth, Shelley, Scott, Byron, ever impassioned, ever longing, ever prophetic.' The spirit of liberty, the vision of the highest thought of God\u2014yet how that spirit was manacled with terrible iron! And yet, when on his deathbed, his physician asked him how he felt, replied, 'I feel unutterable despair.'\"\nDuncan Scott, Esq., Litt.D., F.R.S.C., Deputy Superintendent General, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto, Nov. 15, 1926.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI believe that the Department of Indian Affairs has under consideration the matter of increasing the per capita grant to Indian Residential Schools that have been under the management of the former Woman's Missionary Society of the Presbyterian Church.\n\nI am asked to press upon the Department the desirability of having the increased grant made available in the very near future.\n\nTrusting you will see your way clear to comply with this request,\n\nI am,\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nC.E.

M. S. Meeting in October last and the action of the Home Board in March, 1927.\n\nA further vote of $10,000 for supplies to institutions is recorded on page 48 of the W. M. S. Report. If any of this is used for our Indian Schools, it is not included in the above sum.\n\nThe above table shows that we are educating 625 pupils in the Muncey, Brandon, Edmonton and Coqualeetza Institutes without cost to our Missionary Societies.\n\nThese missionary grants are to assist in maintaining the nine smaller schools in which we are educating only 605 pupils.\n\nThe total government per capita grants for the year ending March 31st are about $161,000. The four large schools received $96,000 and the nine smaller schools received $65,000.\n\nThe increase in the government per capita grants made by the Department to take effect April 1st, 1927, makes it possible for these nine small schools to increase their earnings from the government by over $9,000.\nCLASS-ROOM WORK:\n\nOur class-room work in the residential schools is gradually increasing to a higher standard. We have a prospective class of twenty pupils for grade nine work, five for grade ten and one for grade eleven who will all be writing on the June examination. The most of our pupils make a grade a year. Our main hope lies in the education of the youthful generation. This education should be exceedingly practical. For a long time the Indian is going to live on the land and any system that does not take this into account is losing valuable time. The transition from fishing and hunting, the natural occupations of the Indian, to farming, gardening and stock-raising, is easy and natural.\n\nINDUSTRIAL TRAINING:\n\nThe Indian's bit of land is to be his stock in trade, the one thing he has to begin life on. All our boys receive training in the care of horses, cattle, hogs, sheep and poultry and in all our farming and gardening operations they are taught to use the most up-to-date machinery. Many of the boys are instructed in manual training, carpenter and mechanical work and in the handling of gasoline engines. Our girls are being well trained in dress-making, cooking, laundry work, dairying and all kinds of house-work. We have made exhibits of drawing, writing, sewing, fancy work, canning, wood carving, manual training and products of the farm and garden in many of our public exhibitions. The British Columbia provincial diploma for the best residential school exhibit was awarded to the Coqualeetsa Institute.\n\nGAMES & SOCIAL LIFE:\n\nThere has been a gradual growth in the desire of our pupils in changing from boisterous and unorganized games to well regulated and the strict rules that govern our modern games, such as football, soft and hard baseball, lacrosse, basketball and tennis. They enjoy keen contests for trophies and medals with other teams in the community. The scout and cadet work is greatly appreciated by our boys and tends toward erect carriage and prompt obedience to discipline. The girls are greatly interested in the C. C. I. T. work, supervised by class-room teachers. From the Brandon school we send a group of twelve each summer to the provincial camp which lasts ten days. We make a point of suitably celebrating public holidays. Through the winter, lectures, moving pictures, social evenings and indoor games are important parts of our institutional programmes.\nRELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION:\n\nMorning and evening devotions are held daily, organized Sunday School in all our institutions and Divine Worship is attended in the nearest church. Moral and religious instruction is given through Mission Bands, Circles, C. G. I. T., Tukis and Trail Rangers. Music is a very important part of our devotional services, assisted by the use of stringed instruments, organs and pianos. Our programme is planned for the training of our pupils vocationally, mentally, morally, physically and religiously.\n\nMEDICAL WORK:\n\nOur medical work is carried on by doctors, nurses, field matrons and hospitals. For all Indian Patients treated in our hospitals, the Indian Department pays $2.50 per day. For all patients other than Indians, the Provincial Government pays from 75\u00a2 to $1.00 per day. These government grants together with the patients' fees, contracts with the Workmen's Compensation Board and voluntary contributions, practically make our hospitals self sustaining.\n\nOur residential schools are managed by efficient, devoted and highly qualified workers. The hospitals are training schools for nurses and are noted for their excellent work in nursing back to life and health the sick and afflicted. The names of the doctors in charge are house-hold words in the constituencies served.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\nOttawa, May 4th, 1927.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nFrom the first ultimo, a change has been made in the per capita grants provided for a number of the residential schools. I, therefore, append, for your guidance, the following information:\n\n| Residential School | Per capita rate from April 1st, 1927 |\n|--------------------|-------------------------------------|\n| Ahousaht           | $160                                |\n| Alberni            | 160                                 |\n| Brandon            | 170                                 |\n| Coqualeetza        | 170                                 |\n| Edmonton           | 165                                 |\n| File Hills         | 145                                 |\n| Mount Elgin        | 155                                 |\n| Morley             | 175                                 |\n| Norway House       | 160                                 |\n| Portage La Prairie | 175                                 |\n| Port Simpson       | 155                                 |\n| Round Lake         | 175                                 |\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

Ferrier,\nInspector of Indian Schools & Hospitals,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nBrandon, Man.\nDecember 28, 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier,-\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the fact that the expense of education for the native population is upon the increase, and while the Department desires to provide a reasonably adequate system, it is essential that the outlay should be controlled. It is thought that the denominations should respect the zones of interest which have been established and not encroach upon them by the extension of missionary effort upon which a demand for separate educational institutions might be afterwards based. This view seems entirely reasonable, and in future the Department will not recognize requests for aid to educational institutions unless by pre-arrangement, and assistance must not be expected for institutions which encroach by the extension of missionary effort upon territory already provided for.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

The water system needs to be put in proper condition. This request has been on file for some months. See Dr. D. C. Scott's letter of May 10th, 1928.

This is largely a missionary activity, and the Department believes that it should have a thorough trial before giving it the status of an Indian day school and allowing salary for the teacher.\n\nI note that you will not conduct a day school at Gods Lake during the coming academic year and that a special effort will be made to recruit there for the Norway House Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will be pleased to receive a nomination for the Island Lake Indian Day School as soon as your plans have been made.

McPherson, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSelkirk, Man.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nEnclosed herewith please find 2 sets of Quarterly School Returns, one of which is sent from Mr. Schuetze, L Little Grand Rapids. The other from our teacher, Mr. Kirkness of Pekangecum. The reason they are being sent from here is that they had no blank forms at the above named places.\n\nRegarding the School at Pekangecum, please allow me to explain: Last year this was open as \"a trial.\" I need scarcely say that it has proved quite a success, with an average of between 16 and 20 pupils. It is then no longer a question of whether it is feasible to continue a school at that point or not, as it has been clearly demonstrated. Indeed the people are wonderfully interested in the educating of their children and have proved themselves very loyal to Mr. Kirkness in his work. The returns for this school have not been transmitted through your office as the United Church have so far paid the salary of the teacher.\n\nWill you please be kind enough to forward one of the enclosed sets of school returns to the Offices of the Dept. of Indian Affairs at Ottawa, with a request that they will take action in the way of supplying the necessaries as on every other Reserve and Teacher's salary also. This school can be carried on successfully the year round.\n\nI am also enclosing Mr. Schuetze's school returns with an extra set for Toronto. Will you kindly give the same your signature and mail after sealing the envelope.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted,\n\nVery respectfully yours,\n\n(Sgd.) JNO. W. MIDDRIE\n\nWill you please mail to my address 1 doz. blank forms re School Returns as I have used all Mr. Street's up.\nThe Secretary,\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nToronto,\nAug. 24,\n1929.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn further reply to the communication of Mr. Russell T. Ferrier, dated July 12th, (File No. 160-7) addressed to Rev. Ropt. B. Cochrane, D.D., I beg to state that we were pleased to know that the Department's approval had been given to the re-nomination of teachers mentioned in that letter.\n\nWe have taken note that the official name of the school at Indian Springs is Swan Lake.\n\nIn reference to the school at Pekangekum, where Mr. James Kirkness is the missionary-teacher, would say that, according to a letter received from Rev. John W. Niddrie of Berens River, addressed to Mr. Indian Agent McPherson, Selkirk, Man., a copy of which I enclose, there has been an average attendance at that school of between sixteen and twenty pupils. The average for seven months was fourteen according to the Reports. In either case, there is every indication that a school is being maintained regularly. In view of this, perhaps the Department would consider an allowance to the teacher of the usual $6.00 per teaching day. I shall be glad to know that this is sanctioned by the Department.\n\nIn regard to the Island Lake Indian Day School, - We expect to be able to send to the Department a nomination for this school in the course of a few days.\n\nYours most faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJNS:ELT.\nEncl.\nDuncan C.

I find that I could not come during the next two weeks but almost any day in the week beginning December 9th would suit me.\n\nYou probably know that I have recently taken over the duties of General Secretary of the Board of Home Missions and I am particularly anxious that I may have the privilege of meeting you and some of the other officials of your Department as soon as possible. I trust that under my leadership here the harmonious relations which have always existed between our Board and your Department may continue.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC:AL'A.\n\n[Signature]\n\nREV.

I may have to be away from the city the week of December 9th; perhaps the next week will be more suitable.

The mission teachers of the United Church of Canada. A new building is being erected at Brandon, Manitoba, which will be completed next summer. It will accommodate 150 pupils under Rev. John A. Doyle, D.D., principal, and his staff.\n\nThe residential school at Edmonton, Alberta, has been enlarged to house 85 Brandon pupils during the period of construction.\n\nThe hospital at Fort Macleod, B.C., has been extensively improved.\n\nAll the residential schools made progress during 1929, it was stated by Rev. Arthur Barnet, superintendent, during a recent visitation for the United church.\n\nThree new United church hospitals for Indians in British Columbia and the two summer hospitals have been well patronized. The Hudson Bay Hospital established in 1900, is to be completed early next year under Rev. Horace C. Wrinch, M.D., M.P., who founded the hospital at Norway House, Manitoba, owned by the Indian Department and manned by the United church, serving the hunting tribes of the northern Indians, as well as the Indians of the territory in Hudson Bay Presbytery.\n\nIt is proved increasingly possible to interest the Indian congregation in the missionary work. The Deer Lake band of hunters in eastern Manitoba has never had resident missionaries, but continued to send annual contributions from headquarters at Winnipeg. Lake Winnipeg on Berens River. Missionaries visited the band and performed one week each year. The Haida Bella and Bella Coola bands in British Columbia receive larger missionary allocations ahead of most white communities.\n\nHaida Indians, of Skidegate, B.C., who send their children 600 miles to the residential school at Sardis, have given more than half the posts on the board of control to Haida graduates. They are introducing advanced ideas and principles of government into their communal life. The graduates have formed an attempt to re-establish the villages of the Queen Charlotte Islands, where the missionaries first went nearly 50 years ago.\n\"This is the first time I have had the pleasure of using your lantern slides, I am delighted with them. I am looking forward to the next set.\"\n\n\"I would like to express my own and the appreciation of our people of this excellent set of slides. On every hand one heard heartiest thanks for the information so graphically and attractively presented. Several have said how much more vividly the missionary work of the Church at home and abroad has been brought home to them; and everywhere appreciation and wonder at the far flung work of our United Church.\"\n\n\"We used the slides in our Young People's meeting last night and found them very helpful and interesting. These slides with the information in the lecture give our young people an idea of what our Missionaries are doing. Both old and young are interested and we shall be glad to receive the other sets that are still to come.\"\n\n\"A good set of slides and of great value educationally. This finishes the Season and I think the members of our congregation have a new Missionary Outlook as a result of the various sets of slides shown during the past winter.\"\n\n\"The pictures were much enjoyed and help the people to feel that the money they contribute to Missions is being well spent.\"\n\n\"The co-operative itinerary plan has been most successful.\"\n\n\"Glad to say that the attendance at our lantern lectures is increasing wonderfully and the whole plan is a great success.\"\n\n\"Slides were appreciated by our people. Heavy storms made roads bad but meetings were well attended. I am glad we were able to get in on the itinerary.\"\n\n\"This is our first time for using a lantern at this point, and our people turned out in great numbers and were very much pleased. One man who has not been to church for years because he is too deaf, came to get the benefit of the pictures.\"\n\n\"The itinerary this winter has been exceptionally fine and I know that the slides and lectures have done a great deal of good missionary education.\"\n\n\"The set of slides was much enjoyed by my people, and aroused considerable enthusiasm for the cause of Missions. One great need in our churches is publicity regarding what the United Church is attempting to do on the foreign fields. Your slide itinerary is an effort to meet that need, and is greatly appreciated by our people here.\"\n\n\"This is an excellent set of slides. They were thoroughly enjoyed by all who saw them. This seems to me to be a most effective way to get missionary information to the people. Reading material they leave behind in the pew but this they take along.\"\n\n\"An excellent set of slides. Interest appears to be growing. Many have expressed their appreciation at the eye view of the other side of the world, and what is being done. The arrangements this year suit us just fine.\"\n\n\"All four sets have been very good and those who saw them have been loud in their praise. Africa was very interesting to us because one of our boys Ralph Collins, is on the field. His mother was present to see the place where her boy is working and she was delighted.\"\n\nTHE MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE CO-OPERATION OF OTHER MEMBERS\n\n\"All the Brethren here 'playing the game' and handing on the sets prompt to schedule.\"\n\nF.

Good - qualified teacher.\n- Cross Lake - \" Constance Shoup - \"\n- Island Lake - \" Frances L. Patterson - \"\n- Norway House - Mrs. Annie W. Hill -\n- Bella Bella - Miss Doris Mackay - Miss Mackay is a matriculant, but has not Normal training. She is a sister of the Misses Mackay who have rendered such fine service in our schools in British Columbia and we feel sure she will give a good account of herself this year.\n\n- Kitzagucla - Mr. R. H. Goodridge - We have asked Mr. Goodridge to take this position as missionary-teacher in the stead of Mr. J. C. Ede.\n- Port Simpson - Second Room - In this case we left the nomination with Mr. Indian Agent Wm. Collison.\n- Ucluelet - Miss Elizabeth B. Ryckman. - We have asked Miss Ryckman, a qualified teacher, who has several years' experience in the Indian work to take charge here as a missionary-teacher. Mr. Indian Agent Frost has consented to this.\n\nIf these nominations are acceptable to the Department, kindly notify the respective Indian Agents of the appointments and send us a full list of all our Schools, with salaries attached, and oblige.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Banner\nOttawa, August 29th, 1930.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI have your letter of the 26th instant, submitting nominations of teachers for the coming school year for the vacancies which have occurred in the Indian day schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. It is noted that all are qualified teachers, with the exception of those nominated for the Bella Bella and Kitsegakla Indian Day Schools. I should be pleased if you would give the Department full information in regard to the qualifications and experience each of the teachers nominated possesses and, also, intimate the amount of salary which was promised in each case. I may say that the salary which we could provide would depend upon the qualifications and experience.\n\nThe Department will approve of the appointment of the teachers for each of the schools as mentioned in your letter and the necessary arrangements can be made for them to begin duties on the 2nd proximo, or as soon thereafter as possible. When we have information regarding the qualifications, consideration will be given as to the salary that will be allowed for the new teachers, also, as requested, a list of the respective teachers at each of the day schools for the coming school year and the salaries allowed will be forwarded for the information of the Board of Home Missions. I shall be pleased to receive the above information at an early date in order that the respective Indian Agents can be advised regarding the new appointments and salaries allowed.\n\nRelative to a second teacher for the Fort Simpson Indian Day School, I have to inform you that Mr. Agent Collison requested that a second classroom be fitted up and the services of a teacher engaged for the six months' period from October 1st to March 31st next. He was, however, informed that the Department had no funds available this present fiscal year to provide the salary and equipment for this second classroom and that the present arrangement for carrying on the work would have to continue during the coming school year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 29th, - No. 160-7, -\nI beg to supplement my letter by giving, as you request, whatever\ninformation we have in our possession regarding the various new\nteachers nominated:\n\nGeorgina Island - Miss Julia H. Good. - Miss Good\nholds a life certificate for Ontario and has taught school for fif-\nteen years.\n\nMiss Good has been promised a salary of $350.00 - the\nsame as was paid the previous teacher.\n\nCross Lake - Miss Constance Shoup. - In a letter to\nme, dated March 29th, 1929, Rev. W. W. Shoup, Miss Shoup's father,\nstates: \"Constance is now nearing 19 years and at present is pur-\nsuing B.Sc. work in Southern College, Lakeland, Florida. She has\nbeen specializing in Home Economics.\" Last year Miss Shoup filled\nsatisfactorily the position of nurse-deaconess at Cross Lake. This\nis all the information we have in our possession regarding Miss\nShoup's qualifications. If you wish further particulars, kindly let\nme know and I shall make enquiries and advise you later.\n\nWe are hoping that Miss Shoup will receive the same sal-\nary as was paid Miss Brigham last year, namely, $350.00.\n\nIsland Lake - Miss Frances L. Patterson. - Miss Patterson\nwas appointed on your recommendation. For her qualifications you\nmight refer to your personal letter to Dr. Cochrane, dated July 17th,\n1929.\n\nAs regards Miss Patterson's salary, please refer to your\npersonal letter to me dated June 26th, 1930.\n\nNorway House - Mrs. Annie W. Hill. - Mrs. Hill is an\nhonor graduate of McGill, with Quebec Second Class Academy Diploma\nand has had several years of teaching experience in Montreal.\n\nA salary of $350.00 has been promised to Mrs. Hill.\n\nBella Bella - Miss Doris Mackay. - As stated in my pre-\nvious letter, Miss Mackay has matriculant standing, but her only\nteaching experience was supplying at the Coqualeetza Institute during part of last winter.\n\nI did not make Miss Mackay any definite promise in regard to salary.\n\nKitzegucla - Mr. R. H. Goodridge.- Mr. Goodridge is not a qualified teacher but is a well educated man and taught school some years ago - I could not state the exact period. However, he was in charge of our Kitamaat Mission for two years, of course, not having anything to do with the School.\n\nI promised Mr. Goodridge the same salary as Mr. Ede was paid, namely, $950.00, because I consider him to be a superior man in every way to Mr. Ede. We found it very difficult to secure a teacher of any kind for Kitzegucla and I trust this arrangement will be satisfactory to the Department.\n\nUcluelet - Miss Elizabeth B. Ryckman.- Miss Ryckman holds a teacher's certificate; she taught some years ago at the School at Goodfish Lake, Alberta. She was engaged by Mr. Frost, the Indian Agent at Port Alberni. She was promised a salary of $900.00.\n\nFort Simpson.- I think you misunderstood my statement regarding Fort Simpson. I was not referring to the prospect of a new class-room, but to the resignation of Miss Young. It was in the matter of securing somebody to take her place that I left the appointment in the hands of Mr. Agent Collison.\n\nWith kindest regards,\n\nI remain Yours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barnard\n\nAB.MT\n# Academic Year 1930-31\n\n## Indian Day Schools Under Auspices of the United Church of Canada\n\n| School                  | Teacher                        | Salary                      |\n|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Ontario:**            |                               |                             |\n| Christian Island        | F.

He is being written today to ascertain whom he has secured.\n\nEnclosed is a list of the teachers at each of the day schools conducted under the auspices of your Society. You will note that salary for the assistant teacher at Port Simpson is not shown on this list as this cannot be decided until Mr. Agent Collison replies.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T.

I wonder if it would be too much trouble for you to let me have\u2014\n\n1.- A copy of the Act as it now stands under which Indians may obtain the franchise; and\n\n2.- A statement as to the number of Indians who have applied for and received the franchise since Act XIV was passed.\n\nI am not anticipating that these resolutions, and others which are to be presented in reference to our Indian Work, will seriously influence the policy of our Board of Home Missions in co-operation with your Department, but I desire to be prepared to answer questions intelligently when the discussion arises.\n\nThanking you for your attention to this request,\n\nI am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\nRESOLUTION RE INDIAN WORK\n\nWhereas there is unrest and dissatisfaction amongst our Indian people in the Province of Alberta, owing to the educational policy, resulting in the withdrawal of many of our Indian people from our Church to unite with the Roman Catholic Church, and whereas social and economic conditions are such as to result in the creation of a dependent, rather than a self-reliant people, therefore hampering the efforts of our Missionaries to such an extent as to make their task exceedingly difficult:\n\nTHEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that we as a Conference memorialize the General Council to investigate these conditions, with a view first of all of re-opening if deemed necessary the day-schools on Reserves, which, according to the terms of the Indian treaties were assured the people, so long as there were children available to attend such schools, we further believe that the reopening of such schools on the Reserve would result in a larger attendance at the Residential School in Edmonton. And secondly, to make a social survey of the Reserves, with a view of the Church and State cooperating for the betterment of social and economic and religious conditions.\n\nWE FURTHER RECOMMEND that each Conference in which there is Indian work through its Presbyteries exercise a closer supervision over actual conditions, and policies, obtaining on reserves, and that a more democratic and careful selection of the men appointed to the Indian or educational work of the Church, be exercised.\n\nWE FURTHER BELIEVE that the time is ripe to ask the Department of Indian affairs to consider the conditional enfranchisement of the Indians. We believe that the vote, while not depriving the Indian of any of his reservation or treaty rights, would make for self-reliance on the part of the Indian, and a more intelligent knowledge of, and interest in, our Indian population by the general public.\n\nAll of which is respectfully submitted.\nOttawa, September 16, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant, with enclosure, and in reply I am forwarding a copy of the Indian Act. There were amendments at the last session of Parliament, but these do not affect the enfranchisement clauses. You will note that Indians may be enfranchised under Sections 110 and 114. Section 110 refers to Indians living on reserves and involves the alienation of reserve lands and the granting of title to such lands to the enfranchised Indian. There are very few enfranchisements under this section. Section 114 provides for the enfranchisement of Indians who hold no land on a reserve and who do not follow the Indian mode of life. Under this section, up to March 31, 1930, a total of 1531 Indian men, women and children were enfranchised.\n\nUnofficially, I may add, for your confidential ear, that the Department has been somewhat disappointed by enfranchised Indians. Enfranchisement has not turned out as well as was hoped.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nRESOLUTION PASSED BY ASSOCIATION OF INDIAN WORKERS IN SASKATCHEWAN AT THEIR MEETING HELD IN MAY - 1930.\n\nThe association of Indian workers in the Province of Saskatchewan under the United Church of Canada has given careful consideration to the question of \"Follow Up Work\" among the graduates of the Residential Schools, and among the progressive pupils of the Day Schools. We beg to present through the Board of Home Missions to the Department of Indian Affairs the following resolutions:\n\n1.- That we express our hearty appreciation of the interest the Department has taken in the matter throughout the years, and we desire to co-operate with them, as far as lies in our power, in furthering this policy.\n\n2.- We are determined, as far as our work is concerned, to seek a closer and more sympathetic co-operation between the missions on the reserves and the Residential Schools, particularly in connection with those pupils who are nearing graduation.\n\n3.- We are of the opinion that in the year previous to graduation some encouragement to independence and self-help might be given by the Department to promising students by allowing them to cultivate a piece of land for themselves or to engage in any other remunerative work under the guidance of the Principal.\n\n4.- We would respectfully suggest that the principle of assistance to pupils of both sexes immediately after graduation be extended, particularly in securing horses and implements for work, and in cases where ex-pupils marry, in helping them to provide a house and furniture.\n\n5.- We would suggest the following safeguard to this action, namely, that the officials of the Department give special supervision to these young people in the use of the equipment thus provided, and that in cases where the graduates thus treated fail to make good or prove unworthy, the horses and the implements be passed on to some more deserving person.\n\nAt the Executive of the Board of Home Missions of The United Church of Canada, held in October, 1930, - It was agreed to forward this Resolution, simpliciter, to the Department of Indian Affairs.\nRESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE COUNCIL OF INDIAN WORKERS\nIN BRITISH COLUMBIA - May 1930 - AND ENDORSED BY THE B.C. CONFERENCE.\n\nWHEREAS the following resolution, fully considered and unanimously adopted by the Council of Workers among the Indians in British Columbia, assembled on May 12th, 1930, in St. Andrew's Church, Vancouver, and presented to us with the request that it be forwarded through the Board of Home Missions to the Department of Indian Affairs:\n\nThe resolution reading:-\n\n\"WHEREAS the beneficial result of the present system of education fostered by the Department of Indian Affairs, especially in regard to technical training, are fully appreciated by all, and\n\nWHEREAS we recognise the splendid opportunities thus offered to the Indian youth of Canada, the results thus fully justifying operations along these lines, and\n\nWHEREAS we are convinced that neither the Church nor the Government of Canada is reaping maximum results from the expenditure of money and effort thus entailed, and\n\nWHEREAS there is a missing link which should be forged into the present system along the line of \"Follow up work.\"\n\nIT IS RESOLVED:-\n(1) That for the advancement of the best interests of graduates and ex-pupils generally, we respectfully request that the Department of Indian Affairs take the whole question of what is termed 'Follow Up' work under advisement as soon as possible, and appoint a 'Vocational Director' who would be responsible to the Department of Indian Affairs, who would act as intermediary between employers and graduates, and endeavour to find suitable employment for graduates at wages commensurate with their ability. He would be a man well qualified to supervise the graduates in their employment and to give vocational guidance, to protect their interests and direct as far as possible their future welfare.\n\n(2) That to give maximum effect to this 'Follow Up' system, we further recommend that the Department of Indian Affairs establish an office and home in the City of Vancouver where students and graduates should reside when taking extra vocational training or when seeking employment; inasmuch as by this means the director would be able to look more effectively after the moral welfare of the Indian young people who visit the city or who are in residence while employed.\n\nMoved by Rev. H. Allen and seconded by Rev. E. McGougan.\n\nSigned\n\nThat this Conference endorse this resolution and forward it through the Board of Home Missions to the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nCARRIED.\n\nThe Executive of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, at its meeting in October, 1930, agreed to forward the above Resolution to the Department of Indian Affairs, simpliciter.\nOttawa, November 19th, 1930.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton,\n\nPursuant to our conversation of the other day, I now write to inform you of the various needs at the Indian residential schools under the auspices of the United Church Missionary Society and W. M. S.\n\nUrgent Requirements For Which Provision May Be Made for 1931:\n\nMount Elgin: Minor repairs.\nPortage la Prairie: Principal's residence.\nBrandon: Frigidaire.\nNorway House: Nil.\nRound Lake: Minor repairs.\nFile Hills: Minor repairs.\nEdmonton: Painting and decorating.\nMorley: Frigidaire.\nCoqualeetza: General repairs.\nAlberni: Alterations to cottage.\nAhousaht: Nil.\nKitamaat: Marine engine.\nFort Simpson: Electric light plant.\n\nLess Urgent Improvements For Which Requests Have Been Received and Which Will Have to be Fully Considered:\n\nMount Elgin: Principal's residence.\nBrandon: New wing for additional accommodation.\nNorway House: New Principal's residence.\nRound Lake: Addition to main building.\nMorley: Addition to main building.\nRoot house.\nFencing.\nMore arable land.\nAddition to main building.\nFencing.\nElectric mangle.\nGymnasium.\nGreenhouse.\nFarmer's residence.\nAssembly hall.\nClearing land.\nRoad and docking.\nAdditional classroom facilities.\nCarpenter shop.\n\nIf you think any of the items that I have marked urgent are really not necessary next year, you might say so and, if you find something that I have not down as urgent that you consider is in that category, you might make a special request.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B.A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nMission Board,\n26 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 5, Ont.\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nJanuary 31st,\n1931.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Indian Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nI have not previously made any direct reference to your letter giving a detailed statement of the various needs of our Indian Residential Schools, provision for which may be included in your estimates for 1931.\n\nI have tried to investigate as carefully as possible the situation at the various places. There are only two or three matters to which I should like to refer.\n\nRe Norway House.\u2014I notice that you are not planning to ask even for a small grant for minor repairs in connection with the Residential School there. My impression of that old building, after going over it very carefully last year, is that there should be a small sum of a few hundred dollars available annually for repairs. It would, for instance, be vastly improved by a serious attempt to re-paint the walls and furniture in the dining-room and by a re-lacquering of most of the beds in the dormitories. When I was there I discussed with Mr. Gordon the possibility of improving the storm windows by stripping them, and we had Joe Keeper look over the building in order to get an estimated idea of how much it would cost. I do not know whether the stripping has actually been done or not. As I intimated to you in my conversation, I think the fire alarm arrangements, with only one gong in a building of that size, are entirely inadequate, and that steps should be taken immediately to install a system similar to the one provided in Mount Elgin.\n\nRe Morley.\u2014I have had some further correspondence with Mr. Staley and am enclosing a map, which I asked him to prepare, showing the amount of reserve land which is now actually flooded. This will give you some idea of the basis on which he estimates that he will have a deficit of $1,000 this year. I am rather disappointed that we have not received a copy of his annual report. It does seem as if the Calgary Power Company, in addition to giving us compensation for the United Church land which is flooded, should also do something for the school in regard to the part of the land on the reserve previously used as a school garden and which is now useless.\nRe Ahousant.\u2014 We are very grateful for your attention to the needs of the school there and believe that the plans that you are making in that respect are perfectly satisfactory and quite as much as Mr. Jones can expect during the current year.\n\nRe Portage la Prairie.\u2014 I hope that it may be possible to proceed this year with the building of a Principal's residence. If we are to retain Mr. and Mrs. Hendry in the service of the Church and of the Indian Department, it is going to be necessary to find a separate place of residence for them. Of course, I realize that this will add to the total expense of carrying on the School, as we shall immediately be faced with the necessity of engaging a Matron. However, I am personally quite impressed with the value of Mr. Hendry's services and I am very anxious to retain him if it is at all possible. They have, I think, borne their full share of the burden for us and the Department by their willingness to reside in the school with all the noise and confusion for so many years.\n\nIn conclusion, may I say that I am leaving to-night for a visit to the Maritime Provinces, but I am expecting to spend March 8th and 9th in Ottawa and hope it may be possible to have an unhurried interview with you on Monday, March 9th.\n\nWith very kind personal regards,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB,MLT\n\nEncl.\nMay 21st,\n1931.\n\nMr. Russell T. Ferrier,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ferrier:\n\nRe: NOMINATION OF TEACHERS\n\nIn looking over the list of schools on the Indian Reserves for which we are responsible, in regard to making nominations, I discover that there are comparatively few cases where it will be necessary to nominate new teachers. The list of such places, as near as I can estimate at the present time, is as follows:\n\nManitoba: Cross Lake, Nelson House, Oxford House and Rossville.\n\nBritish Columbia: Bella Bella, and probably the second room at Port Simpson.\n\nIf it is agreeable to you we will follow the same policy as last year and not mention those cases where the teachers wish to continue for the approaching academic year. In regard to the others, be assured that they are under our careful consideration, and instead of keeping our list until August as we did last year, we will send in our nominations one by one as we select teachers for these respective schools.\n\nIf, through your Inspectors or Indian Agents you know of any other places where changes are recommended, kindly let me know at your earliest convenience.\n\nWith kind regards to you and yours,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArthur Barner\n\nAB: NEF\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the nomination of teachers for the Indian schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada. It will not be necessary for you to write regarding those schools where the present teachers intend to continue during the next academic year.\n\nIt is noted that you will send in, as they are selected, the names of teachers you nominate for Indian day schools.\n\nYou will be promptly advised when any of our inspectors or agents desire a teacher changed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Arthur Barner,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 17th, 1931.\n\nReverend Sir,\n\nI desire to inform you that provision has been made in the appropriation for the current fiscal year for the following increases in pupilage:\n\n| School       | Former | New |\n|--------------|--------|-----|\n| Mount Elgin  | 140    | 150 |\n| Brandon      | 125    | 160 |\n| File Hills   | 90     | 100 |\n| Edmonton     | 140    | 150 |\n\nI am, also, pleased to inform you that the per capita grant at Mount Elgin has been increased from $145 to $150; Portage la Prairie from $160 to $165; Ahousaht from $165 to $170 and Alberni from $165 to $170. All of these increases are effective from April 1st, 1931.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev. Kenneth J.

McGill, Esq., M.D.,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nMy dear Dr. McGill:\n\nI had hoped as the Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church responsible for the administration of the Indian department to have called on you before this and extended to you a welcome on behalf of our Church as the new Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs for Canada.\n\nIt seems likely now that both Dr. Cochrane and myself will be in Ottawa next Tuesday, December 13th, when we hope to have the privilege of meeting you and assuring you of our desire to cooperate in every possible way in the great task which you have undertaken on behalf of the Indians of Canada.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter which I am sending today to the Hon. T. G. Murphy, Minister of the Interior, for your information. We would appreciate the privilege of discussing this matter with you during our interview next week.\n\nWishing you every possible success in your new position,\n\nI am\n\nYours very cordially,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEnd.\nDecember 9th, 1932.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton,\n\nI have your letter of December 7th, and have read with much interest your letter to the Honourable Mr. Murphy, copy of which was attached.\n\nI note that it is your expectation to visit Ottawa in company with Dr. Cochrane on Tuesday, December 13th. I shall look forward to this opportunity of making your acquaintance and discussing matters of common interest.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nThe United Church of Canada,\n299 Queen Street, West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nOttawa, July 29, 1933.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nAs you are aware, for several years past, the Department has made it a practice, when funds are available, to allow advances early each quarter on the per capita allowances of schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church.\n\nRecently, our Accounting Branch has taken exception to allowing advances before the returns for the preceding quarter have reached the Department. In some cases the principals apparently delay preparation of the quarterly returns and, as a result, the returns do not arrive at Ottawa until several weeks after the end of the quarter.\n\nIn order that there may be no unnecessary delay in forwarding advances, when funds are available, I have to request that you will direct the principals of your Indian residential schools to prepare and forward their returns to the Department promptly at the end of each quarter, as, unless they do so, the advances on the subsequent quarter will be delayed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. W.,\nToronto 2, Ont.\n### ACADEMIC YEAR 1933-34\n\n**INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS UNDER AUSPICES OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA**\n\n| SCHOOL                  | TEACHER                        | SALARY                      |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|\n| **Quebec:**             |                                |                             |\n| Caughnawaga             | Miss Viola Daly (Sr.)          | $90 per teaching month      |\n|                         | Miss Eleanor Gulton (Jr.)      | 90                          |\n| Oka Country             | Albert E.

He should be a man well qualified to supervise the graduates in their employment and capable of giving vocational guidance, to protect their interests and as far as possible direct their future welfare.\n\n(2) That, to give maximum effect to this \"follow-up\" system, WE FURTHER RECOMMEND that the Department of Indian Affairs establish in central locations a hostel which would be an office, a home and a club-room, where students might reside when taking extra vocational training, or when seeking employment, or when passing through the city, inasmuch as by this means the Welfare Officer would be able to look more effectively after the moral well-being of the Indian young people who visit the city or who are in residence there while employed.\nRESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY CONFERENCE OF INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL PRINCIPALS OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA HELD AT TORONTO JAN. 29-FEB. 1, 1934.\n\n* * *\n\nRE: INSURANCE OF INDIAN MEANS OF LIVELIHOOD.\n\nWHEREAS the Indians of the coastal waters of British Columbia are suffering today from the invasion of their ancient fishing grounds by white men and Japanese, who with their superior equipment and aggressiveness are making it very difficult for these Indians to make a living,\n\nAND WHEREAS certain large areas throughout the Dominion are becoming depleted in fur bearing animals through the destructive methods of white people who have invaded the trapping grounds held by the Indians for centuries past and it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Indians to depend on trapping to provide for their needs,\n\nTHEREFORE be it resolved that this Conference ask our Mission Board to call the attention of the Department of Indian Affairs to these problems, urging them to work out a plan whereby certain coastal waters shall be reserved for the exclusive use of the Indians.\n\nFURTHER we would ask the Department to assume supervision of trapping grounds with the object to setting aside certain large areas for the exclusive trapping rights of the Indians.\nRESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY CONFERENCE OF INDIAN RESIDENTIAL\nSCHOOL PRINCIPALS OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA\nHELD AT TORONTO JAN. 29-FEB. 1, 1934.\n\nRE: RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL POLICY.\n\nWHEREAS the Government of Canada, through the Department of Indian Affairs, entered into an agreement with the Churches in regard to Indian Education in 1910, in which the Residential School for Indian boys and girls under the management of the Church was to be the chief factor;\n\nAND WHEREAS this agreement has not been revised in the past except by mutual consent;\n\nAND WHEREAS the Residential Schools, as conducted by The United Church of Canada have demonstrated their ability to fulfill the undertakings entered into with the Government of Canada. The Church itself has put large sums of money into maintenance from year to year and given the services of some of her finest personalities.\n\nAND WHEREAS there is a feeling of uneasiness in regard to the attitude of the Department of Indian Affairs towards the Residential School policy in the future;\n\nWE, THEREFORE, REUEST THAT the Government make a declaration in the immediate future concerning their intention to continue Residential Schools for Indian boys and girls and to support them in such a way, by financial and other official assistance, that their efficiency will be unimpaired and we hope increased.\n\nIn support of our position we submit the following considerations to show that the Residential School is today the most vital factor in the preparation of the Canadian Indian for citizenship:\n\n(1) The safe-guarding and developing of the health of the pupils.\u2014The annual report of The Department of Indian Affairs', to mention only one aspect of this important problem, says in regard to trachoma that the Residential School is the key to the solution of the problem. This would apply also in some measure to tuberculosis.\n(2) The preparation of Indians for full citizenship by -\n\n(a) Providing them with vocational training.\n\n(b) Giving them sufficient educational equipment, so that they can compete with other Canadians in various occupations.\n\n(c) Developing moral fibre and Christian character, which are absolutely essential in order that the Indians may not only attain citizenship but have the necessary intellectual and spiritual background to take full advantage of its privileges and make their contribution to our national life.\n\n(d) The preservation of native arts and crafts as a part of Canada's contribution to the culture of the world.\n\n(3) While we are entirely opposed to the theory that Residential Schools should be merely orphanages we do recognise that they are still necessary for the adequate care, both physical and moral, of Indian children from isolated homes, from destitute homes, from homes and reserves where moral conditions are questionable, and of Indian children who have no parents.\n\nWe protest against any curtailment of the Residential School policy, as carried out in the areas which we serve today, in the interests of the improved Day School for the following reasons:\n\n(1) The nomadic character and seasonal occupations of many of the Indians, which makes regular attendance at the day School impossible.\n\n(2) The impossibility of giving the Indian the type of education, which is essential to his earning a living and competing in the labor market, in the improved school as compared with the Residential School with its specialized staff.\n\n(3) An increasing proportion of pupils are children of graduates and are by long odds the most promising material for developing leadership among the native people, and they will be shut out of the Residential Schools by a rigid enforcement of compulsory Day School attendance.\n\nOf 558 Indian pupils in Grade VIII. in Canada 204 are in Residential Schools. Among the 94 taking High School work 67 are in the Residential Schools and 47 of these are in the schools under our auspices.\nRESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY CONFERENCE OF INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL PRINCIPALS, OF THE UNITED CHURCH OF CANADA HELD AT TORONTO JAN. 29-FEB. 1, 1934.\n\nRE: RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER RESIDENTIAL SCHOOLS.\n\nWHEREAS it is not the policy of The United Church of Canada to solicit pupils from homes which are affiliated with any other denomination;\n\nWHEREAS there are always some parents, however, who appreciate the privileges afforded by our schools and desire to obtain them for their children;\n\nAND WHEREAS in several recent cases we feel that the decisions of the Department of Indian Affairs, in regard to refusal of admission of children of parents who have at some time been affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, have been unsatisfactory;\n\nBE IT RESOLVED: THAT we request the Secretaries to keep this matter before the Department of Indian Affairs and also take such steps as may be necessary to secure the co-operation of the other Protestant Churches in presenting the case to the Government;\n\nAND THAT in cases where the religious affiliation is not clear ample opportunity should be given to the Principals of both denominations to state their case before the application is recommended by the Agent or considered by the Department;\n\nAND THAT the Principals be requested forthwith to supply the Secretary with all information concerning cases which are pending.\nMr. Beaton discussed these matters with O.M. when he visited department on Feb 22/34.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPoor Copy\nCHURCH DOESN'T WANT INDIAN DAY SCHOOLS\n\nAsk Government Not to Take Present System Out of Missions' Hands\n\nHearing that the Canadian government intends to inaugurate a system of day schools on Indian reserves, rather than encourage the Indian residential school system conducted by church organizations, the United Church of Canada has sent through its department of Indian missions a request that the government do not \"slacken up\" on the residential schools.\n\nIn their appeal officials of the United Church of Canada point out that trachoma and tuberculosis, prevalent among Indians, may not receive as efficient treatment in the residential schools as in the day-schools.\n\nThey further seek to have the residential school system continued and encouraged because \"it is a question for full citizenship, that it develops moral fibre and Christian character and encourages the teaching of native arts and industry.\"\n\nThese are the words of Rev. Kenneth Macdonald, head of the United Church home mission department, who told The Star today that the nomadic character and seasonal occupations of the Indian people would prevent successful working of a day-school system.\n\nHow seriously did the United Church of Canada take the situation? The Star learns, that for the first time in its history a conference of all the principals of the residential schools was held last weekend in Toronto to prepare the appeal.\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMarch 15th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan:\n\nPlease accept my sincere thanks for your personal letter of March 13th. I appreciate your thoughtfulness and consideration in regard to the matter.\n\nFor your personal information, I am sending you a copy of the letter which I wrote to Rev. R. J. Ross, of Round Lake, in regard to the Belanger case after my interview with Dr. McGill and yourself.\n\nI am wondering if it would be all right for me to write Jack a letter. I would keep off Department Affairs and send him a purely personal communication. If you think he would appreciate it, please put a slip containing his house address into some communication coming from your department within the next week or two.\n\nWith very kind personal regards,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MLT\n\nEnc.\nRev. R. J. Ross,\nStockholm, Sask.\n\nMarch 6th,\n1934.\n\nMy dear Mr. Ross:\n\nRe: Belanger Case.\n\nI am in receipt of your communications concerning this case and wish to express my personal opinion that it would be very unwise to receive these children into your School until such time as the Department has given a final ruling on the matter. While I am convinced that they are not justified in the attitude which they have taken up to date, nothing is to be gained by presuming that the ultimate outcome of the negotiations will be favorable to the desires of the parents.\n\nI found it rather difficult when I was discussing this question with officials of the Department of Indian Affairs in Ottawa last week to answer the question as to why the United Church was so interested in securing the attendance of these three children when there are, according to their information, several Protestant children of school age on the Reserve who are not in residence and therefore not receiving any education.\n\nI discussed the matter with two or three men in the Department, including the Deputy Superintendent General, and I am convinced that they are sincerely trying to be just and fair in the decisions made where controversy arises concerning whether children should be placed in Protestant or Roman Catholic Schools.\n\nIt is quite clear to me from my experience in this case that we have been handicapped in the past by the fact that Principals of our Schools have tried to make their representations directly to Ottawa without having the influence of the whole Church behind them, while the Roman Catholics are thoroughly organized and the man who approaches the Government on any question - even though it be the matter of the admission of a single child - speaks with the authority of the whole communion.\n\nI am not writing in this vein to indicate that I have given up protesting against the rulings which have already been made in the Belanger case, but to assure you that even if the final decision is against us, we will have done our duty when we placed the indisputable facts before the\nGovernment. The suggestion of the Agent that he should resort to courts of law or to the use of the Mounted Police, in order to force these children into a Roman Catholic School, is simply ridiculous and should be completely ignored.\n\nWith very kind personal regards,\n\nI am\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n\"Kenneth J.

Mr. Ross.\n\nMr. Sutherland is making very fair progress, and the report yesterday was that they were hopeful he would be able to get up in two or three weeks' time. I saw him last Saturday. I am sure that he would be very pleased to hear from you. His address is 30 Waverley Street.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nMay 8th, 1934.\n\nMEMO FOR FILE:\n\nLetter of May 8th, addressed to Rev. Mr. Beaton, was written in view of the following paragraph contained in Mr. Beaton's letter of April 24, 1934, on File 1-1-3:\n\n\"Rightly or wrongly, there is a growing feeling on the part of our missionaries and their representatives on the Board that the Government plans to take away from the Missionary Societies of the Churches the right to nominate teachers for Indian Day Schools. This feeling is very pronounced and exceedingly vocal over our whole British Columbia Conference. We had before us a very strong resolution which was passed by the British Columbia Conference last May. After due consideration, the Committee recommended a resolution which is copied here-with, and it was unanimously adopted by the Board:\n\n\"That we re-affirm our conviction that it is in the interests of both the educational and missionary work on Indian Missions that the Church should retain the right to nominate teachers for Indian Day Schools, and that the Secretaries be asked to call a Conference with other Churches engaged in Indian work, with a view to making representations to the Department of Indian Affairs asking for assurance that no infringement of this right is contemplated.\n\n\"We further recommend that the teachers nominated should possess the following qualifications:\n\n(1) Must be missionary minded.\n(2) Must have adequate professional qualifications.\n(3) Must be old enough to appreciate the problems involved in living on an Indian Reserve.\n(4) Must be able to work harmoniously with others.\n(5) Must, preferably, be members of the United Church of Canada.\"\nMay 8th, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have given careful consideration to your letter of the 24th ultimo, and it has been decided to forward the salaries of teachers of Indian Day Schools direct. As you were previously informed, all salaries will be paid monthly in future.\n\nAs I intimated to you when you were in my office recently, the question of the method of appointment of teachers is the subject of correspondence between this Department and the Civil Service Commission. A definite decision in this regard has not yet been reached.\n\nI have noted particularly the paragraph in your letter in which you complain of a discrimination against missionary teachers in the matter of salary. I agree with you that the salaries of qualified missionary teachers should not be on a lower scale. Unfortunately, present conditions and regulations do not permit the Department to make any re-adjustment in salaries. The matter, however, will be kept in mind, and as soon as financial conditions warrant, the necessary adjustments will be made in the salaries of this class of teachers.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nJune 29, 1934.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nWith reference to your recent visit to the Department, you will remember that, in connection with the Fisher River Indian Day School, the method of dismissing teachers was discussed.\n\nI feel that the Indian day schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church of Canada should be in conformity in all respects with the Indian day schools conducted under the auspices of other religious bodies. Under these circumstances, I would appreciate your first advising the Department, in future, when you consider it necessary to recommend the dismissal of a teacher in one of the Indian day schools in which your Society is interested. Your representations in this regard will receive careful consideration, and, if a change in teacher is decided upon, instructions to that effect will be issued from here.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev.

McGill,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAt the meeting of the British Columbia Conference recently held in St. Andrew's-Wesley Church, Vancouver, the following resolution was passed, which I beg to submit for your consideration:\n\n\"Re. Follow-up work and Placement Officer:\nWhereas the beneficial results of the present system of education fostered by the Department of Indian Affairs, especially in regard to Residential Schools, are fully appreciated by all;\nAnd whereas we recognize the splendid opportunities thus offered to the Indian youth of Canada, the results obtained fully justifying operations along this line;\nAnd whereas we are convinced that neither the Church nor the Government of Canada is reaping maximum results from the expenditure of money and effort;\nAnd whereas there is a missing link to complete the work which should be forged into the present system along the line of \"follow-up\" work:\n(1) for the advancement of the best interests of graduates and ex-pupils generally, we respectfully request the Department of Indian Affairs to take the whole question of what is termed 'follow-up' or 'Placement' work immediately under consideration and appoint a Placement Officer or Welfare Officer, who would act as intermediary between employers and graduates and endeavour to find suitable employment for graduates at wages commensurate to their ability. He should be a man well qualified to supervise the graduates in their employment and capable of giving vocational guidance to protect their interests and as far as possible direct their future;\n(2) That, to give maximum effect to this 'follow-up' system, we further recommend, that the Department of Indian Affairs establish in central locations a hostel which would be an office, a home and club room, where students might reside when taking extra vocational training, or when seeking employment, or when passing through the city, inasmuch as by this means\nMr. H.W. McGill\n\nJuly 13, 1934\n\nthe Welfare Officer would be able to look more effectively after the moral well-being of the Indian young people who visit the city or who are in residence there while employed.\"\n\nI am, Dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary.\nOttawa, July 25, 1934.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nThe Department has received your letter of the 13th instant, with reference to the recommendation made at the recent meeting of the British Columbia Conference of the United Church of Canada.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General is in the West at the present time, but, on his return, your communication will be brought to his attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. H. E. Horton,\nSecretary,\nConference of British Columbia,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n6464 Chester St.,\nVancouver, B. C.\nNovember 30th,\n1934.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am hoping to be in Ottawa on Monday, December 3rd, but am sending forward an outline of the repairs and improvements which seem to be necessary in connection with our Indian schools. The two places of greatest need, so far as our work is concerned, are the Mount Elgin Indian Residential School, Muncey, and the Norway House Indian Residential School. The following is the list:\n\nMount Elgin Residential School, Muncey, Ont.-\n\nAnnex Building:\n- Finish senior classroom.- This includes floors, walls, ceiling, painting, blackboard, &c.\n- Ten-tent ceilings in junior and intermediate classrooms.\n- Hardwood floors in junior and intermediate classrooms.\n- Finish halls.\n- Check heating plant\n\nMain Building:\n- Installation of jacket heater and hot water tank, adequate for pupils and staff.\n- Electric refrigerator room.\n- Toilet accommodation in dormitories.\n- Larger capacity electric pump.- (present pump overloaded; hopelessly inadequate in case of fire.)\n- Overhaul heating plant.\n- Remove partitions between present senior classroom and boys' reading-room, converting enlarged room into auditorium, with chair seats.\n- Remodel pupils' diningroom and kitchen.\n- Paint all woodwork and windows outside.\n\nBarns:\n- Repair and paint all roofs, at present rusting badly.\n\nWe are aware that the Architect of the Department has it in mind to remodel the whole interior of this main building at Muncey. We do not see the necessity of this but believe that, with the changes and improvements suggested and a normal sum spent on repairs annually, the present building can be made quite adequate, - unless it is the desire of the Government to greatly increase the number of pupils.\n\nNorway House Indian Residential School, Man.-\n- Remodel and refurnish kitchen, with the exception of the stoves.\nRe-cover diningroom tables and provide new benches.\n\nInstall a steam-pressure plant for hot water and laundry purposes.\n\nNew roof for school verandah; present roof leaking badly in all directions.\n\nFill all cracks on outside with oakum or putty, and paint the whole exterior, including roof.\n\nRefurnish staff bedrooms with proper beds; at present using same type of cots provided for children.\n\nPurchase 50 new mattresses for children's beds.\n\nThese are imperative needs. The Department should also look forward to enlarging and improving the present outside classroom at Norway House, so as to provide teaching accommodation for both teachers and leave the present classroom in the main building as an auditorium.\n\nIn this connection, I would also suggest that serious consideration be given to uniting the teaching of the children from the Reserve with those in residence, bringing the whole programme of education on the Reserve under the direction of the Principal of the school.\n\nBrandon Residential School.-\n\nElectric refrigerator.- Probably room at present used as cooler could be turned into walk-in frigidaire. If not, the installation of a large cabinet type electric refrigerator in one corner of the kitchen would be much better than the present system.\n\nNew water supply.- It may be that some action on this matter has already been taken by the Department, as Mr. A.G. Hamilton, the Inspector, reported on it towards the end of September. For the first time in 76 years the spring, which was tapped to supply the School with water, is practically dry. Brandon School is at the moment without fire protection in that sense. There is another spring, 600 yards farther up the hill, which even in this especially dry summer, has maintained a steady flow of good water. It would be an inexpensive matter to extend the lines to tap this source.\n\nGod's Lake.- New Day School.-\n\nMorley Indian Residential School, Alta.- Furnishings for the new wing at present in course of erection.\n\nKitselas, B.C.- New Day School.-\nKlentu, B.C.\n\nThe Department has been considering for years the building of a new school and teacherage at this point. Personally, do not consider this necessary; if sum of $250.00 for repairs to the present residence and dispensary, and a similar sum for repairs to the present day school building, could be made available, I believe the plant would be satisfactory.\n\nSome of these items are necessarily more urgent than others and I shall be glad to go into details and to answer any questions which may arise in your mind after you have gone over the list. I think I can also give fairly accurate estimates as to what the cost will be in each case.\n\nI am delighted to know that you are able to carry on so well and trust that your health may continue to improve.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nKJB.MT\nDecember 11th, 1934.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General -\n\nIn respect to our conversation regarding a reputed agreement with the Missionary Society of the United Church concerning the conduct of Indian Day Schools, I would say that the Schools Branch of this Department has no record of any such agreement.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 10th,\n1935.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI am turning to you for advice. As you are aware, the United Church has had under consideration for a couple of years the question of appointing an independent Commission to make a survey of our Indian Education. It now seems likely that this survey will be undertaken during the month of May, the personnel of the Commission being Dr. W. J. Elliott, of Vermilion, Alberta, Principal of the Agricultural College there, Miss Dorothy Kirkpatrick, M.A., at present Girls' Work Secretary for the Province of Saskatchewan, and Dr. J. L. Stewart, M.A., B.D., now on the staff of St. Andrew's College, Saskatoon, and for many years Vice-President of the West China Union University at Chengtu.\n\nI would like during the survey to let the Commission have a look at one Anglican and one Roman Catholic school. As we will be in Calgary anyway, I have been wondering whether the two schools on the Blackfoot Reserve, near Gleichen, would be the best ones to see. So far as I can tell now, among our own schools, the Commission will visit Portage la Prairie, Brandon, Round Lake, File Hills, Morley, Coqualeetza and Alberni. I am also anxious to give them a chance to see two or three good day schools. Can you let me know whether the Anglicans have any good day schools within reasonable driving distance of these places, where the rail journey will have to be broken in any event?\n\nThis Commission is going out without any instructions from the Board of Home Missions to make such recommendations as their own investigations warrant concerning future policy in regard to Indian Education.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J. Beaton\n\nKJB.MT\nOttawa, April 11, 1935.\n\nDear Mr. Beaton:\n\nI have your letter of the 10th instant, regarding the independent Commission which is being appointed to make a survey of Indian education under the United Church, and stating the names of the personnel of the Commission. I am sure that this survey will be of value to both the Church and the Department, and I hope that we will be favoured with a copy of the Commission's final report.\n\nThere would be no objection to the Commission visiting one or more of the schools conducted under the auspices of the Anglican and the Roman Catholic denominations. I notice that the Commission will be in Calgary and would like to visit two schools on the Blackfoot reserve.\n\nIn this connection I would point out that the Old Sun School (Anglican) is a modern building, and I am sure the Principal, Rev. Mr. House, would gladly give the Commission every opportunity to inspect the school.\n\nThe Crowfoot Indian Residential School (Roman Catholic), near Cluny, Alta., is not a modern school building. It may be found, on inspection, that the dormitories are somewhat overcrowded. I am sure the Principal, Rev. J. Ricou, O.M.I., also, will be pleased to allow the Commission to inspect this school. I may say that the matter of providing an addition to this building is now being considered.\n\nIf I was definitely advised as to the schools of the Anglican and Roman Catholic denominations which the Commission would care to visit, I would inform the Principals. By so doing, it might remove any cause for suspicion concerning the purpose of the visit and the Commission would be assured of a welcome.\n\nMight I suggest that, if the Commission wish to see two schools of similar type, they visit the Gordon's Indian Residential School (Anglican) and the Muscowequan School (Roman Catholic), in the Touchwood area.\n\nRev. Kenneth J. Beaton, B. A.,\nAssociate Secretary,\nBoard of Home Missions,\nUnited Church of Canada,\n299 Queen St. West,\nToronto 2, Ont.\nagency. These schools are about 80 miles, over good road, from Regina.\n\nWould the members of the Commission care to interview our Inspectors - Mr. Christianson, in Calgary, and Mr. Murison, in Regina? It might be to their advantage and I am sure the Inspectors would give them any assistance possible.\n\nThe two Roman Catholic schools I would like the Commission to visit in British Columbia - if they can arrange to do so - would be Kamloops, our largest Indian residential school, and St. Mary's Mission, at Mission City, on the C. P. R., about 35 miles east of Vancouver. These schools are under English speaking priests, while the other Catholic schools mentioned are in charge of French speaking Fathers. I am sure that the Commission will be welcome at any of the residential schools, whether Anglican or Catholic.\n\nRegarding the day schools, there is only one in Alberta, on the Sarcee reserve, near Calgary, which is conducted under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Church. In Saskatchewan, there are two day schools in the Touchwood agency. The Gordon's and Muscowequan Residential Schools, also, are in this agency. None of the other Anglican day schools are near residential schools. There are three on the Duck Lake reserve and several that might be within easy visiting distance in the Carlton agency. Most of the day schools are rather difficult to visit. However, I am sure the Commission will be welcome at any of the day schools they care to see.\n\nI note that the Commission is going without any instructions from your Board and will make such recommendations as their investigations warrant.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education.\nChange Is Made In Indian Work\n\nDr. Barner Resigns and Home Mission Committees Take Over Task of Supervision\n\nAn important change in the administration of the work of the United Church in Canada, among the Indians in this province and elsewhere, becomes effective at the present time.\n\nUp to the present the supervision of the work of the United church among the Indians has been under the direction of Rev. Dr. Arthur Barner, who for earlier years was in charge of the mission for the Methodist church of Canada, which always took a keen interest in the welfare of the native people.\n\nDr. Barner has now reached the age for retirement and has given up active work. A change has therefore been made in the manner of supervision and in future the care of the Indian missions in the province will be the direct duty of the home mission committees.\n\nThe work of the United church for the Indian people in the Manitoba conference is larger than in any other conference of Canada, Manitoba being closely followed by British Columbia with almost third. In the Manitoba conference approximately $50,000 is expended annually on the work, of which slightly more than one-half comes from the federal government.\n\nThe list of Indian missions which are 16 in number in this conference includes: Falcon Lake, God's Lake, Island Lake, Nelson House, Norway House, Oxford House, Little Grand Rapids, Berens River, Fisher River, Pikan-geehi, Portage la Prairie, Long Plains, Indian Springs, and the Portage and Brandon residential schools. At Norway House the church has a residential school.\n\nDr. J. A. Cormie, superintendent of missions in the conference, will visit each these places as possible during the present year.\nApril 16th,\n1935.\n\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nI appreciate very greatly your letter of April 11th in regard to the Commission which is to visit Indian Residential Schools.\n\nWill you please be good enough to send to each member of the Commission a copy of the Indian Act and of the last Report of the Superintendent of Indian Education. The addresses are as follows -\n\nDr. W. J. Elliott, Provincial School of Agriculture, Vermilion, Alberta.\n\nMiss Dorothy Kirkpatrick, Lloyd's Bldg., Eleventh Avenue, Regina, Sask.\n\nDr. J. L. Stewart, St. Andrew's College, Saskatoon, Sask.\n\nI think your idea of giving us introductions to the Principals of the Anglican and Roman Catholic Schools which we can visit is a very fine one. I had spoken to Canon Gould about the Anglican Schools and I was intending to see Father Plourde in Winnipeg on my way West. I shall be in Ottawa on the 24th or 25th and hope to discuss with you in more detail what schools it is feasible to visit outside of our own group. Unfortunately, we are pretty seriously handicapped in regard to time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nKenneth J.

What responsibility is taken by the Department of Indian Affairs in regard to the provision of housing, furniture, and fuel for teachers in Indian Schools:\n\n2.

Moye,\nSecretary,\nPrince Rupert Presbytery,\nThe United Church of Canada,\nHAZELTON, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of a letter, copy attached, from the Rev. D. W. More, of Hazelton, B.C., as Secretary of the Prince Rupert Presbytery of the United Church of Canada, in which information with regard to the policy of the Department in the matter of the administration of Indian Schools is requested.\n\nInspector Barry has drawn my attention to the fact that during the past sessions of the Prince Rupert Presbytery of the United Church of Canada considerable adverse criticism of the Department's administration in British Columbia was voiced. Criticism was also levelled against the administration of the Indian Schools and, under these circumstances, Capt. Barry considers that the Rev. Mr. More is merely seeking an official declaration of policy which will be considered probably adversely at the next meeting of the Prince Rupert Presbytery. He does not wish, therefore, to take the responsibility himself of supplying the Secretary of the Prince Rupert Presbytery with the information desired.\n\nIn connection with this matter, I would draw your attention to correspondence forwarded to Dr. H. W. McGill by Mr. Indian Agent Collison, Skeena River Agency, under date of February 22nd, 1937, No. 504-10306.\n\nAttention is also directed to your letter No. 64-168 of March 11th, 1937, addressed to myself, dealing with matters of a similar nature. You will remember that this matter was discussed with you when I was in Ottawa.\n\nA copy of my letter to the Secretary of the Prince Rupert Presbytery, acknowledging the receipt of his communica-\n\nR.

Hoey\n\n3rd Feb., 1938.\n\ntion of January 24th, is attached for your information.\n\nI should be glad to have a copy of your reply to Rev. D. W. More in due course.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Mackay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, February 9, 1928.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nYour letter of January 24th, addressed to Major D. M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for British Columbia, has been passed on to me for consideration and reply.\n\nI note your request for certain information with respect to the administration of Indian schools.\n\n1. My answer to your first question is based on the assumption that the question itself relates to the administration of Indian day schools and not to Indian residential schools. I may state that it has never been found possible to evolve a policy of uniform application throughout the Dominion, with respect to housing accommodation for teachers at Indian day schools. Where such schools are established close to white settlements, cities, towns or villages, teachers in charge, particularly female teachers, prefer to secure board and lodging in the white settlements, and, in these cases, no accommodation is provided for teachers at the schools. In the outlying districts of the Dominion, accommodation for the teacher is usually provided and in most cases forms part of the school, itself. The furniture, fuel and general supplies are provided by the Department. In a number of schools, the teachers in charge live in homes provided by the denominations or the religious orders to which they belong. If the teacher is the sole occupant of such a house, fuel is provided by the Department.\n\n2. In reply to the second question, I may state that Section 10 of the Indian Act reads as follows:\n\n\"Every Indian child between the full ages of seven and sixteen years who is physically able shall attend such day, industrial or boarding school as may be designated by the Superintendent General (Minister) for the full periods during which such school is open each year; provided that where it has been made to appear to the satisfaction of the Superintendent General (Minister) that it would be detrimental to any particular Indian child to have it discharged from school on attaining the full age of sixteen years, the Superintendent General\n\n(Minister ...\n\nReverend D. W. More,\nSecretary,\nPrince Rupert Presbytery,\nUnited Church of Canada,\nHazelton, B. C.\n(Minister) may direct that such child be detained at school for such further period as may seem to be advisable, but not beyond the full age of eighteen years, and in such case the provisions of this section with respect to truancy shall apply to such child and its parents, guardians or persons with whom such child resides during such further period of school attendance.\"\n\nIndian pupils who have obtained creditable standing on their Entrance Examinations and who are physically fit are eligible, from year to year, for departmental tuition grants. These tuition grants enable a number of Indian pupils to proceed with the regular high school studies or, if they so prefer, with courses of vocational instruction. In a limited number of cases, grants are also given to encourage Indian pupils who have graduated from high school to proceed with professional courses, Law, Medicine, Nursing, etc.\n\nIt is my hope that I have supplied you with the information you desire. If I have failed or if you desire additional information, I want you to feel perfectly free to communicate with me again.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, February 10, 1938.\n\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nIn response to your request, I am enclosing herewith copy of letter sent forward by the Department to Reverend D.

I am now considering the recommendations which will be made to our Board next Spring regarding a number of such, and I should be glad if you would let me have your idea of the places where such change might be desirable in Schools where the United Church makes the nominations, so that I may have these before me and try to make adjustments and rearrangements in the interests of the work generally.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:BJ\n\nMiss M.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nI note that you are under the impression that Dr. Dorey misunderstood the date at which the increase was to be made in the per capita allowance to this School. This may well be so.\n\nWe are in receipt today of two cheques - one for $4500.00, with an accompanying memo, on which is noted, \"allowance for quarter ended March 31/38, Coqualeetza Res. School;\" and the other for $2500.00 for the Edmonton Residential School, with a similar notation. In view of the fact that the March quarter grant to the Coqualeetza School should be a little over $9,000, and the grant for the Edmonton School over $6,000, we cannot understand the marking of cheques for the smaller amounts as allowances for the quarter. They are in both cases probably intended as advances on the grants for the quarter, but I think I should draw your attention to the wording of the slip which accompanied the cheques, so that there may be no misunderstanding about the matter.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MT\n\n[Signature]\nStatement of payments made on the March quarter per capita allowance of the Indian Residential Schools conducted under the auspices of the United Church:\n\n(a) Full payment of the earnings for the March quarter, 1938, have been made to the following schools:\n\n1.

As a result it is not possible for us to pay the full quarter grant at all Indian Residential Schools. In the case of some schools we have paid the full grant for the quarter and in others we have only made a part payment. For your information I enclose a statement showing the payments made to schools conducted under your auspices. Balances due for the March quarter will be remitted as soon as additional funds are voted.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nRev. R. B.

A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nOctober 3rd,\n1938.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nYou will remember writing me on August 30th that the officer in charge of the Treaty payment trip had reported that the Indians of certain districts of Northern Manitoba had very little knowledge of English. I wrote to Dr. Cormie, our Superintendent, asking him to draw the attention of the school teachers to the situation, and at the same time I expressed the opinion that the children probably knew a little more English than they would be willing to admit to a stranger. I am, however, in receipt of the following from Dr. Cormie:\n\n\"The report which goes forward by today's mail may throw a little light on this whole problem. It is perfectly true as you say that some children know a little more English than they would be willing to admit to a stranger, but the conditions under which education is carried on on the reserves make it impossible to do very much in the way of teaching English or anything else. A small enrollment, the irregularity of attendance, the equipment in the schools, to say nothing of the attitude of the people generally toward the education of their children, all contribute to make satisfactory educational work difficult, if not impossible. In addition to all this, there is no reason why they should learn English as far as their social contacts go, since English is never used on the reserve.\n\n\"I will, of course, write to our teachers, though I know that they are doing the best they can.\"\n\nIn addition, Dr. Cormie asks us to draw your attention to the urgent need of doing something to meet the educational requirements of the Indians of the Island Lake reserve. There are about 150 children of school age for whose education there has been provided a dingy log building, with seats for 18 children. Dr. Cormie was good enough to send us a couple of photographs of the type of equipment in use in these schools, which I am sending to you. They are taken outside for the purpose of photography. I think that better seating facilities would indicate to the Indians that the Government was really\ninterested in their education.\n\nI know you have many problems and I hesitate to add to them, but there are some things that I think should be drawn to your attention. Someone, I think, described the ideal university as \"a log, with a student on one end and Mark Hopkins on the other.\" Well, here is a picture with four students alongside of it, but no Mark Hopkins. Dr. Comrie says this log was actually in use in one of the schools in Northern Manitoba that he visited.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, December 22, 1938.\n\nDear Dr. Dorey:\n\nI have been instructed by the Minister to send forward to you copy of a letter addressed by him to Reverend Dr. Westgate.\n\nThe subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

It is extremely interesting. The only concern I have is that the United Church Schools do not seem to be particularly well represented in this work. I hope that our teachers are co-operating as fully with your Department in this very important phase of the work as those of the other Churches.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD.MT\nMr. R. A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare and Training,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of March 3rd, which we have sent on to Dr. Cochrane, who is now in Vancouver.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGD:EWS\nThe Honorable T. A. Creer,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 11th,\n1939.\n\nMy dear Mr. Creer:\n\nIn further reference to your letter of February 21st and March 2nd, I should like to say that on a recent trip to British Columbia, I discussed in Vancouver with the representatives of the British Columbia Conference the suggestion of your Department that we might consent to the use of the Coqualeetza Indian Residential School as a sanatorium for active tuberculosis cases. I also had the privilege, along with our two Superintendents of Missions and Captain R. G. Scott, of meeting with Major MacKay and Captain Barrie, to discuss the same matter. Subsequently, the British Columbia Conference Home Mission Committee appointed a special sub-committee to consider your suggestion, and their report I submitted to the Board of Home Missions, which met the week before last.\n\nThe Board referred the whole matter to the Executive, and appointed a committee consisting of my colleagues and myself, Captain Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza School, and a representative of the Woman's Missionary Society, to meet with you and further discuss the matter. In the light of these facts, it would seem that the next step is to arrange a date, in the near future, when this committee could meet with you and other officials of your Department, to go into the matter further. There are a good many questions which have been asked by the British Columbia Committee which we shall have to discuss with you before our Board can give a definite answer to your proposal.\n\nIf you could give me two or three alternative dates when you could meet with us, we could get in touch with Captain Scott and see which one would suit him best. You will understand that before he can leave the School for even a few days, he will have to make a re-adjustment of duties among the members of the staff.\n\nAwaiting your reply, and with kindest regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nRBC.MT\n\n(Sgd.) R. B. Cochrane\nThe Honorable T. A. Creerar,\nMinister of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 12th,\n1939.\n\nDear Mr. Creerar:\n\nI have just had a telephone message from Mr. Hoey, asking if it would be possible for Dr. Cochrane and myself to meet you in Ottawa on Friday morning, next, April 14th. I understand that this is in reply to a letter, addressed by Dr. Cochrane to yourself yesterday. If you will refer to this letter again, I think you will find that Dr. Cochrane has made it clear that we shall find it necessary to have Captain Scott, Principal of the Coqualeetza Residential School, and a representative of the Women's Missionary Society as part of the Committee to meet with you and discuss the matter.\n\nYou will realize that it is quite impossible for us to get Captain Scott here on forty-eight hours' notice. I think that the earliest possible date at which Captain Scott could be here would be some time the week beginning April 23rd, provided a date during that week could be arranged when we could meet you. Would you give the matter further consideration and advise us by wire on what date and at what hour during that week it would suit your convenience to have us meet with you? We can then wire Captain Scott and try to have arrangements made for his coming East at that time.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(Sgd.) George Dorey\nMr. R. A. Hoey,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nApril 12th,\n1939.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nI beg to enclose copy of letter which I have sent today to the Minister on behalf of Dr. Cochrane and myself. For your information, I am also enclosing copy of the letter which Dr. Cochrane wrote on the 11th to Mr. Crearar, in response to which evidently Mr. Crearar arranged for the meeting on Friday.\n\nOn reading Dr. Cochrane's letter, you will see that it was definitely stated that we wanted Captain Scott to accompany us. I do not see how the Minister could have got the idea that we could get Captain Scott here for Friday, but, naturally, he is a busy man and like myself does not always read all through a letter.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nGD.MLT\n\nEnclos.

You know as an administrator how much even a few thousand dollars help in these days of economic stress and strain.\n\nAgain thanking you on behalf of the Committee,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\nR.B.

I should appreciate anything you can do to expedite payment of this amount.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nVery sincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nREV. ROBERT B. COCHRANE,\nSECRETARY\n\nREV.

This accounts for the delay in forwarding to you the amount due for the December quarter at Norway House. However, it is hoped that additional funds will be made available in the near future and arrangements will then be made to immediately forward you the amount due.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

However, apart from the annual reports, which go back to Confederation, we have no information in print or available in typewritten form. In your case, I have been wondering if you could not secure from Dr. Cochrane or Dr. Dorey all the information you may find necessary for the preparation of your address. I regret to state that the limited staff at my disposal here will simply not enable me to undertake a systematic search of the records for information regarding governmental or missionary effort in northern Manitoba.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

Corker in which he makes application for discharge from the Alert Bay Industrial School for the pupils mentioned therein namely Arthur Stanley, Fred Dixon, David Bernard, Willie Bob and Charles Peterson.\n\nDavid Bernard asks for a plot of land at Rivers Inlet and also that he be allowed to teach the school at Rivers Inlet. With regard to this request I may say that Rivers Inlet is not in this Agency but in the Bella Coola Agency, and I would not care to offer any recommendation as to what should apply in another Agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nSgn. W.M. Halliday\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nSecretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 27th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Agent Halliday, in which he states that David Bernard, who was recently discharged from the Alert Bay Industrial school, wishes to secure a plot of land at Rivers Inlet and also to teach the school at that place.\n\nKindly advise the Department with regard to Bernard's application for land at Rivers Inlet and also state whether you consider it would be advisable to open a school at this place.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nI. Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nSir:\n\nReferring to Departmental letter of 27th ultimo,\nI have the honor to state that the entire Indian population at River's Inlet is 109; of these about 15 are of school age.\n\nThere is no schoolbuilding or missionary at this place. The summer village of these Indians, where they stay most of the time and have their best houses, is close to salt water, but about a quarter of a mile below the Reserve, on land belonging to a salmon canning company. Here the Methodist Mission have secured the lease of a plot of ground. It seems that the school ought to be built at or near this place.\n\nExperience teaches that it would hardly be wise to leave an Indian graduate of an Industrial School, especially if he is a member of the same band, in complete charge of a school. Personally I have no knowledge of the applicant, David Bernard; he may be exceptionally fitted for the work.\n\nIf the Department is ready to build a school and pay a teacher, the Methodist Mission might be willing to supervise the school and keep a missionary here. The Indians here are in a primitive state, and have a poor reputation morally.\n\nWhen I hear from the Department again in this matter I might write to the Chairman of the Port Simpson District of the Methodist Church to find out what the mission would do.\nAll the land on the River's Inlet Reserve is held in common; no subdivisions have been made. Very little is under cultivation and the climate is humid. If David Bernard is a member of the band, I should not think the other members would object if a piece was set aside for him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Allen Halliday in July last wrote to the Department stating that a young Indian named David Bernard, who was educated at the Alert Bay Industrial School, applied to him for a plot of land at Rivers Inlet and also to be allowed to teach school there. As this reserve is in Mr. Fougner's agency the Department asked him for a report regarding this application and whether he considered it would be advisable to open a school there.\n\nMr. Fougner has sent in his reply, stating that the entire Indian population is 109 and that there are about 15 children of school age. There is no school or missionary there and the Indians do not live on the reserve all the year round, but have a summer village near there where the Methodist Mission have secured the lease of a plot of land. The Agent says that if a school were started it should be in this vicinity. He would not recommend a school being placed in charge of an Indian graduate of an industrial school and has no personal knowledge of the application.\nThese Indians are in a very primitive state and are shown in the census to be pagans. It appears that the Methodists contemplate starting a mission there. I think it would be well to wait and see whether the Methodists take up work there, when the question of establishing a school might be considered.\n\n[Signature]\nOttawa, October 22, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 5th instant reporting on the application of David Bernard, an ex-pupil of the Alert Bay Industrial School, who wished to secure a plot of land at Rivers Inlet and also to teach school at that place I beg to say that before any action is taken the Department will wait and see whether the Methodist take up work there when the question of establishing a school can be considered.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

You can put yourself as to where you put the school house.\n\nThe company however set off a site on which we would expect to build again.\n\nIt is close beside the place where they used to pull up their steamer immediately across the river from the mill.\n\nThe school house I suppose would be on the reserve, or is there any reserve there?\n\nGoods sent to the School may be addressed to Mr. Hazelwood.\nHe is the man I expect to send there.\n\nAnd any temporary provision be made for a room in which to hold school and for seats or desks?\n\nThey could be easily made right there, where there is plenty of lumber.\n\nI suppose we could also rent a room from some of the Indians until we could do some building.\n\nIf such a room be rented and seats made will you authorize the same.\n\nI would be glad if you see your way clear to authorize them that you order them made.\n\nIn any case let me know what action you take.\n\nKin regards to Mrs. Ferguson and \"Digwall.\"\n\nSincerely\n\nJ.G. Spencer\nBella Coola B.C.\nDecember 22, 1914.\n\nRev. J.C.Spencer,\nFort Simpson, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your letter of 30 ultimo, in which you state that you have engaged a teacher to begin work at River's Inlet on January 1st., I must say that it appears to me that this has been rather hasty. While I believe that the Department would be willing to establish a school at this place, and the gentleman named would be most acceptable for the position, nothing has yet been done to prepare the way; there must be a school-room with equipment, a boarding-place for the teacher etc. As to fixing a salary, setting equipment etc., an Agent has no authority to act; he can only recommend to the Department, and all this takes time. As far as expenditures go an Agent's scope is very circumscribed.\n\nI visited the place last week, and found all the Indians at the upper village on the lake. Here I saw David Bernard, a bright, cleanlooking young ex-pupil of Alert Bay. He was idle, and seemed almost lost amongst the rest of the Indians. I do not think he could be trusted to teach a school without supervision; but if it could be arranged that Mr. Hazelwood work as missionary and Bernard teach under his supervision, this would appeal to me. It may be impracticable at present.\n\nThe Department has received other correspondence on this subject, and I forward your letter; thus I shall be waiting for instructions from the Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\nBella Coola B.C.\n\nDecember 22, 1914.\n\nNO. 167799/I.\n\nSir:\n\nI have the honor to enclose a self-explanatory letter from Rev. J.C. Spender of Port Simpson, and copy of my reply to the same.\n\nIf the Department desires to authorize the opening of a school here at present, and send schoolmaterial, to Mr. Hazelwood at River's Inlet, I may state that the number of children of school age is about 15, practically all beginners.\n\nWaiting for instructions in the matter,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nThe question of establishing a school at Rivers Inlet was brought to the Department's notice last fall, when Mr. Agent Fougner was informed that before any action would be taken the Department would wait to see whether the Methodist Church takes up work there, when the establishment of a school could be considered.\n\nMr. Fougner encloses a letter addressed to him by Rev. J. C. Spencer of Port Simpson, in which he states that he has appointed a matriculant of Toronto University to open school there and he asks that some school supplies be sent. Mr. Fougner calls the Rev. Mr. Spencer's attention to the fact that nothing has been done to prepare the way; there is no school-room or equipment or boarding place for the teacher and no reference made to the salary. I think the Department should have this information before authorizing the opening of the school.\n\nIt seems to me that Mr. Spencer has taken too much upon himself in making this appointment without consulting\nsulting the Agent or the Department and I think it would be well to call Mr. Ferrier's attention to this matter and request him to inform Mr. Spencer that, while the Department is prepared to receive his nominations, before a school can be opened or the appointment of a teacher made the sanction of the Department must be obtained.\n\nArthur Spencer\nOttawa, January 13, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 22nd ultimo enclosing a letter from the Rev. J. G. Spencer of Fort Simpson and a copy of your reply in regard to the establishment of a school at River's Inlet.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that before a school can be recognized there the Department will require the information asked for in your letter to Mr. Spencer. I may also inform you that, while the Department is prepared to receive nominations from him of teachers for schools conducted under the auspices of the Methodist Church in British Columbia, the sanction of the Department must be obtained before a school is opened or an appointment made and the Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, will be requested to inform Mr. Spencer accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McTavish\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nIver Fougner, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola, B.C.\nOttawa, January 13, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI beg to inform you that the question of establishing a school at River's Inlet was brought to the notice of the Department last fall and our Agent at Bella Coola was informed that the Department would wait and see whether your church took up work there, when the question of establishing a school would be considered.\n\nMr. Agent Fougner has now sent the Department a letter received by him from the Rev. Mr. Spencer of Fort Simpson advising him of the engagement of a teacher to begin work at River's Inlet on the 1st instant and asking to be furnished with a supply of school material. Mr. Fougner in replying to Mr. Spencer stated that, while he believed the Department would be willing to establish a school at this place and the gentleman named acceptable for the position, nothing has been done to prepare the way; there must be a school-room with equipment, a boarding place for the teacher and a fixed salary decided on, etc. He also said that he as Agent had no authority to act and that all he could do was to make a recommendation to the Department and that all this would take time.\n\nIn the first communication it was suggested that David Bernard, an ex-pupil of the Alert Bay Industrial School, be placed in charge, if it were desired to carry on a school at\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nat River's Inlet. Mr. Fougner states that he visited that place lately and found all the Indians at the upper village and saw Bernard, the ex-pupil referred to, who seemed almost lost among the rest of the Indians. Mr. Fougner does not consider that he could be trusted to teach the school without supervision, but, if it could be arranged that Mr. Hazelwood work as missionary and Bernard teach under his supervision, this would appeal to him, but says that this may be impracticable at present.\n\nI draw your attention to Mr. Spencer's action in this matter, as the Department considers that the appointment should not have been made until the information asked for by Mr. Fougner was furnished.\n\nI shall be glad if you would request Mr. Spencer in future to consult with you when the matter might be brought to the attention of the Department and authority obtained before schools are opened or teachers appointed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nReferring to letter of I3 ulyimo, I have the honor to say that I visited River's Inlet the latter part of January. Mr. Hazlewood had arrived and secured a room for teaching in; he is a carpenter, and had made desks etc. himself.\n\nHe had had a few pupils but the Indians were yet at the upper village; thus the school was not in operation at the time of my visit. The teacher had bought and paid for schoolmaterial for $4.38, and has sent the bill to this office.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 5, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nReferring to official letter of the 13th of January, last, in regard to the establishment of a school at River's Inlet and the appointment of a teacher there I beg to say that the Department is informed that Mr. Hazlewood has arrived and intends carrying on a school there. It appears that he has secured a room to teach in and has made desks himself and has purchased a small amount of school material.\n\nThe Department has not yet recognized this school and before doing so it would like to know what arrangements were made with Mr. Hazlewood as to salary. The Department would be pleased to have this information at as early a date as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Wilson\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nCupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo The Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\n\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nReplying to yours of March 5th, #167799/1, re Mr. Hazelton at Rivers Inlet, when I was out in B. C. I made enquiries concerning his work and find that he has been engaged in the mission work and teaching for the last twenty years. We have never asked the Government for any assistance and the school has never been on the list.\n\nOn the removal of Mr. Raley from Port Simpson to take the principalship of the Ceqaleetza Institute, Dr. Spencer was appointed as the Chairman of the Port Simpson District and it was he who engaged Mr. Hazelwood to take up the work, and instructed him to open the school. I have made certain enquiries and believe that as a Church we should continue the work. There are other people besides Indians there. I pointed out to Mr. Spencer that unless there were Indians to warrant the appointment we could not appeal to the Government to pay the salary of the teacher who might be engaged in teaching other children, but he assured me that there were fifteen or sixteen Indian children of school age and it was these that Mr. Hazelwood was working with. If this is in harmony with facts\nDepartment of Indian Affairs, (2)\n\nI would like the Department to recognize Mr. Hazeltwood as a teacher at that point at a salary of $600.00 per year.\n\nI will write Mr. Hazeltwood and ask him to give me a report of his work and the number of Indian children attending his school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT. Ferrier\n\nM.C.B./ T.F.\nOttawa, April 13, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the establishment of a school at Rivers Inlet and the appointment of Mr. Hazelwood as teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to ask you to be good enough to bring this matter to the attention of the Department when you are in Ottawa this month.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Perrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, April 28, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn further reference to your application for the recognition of a school at River's Inlet to be conducted under the auspices of your church I beg to say that the Department will await the report, which you state you have asked Mr. Hazelwood, who has been sent in there as teacher, to make.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nJ.

Sir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 28th of April last, in reference to your application for the recognition of a school at River's Inlet in which you were informed that the Department would await the receipt of the report you stated you had asked Mr. Hazelwood to make. The Department would like to have this report as soon as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nTo The\nSecretary of the Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Can.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReplying to yours of July 29th, #167799-1, re the recognition of a school at Rivers Inlet, B.C., I have been unable to secure sufficient data that would warrant me in recommending that a school be established at that point. There are sufficient children there during the fishing season and also at Christmas time for a short time, but for the other portion of the year they scatter to logging camps, berry-picking, hop-picking, etc. I do not think that sufficient could be gathered to keep the school going. There are a number there during the fishing season from different points on the West coast. At present I am not prepared to recommend that a school be opened at Rivers Inlet.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nT.F./M.G.B.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSCHOOLS BRANCH\n\nSEP 11 1915\nOttawa, September 14, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant in further reference to the recognition of a school at Rivers Inlet, B.C.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided not to establish a school at this point and if Mr. Haslewood has been carrying on a school there it should be closed at once. If there is any money due Mr. Hazlewood for his services as teacher he will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nOttawa, September 14th, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn further reference to the question of the recognition of a school at River's Inlet I beg to say that, in view of a report received from Rev. Mr. Ferrier, Superintendent of Methodist Indian Schools, the Department has decided not to establish a school at this point. Mr. Ferrier has been informed accordingly and also that, if Mr. Hazlewood has been carrying on a school there, it should be closed at once. If there is any money due Mr. Hazlewood for his services as teacher he will be paid upon receipt of a return forwarded through your office showing the number of days the school was in operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Also they paid $25 for lumber that provided him with seats for the school. The total is $175. If a check is sent to the Mission Rooms, as per your offer, you will greatly oblige,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nJ. Ferrier\n\nT.F./ M.O.E.\nOttawa, October 12, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo stating that the Mission Rooms paid $150.00 for the support of Mr. Hazlewood while at Rivers Inlet and $25.00 for lumber.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Mr. Agent Fougner was informed that if there is any money due Mr. Hazlewood for his services as teacher he will be paid upon receipt of a return forwarded through the Agent's office showing the number of days the school was in operation. Until this return is received the Department is not in a position to make any payment for Mr. Hazlewood's services.\n\nIf you will forward receipts for the $25.00 expended for lumber for seats for the school this amount will be paid.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Methodist Indian Schools,\nBrandon, Man.\nSir:\n\nReferring to letter of 14 ultimo, I have the honor to report that Mr. Hazlewood taught for a short time at River's Inlet; but he sent no reports to this office, and did not notify me when he left. His present address is unknown to me.\n\nOn March 22 this year, I sent the Department vouchers No. 512 for $21.15 in favor of the B.C. Canning Co. Ltd.; and 513 for $4.38 in favor of Mr. Hazlewood. These were to pay expenses incurred in putting the school room in order.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that at the head of Rivers Inlet lives the Gwekano Indians, 37 in number, on the Katit reserve. Year ago the Methodist Church had a Missionary at this place. The Mission house and Church burned down, and the work was discontinued.\n\nNow I have a letter from Rev. D.S. Osterhout, Superintendent of Indian Missions of the United Church, saying that the Church intend to place a missionary-teacher here, asking the Department to grant salary to the teacher, etc. The number of children below 16 years of age is 26, some of these being at the residential school at Alert Bay. It would be well if a good white man could be placed here, as the Indians are somewhat demoralized.\n\nThere is no village on this reserve. The old one consisting of smoke-houses burned down a year ago, and the Indians now generally live in houses below the reserve belonging to the B.C. Packers Ltd., The Pacific Mills Ltd., have bought the timber, and proceeds of this sale coming to the Indians should be ample to build a new modern village, if they were so minded. This is Katit reserve No. 1.\n\nUntil the site of a new village is located, and assurance obtained of one being built, it is not thought advisable to build a school house. It may be possible to rent a suitable building from the British Columbia Packers Ltd. The Church is anxious to get the work started with the least possible delay; and the main consideration for the Department would be the ability to grant teacher's salary.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nThe Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, October 7, 1935.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, regarding the establishment of a day school at Rivers Inlet and requesting that a grant be provided towards payment of the salary of a missionary teacher.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will have no funds during the current fiscal year to provide the cost of fitting up a classroom or for payment of teacher's salary. You might, however, study the situation at this point, ascertain if it would be possible to rent a suitable building for classroom purposes and also if the Indians will be residing there permanently. You should then advise the Department as fully as possible regarding the prospect, if a school is established, of making it a success. In any event, the Department would not be prepared to erect a building for school purposes until the Indians become permanently located on the site of a new village.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nI. Fougnier, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nBella Coola,\nB. C.\nMay 30, 1936.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMR. MACKENZIE,\n\nWith reference to the letter hereunder, from Agent Gillett, regarding the offer of the minister, Department of Fisheries to hand over the hatchery building at Rivers Inlet for school purposes, I would say that no funds have been provided to establish a school at this point. A request was made by the authorities of the United Church, in September, 1935, for a grant towards the salary of a teacher. The church authorities stated they intended to place a missionary teacher at Rivers Inlet.\n\nUntil the site of a new village is located, it is not thought advisable to build a school house. The old village, consisting of smoke houses, was burned down about two years ago and the Indians now live in houses below the reserve (Katit Reserve No. 1), belonging to the B.C. Packers Limited. Should a school be established, the church authorities would arrange for a building and this Department would only be called upon for teacher's salary and incidental expenses. We would not require the material in the hatchery building in erecting a school and teacher's residence.\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere has been consideration correspondence between our Board in Toronto and your Department at Ottawa and the Indian Agent at Alert Bay, Mr. Todd, concerning the little Reserve at Takush, B.C., where there are less than 50 Indian men, women and children and where there are insufficient children to make possible anything like a respectable school.\n\nTwo other small tribes have been mentioned with which the Takush tribe might be persuaded to amalgamate, namely, Blunden Harbour and River's Inlet - the latter familiarly known as the O-wee-kee-no tribe. Their old village of smoke houses was burned down a few years ago completely, and I have heard that there is a possibility that a fine stand of spruce timber on the Katit Reserve which belongs to the O-wee-kee-no people may be sold to the Pacific Mills Co., for the considerable sum and that the proceeds might be used for the construction of a new village, more modern and better placed than the old village on the river bank.\n\nIn my opinion, if the Takush people could be persuaded by Mr. Todd to move to that location, it would be much more desirable than to Blunden Harbour, and it might be possible that when arrangements are made for the building of the new village, perhaps by the Pacific Mills Co., that a small school might be erected with accommodation for 20 or 25 children and for a missionary-teacher at the same time. The Methodist Church, now merged in the United Church of Canada, had to my knowledge a mission among these people at the head of River's Inlet over forty years ago and we should be very happy to co-operate in any possible way if conditions are so improved as to make possible some missionary and educational work among them again.\n\nI enclose you herewith three pictures - one illustrating the destruction of the old town by fire and the other one of the buildings, also burned down, in which some of the tribesmen lived a few years ago. The third picture shows a number of the O-wee-kee-no people at the head of the inlet with old Capt. Oliver and one of his helpers sitting in the centre of the group. Unless something is done for these people at an early date the destruction of disease\nand intemperance will have finished its work.\n\nI shall be glad to have these snaps returned as I wish to use them when I proceed to Toronto the latter part of this month.\n\nWith very kind regards,\n\nI remain,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSSO/AM\nEncs.3\nVancouver, B.C.,\nP.O.Box 8, March 10, 1938.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am attaching a letter received from the Rev. S.S. Osterhout, Superintendent of United Church Indian Missions, in which he suggests the erection of a small school, to accommodate some 25 children, with living quarters for an unmarried male teacher. Should the Department favourably consider this request, the materials for the construction of the school could be obtained from the Pacific Mills Company and the work carried out by the Indians under the same white supervision in a more economical manner than if the provision of such a school were left to a later date.\n\nI have discussed this matter with Inspector Barry and we are of the opinion that in the event of a successful establishment of an Indian village on the Katit Reserve, a small school, with additional accommodation for a single male teacher, would undoubtedly become necessary. The cost of erection of such a school, which has not been provided for by the Indian Agent and which would probably not exceed $1000.00, might possibly be included in the Supplementary Estimates.\n\nW. E. Collison,\nFor. D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to that portion of your letter of the 10th instant which reported on the letter received from Reverend S. S. Osterhout regarding the erection of a new Indian Day School on the Katit Reserve.\n\nOur estimates for the fiscal year 1938-39 are now before Parliament and I therefore regret that it is not possible to include any additional expenditure for the erection of Indian Day Schools. The matter will be kept in mind and, in the event of the successful establishment of an Indian village on the Katit Reserve between now and the end of the year, favourable consideration will be given to including in our estimates for the fiscal year 1939-40 the amount that would be required to erect a Day School.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

A.\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, 15th November, 1910.\n\nMr. D.C. Scott,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nVery Reverend F.M. Bunoz, O.M.I., is perfect Apostolic of the Yukon. His residence is Prince Rupert. His jurisdiction extends from the 54th Parallel northward west of the mountains on the mainland, but includes Queen Charlotte Islands and Fort George. This is his diocese. He is not a bishop, but may be addressed as such.\n\nRegarding Indian schools in his diocese.\n\nThere is a building at Stewart Lake almost ready to open. He is inclined to open it if the amount contained in this year's estimates for Atlin School and the Babine could be applied to the support of the Stewart Lake. I have told him that we could switch the grant to the Atlin School and the grant for salaries and support of the Babine Schools, but could not switch the amount for the Babine School building. That next year we might give him a larger grant but I am not favourable to establishing a school at Stewart Lake permanently. He himself is favourable to the permanent establishment of a school in his diocese at Fraser Lake on the line of the Grand Trunk Pacific. He will write his decision to build the Babine school or switch the grant to Stewart Lake when he returns to Prince Rupert. Hold the matter in the meantime.\n\nF.O.\nOttawa, March 22, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in further reference to the establishment of day schools in your Agency.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that this matter has been the subject of correspondence between the Department and the Rev. Father Bunoz, Prefect Apostolic of the Yukon. Pending a decision regarding the payment of a grant for a boarding school at Stuart Lake the Department is not prepared to go any further at present with the erection of day school buildings. Your letter and recommendation will, however, be kept in mind. In any event I may say that there are not funds available for building this year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nV. J. McAllen, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFraser Lake, B.C.\nAnnunciation Church,\nPrince Rupert, Canada.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Aug. 7th. 1913.\n\nMr. J.D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nIndian Department, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your communication of July 24th ult., I must say that I regret very much that long delay with regard to the erection of the Fraser Lake Indian school but I suppose the Department can't help it under prevailing circumstances; Remember, however, that the railway is getting close to Fraser Lake now and it will reach that place next summer.\n\nDuring the meantime and providing it would not cause unnecessary delay in the erection of the boarding school due the Indians by specific contract, I would be very glad to see day schools established at Babine, Stewart's Lake and Hagwelget. These are three important places especially Babine and Stewart's Lake where you could find houses to rent, which could do for temporary dayschools. The salary of the teachers however must be up to the standard of the district. Here at Prince Rupert the Lady Teachers are getting $100.00 a month. I don't think that any competent person would accept to work in earnest for Indian children for less than the above amount. I hope, therefore, the Department will understand the importance of paying decent salaries in order to secure immediate and good work in the schools to be established. I may add in concluding, that all the Indians of that region are clamoring for schools, they want to read and write and the new white settlers show amazement at the fact, the Indians have no schools up to the present date.\n\nVery respectfully,\n\nE.M. BUNOZ, O.M.I. P.a.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, August 26, 1913.\n\nRev. Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th instant in further reference to the opening of temporary day schools at Babine, Stuart's Lake and Hagwelget.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if there are temporary buildings available at Babine and Stuart's Lake the Department is prepared to make a grant for the teachers' salaries and also to supply the necessary school material. However, the salary mentioned by you $100. a month, is more than the Department pays at any point in British Columbia. As to the salaries, much would depend upon the qualifications. Presumably it would be almost impossible to get teachers with proper professional qualifications for these inland districts, but it may be possible for you to nominate teachers, who, if they have not the professional qualifications may nevertheless be competent to conduct the work at these day schools.\n\nWith regard to Hagwelget, a school was conducted at Roche Deboule, but was closed sometime ago owing to the fact that the Rev. Father Godfrey's time was so taken up with his Mission work that he found it impossible to give any attention to the day school. Father Godfrey informed the Inspector that he hoped to obtain an assistant and Mr. Green was then advised that in this event the Department would be pleased to have this school re-opened.\n\nThe Department will take up in the meantime, with the respective Indian Agents, the question of securing temporary buildings.\n\nRev. E.M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nAnnunciation Church,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, August 27, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from the Rev. E. M. Bunoz of Prince Rupert in which he asks for the temporary establishment of Roman Catholic day schools at several places, among others at Stuart's Lake in your agency. He states that a building might be secured for school purposes and I would ask you to report fully to the Department on this after ascertaining whether such a building is available and what rent would be expected. You should consult with the resident Roman Catholic missionary in regard to this matter and give it your prompt attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nWm. McAllen, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFraser Lake, B.C.\nReferring to Dept's letter of Aug 27, 1918, dealing with the temporary establishment of a day school at Stuart Lake, I beg to report that I had a conversation with Rev. Father Corcela O.M.I. over the telephone line yesterday with regard to this matter. He informed me that a building was available for this purpose, the rent would be $15 per month, but the Dept would be expected to furnish seats, desks & stove.\n\nI am having Rev. Corcela furnish me with a written statement giving size of building, number of children it will accommodate, seats, desks & stove required to furnish same. I should have this in two weeks' time, when the information will be at once forwarded to Dept.\n\nI have etc.,\nyour obedient servant,\nWilliam J.

Father Crocota, O.M.I., in charge of the mission there and he has given me the following information for the Dept., namely\u2014\n\nSize of building\u201416 x 28 which would leave, after deducting 2 rooms 9 x 14 each for teacher, one large room 20 x 20 for school room.\n\nIn this room 10 desks, 2 pews each 8 feet long and seating 4 pupils to the desk could be arranged, also teacher's desk & table.\n\nThe Dept. would be requested to do all the furnishing which would mean to construct 10 pews, 2 desks & seats, each 8 feet long for which lumber would have to be shipped and hand dressed costing $2 per foot, also to furnish, 1 large heater for school room, 1 small desk for teacher's room, 1 small cot & stove for teacher, 2 chairs & 1 desk & table for school room.\n\nThe Department's architect could determine the type of desks & pews to be used and the cost of same, carpenter wages being...\nSir,\n\nseven dollars per day here. Large tables would cost about $80 each; small ones $12 each.\n\nThe building I should have stated is the property of the Roman Catholic Mission, and Father Cossota states to me that if the Department so desires he could personally arrange for the installation of the table, at the prices above quoted. The other material alone etc. could be locally purchased.\n\nIf the Dept desire Mr. Father Cossota or myself to have the furniture done along the lines above stated, plans and specifications of table, desks etc. should be forwarded by Dept.\n\nI shall be glad to furnish any further information necessary.\n\nI have the\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.

A sketch showing the combination seat and desk is enclosed herewith. This is drawn to a scale and the desks can be made by any ordinary carpenter. The teacher's desk or table might be made at the same time and you may purchase a stove for the school-room, a small stove for the teacher's room, as well as a cook stove for his use and two chairs.

About that time these people took up pre-emption and are not now connected with the reserve in any way except perhaps owning a little land until they get their own lands in shape, when I expect they will support themselves entirely on their pre-emption.\n\nThe Dept has issued instructions for the opening of a temporary Indian day school at Stuart Lake. There is no Provincial school at this point. Can I allow the children of the above mentioned half-breeds to attend this Indian school? I may state that there is sufficient number of Indian children to fill school. Kindly advise.\n\nJ. J. McLean Esq.\nActing Chief\nDept of Ind Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nI have the\nhonour to be,\nJ. J.

Father Coccolia O.M.I., stating that the school opened with an attendance of 32 children; but both gentlemen state that adult Indians are leaving reserve to follow their hunting and other avocations and are compelled by shortness of food supply to take their children with them.\n\nFather Coccolia states that on a former occasion when discussing school matters with the Dept. and in respect to Indians similarly situated, he had been informed that in cases of this kind the Dept. would be willing to provide food to a certain extent, for the children.\n\nI would be very glad if Dept. could now see their way clear to do so, as without assistance of this nature there is no doubt that attendance will be very poor.\n\nFather Coccolia suggests soup, to be given, say twice a day. Soup has the merit of being easy to prepare, it would also be cheap and wholesome.\n\nI might say the Indians at Stuart Lake are so situated that they have often to leave home for long periods, hunting and fishing. Comparatively few remain constantly on the reserves. Dept. will realise it is next to impossible to maintain anything like a decent school attendance under these circumstances.\n\nI would respectfully request Dept.'s earnest consideration of above.\n\nI have etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

The difference is very noticeable.\n\nI regret to say that under such consideration my stay here cannot be very long, as such salary will scarcely cover expenses with Flour at $10.00 a hundred, Sugar $16.00, Coal-oil $0.50 a quart, &c...\n\nHoping you will take this into consideration,\n\nI remain respectfully yours,\n\nJ.

Clan Esq.\nIndian Agent\nFort Fraser B.C.\n\nSir:\n\nTo-day I received a letter of H. Father Wolfe. In this letter he announces me that my salary will probably start with the 1st of August and that there will be a raise of salary. It seems to say these two tidings are very welcome, and I will do my best to make this school a success.\n\nIn re-arranging the correspondence between you and Mr. Van Dyk I see that the teacher's salary is paid quarterly, so that the 30th of September will be next pay-day. If it is the same to you, would you please be so kind and send my salary to me? As, on account of the nearly total failure of crops in my district (Chilcotin, Alberta) I could not collect the wages due me by different farmers, and so I had no money to take her with me. If you send the money to me, I will have to sign the check first and then send it to her; and where the mail goes only twice a month from here and the mail route to my post-office in the Chilcotin district is not very well arranged, it might take another month before she can come and it would be too cold then to travel those forty miles between Vanderhoof and Fat H. James. Moreover, if my wife were here, I could do several things I am planning.\nin connection with the school and of which I will talk below.\n\nMy family will need only 50 dollar for railway expenses; about 33 dollar from Macleod to Vanderhoof for my wife and about 17 dollar for a half fare ticket for my oldest daughter; the other two go free. I send my wife my last ten-dollar bill for travelling expenses on the road, as food, one might say in Calgary etc. If it is not too much trouble to write the check for my salary on my wife's name, I will be very much obliged to you. Her address is:\n\nMr. A. K. J. Okon Ochoniy\nAlderville (Macleod District)\nAlberta\n\nI am planning the following things for the school:\nAs soon as my wife is here and takes over the cooking, I will start a second school in the evening for the adults. Several adults want to come to school and I think it will be best to make two schools, one for the smaller boys and girls, those who come to school now, and the (probably evening) school for the grown-ups, big boys and girls and grown-up people. I have been inquiring and I think I can count on a floating number of between 20 and 30, sometimes over 30, as in the two months of December and January. There is some Indians who have big children at school now and who want to come themselves. Will keenly they are and better they will learn.\n\nI intend moreover to start a separate class of music for all there (above 10 years old) who have good voices and like music, this class to be held probably on Saturday morning.\nIt will not be necessary to say that, if I intend to do these things, it is with the implied condition that you approve of these plans. I know that these plans are far-reaching, but nine years of teaching in the Old Country (4 at a public school and 5 at a boarding school) gave me a liking for teaching and I want to honor the position I accepted.\n\nI enclose herewith a requisition for 3 dozen of lead-pencils for the grown-up school; I do not intend to let them work with ink, as I want to be practical before everything and most of the Indians do not carry fountain-pens, but most of them have or can get a pencil and so it will be better to let them get handy with pencils. There are lots of blank drawing-books left and I will make lines on these and let them use these as scrubbers.\n\nOf course, I can not start any of these things before my wife is here. The reason I would like you to send my whole salary is because things are so much cheaper in Mackled than here and she can buy what she needs for her and the children and ship it up here.\n\nI am still doing the cooking and intend to keep it up until my wife comes. It takes lots of time, of course. For instance, to cook the beans well, I have to start cooking them at about 7 o'clock in the morning, after they have been soaking in water overnight. The meal of the children consists of a plateful of soup (rice-soup one day, bean-soup the other), a cup of tea and two crackers. You see there is not much variety in the menu, but my wife will do both\nbetter, of course. The cost per child per day until now has been about 5 cents, for these three weeks. Next mail I shall send the bills in duplicate, as requested.\n\nEnclosed please find the attendance report for these three weeks. I do this because I have seen in your letter of the 21st of July to Mr. Van Dyl that \"monthly reports have to accompany quarterly requisition for salary\" and I would like to have my family here as soon as possible, on account of the cold weather next month (the long drive through the cold for my children) my planned evening school and the cooking (not forgetting I feel very lonesome without my wife and children) and I can not get them here before I touch my salary.\n\nIn the hope you will grant me the favor I asked,\n\nI remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMr. Oka Ochonig\nTeacher\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit herewith voucher for salary of teacher of Stuart Lake Indian school for last two months of the quarter ended Sept. 30th, the former teacher's salary for July is already paid.\n\nIf Dept. accedes to Mr Ockony's request to send cheque to his wife it would be almost necessary to make the cheque out in her name or payable to her.

A supply of forms is being sent you, which you will be good enough to give to the teacher and request him to prepare a return giving the names of the pupils, days attendance and all particulars as called for by the return and forward it to the Department as soon as possible.\n\nI have also to request that you will be good enough to inform the Department as to the qualifications of Mr. Ockoniy and also his nationality. In the meantime his appointment as teacher of this school is approved temporarily.\n\nThe teacher states in his letter that he has forwarded you a requisition for lead pencils. This has not yet\n\nW. J. McAllan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\nif yet reached the Department and you have it in your possession you should forward it at once so that the supplies asked for can be sent.\n\nYour early attention to the above is desired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS. STEWART\n\nAssistant Secretary.\nSir:\n\nI have the honour to submit for your consideration the attached letter from Mr. Ockoniy, teacher of the Indian School at Stuart Lake asking for a monthly remuneration for his wife who is now doing the cooking for the Indian Children.\n\nIn your letter of May 23rd, No.285,754-1, permission was granted to supply a little food to the children. This procedure has resulted in the school being a great success, an average attendance of about 30 children is maintained. Now the preparing of the food entails a lot of time and hard work and can not very well be attended to by the teacher, I had an idea that some of the older children could perhaps be got to assist but when I visited the school on the 11th inst. I realized that any arrangement of that kind was not feasible. Under these circumstances I would strongly recommend the Dept. to agree to the method at present in operation and concede the remuneration asked for on behalf of Mrs. Ockoniy. Any further information required in the matter I will gladly furnish.\n\nI have etc.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Dep. and Secy.,\nDept. of Ind.

You know how much extra work this means. This is the reason why I would like to ask for a remuneration for this work. I think a monthly sum of fifteen dollars would be a fair pay for this extra work.\n\nHoping you will see fit to grant this request, I remain,\n\nSir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nH.M.

Mr. Ockoniy seems to have a genuine love for teaching and the children are making good progress. He is sending me his certificates etc. which I will at once forward to Dept. for examination.

Mr. Ockoniy will be paid quarterly and you should include her salary on the requisition for the teacher's salary which is sent in at the end of each quarter.\n\nIn reply to your other letter of the 19th instant I beg to say that Mr. Ockoniy's qualifications are satisfactory.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I went to teach German and Latin to the \"first year\" at the boarding-school to which I was attached before coming to Canada. This was a separate school, reason why my certificates were high enough as the separate schools have lots of advantages in legislation in Holland.\n\nI was conductor of a band of 20 men for about 8 years and conducted a choir (not a church-choir) for about 4 years.\n\nTo regard my signature, you will have noticed that I signed all my certificates with my first name only.

About 30 children were present and this average is steadily maintained. The brighter children are making good progress and the teacher Mr. Okon Ockony is entirely at home in the work. I also saw the children fed a meal of thick bean soup with pilot bread and a cup of tea which they certainly appreciated. Mrs. Ockony prepares and serves the meals which entails a lot of labour and a remuneration was asked for. I undertook to recommend same few sanction of the Department.\nSir:-\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter (registered) of Jan. 18, NO285954/1, returning Mr. Okon Ockoniy's Certificates also copy of your official letter dated Nov. 4, the original not having reached me.\n\nI beg to state I am writing Mr. Okoniy today to endeavour to have these returns sent in on the proper forms. These will be forwarded as soon as received.\n\nThe reason the requisition for lead pencils was not at once submitted to Dept. was because the request was simply made me in a general way in a letter and I had to return it to the teacher to be put in a more definite way. Kindly turn up the requisition sent by me on Dec. 19 and you will find it dated at Stuart Lake on Nov. 30 and as the mail from that point is sometimes once a week and sometimes once a fortnight the delay is easily understood. My recollection of the matter is that the requisition went forward without undue delay on my part.\n\nTrusting this explanation is satisfactory.\n\nI have etc.\n\nJ.D.

You should also state whether the school is in operation during the summer months, and the Department desires to ascertain fully the nature of the work performed by Mrs. Ockony on behalf of the Indians.\n\nOn certain reserves the Department employs women in the capacity of Field Matrons. Their duties consist in cooking meals for school children and also in making house to house visitation with a view to instructing the Indians generally, in domestic arts and in the care of young children etc. It is desired to learn whether Mrs. Ockony has done any work of this nature. You should ascertain whether the Indians have applied for aid or instruction in the case of illness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW.J. McAllan Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to your letter of 15th ult., re. Mrs. Ockonly's duties at the Stuart Lake Indian School, I beg to report that up to the present one meal per day only has been cooked. This consists of rice or bean soup with bacon and bread. It is given in the middle of the day and so far has been found sufficient.\n\nThe school is closed for six weeks in Summer reopening towards the end of August.\n\nMrs. Ockonly has recently started a sewing and knitting class among the girls. I am informed that she often visits the sick children and is well qualified for the duties of Field Matron. However, I am of the opinion that before she could be expected to perform the duties pertaining to this office regularly she should receive some increase in salary. Kindly advise if this could be arranged for and what additional amount the Dept. would be agreeable to pay Mrs. Ockonly for these services.\n\nI would be pleased also if you would kindly advise me if the closing of the school for six weeks in Summer affects the salary of the teacher or the matron.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Dep. and Secy.,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, 14th September, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th ultimo, I beg to say that you have failed to inform the Department whether you consider it advisable to have a field matron appointed for the Stuart Lake Reserve. You state that Mrs. Ockony is qualified for the work, but you have failed to state whether there is much work of the kind to be done. I may say that if Mrs. Ockony were appointed for this work, she will probably be allowed $10.00 or $15.00 a month, in addition to the allowance of $15.00 already made her for cooking meals for the children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. McAllan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\nSir,\n\nReferring to your letter of the 14th inst. No.285,754-1 re. the advisability of having a field matron appointed for working among the Indians of Stuart Lake, I beg to say there is certainly a good field for the activities of one. Not having a doctor within 40 miles there are often cases of sickness to be attended to. A sewing and knitting class is now started and much good would result from regular house to house visitations with instructions in cooking general domestic economy, cleanliness etc.\n\nAs mentioned in my letter of the 15th ult. Mrs. Ockoniy is well qualified for this particular work, as in addition to possessing the technical knowledge she has that rare gift of personal interest or sympathy in such work and I have the utmost confidence in recommending her for this position. Would suggest $15.00 would be satisfactory remuneration per month for this work.\n\nIf Dept. decides to appoint Mrs. Ockoniy kindly advise if her salary as Matron is to be requisitioned on the regular monthly pay roll or otherwise.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInd. Agt.\nOttawa, October 6th., 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nIn view of the report contained in your letter of the 24th ultimo, I beg to say that the Department hereby appoints Mrs. Ockoniy as Field Matron for the Indians of the Stuart Lake Reserve. Under the terms of this appointment it will be her duty to make house to house visits and care for the Indians. She should also instruct the women and young girls in useful household arts and impress upon them the absolute necessity of keeping their houses clean. She should also give instructions in the proper care of children and teach the women and girls to sew in order that they may learn to make clothes for themselves and their children. Printed rules of instructions to field matrons have been prepared and a copy is enclosed herewith as a guide to Mrs. Ockoniy in her work. The Department will allow her a salary of $10.00 a month for the duties in question. It is considered that this is a fair allowance in view of the fact that she is already paid $15.00 a month for cooking one meal a day for the school children. If at the end of six months it can be shown that good results have followed upon the work done by Mrs. Ockoniy as field-matron, the Department will consider paying her at the rate of $15.00 a month for this work.\n\nYou may furnish Mrs. Ockoniy with a supply of simple drugs for use on behalf of Indians, the account for which may be submitted to the Department for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLeod\n\nW. J. McAllan Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Oct 6 No 285,754-1 with circular, informing me of the appointment of Mrs Ockoniy as Field Matron for Indians of the Stuart Lake Reserve at a salary of ten dollars per month for these duties. I may state Mrs Ockoniy has been conducting a sewing class since the re-opening of the School in August and I will requisition salary for her on the monthly pay roll at above rate commencing Oct 1st. I will see to it that she is thoroughly advised as to her duties.\n\nAbout a supply of simple drugs for her work I would say that I will be at Stuart Lake in the very near future and if the supply sent in some time ago to Rev. Father Coccolia, who resides close by is not available I will furnish Mrs. Ockoniy with a small list as directed.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst.

Her salary for these two services will be paid monthly upon receipt of properly certified vouchers from you. Her salary as matron has been paid till November 30th, last, and for cook to September 30th, last. At the end of this month you should forward a voucher for one month's salary as matron and three month's salary as cook and in future you can combine the salaries for both services in the one voucher at the end of each month, stating on the voucher that the payment is for her services as matron and cook.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Agt.\nReport of the Indian School Garden at Small Lake B.C.\n\nThis garden was composed of three patches, each patch in a different soil:\n\na) Pure clay, worked three times, once with the plow, two times with the spade; last year, 1915.\n\nb) About 4 inches of leaf-mould, mixed with about 4 inches of clay. This ground was broken in the spring of 1915, put in clover without manure, plowed again last spring and pulverized with the hoe.\n\nc) About 8 inches of leaf-mould, with very little sand. This ground was worked two times with the spade in 1915.\n\nIn a) were sown: peas, onions, parsley and beans. Everything came up fine, but owing to the dry weather the onions died off. The beans did very well, but were killed by night-frost. The parsley was good. The peas did very well and gave an abundant crop.\n\nIn b) were sown: peas, parsnip, kale, cabbage, onions, sage, cress, carrots, squash and radishes. The squash was killed by the night-frost, but the other vegetables did very well, excepted the cabbage, and gave excellent results.\n\nIn c) were sown: carrots, beets, turnips, onions and lettuce. This piece proved to be an excellent one. I shall the pleasure of showing to the Indian Agent, Mr. McLean, carrots weighing 2 lbs.\nand turnips weighing 18 lbs; also there were seed onions which grew to a bigger size than some grown from onion sets.\n\nIn short I believe to be justified in calling the garden a success. I tried as much as I could to show the Indians how a well-worked piece of land produces more than a badly worked one. I made the following experiment: I broke a piece of ground with the spade in the spring and put in some onions and turnips of the same kind I put in ground I worked last fall and showed them the difference in growth and production. I did this to show them the advantages of fall-working of the land in our semi-arid climate. When they wondered how I had better garden-huck than they had in the same soil, I told them because I worked the land in the fall and waited it well so as not to disturb the land in the spring and keep the moisture in. Last year's fall they found it funny to see me work the land; but I am very glad to state that (a thing which never happened before) this fall quite a number of them made their land ready now instead of wasting till spring, as was their custom, and I am sure next year's crop will show them I gave them good advice and example.\n\nI must add that the conditions this year were very unfavorable, as we did not have any rain after July 3rd, and we had seven night frosts on August 15th, 16th and 17th.\n\n[Signature]\nM. M. Okon O'Konn\nTeacher\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit herewith the report of Mr. A.J. Ockoni Indian teacher at Stuart Lake School, on the school garden for 1916. In your letter of Dec 18/15 No 427,641-63 instructions were given to supply the teacher with seeds which was done.\n\nDespite the very backward and disappointing season very fair results were obtained. The plots were also used for demonstration purposes the Indians taking quite an interest in the methods of preparing the soil and cultivation.\n\nI would like to give credit to Mr. Ockoni as he gave the matter a great deal of attention involving a considerable amount of hard work.\n\nI consider this is one of the best ways of instructing Indians, as the whole process is worked out before them and the results are visible at all times.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nJ.D.

I am given to understand that they remain with the new institution and I would be pleased if you would kindly advise me if their salaries are to be requisitioned in the same manner as at present.

Agt.\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nFebruary 2nd 1917\n\nMy dear Sir,\n\nThe acknowledgment of the aboriginal Indians' right to a school and the generous support of the said school a few years ago was the good work of the administration of which you, sir, are the head. As I was the founder and manager of the said school, I had several opportunities to deal with your important Department.\n\nThe fair treatment I have then received was not the least encouragement that lead me to assume the task of building and directing a boarding-school at Fort St. James B.C.\n\nIt is in behalf of this last institution that I am addressing you these lines.\n\nMuch to my surprise Mr. McMillan, Indian agent for this district, advises me that the Department wants the Stuart Lake Indian Day School to be closed immediately after the boarding-school has been started.\n\nIf such a plan were immediately followed I could not do justice to all pupils nor would I economize any of the Department's money.\nTo do justice to all pupils, both boys and girls, must have their own apartments for class and manual labor, for eating, sleeping, recreation etc. This would require a very spacious building, and during these war-time (the Government having declined to actually fulfill its pledge of erecting here such a spacious building, that might cost $50,000) the ecclesiastical authorities have done the next best thing. According to means and time we have erected a school which is not sufficiently large to fully accommodate both sexes.\n\nTherefore I beg of you, Sir, to allow me to keep open the Heart Lake day school for girls, while boys will all attend the Boarding School, so Indian parents are more eager even to have their girls than their boys educated.\n\nTo attempt to accommodate both boys and girls in the actual building would I am afraid not only compromise the success of the work, but instead of lowering expenses it would increase them. For instance twenty girl boarders would cost a good deal more to the Department than the small teacher's salary of $800 a year and the small amount expended for fuel and lunch. The lunch to the day-school pupils will be even less expensive owing to the fact that no boys shall share in it. To tell the pupils and the Department's interests will, I am convinced, be better served in the time being by keeping open the Heart Lake Day School for some time, along with the new Boarding-School of the same place.\n\nMay I hope, Dear Sir, that after you have weighed\nthe justice of my demand you shall see your way through in granting it.\n\nI remain, dear sir,\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. Allan O.M.S.\nPrincipal\nANNUNCIATION CHURCH\nPrince Rupert, Canada.\n\nPrince Rupert, B.C., Feb. 10th, 1917\n\nMr. Duncan Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI understand the Day school is to be cancelled immediately against our expectations. I thought you might keep it up till the end of the scholastic year for the benefit of the girls who cannot find admission in the boys school just now; perhaps the wife of the actual teacher might take care of those children for a few months at a reduced salary.\n\nHoping that you are well, I beg to remain,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n(Sgd.) E. M. Bunoz, O.T.I.\nFebruary 20th, 1917.\n\nMy dear Bishop Bunoz,\n\nI have your note of February 10th. Under the circumstances we will be quite willing to keep open the day school for the present and I am writing to that effect to the Principal, Rev. Father Allard.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. E. M. Bunoz, O.M.I.,\nAnnunciation Church,\nPrince Rupert, B.C.\nFebruary 20th, 1917.\n\nDear Father Allard,\n\nAfter reading your letter of February 2nd, I am quite of the opinion that it is necessary to keep open the day school for the present. I am writing the Agent to this effect.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Allard,\nFort St. James, B. C.\nFebruary 20th, 1917.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been informed that the boarding school recently opened at Fort St. James has accommodation at present for boys only, and that if the Stuart Lake day school were closed there would be no provision for the girls. Under these circumstances it has been decided not to close the day school for the present.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. J. McAllan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the attached requisition for Mr. A.J. Okon Ockoniy's salary for month of January see your letter Dec 22nd No 285754/1, Mr Ockoniy having notified me that the boarding school started on Feb 1st.\n\nMr Ockoniy asks me to write the Dept. thanking them and its officers for the kind consideration help and encouragement he has ever received from them.\n\nI would be very pleased if the Dept. would write Mr. Ockoniy a letter of appreciation for the excellent service he has rendered in his tenure of office as teacher at Stuart Lake. I am sure Inspector Megraw would support me in this request.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.,\nAsst. Dep. and Secy.,\nDept. of Ind. Affrs.,\nOttawa.\n\nInd. Agt.,\nOttawa, March 2, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 12th ultimo enclosing a requisition for Mr. Ockoniy's salary as teacher of the Stuart Lake Day School for the month of January, last, he having notified you that the boarding school started on the 1st ultimo, and stating that you would be pleased if the Department would write Mr. Ockoniy a letter of appreciation for the excellent services he has rendered as teacher of the day school.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has already written Mr. Ockoniy in reference to the good work he has done at this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. J. McAllan, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of Feb. 20th. No. 285754 advising me that for the present the day school at Stuart Lake would be kept open for the benefit of the girls. On account of this information I am disregarding instructions given in your letter of Dec. 22/16 No. 285754/1 as far as Mr. Okon Ockoniy is concerned and will requisition his salary at the end of each quarter. In the matter of the mid-day meal which has been furnished in the past to the day school children with Mrs. Ockoniy as cook I think a much better arrangement can be made with Rev. Father Allard, Principal of the boarding school. The two schools will be under the one roof and the Boarding school cook might just as well cook the mid-day meal for the day school children. I have asked Father Allard to take this matter up with the Department direct and submit the lowest per capita price he could furnish meals for. Kindly advise me later on what arrangement if any has been arrived at.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nDuncan C. Scott Esq.\nDeputy Supt. General\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\nI beg to advise you that Mr. A.J. Okon Ockoniy, teacher of the Indian Girls Day School at Stuart Lake has tendered his resignation as he is enlisting for service overseas. I understand that Rev Father Allard is arranging to fill the vacancy.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInd. Agt.\n\nThe Asst. Dep. and Secy.,\nDept of Ind. Affairs\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the last paragraph of your letter of March 2/17 No 285754/1 in which it is indicated that a letter testifying to the good work done at the Stuart Lake Indian Day School by the teacher Mr. A. Okon Ockoniy, had been forwarded him, I beg to say that in conversation with Mr. Ockoniy over the phone a few days ago he advised me he had not received such letter. As Mr. Ockoniy is leaving the Indian Service for the present and is enlisting for service at the front I would be very pleased if you would kindly have a copy made of the original letter sent, which has evidently miscarried, and forward same to Mr. Ockoniy.\n\nI have the honour to be Sir\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nInd. Agt.\n\nThe Aast Dep. and Secy.,\nDept. of Ind. Affre.,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, September 7, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in which you state that Mr. Ockoniy, teacher of the Stuart Lake Day School, is enlisting for overseas service and requesting that a copy of a letter sent him in appreciation of his services be sent him as he did not receive the original.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the letter referred to was dated December 11, 1916, and referred to the work done by Mr. Ockoniy in conducting the school garden at the Stuart Lake school during the summer of 1916.\n\nA copy of this letter is enclosed herewith, which you will be good enough to forward to Mr. Ockoniy. I may say that the Department is pleased with the services rendered by Mr. Ockoniy in the class-room as well as the interest taken by him and his wife in the welfare and advancement of the Indian children in this school.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nW. J. McAllen, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nFort Fraser, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM FOR FILE.\n\nAgent McAllan believes that there should be day schools under R.C. auspices at Stony Creek and Stewart Lake.

C.\n\nREPORT FOR 1886.\n\nAs Secular Education is not the primary object of the Sisters' work in their school for Indians and Half-breed girls, only one examination has been attempted this year.\n\nBefore the midsummer vacation the Rev. R. Small, visiting the school in his capacity of Chaplain, kindly undertook to examine the children in the following subjects:\n\n- Church Catechism, Holy Scripture, History, Arithmetic, Geography, Dictation and Reading. We quote from his report sent to the N. W. \"Gazette,\" in August.\n\n\"The work produced betokened great pains and interest, and an effort on the part of all to do their best.\n\nScripture, as was right, pre-eminently took first place. The answers given by the elder class on this subject were clear and accurate. In the junior class it was at first a matter of difficulty to elicit audible answers, nor was this unnatural considering it was their first formal examination.\n\nThe progress made in History and Geography seemed fairly, even amongst the bigger girls, though there was more discrepancy in the reading.\n\nPerhaps Grammar and Arithmetic are the subjects where there is most room for improvement.\n\nThe Writing and Dictation showed remarkable progress.\n\nThree Indian girls were examined only in reading and religious knowledge, and very creditable specimens were shewn of their writing copied from print.\"\n\nAs domestic work in its various branches forms part of the girls' training, it is impossible for them to give more than four hours a day to lessons, but this is done with scrupulous regularity.\n\nNeedlework also receives special attention. The Indians take very readily to this part of their education. One of the pupils who is very skilful in making moccassins and gloves, has received orders for several pairs, and executed them most satisfactorily.\n\nDuring the early part of the year the Sisters were much encouraged by the increase of the numbers in their school, but since the Autumn several pupils have of necessity been removed.\n\nTwo little girls who were inmates of the house during their mother's temporary absence have now returned to their home, but they continue to attend as day pupils. Another has gone out to service, and we hope that in her case the seed sown will, under the care of a kind mistress, bear some fruit.\n\nAnxiety and disappointment have in some cases attended the Sisters' work, but calling forth as they should do an increase of love and patience, such troubles cannot be regarded altogether as misfortunes.\n\nDuring the summer vacation, eleven children remained with the Sisters, spending part of the time at the little Mission House, Hope.\n\nOne drawback to the growth of the school is the continued want of funds. Half-breed girls have no friends to pay for them, and Indian parents are only able or willing to give very little towards the support of their children.\n\nA subscription received by the Sisters last May in New Westminster, Vancouver, Moodyville, Victoria, have materially strengthened the maintenance fund for this year.\n\nA special result of the Sisters' collecting tour shows itself in the improvement of the school room. The room was originally a kitchen, and it has required many persevering efforts to obliterate traces of Chinese labor from the floor and walls. A new window has been thrown out to admit light, an old store cupboard removed, and a few other alterations render the room more habitable, at least for present needs.\nFrom S. Paul's Mission back to Lytton, to take train for Yale. Where I arrived on the morning of Wednesday the 13th.\n\nThe most deeply interesting part of my work soon after my arrival, was the examination of the girls' school carried on by the Sisters of All Hallows, in the old parsonage house, to which has been tacked on the hospital built when the C. P. R. was in course of construction.\n\nNo words of mine can express the intense interest attached to this work. I could speak of the careful and successful teaching; of the readiness and accuracy with which my questions were almost invariably answered; of the quickness of apprehension and the clear understanding of the subjects treated of in the examination; but what are all these compared with the conviction that could not but come home to my own heart, of the love, the trust, the patience of the Sisters; so devoted to their work, so fully answered by love and trust and quiet gentle obedience on the part of the children under their care.\n\nThe examination occupied the greater part of two days, the subjects of examination being the Catechism, a selected portion of the Old Testament (from the Call of Abraham to the last of the ten plagues), The Ministry of Our Lord, Grammar, History, Geography, Arithmetic, Reading, Dictation, Analysis, Parsing, Recitation, &c. I began my examination by a strict adherence to the text books given me by the Sister Superior, but I soon laid these aside and took up the examination just as I should do in any school which I might be called on to examine, and I was more surprised and gratified than I can say when I found the intelligent, ready, quick answers. The children themselves seemed to brighten up and look pleased when I laid aside the books and appealed to their intelligence rather than to their memories.\n\nThe afternoon of the second day, when several visitors were present, was given to singing, recitations, &c., and the specially pleasant task of giving prizes and rewards, which were so really merited.\n\nIn addition to their regular work in the education of Indian and half-breed girls, one of the Sisters has, at the urgent request of some of the residents in Yale, undertaken the charge of a few of their children, who come daily to school, and I know I do but express the feelings of the parents when I say that they are more than satisfied with the progress their children have made, not only in general knowledge, but also in the increased gentleness of demeanour and quietness of manner we all love to see so much in our daughters.\n\nCHARLES T.

I regret that I have had no opportunity of visiting the school personally\u2014Mr. Agent Mr. Picton however to whom the matter had been referred some time ago reports the following information\u2014\n\nI have visited the institution at Yale maintained and kept by the Sister Superior of the Community of All Hallows and find that there are nineteen girls at this Mission, seven\n\nThe Honorable\nThe Superintendent\nof Ind. Affairs.\nseven of these are full blooded Indians and ten are half breeds, three half breeds are children of white men and Indian women who have been deserted by their white fathers, and have always lived on Indian Reserves until taken into the Mission house by the Sisters, and are in habits and customs as much Indians as the full blood girls are.\n\nThis Mission is in charge of four sisters, who devote their whole time to the education and providing means for the maintenance of the Mission, they receive scarcely any assistance from the parents or friends of these children, besides educating them they board, lodge, and clothe them, besides they are taught sewing, knitting, cooking, and general training in domestic house work, three girls from this Institution have been able to take situations in private families, where they are now earning a respectable living, there are four other girls who will very soon be able to take situations.\n\nI am aware that the Sisters are continually applied to by girls of the above class for admission but in consequence of the scarcity of funds, and house accommodation they cannot admit a larger number.\nnumber than what they have at present. I am also aware that these sisters are obliged from time to time to go out among charitably disposed people to solicit aid to support their mission.\n\nIf Government aid is to be given to any institution of this kind, none is more worthy than the mission of All Hallows, Yale.\n\nIt would appear from the above, that the school has been well carried on with effective results and, so far, entirely by the work of these sisters and such assistance as they were able to obtain from charitably disposed people, which of course must be very limited.\n\nGovernment aid could not be well given subject to the regulations for the per capita grants to ordinary missionary day schools as the sisters board, clothe and educate a certain number of pupils. They are however, deserving of some special assistance from the Government which might if feasible be paid on the production of a quarterly or semi-annual report showing the number of pupil residents at the school and such additional information.\ninformation as might be requisite\nwith the endorsement of the local\nAgent of the Department who would\nhave no difficulty in visiting the\nschool from time to time, so long\nas it continued at Yale.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.W.

With\nwith the hope\neventually of establishing\na hospital &c.,\nfor the treatment\nof serious and\nprolonged cases; also\nyour wish\nthat the Dept. should\ncontribute towards\nthe salary of the\nPhysician.\n\nIn reply to\nthis portion of your\nletter, I beg to state\nthat no provision\nhas been made by\nParliament for\n&c.\nand me for such a\npurpose; but\nI shall have much\npleasure in bringing\nthe matter under\nthe attention of the\nS.G. & H. at an\nearly date, and\nI will afterwards communicate further with you regarding the same.\n\nYours etc.,\nP. R. and dear Sir,\n&c.\nSir,\n\nWill you allow me the favour of bringing before your notice two several matters relating to Indian Affairs in this Province, and within the Town of New Westminster, wherein (I think) the assistance of the Department may be legitimately invoked in furtherance of the intellectual, industrial and physical improvement of three Indians who are being cared for by the Church of England?\n\n(1) The School for Indian Girls, at Yale, under the management of the Sisters of All Nations.\n\nAs a result of the encouragement which the Department has already given us here, our accommodation is already now taxed to the utmost, and we are compelled to refuse all new applications. We have prepared plans for the extension of our premises with accommodation for twenty-five more boarders, and including a new schoolroom, and a play-room for wet weather, and bath rooms.\n\nThis extension is estimated to cost \u00a35000 (\u00a35000 or five thousand dollars). We have ourselves raised \u00a32000 (\u00a32000 or two thousand dollars) towards this, and, if the Department would contribute the balance, we would make a further effort to provide the sum necessary for fittings and furniture, probably another \u00a3300 (\u00a3300 or three hundred dollars).\n\nThe enlargement of our buildings, and the growth of our numbers makes it very desirable that there should be more land about the School. We have at present but three acres. An adjoining lot, consisting of about ten acres of grave land and orchard could be purchased. The same rate offered for it, but I think, on a definite offer, would take readily.\n\nWill the Department consider the possibility of assisting us in this direction also?\n\nI ought to remind you that the whole grant at present...\nmade by the Department is extended in Montana. The latter receive no salary whatever.\n\n(2) Industrial School for Boys.\n\nWhile schools are available for each work amongst girls as is progressing at Yale, we have not yet in the Church of England similar communities of men for agate work amongst boys. The former, consequently, is very much greater, and has hitherto been beyond our accomplishment. It is, however, equally important.\n\nThe government scheme of Industrial Schools has left untouched the whole district worked by the Church of England, viz., on the Fraser River from Yale to Lillooet, about 104 miles; on the Thompson River from Lytton to Ashcroft, about 50 miles; and on the Nicola River from Spence's Bridge to Battle's, about 40 miles. The school at Kamloops will be more than 50 miles from the nearest point in the Church of England District, and more than 100 miles from Lytton which is the centre of that District. We estimate the number of Indians in this District at between 2000 and 3000.\n\nI venture, therefore, to press most earnestly upon the Department the need of such an Institution in this District.\n\nLytton, at the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers, armed by the natural situation of its soil only on account of its geographical position, but also because the Indians generally regard it as a kind of head-quarters to which they are in the habit of resorting. Two physicians reside there, and it is easy of access by our Medical Missionary who visits it almost invariably every week. I have the dead advantage of being very dry, but I have water rights there which would be available, although at present they are extremely bespattered upon by the C.P.R. and the townspeople.\n\n(3) Medical Aid.\n\nI have for some years been in correspondence with the Department on the subject of providing medical attendance for the Indians in our district throughout the whole of which no doctor has been needed excepting during the period of railway construction.\nLast year I again brought the matter before the Superintendent in Victoria, and received from him a letter dated 19th May 1868 in which he undertook to bring my proposal before the Department \"without delay,\" expressing his strong approval of it. Six months later, having heard nothing further from the Department, I engaged, on my own responsibility, a gentleman with double English qualifications who has now been nearly a year at work.\n\nHe resides at Yale for the advantage of the School, the health of which is my most anxious consideration at present, but he has inspected the whole district several times, and makes trips to Lytton & other populous villages at frequent intervals.\n\nI am compelled to allow him the privilege of private practice amongst the whites because the stipend I am able to attempt provide him is altogether insufficient for his needs, but he might quite comfortably occupy himself wholly with Indians were we could afford it.\n\nThe contributions of the Indians themselves are not worth taking into account at present, but we are educating them to a sense of their responsibility in this respect.\n\nDr. Pearce's services are at the disposal of all Indians within his district, whether belonging to the Church of England or not. By means of remunerating him are not permitted and therefore it is if no use my asking for something supplementary to what I give him. The work is very arduous, the position one of loneliness and much discomposure, and a man needs tempting, therefore, to retain it and I hope that these considerations will have weight with the Department.\n\nIn conclusion I hope that the Department will always keep in view the fact that in all our Indian work their object are ours. We are working for no private end, but aiming simply and solely at the advancement of a people needing only fair opportunities to develop their considerable abilities.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour faithful servant,\n[Signature]\n[Place]\n\n[21]\nThe Rt Rev\nThe Anglican Bishop N.W.\nNew Westminster\nB.C.\n\nSECOY'S BRANCH,\nOCT 6... 1889\nWRITTEN.\n\nRt Rev Sir,\n\nIn the absence of\nthe S.G. of D.C., I beg to\nask the rev't of yr\nLship's letter of the 26\nult., wherein yr Lship\nrequests the\nMinister's consideration\nof several matters\nin connection with school\nwritten your advice, &\nalso in regard to the\ngranting of a subsidy to\na medical man for\nattending on the Indians\ntherein.\n\nI beg to inform\nMr. Lship that I shall\ntake an early\nopportunity on the\nreturn of the S.S. \nto Ottawa to \nbring in Bishop's \nletter under \nhis consideration \nPlease do \nRt Rev Sir \n+ C\nThe Rt.

In regard to a school for Indian girls at Yale under the management of the Sisters of All Hallows, the Minister states that he will be prepared to recommend $1,500 towards the erection of school buildings be included in the Estimates to be submitted to Parliament at its next Session.\n\n2. As regards the purchase of the land adjoining that occupied by the school, the Superintendent General is of opinion that $500 should be sufficient for the land in question; and he will be prepared, if the same can be bought for that amount, to have it also included in the Estimates for 1889-90.\n\n3. In regard to your proposition that an Industrial School for boys be established within Your Lordship's diocese in the vicinity of Lytton, at the confluence of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers,\nthe Superintendent General thinks that a Protestant school should be started in this locality, and he will give the matter consideration.\n\n4. In regard to Your Lordship's application for assistance towards furnishing medical aid to the Indians in Your Lordship's Diocese, the Superintendent General has taken note of your representations and he will consider the matter.\n\nI have, &c.,\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE CHIEF CLERK.\n\nPlease insert in Estimates for 1889-90 an item of $1,500 to assist in the erection of buildings in connection with the school for Indian girls to be conducted under the auspices of the Church of England, at Yale, British Columbia; also an item of $500 for the purchase of land for the above school.\n\nD.

Superior, and those acting under her direction.\n\nThe school house recently built was a most necessary addition and was very much needed to accommodate, with healthful comfort, the number of children there provided for.\n\nThere is now an excellent dormitory\u2014large, well lighted and ventilated\u2014a very good school room, a nice play yard, besides other necessary accommodations.\n\nL. Van Horne, Esq.,\nDeputy to the Dept. Sect. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nand suitable apartments.\n\nA building which was formerly used as a stable has been converted into a pretty little Chapel, which, being attached to the School building, is an addition of no little importance.\n\nI may state that the School in question was first opened in January 1885 in premises belonging to the Church of England, by the Sisters of the Community of All Hallows, Richmond, England. At that time the buildings at their disposal were small, and only 13 children were taken in. In the early part of 1888 the School was removed with larger premises acquired by His Lordship, Bishop Elliott, at a cost of \u00a3200. A governess was added to the staff, and the number of pupils was increased to 70. The Act concerning Parliament that year, a per Capita allowance was voted for this School of \u00a360 per annum for 25 children. That fund is now being drawn for 61 children.\n\nThe number attending on the occasion of my visit, but building recently erected, in addition to the premises occupied up to the time of its completion, and at present will conveniently accommodate 80, but His Lordship states\nStates that the Sisters can only increase the present number by 4, which will be the limit of the number provided for by statute.\n\nMay also add that the $60 allowed does not cover the expense of food and clothing for a year. The extra cost above the $60 must meet (1) by the community through voluntary contributions, and (2) by means of fees paid by a few white children attending the school. Of the latter there were seven when invited the institution.\n\nThe present staff consists of:\nSister Amy (Sister Superior)\nSister Alice,\nSister Margaret, and\nMiss Hardy governess whose salary is paid by the community.\n\nThe cost of the School Building will be taken from the enclosed balance sheet received from the architect in charge, and the enclosed plans will convey all required knowledge of size, style, and interior of building.\n\nPlease let know the\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nV.

W. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria, B. C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI have the honor to acknowledge yours of the 14th instant 535 X covering copy of letter from the Department at Ottawa 41672-2 relating to \"All Hallows\" School, Yale.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that ample precautions have been taken to provide against a calamity by fire.\n\nThe stove pipes, are in every instance conveyed into brick flues; there is a supply of water both upstairs and downstairs; and from the dormitory there is an exit on to the roof of the woodshed affording the easiest possible access to the ground. There are two exits from every room occupied by the children, but the doors do not open outwards.\n\nWith regard to the other question, viz, that respecting the \"Seven white children\", I beg to say that they are not included in but are additional to the twenty-one Indian children for whom the grant is drawn.\n\nHaving\nHaving answered this question, I will take the liberty of saying that it ought to have never been put.\n\nThe mere suggestion of the possibility that I could draw Public money for any other than its lawful object is an affront both to me and the Sister in charge of the School. I am willing to believe that the imputation was unintentional on the part of the Deputy of the Deputy of the Superintendent General, but it was none the less a blunder, which ought not to have occurred in a document emanating from a Public Department.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Signed) A.

Sillitoe, in which His Lordship states that ample precautions have been taken to provide against such a calamity.\n\nIn reply, I beg\nto inform you that the Deptt is glad to learn of this fact. But with regard to the other subject referred to by Bp. Silvius in his letter, viz., the information sought for by the Deptt as to the seven white children included in the return read from the school, Sir, His Lordship states, are additional to the twenty-one Indian children for whom the Grant is drawn, I have to express regret that His Lordship should suppose that the Deptt wished intended in any way to imply by its letter to you that there was any want of good faith on his part or in\nthat of the authorities\nof the school in\ntraining these\nchildren to the\nDirt together with\nthe Indian children\nin the list. It was\nsimply thought that,\nthrough inadvertence\nwhich I think might\noccur, the authorities\nof the institution\nmight overlook the\nfact that the contribution\nmade by the Dept\nwas to be used for\nthe education of\nsupport of Indian\nChildren. I had the\npleasure of informing\nHis Lordship\nto the above effect.\nI take this\nopportunity of stating\nto you that, when\nofficial letters are\naddressed to you by the Deptt it is not desired that you should forward copies of the same to the part or parties from whom information was asked in these official letters (as to be obtained), but that you should address to those who sent the request for the information, subsequent communicate the information obtained from them to the Deptt with such remarks as may seem proper pertinent to the matter.\n\n[Signature]\nNew Westminster\n\nNovember 3rd 1893\n\nTo the Dep.

Bentworth\nArchitecton of Columbia\nArchdeaconry of Columbia\n(DIO: OF NEW WESTMINSTER)\n\n1601 BARCLAY STREET,\nVancouver, B. C., December 14th, 1908\n\nTo The Deputy Supt'dt. General of Indian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:-\n\nReferring to an interview which the Rev. H. J. Underhill and myself had with you at Ottawa on Sept. 20th., in reference to an increase of the grant of $60.00 per head to our School for Indian Girls at Yale, B. C., you requested that I should forward a statement through the Superintendent at Victoria.\n\nThe School was started over twenty years ago, and is still under the Supervision of the Sisters of All Hallows Community. The Head Mistress is a Public School Teacher with Normal Training, and over twenty years experience in Prince Edward Island. There is a Matron, a Pupil Teacher, and two of the Sisters assist in Teaching and in the care of the Children, is evidenced from the remarkable fact that there have been no deaths in the school for seventeen years, and during that time only five deaths from illness developed in the School.\n\nThe two main reasons for asking for an increase are:\n\n(1) The increased cost of living. In a statement prepared by the Letter Carriers some time ago, this increase in British Columbia was stated to be forty-seven per cent. The\nArchdeaconry of Columbia\n(DIO: OF NEW WESTMINSTER)\n\n1601 BARCLAY STREET,\nVancouver, B.C., December 14th 1908\n\nTo The Deputy Supt'dt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\n(2)\n\n$60.00 has had to be supplemented to a large extent for actual living expenses, and clothing is entirely supplied by Church organizations, mainly from the Women's Auxiliary.\n\n(3) The second reason is that Industrial features are being grafted on to the School work. It is of little importance whether, if an increased grant is given it should be called an Industrial School, or whether it is a Boarding School having special Industrial features.\n\nThe teaching of Special features makes additional expenses. The Policy of the School is undergoing a change. In the early days the Homes from which the Children were drawn, were such that it was wise to train them for Domestic Service, and many had no Homes at all. Now there is a great improvement in the Indian Homes in the District. It is a gratifying fact that seven Children at present in the School are Children of former pupils. Except in exceptional cases they should be trained to go back to their homes and be able if necessary to earn their own living, and be a help to their families.\n\nTo further this a Sister has come from England with appliances and necessary knowledge to teach all branches of Lace.\nTo The Supt'dt General Indian Affairs.\n\nMaking. Other branches besides Domestic Work and Elementary Cooking are (1) Dress Making, (2) Laundry Work\u2014 as soon as a new Laundry can be had\u2014, (3) Basket Making and (4) Needlework. The elements of Simple Nursing should be taught by a trained nurse.\n\nI may add that from the first of January, the Rev. H. J. Underhill will be in residence at Yale as Chaplain to the Canadian and Indian Schools. A house has been built for him and he will take part in the instruction at the Indian School.\n\nFor eleven years I have had an intimate knowledge of, and have been a frequent visitor to the Indian School, and I earnestly trust the Department may be able to make an increase in the grant, an application for which I believe to be abundantly justified.\n\nI am, dear Sir,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEndorsement from the BISHOP OF NEW WESTMINSTER.\n\nE.S.W.P./H.P.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to the Department's letter to this office of the 19th of May last in which inter alia the question of the application of the management of the All Hallows Boarding School, Fraser Agency, B.C. is dealt with, I have the honor to enclose herewith, for the Department's information and consideration, a communication of the 4th instant addressed by the Venerable Archdeacon Pentreath (with endorsement of the Bishop of New Westminster) to the Deputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs, Ottawa, again urging compliance with the request previously made.\n\nIn connection with the application, it may be stated that while it is true that the cost of living has materially increased - perhaps to the extent of 50% within recent years - such increase affects chiefly those institutions and persons who have to purchase everything or almost everything worn and consumed. This can hardly be said to be the case with the institution in question, for the reason that much of the garden truck\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\ntruck, if not, indeed, all of it, so expensive to the city consumer, is grown on the school grounds. This food supply, with the poultry etc. raised from year to year goes far to supplement the school's funds. Then again, the Indian girls, who do most of the actual work of the institution, bring about a considerable saving in the matter of labor which, especially in these times of high wages, must help out materially the school's finances.\n\nAnother point on which stress is laid by the management is that were the grant to the institution increased so as to bring it within the scope of an industrial school much more effective work could be done and the usefulness of the institution enhanced. I rather fail to see how any more good could be had thereby than is now actually the case in the boarding schools throughout the superintendency where all the usual household duties, including the useful arts of knitting and sewing, are regularly taught to the pupils therein domiciled. In view of the circumstances mentioned I do not see any way clear to support the application.\n\nI have the honor to be\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent, B. C.\n\nP.S. Were the request granted all boarding schools in the Superintendency would expect similar treatment.\nArchdeaconry of Columbia\nIDIO: OF NEW WESTMINSTER\n\n1901 BARCLAY STREET,\nVancouver, B.C., July 15th 1909\n\nThe Deputy Sect.

He lives, He lives,\nJesus, Who salvation gives!\nRising, in the earl gloom,\nLo! His glory fills the tomb;\nAll the earthly guards are fled\nFrom the Mansion of the Dead;\nListen, for the Angels say,\nSee the place where Jesus lay.\n\nEnter, if ye seek for Him!\nThere the light shall not be dim;\nAt His head, and at His feet,\nMark the clothes and winding sheet,\nAll in sacred order seen,\nIn the grave where Christ has been;\nSo He left it, all was done,\nEre the rising of the sun.\n\nEarth was trembling\u2014Jesus rose,\nCalmly passing through His foes;\nDeath hath no dominion now,\nCaptain of Salvation Thou.\n\nJesus, Conqueror of the grave,\nJesus, Master, strong to save,\nTeach our hearts the unearthly bliss\nOf a purer world than this!\n\nBid the powers of darkness fly,\nShew to us the shining way,\nUs the children of the day;\nOnward, onward, in the road,\nRadiant with the Light of God,\nGod the Father and the Son,\nAnd the Spirit, ever One!\nGarden Thoughts.\n\nEvery Spring the Holy Spirit teaches us by our gardens a great many things about the resurrection, and the joy of the Eternal Easter.\n\nHe shews us that even the tiniest seed, or root, or bulb in our gardens, if it has life in it, rises again, even if we planted it so long ago that we have quite forgotten about it.\n\nWe learn to understand in this way, that, if we were given Life in our Souls at Baptism, and the Life has been growing in us through the other means of grace, when our bodies die and are buried, they will rise again at the Resurrection Day.\n\nWe see, too, that the plants which come up in our gardens do not look at all like the little plain brown seeds, or bulbs, which we planted. They each have their own body, so that we know them all when we see them, but what a beautiful body it is!\n\nSo it is with people, who are God's flowers. We can only see, perhaps, what is just on the outside of their lives, and they may seem to us very dull, and plain, and uninteresting; but God can see into their hearts, and He sees the beautiful soul that is growing so quietly all hidden away, just a secret which He alone shares. Then in the Resurrection day He gives that soul a body \"as it pleaseth Him,\" a \"beautiful body to a beautiful soul, or an ugly body to an ugly soul.\"\n\nThe Bible tells us that some will be more beautiful than others, for some souls have been growing more beautiful on earth, giving themselves up more every day to be made holy by the Blessed Spirit, coming closer to our Lord in the Sacraments, and trying every day to please the loving Father a little more.\n\nThat Life, which is our Lord's Life, \"can never die\"; what dies and is buried is only the outside, ugly part, while the true Life is set free then, waiting for its Resurrection body.\n\nSo St. Paul ends his wonderful teaching on the Resurrection by telling us to be very steadfast in all the duties God gives us to do. He does not call them \"our work,\" but \"the work of the Lord\"; for he says that we know now that none of our work is \"no use,\" so long as we do not try to do it all by ourselves, but ask and use the grace of our Lord.\n\nOr, if we think of it in another way, every little duty faithfully done, every kind deed, or loving word is like a little seed sown in God's garden, and hidden until the Eternal Spring comes, when it will blossom and make glad God's beautiful garden for ever.\n\nThere are some who seem to have more suffering than anything else to bear, but they too, know that not one moment of their pain or sorrow is of \"no use,\" for if they have borne it patiently for love of our Lord, who suffered so much for them, they may perhaps have the gladdest surprise of all in the Resurrection, when they see how God is glorified by\n\n\"The mighty harvest\nFrom small seeds of pain.\"\n\nThe Year Round.\n\nCHRISTMAS, 1909.\n\nWe began our decorations in good time this year, even the Christmas Tree was standing in the Schoolroom by Christmas Eve, with its wide-spread expectant branches, so that everything looked very bright and festive indeed.\n\nAfter the children had gone to bed early, the older ones to get up for the Midnight Celebration, and the little ones to sleep peacefully and dream of their \"stockings,\" we elders settled down to finish our own Christmas preparations, when, very unexpectedly, a welcome visitor from far-away Japan arrived, just in time to join with us in the Great Christmas Feast. So those who had come from far, the East and West, met together where the fir trees beautified the place of God's Sanctuary at that snowy Christmas-tide!\n\nFull of joy was all that Festival, but almost the gladdest part of all to the children (besides the services) was the beautiful Christmas Tree on St. John's Day.\n\nMany kind friends had generously contributed all sorts of lovely things, dolls, toys, and useful gifts too for the children, besides\nALL HALLOWS' IN THE WEST.\n\nIn April we had to say goodbye to Miss Harris, after her years of loving service; but we wish her every joy in her new life, and hope we may have the pleasure of seeing her again from time to time.\n\nIn May we were all so grieved to hear of the Bishop's illness. He had always been so kind in visiting the School, and we were looking forward to seeing him amongst us again very shortly, for a Confirmation. But God ordered otherwise, and very soon we heard that our Bishop had entered into the rest of Paradise, of which he had so often spoken to us. Eager children bought little mountain searching for the first white trilliums, or brought little offerings of snowdrops from their gardens, to make a wreath for Sister Superior to take down for the Bishop's grave.\n\nIn June, Bishop Perrin of Columbia kindly came up to take the Confirmation in the little School Chapel, when four of our girls, Isabel, Flora, Rena, and May, were confirmed, and had their first Communion on June 12th.\n\nThe Bishop came into the schoolroom to say a few words to all the children after the Confirmation. He told them to try and remember these lines, as they would help them:\n\n\"I can't, can do nothing,\nI'll try, can do many things,\nI will, by the help of God, can do all things.\"\n\nEveryone was very busy during the month of June, preparing for the school closing, for this year we were not simply going to have an ordinary programme of songs and recitations, but the children, under Miss Flower's direction, were learning a little Cantata called \"Granny's Birthday.\"\n\nThree \"old girls,\" Emma, Bee, and Ada, came to stay for the great event, and another, Alice Macpherson, came just for a day or two before hand. It is one of our greatest pleasures to see the \"old girls\" back at the school again, to hear how well they have done, and to share their joy in all being together again. One of the ways in which they are always ready to be useful is in helping to pick cherries! They all feel quite at home up in the branches of the cherry trees!\n\nThe flowers were lovely this year, we had quantities of all sorts for the closing; roses, honeysuckles, daisies, and many other kinds, in spite of the gaps we feared we should have in the garden after\n\nwarm scarves, socks, caps, etc., for the older people.\n\nHow eagerly young eyes scanned the branches to try and see the names on dolls and toys, and what delight it was to find their own name on some specially beautiful thing!\n\nOur Indian friends quite entered into the children's delight, and enjoyed their pretty toys almost as much as they did!\n\nWhen it was all over poor old Chief Charlie from Squatetch, made a touching little speech to say how glad he was to come once again, for he felt so sad at home now, so many of his friends had died, and he was almost alone in his old age.\n\nDuring the month of January, 1910, we were very busy as usual, but we had a rest from taking care of water-pipes for ours were frozen outside for six weeks. It was quite a change to feel that it did not matter how cold it might turn in the night if there would be no danger of boilers bursting, or taps having to be thawed out! True, we had to get all our water carried up from the brook, but that was something new, and children always like new things, so no one really minded that very much. We were so much better off than our neighbours, for no one else had such a convenient brook!\n\nDuring February and March we had a great many snowstorms, and also an epidemic of influenza, so that we were very glad when April and May brought spring flowers and sunshine, and everyone was able to be out of doors again.\n\nDuring Lent everyone tried very hard to fill our Missionary Box, several of the girls who had left school lately sent some money for it too, and though the last sums came rather late, yet we were able to give $30 altogether as our offering. We hope that this year more of the \"old girls\" will help us, so that we may be able to send more to help the Missions of the Church. Archdeacon Penrettah told us that Mission work ought to be especially an offering of love from women, for our Lord had done so much for woman, and her position in Christian lands to-day was the result of our Lord's teaching and example.\n\nEaster was, as usual, a time of very great gladness, and though many voices were not very strong, after influenza, yet all tried their best to sing the joyful hymns and the other music of the Church Services.\nthe winter's frost.\n\nSummer holidays are very busy times, indeed. First there is all the excitement of finding out who is going home, then packing suitcases, buying holiday clothes, and going to the station with a merry party to \"see them off.\" Then those who are left behind settle down for their special holiday-making. They divide the lodgings between them and feel very important people!\n\nThe youngsters are generally spent in fruit picking, after the little daily duties are finished, but sometimes we all go down to the beach, for there is plenty of sand there, and large shady rocks, also wild flowers and berries.\n\nThere were some very nice pictures, as usual, and the \"holiday children\" enjoyed themselves very much. Five of them were \"new girls,\" Lucy, Lizzy, Evelyn, Lulu, and Kitty. It kept us very busy taking care of them all, for they were very new to school ways.\n\nIn August the other girls came back from their homes, and every one had plenty to tell of all the things they had been doing. Grace had been away for her first real holiday this year, for Nellie's mother had kindly invited Grace and Emma to go home with her and spend their holidays in Chilmark. They enjoyed themselves very much indeed, everyone was so very good to them.\n\nIn September lessons began again, and everyone settled down for the new term.\n\nIn October another little girl came, Suzanne, Makura's little daughter. That made quite a party of very little ones, who had very happy times together, playing all sorts of games among themselves out of school hours.\n\nMost of the children have been buying their gardens ready for the winter, and planting their bushes.\n\nEveryone welcomed the All Saints Festival; the beautiful services making us realize more deeply our awareness of those who have gone before, and leading us on to fresh efforts, as we think of the \"great cloud of witnesses,\" who are looking and praying that we too, may overcome as they did in the strength of God.\n\nThe snow was late in coming this year, but it was nice and mild, so that the garden did not suffer at all.\n\nThen there were three blizzards, one after another, and after lessons had begun again, in February, the influenza began all over again too, but not so badly this time!\n\nMonday, January 8th was perhaps the most eventful day of the whole month. It had been quite mild weather till then, but on Sunday the snow began falling fast, large soft flakes like feathers. In the night a gale rose, banging doors open, and driving the snow through the windows.\nSeveral of the children's beds were covered with snow, and the little girl had a snowdrift over her, but it was all removed, and dry warm things put on before waking-up time came, or there would have been fine games of snowballing in the dormitory!\n\nLater on in the day the thermometer fell about 40 degrees, and the gale changed into a blizzard, which lasted about five days, and was the worst we have had for eighteen years, it being 20 degrees below zero in town, they said.\n\nOn that Monday, Inspector Ditchburn, the new \"Inspector of Indian Agencies,\" visited us for the second time, though he found it very cold work taking all his measurements, etc., in such weather. The results of his visit will be found mentioned elsewhere.\n\nNaturally we were not free from water troubles in such conditions as these, but we fared so much better than our neighbours, that we could only feel thankful for all the water we had, even if it did come down in rather inconvenient \"fluids\" sometimes!\n\nAt the end of February, though the snow is still deep on the ground, and piled up many feet high round the houses, and though the river has been frozen over (all but one little green strip), for five weeks, yet there is a feeling of spring in the air. Seed lists are being consulted, and gardens planned, while tomatoes are being started on top of the plate-warmer in the kitchen!\n\nWe have Lent before us, but there is the joy of Easter to hope for at the end; just as there is the joy of the last great Easter set before us, when the Lent of this world is over for ever.\n\nSermon before the Consecration of the Bishop.\n\nST. JOHN'S CHURCH, YALE, B.C. (July 24th, 1910.)\n\n\"As My Father has sent Me, even so send I you.\"\n\nTo-morrow will be a day of great importance, for something will take place which has never happened before in the history of the Church in this Diocese.\n\nTo-morrow a Bishop will be consecrated for the Diocese of New Westminster, in St. Paul's Church, Vancouver.\n\nSome time ago we met in the Synod and chose a Bishop. We chose him, but still we have no Bishop, for our choice did not make him a Bishop. The other Bishops of the Church approved of him, but even that did not make him a Bishop. He will not be a Bishop until to-morrow.\n\nThen the Archbishop has to travel two thousand miles, and the other Bishops have to leave their Dioceses, the Service of Consecration takes place, and he is made a Bishop of the Church of God; not a Bishop of New Westminster only, though he belongs to this place, and will minister in this Diocese, but he will take his place as a lineal descendant of the Apostles in the Church of God. To him the words of the text will be said, the words our Lord said to his Apostles when he made them apostles of His Church, \"As My Father hath sent Me, even so send I you.\"\n\nAfter His Resurrection, and before His Ascension, our Lord said these words to His Apostles, when He breathed on them and gave them the Holy Ghost.\n\nThat was not the same gift of the Holy Ghost as that which they received at Pentecost, but a special gift to enable them to fulfil their work as Apostles in the Church of God.\n\nIn the forty days before the Ascension, our Lord taught them about the Kingdom of God; but He never filled up the place of Judas (He left that for the Church to do), there were only eleven Apostles at the time of the Ascension.\n\nThen, immediately afterwards, we read how the Apostles met to choose another to make up their number. They chose two who were witnesses with them of our Lord's Life and Resurrection, and then they prayed to God to show them which of the two He had chosen, and the lot fell on Matthias, then we read that he was numbered with the Apostles.\n\nWe never hear again of their casting lots, but we do read, after the death of St. James, that the Holy Ghost said \"Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them,\" then they laid their hands on them and they were called Apostles too, so there were thirteen Apostles then.\nALL HALLOWS IN THE WEST.\n\nSt. Paul had been chosen by God before he was even a Christian, but that call alone did not make him an Apostle then; he was made one by the Apostles, who laid their hands on him at the command of the Holy Ghost.\n\nSome people say the Church of England is too narrow, but while we do not wish to condemn anyone else, we must hold fast to that which has been committed to us.\n\nWe have in the English Church what many others have not, perhaps they do not care to have it, perhaps they do not believe in it. But we have that which has been handed down to us for 1900 years from our Lord Himself.\n\nHe gave the power and the government of His Church to His Apostles, and they in their turn, handed it on to others. They did not, as we saw limit their number only to twelve, for Bishops were set apart in many cities, both by St. Paul and others, but the same authority was handed down to them.\n\nEither we must believe that the government ordained by our Lord in His Church came to an end, or else that same government is in the Church today.\n\nThis last is what we believe, we maintain that our Bishops are the literal descendants of those who were first set apart by our Lord Himself.\n\nSo to-morrow another will be consecrated to take his place in the government of the Church of God.\n\nIt is not learning, it is not personal holiness, it is not experience, it is not age that can make a man a Bishop, but the solemn consecration by the other Bishops when the gift of the Holy Ghost is given, and he is made a literal descendant of these who were made Apostles by Christ, when He said to them \"As My Father hath sent Me, so send I you.\"\n\nIt is Christ Who gives us all spiritual blessings. Our Baptism, our Confirmation, our Communions, all come from Him. We believe that beyond the Bishop, beyond the Priest who ministers to us in the Sacraments of the Church, stands Christ Himself, the Fountain of all Grace.\n\nCLOSING DAY, (June 30th, 1910).\n\nAn ideal summer day! Bees and butterflies flitting about among the Acacia tree blossoms and flowers. Birds singing merrily\u2014when they were not too busy among the huckleberries in Sister's garden. Our brook rushing noisily down from the mountain behind the Schools, to join the Fraser below, where perchance one sees the Indians threading their way up the river in their curiously carved canoes, laden with fresh salmon or some of their beautifully woven baskets.\n\nIn the Schoolroom with Sister Superior were assembled a large gathering, the Rev. H. J. and Mrs. Underhill, Mrs. Pugh (wife of the Archdeacon of Yale), the Rev. C. C. Croucher, some ladies from Emory, several friends from the village, including Mr. Dodd, accompanied by Judge Howie of New Westminster, who kindly presented the prizes and made a very happy speech at the close.\n\nThe schoolroom and stage were prettily decorated with a profusion of ferns, daisies, syringa, deutzia, and an archway of roses.\n\nThe programme opened with a very pretty \"Wind Pril,\" followed by a grand march by the whole school. Then the Cantata entitled \"Grammie's Birthday,\" which was intensely interesting and exceedingly well done by the children, the result of long and careful training by Miss Plover.\n\nEva, surrounded by all the children in their pretty pink dresses made a charming old gramme of eighty-one with her snowy hair, soft white shawl and lace cap, kindly designed by Mrs. Pugh.\n\nThe songs of \"Greeting\" to Grammie, the crowning her with flowers, Grammie's song to her children, and the soft \"lullaby\" at the close, with little Alice asleep on her knee, were particularly well suited to the children's voices and were sung with a sweet pathos, not often heard.\n\nA Patriotic Song, the prize-giving, some speeches by the visitors and \"God save the King\" brought a very happy occasion to an end.\nThen all went to the Dining Hall, where the tables had been tastefully decorated with maiden hair fern and flowers, and were laden with cherries, jellies and cakes, and other good things, which presided over by the Sisters, and surrounded by the happy faces of the children made a pretty scene that will never fade from the memory of those who had the privilege of joining in the closing of 1910.\n\nE. M. Dickson.\n\nA Christmas at Yale.\n\nAs one who has spent a Christmas at Yale, I will begin by saying how greatly I enjoyed it; this most peaceful happy time will not readily be forgotten.\n\nWell, for some days before, there seemed to be a thrill of expectation in the air; preparations were going on for that wonderful Christmas tree\u2014which was to dazzle the eyes and gladden the hearts of the Indian Children.\n\nOn Christmas Eve, we had a midnight Celebration of the Holy Eucharist; the music was beautifully sung by the children, whose sweet voices rang out in the magnificent words of the Service; and there we met our Lord, Who once more deigned to come to us.\n\nThere were several grown-up Indians present\u2014one very feeble old woman had to be helped up to the Altar.\n\nAfter Service we had a very early breakfast, and adjourned to bed.\n\nOn Christmas Morning the children came round to all the bedrooms singing a carol very sweetly, under the direction of Sister Marian. They had had the exquisite pleasure of opening their stockings, which, together with the breakfast, was a lengthy process.\n\nAs it was Sunday, we went to Matins at the Village Church.\n\nWe were sorry to miss the Vicar, who had been obliged to go one of his outlying parishes.\n\nOn our return we all had dinner together in the Dining Hall, which was very prettily decorated by the children, and we specially made two turkeys look very foolish, and several puddings vanished altogether. The children had dessert, and pulled crackers, and seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves. We were all sorry that one little girl was ill, and had to spend her Christmas in bed.\n\nIn the evening we had Service in our own Chapel, and several Carols were sung.\n\nPRIZE LIST.\n\nCLASS PRIZES.\n\nStandard II.\u2014Adela.\nStandard III.\u2014Janet.\nStandard IV.\u2014Flora.\nStandard V.\u2014Isabel.\n\nWriting\u2014Eva.\nReading\u2014Nellie.\nLace-making\u2014Eva.\nNeedlework\u2014Jennie.\nChurch Catechism\u2014Medal presented by Archdeacon Pentreath\u2014May.\nScripture\u20141st prize, Silver Cross, presented by H.

The tree was got from the woods behind the School, and was a splendid specimen\u2014reaching to the ceiling. It was covered with presents for Sister Superior had forgotten nobody, and when lighted up looked very lovely. To see the trouble the Sisters had taken; with sparkling eyes and bated breath the little ones marched round, and after they had sung some Carols, Mr. Undeshill began to give out the presents, and all too soon everything was over for another year.\n\nM. Ramsey.\n\nChildren's Pages.\n\nCONFIRMATION.\n\nBefore we are confirmed we have to be Baptised, and come to years when one can choose right, and know right from wrong, and try to do better.\n\nWhen we come to be confirmed we have to be really sorry for our sins, and try to lead better lives by teaching others to be good, and by being good ourselves.\n\nWhen we go to be confirmed we are going to receive the seven-fold gifts of the Holy Ghost, though we do not see the Holy Ghost coming down and resting on the ones that are to be confirmed.\n\nThe wind is one of the types of the Holy Ghost\u2014the wind can do mighty things and blows where it likes to blow: and so the Holy Ghost goes where He wants to go, and makes mighty things happen.\n\nWhen a person is confirmed, that person cannot be confirmed again, for when that person was confirmed his character was sealed.\n\nWhen we are confirmed we don't expect to be better or perfect all at once, but we are to try more and more every day.\n\nJemus.\n\nCHIEF JOE.\n\nWhen I used to live in North Vancouver I used to go and see Chief Joe.\n\nHe was a nice old man. He was the Chief of all the Chiefs in British Columbia. He lived in Capilano. He had two daughters, and one son named Mithras who is Chief now.\n\nOne of his daughters can make nice baskets, another of his daughters was still going to school. Chief Joe and his son used to go fishing in the summer.\n\nChief Joe's wife is a very old woman. She is always picking berries and digging clams to sell. Sometimes I went with her when she went to sell her berries.\n\nChief Joe went to see the King (King Edward), and all the Indians were gathered together to see him go. They were all dressed the way they used to dress in the olden days. I watched them all until they got to the station in Vancouver.\n\nWhen Chief Joe came back he told the people all what he saw.\n\nHe said when he got to London they did not think he could see the King. So one of the men went and asked the King if he would see him. He said of course he would see him. So Chief Joe went to the Palace.\n\nHe said the ceiling was all made out of looking-glass, and the other Chief got scared because he saw himself walking on his head.\n\nThey went before the King, who was on a platform. All the other people felt so grand that they never came down to shake hands with Chief Joe, but the King came down and shook hands with Chief Joe. The King's wife also came down to shake hands with him, and he gave her some baskets; and she said to him she would take them to carry their lunch in, when she went with her grandchildren.\n\nAnd Chief Joe told the King the things the Indians wanted, and the King said they must be patient, and they would see what they could do for him.\n\nWhen Chief Joe came back all the people were very glad to see him.\n\nNellie (aged 13).\nALL HALLOWS IN THE WEST.\n\nBesides this disadvantage there is another almost more grave. The closing of the Chinese laundry where our washing used to be done, necessitated its all being done in the School. This is splendid training for the girls, and they quite enjoy it, but for lack of any laundry building, all the boiling, drying and ironing of the clothes has to be carried on in their Playroom, or general \"living room\" where meals are also served. The discomforts of these arrangements are obvious, yet it is all that can be done under the present circumstances.\n\nAlso there is no basement, or even any foundation to the building at the back, so that the water coming down from the mountain rots the sills and woodwork.\n\nIt had been therefore, planned to move the entire Indian School building out of its present rather cramped position over to their playground, so as to allow of the addition of a kitchen and laundry, and to leave the present site for the erection of the new Chapel which would thus be built between the two Schools.\n\nBut times are changing in B.C. as in other parts of the world and buildings that seemed quite satisfactory to the authorities twenty years ago are found to fall short of the new requirements.\n\nFor instance in the dormitory where formerly twenty-five children were allowed, only eighteen may sleep now so as to have the requisite amount of cubic feet of air for each child.\n\nThis means that even by filling up every bedroom, so that we can never have visitors or \"old girls\" to stay, we can only take in twenty-six children at the very most, although our grant now permits us to have thirty-five.\n\nIn January of this year we were visited by Inspector Macdonald, who passed the School as a \"School in Class C,\" (subject to the above condition as to the dormitory), which means that we are to have a larger grant; a hundred dollars a year for each child instead of sixty dollars as formerly.\n\nThis is good news, for expenses have so much increased of late years that the cost of maintaining a child is now a hundred and twenty dollars a year (about twenty-five pounds), allowing nothing for clothing, house repairs, or expenses of that sort.\n\nA History and an Appendix.\n\nIn 1884 three Sisters from the Community of All Hallows, Ditchingham, Norfolk, England, came out at the request of Bishop Sinne, the first Bishop of New Westminster, to undertake Mission work amongst the Indians in his diocese.\n\nAt first they lived in the vacant Parsonage at Yale, which was then a large town of about six thousand inhabitants, and they held classes in the Indian church.\n\nAfter a year or so, the nucleus of the present Indian school began to be formed, using the old C.P.R. Hospital behind the Parsonage for a temporary shelter.\n\nIn 1888 the Sisters moved to the \"Onderdonk\" house, about half a mile west of the town.\n\nThe good news soon came that the Dominion Government had decided to help the Sisters with a grant of $60 a year, for each pupil up to the number of twenty-five.\n\nIn 1890 the present Indian school building was completed, the money being raised by the Sisters in begging expeditions, aided by a grant of $1500 from the Dominion Government.\n\nThe School numbers varied, at times being as high as thirty-six, when part of the old Laundry was used as a dormitory.\n\nAdditions and improvements have been made from time to time with the help of funds raised by the kindness of friends, and by a grant of $350 from the New England Company.\n\nThus a lean-to Washhouse was added to the Playroom, some small rooms built on to the Chapel end of the building, etc., so that the School is much more convenient in some ways than it was formerly.\n\nBut there is no kitchen, so that meals have to be carried over from the other house, where culinary operations are on such a large scale that it is impossible now to give the simple teaching in cookery that girls ought to have to fit them for their after life in this country.\nThe Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge has very kindly given us five Scholarships of ten pounds each a year for some years past, and other friends have helped us most generously, most notably St. Peter's Sunday School, Charlottetown P.E.I.M.T. As a rule, donations towards the maintenance of the Indian School average not more than one hundred dollars a year.\n\nSo that it will be seen that to \"make ends meet\" with sixty dollars a year to come from \"somewhere\" for each child, has hitherto been an almost impossible problem so far as the Indian School is concerned.\n\nQuite impossible, it would have been, without the constant and most generous help of the W.A. and other friends in England and Scotland, who relieve us entirely from all anxiety as to clothing or bedding, and also provide articles for sale, which raises a small fund to meet current expenses in the garden, or for house furnishing etc.\n\nNow we find, by the new arrangements as to Indian Boarding Schools, that if, instead of spending two or three thousand dollars on moving and adding to this present rather unsatisfactory building, we were to raise enough money (perhaps about five thousand dollars) and build a \"Class A School,\" up to modern requirements as to sanitation, ventilation, heating, isolation of infectious diseases, etc., that the Dominion Government would give us the maximum grant of a hundred and twenty-five dollars a year for each pupil, provided that the plans were submitted to, and approved by them.\n\nIt does seem such a splendid opportunity to be taken advantage of! For this would just about make us self-supporting, provided that the W.A. and our other kind friends still helped us with clothing.\n\nEven if the new building only allowed us to take in thirty children, that, with the increased grant would mean a clear gain of seven hundred and fifty dollars a year towards the work of the Church!\n\nWe have the great encouragement of hearing that a sum of six hundred and fifty dollars has already been given in England towards this building fund, and other efforts are being made on our behalf,\n\nMay we plead very earnestly for these children, the descendants of the original owners of this beautiful land among the mountains of the Far West?\n\nWe ask for means to build a suitable house for them, where they may be gathered in to learn all that shall fit them so to fulfil their duty to God and their neighbour in this world, that they may be prepared for their everlasting home in the \"Land which is very far off.\"\n\nALL HALLOWS' INDIAN SCHOOL BUILDING FUND.\n\n| Name               | Amount |\n|--------------------|--------|\n| T.

I just remember we sang to them out in the front.\n\nTheir train stopped right in front of the school. We were all put in rows, and all had maple-leaf branches in our hands, which we waved about when we sang.\n\nThere is only one other girl here who was here at that time.\n\nGrace (aged 13).\n\n(When the King was Duke of Cornwall, he came to visit All Hallows in the West, on October 3rd, 1901. The Royal Train stopped in front of the school, and the Duke and Duchess, with some members of their suite, graciously came in to the school garden, where a maple-leaf pavilion had been erected for them. The children sang a song of welcome specially written for the occasion. Grace was only 3\u00bd years old at the time.)\nABOUT CHRISTMAS (1909).\n\nOn Christmas Eve some of us went to Midnight Celebration. We got up at twelve o'clock. When we came downstairs the old people were singing in the schoolroom\u2014they were learning some Christmas Hymns and Carols.\n\nWhen it was time to go in the Chapel the other people went in first and then we went in last.\n\nIt was a very nice Service. We had one Hymn\u2014it was, \"O come! all ye faithful,\" the other people sang it in Indian, and we sang it in English. One of the little babies was crying in the middle of the Service.\n\nWhen the Service was finished we came out and stayed in the Schoolroom, and one of the Sisters gave us one card each. The card was very nice.\n\nThe Indians had some tea before they went to their homes. When the people went away we went to bed.\n\nElsie Histko.\n\nOUR CLOSING.\n\nI will tell you about our Closing. We had our closing on June the thirtieth, and it was very nice. Some people from the village came to see it. The room was decorated with roses and syringa, and other flowers. The people thought it looked very nice when they saw it.\n\nWe had eighteen kinds of drilling and a play. The play was called \"Grannie's Birthday.\" There were twenty-four girls in it. Eva was the oldest, so she was to be the Grannie. Eva was dressed in a grey skirt, with a white shawl around her, and she had a lace cap on with ribbons on it.\n\nAll her grandchildren were singing to her. There were about seventeen songs, and Grannie sang one song to us. I think the prettiest song was the song Grannie sang to us.\n\nAll the people said it was very nice when it was finished.\n\nAfter that the prizes were given. There were twenty-five prizes. All the girls never got prizes, but some of them got two or three prizes.\n\nMay (aged 13).\n\nA FLOOD.\n\nI will tell you about the Flood at Spence's Bridge.\n\nOne day, about twelve o'clock, there was an old man sitting by the fire, and there was a kettle on the stove. It was boiling. It would make the lid go up\u2014it made it go up three times\u2014and the old said he knew what it meant. This old man lived in the house next to us.\n\nThere were lots of people bathing in the river, and little children. Some were sitting by the river, and this old man came and told them there was going to be a flood, but they would not believe him. He kept telling them to come away from there, but they would not go.\n\nSo he left them alone, and went away. After a while there was a great noise, because all the side of the hills fell down and fell into the river, and stopped the river from running. The water rose over the houses, but it never came to our house because it was on a hill.\n\nLots of people ran for their lives, but many of them were killed. Some men were on horses and they snatched up the children and ran up the hill.\n\nAfter the water went down, they all went down again. Lots of people left that place.\n\nAfter a while some men went down the river, and they found ever so many dead people, and they took them to their people.\n\nThat is all I know about it.\n\nEdith (aged 12).\n\nABOUT A BEAR.\n\nOne day my little brother and I went for a walk at our field near Lytton, and we saw a bear. We ran as fast as we could, and it nearly bit our little dog, and Bob was barking at it, and it ran fast too until we shut the door and ran to our beds; and we wouldn't come out until we were going to cook our tea.\n\nMy little brother and I were scared, and we wouldn't go out at all, until we went to sleep.\nMY GARDEN.\n\nMy garden is in our living-room and a big garden too. It has pretty flowers in it. Two of my gardens are square, and wood around them. I have lots of roses in them, they are all colours. My sweet peas are out now. All the other girls have gardens too, they are bigger than mine. My sunflowers are all getting to be very big. My garden is not very big. One of my plants are dead from root to the end, and so I pulled it up.\n\nFLOWERS.\n\nFlowers are very beautiful. They teach us many things. Violets teach us to be humble\u2014they hide their heads under their leaves: so we shouldn't talk about our good done\u2014we should hide them deep in our hearts. The lily of the valley teaches us to be humble too.\n\nThe white water-lily has her roots way deep in the mud under the water and yet she keeps herself pure and white. Whenever we are, even if the people around us are bad and won't fear God, we must keep our souls pure and clean.\n\nIf our bundies are not washed or mended properly, Sister sends them back to be washed or mended over again.\n\nSometimes we lose care of our clothes, and sometimes we put them on the pipe by the stove and they get burnt.\n\nSometimes we lose care of our stockings, and sometimes we lose care by losing in our stockings.\n\nIf our bundies are not washed or mended properly, Sister sends them back to be washed or mended over again.\n\nVERNON.\n\nThere is lots of Indians in Vernon. When we go to pick hops they painted themselves red, and they wore feathers on their heads. They wore a blanket around themselves, and they sat us to go and catch little fish in the creek.\n\nWe went out singing one day with Elizabeth, we caught eight altogether, and we divided it between us.\n\nEvery night we go to the store to buy some nights we don't.\n\nWhen the month was ended we all went to Salmon Arm again, we went home in a wagon.\n\nJana (aged 11).\n\nHilda (aged 10).\nCHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS (1910).\n\nThe first part of our holidays we had no snow, not till after Christmas this year.\n\nWe all had a lovely time on Christmas Eve, and we all went to bed early. About half-past eleven some of us got up to go to Midnight Celebration.\n\nThe Chapel was beautifully decorated, especially the Altar. On each side of the Aisle there were evergreens, and everything looked so bright.\n\nAfter we came out of Celebration it was a quarter past one, then we had supper and went to bed.\n\nNext morning, as you may suppose, we were all busy with our stockings, and at ten minutes to seven we were all singing Carols.\n\nWe had breakfast at half past eight, we all got such a lot of presents too.\n\nAfter Mattins we all went down to the dining hall and had our Christmas dinner there. We had two turkeys, and after that came the pudding which was very nice.\n\nWe had a still more lovely time on Monday afternoon, when we had our Christmas Tree in the Schoolroom.\n\nWe all got such nice useful things, the tree looked so lovely when lighted.\n\nAnd after Christmas we had such a lovely time sleighriding after the snow fell, although we had some very cold weather for some days.\n\nIsabel (aged 15).\n\nCHRISTMAS TREE.\n\nWe were longing to look at the Christmas Tree. We were singing when we were going to get our presents off the Christmas Tree. Some of the dolls looked very nice. Lizzie got a nice doll with a brown hair and a blue ribbon and a pink dress.\n\nLots of the girls got small little dollys, they were the ones that Miss Flower dressed and she gave them to the girls. Canada and Celia got a nice scrap book off the Christmas tree, and some of the girls got a nice skipping rope.\n\nThere was a nice Santa Claus on top of the Christmas tree.\n\nSusan (aged 10).\n\nA SNOW STORM.\n\nIt was Sunday when it began snowing so hard. When we went to bed it was still snowing, but we went to sleep without hardly thinking of the snow. When most of us were asleep the snow was coming in at the windows, for they are usually open at night. A little while after that Sister came in and brushed the snow off the beds and dried the clothes that were wet.\n\nThe next day it was very cold, and the windows were frozen over, and such pretty patterns that Jack Frost had drawn in the night. The snow was quite deep by then, so that it was too deep for the ditch on the hill, the water came pouring down the hill, right down into the back kitchen, at first we thought it was mud coming down the hill, it was so muddy. And the river was frozen.\n\nAnd after the snowstorm was over we went for a lovely walk, we saw big pieces of ice. They looked so pretty.\n\nJanet (aged 11).\n\nSPRING.\n\nWhen Spring comes all the things seem to wake up, everything is asleep in winter, and the snow is the blanket. When the snow begins to melt, all the flowers begin to wake, the trees put on their green leaves, the birds begin building their nests, even the people seem to wake up for they walk about more. Everything is green, as if the whole earth had put on a green dress, the grass comes up nice and fresh.\n\nSpringtime is when we begin digging our gardens, and put in our seeds.\n\nJennie.\nST. PATRICK'S PRAYER\n\nThere were Grace and Nellie, little lass when I left, now they had grown into big girls that I hardly recognised them, and saw so many strange faces; the music also was changed in Chapel, I almost expected to hear the same tunes that we used to sing.\n\nI don't think we were idle during the week we stayed at the old School; we were either out for walks, enjoying our favourite haunts, or helping to pick cherries, or helping to take care of the little ones, as it was a few days before the Closing and everybody was too busy. We were often invited to stay to Lunch by an old school friend who now had a house in town, which we always gladly accepted.\n\nAll holidays must end; the week I spent at Yale seemed to me to be the shortest I have ever spent; we would dearly have loved to have stayed longer; and what lovely bouquets Sister gave us before we left, the bouquets were nearly as large as ourselves. So the week ended at Yale, never to be forgotten.\n\nEmma Chiltonen.\n\nNEWS OF \"OLD GIRLS\"\n\nCristina (Mrs. F.

There was the same old book that we used to pore over, and I saw the places where we often had picnics, and it sounded like the same little birds that used to have their homes there, where they were just simply changed anything, there were the cherry trees that we used to climb, what leaves we used to have! they were just simply loaded with cherries now, as they were seven years ago, and what a feast we had again before we left.\n\nCOPY\nClara (Mrs. Clare), had another dear little boy last summer; they have moved to the Section-house near Yale Creek.\n\nEsther (Mrs. Lynes) has a large family of boys and girls, she was living at Okanagan Landing.\n\nRosie (Mrs. Mitchell) was staying with Dora (Mrs. Walters) near Savonas last summer with her little children; Dora has a sturdy little boy and a dear little baby girl.\n\nLizzie Kirkpatrick is staying with her aunt on the Cariboo Road, and leads a very busy life indeed, but likes to hear from the old School.\n\nCassie, or Katie, Fowler is still keeping house for her father, and writes very interesting letters about all her doings from time to time.\n\nPhyllis (Mrs. Joe) has been to see us each summer with some of her little children.\n\nElizabeth is still in service in Caulford, she sent a large sum for the Missionary Box last year.\n\nJosephine, who is living at Chilliwack, also helped with the Missionary Box, so did Elsie, who is in Taconia, and Bee and Ada, who are both in service at Ashcroft, and very happy to be together.

(Taken from Department's Letter of Nov. 20th 1894, file no.: 120, 050)\n\nWe also have the honour to enclose you a copy of our School Magazine being the first number published entirely for the Indian School.\n\nYours Truly,\nConstance, Sister Superior.\nOttawa June 8, 1911\n\nMadam,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 2nd instant I beg to inform you that under the new agreement regarding the maintenance and management of the All Hallows boarding school the per capita grant will be paid from April 1st last on the average attendance of the authorized number of pupils in residence at the school each quarter. The per capita grant will therefore not be calculated for each pupil individually and a scale of payment will not be required.\n\nI also beg to acknowledge with thanks the copy of the school magazine \"All Hallows in the West.\"\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nAsst Deputy and Secretary\n\nConstance Sister Superior\nAll Hallows Boarding School\nYale, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nMany thanks for your letter of May 26th regarding school holidays.\n\nAs the summers are generally so hot here we have usually had about 2 months' holiday from classroom work, but have gone on with industrial work, & such classes as Scripture. Sometimes piping etc., or when many young children were here, with reading & writing for them.\n\nDuring this time some of the pupils were sent home for 3 weeks with leave from the Department.\n\nWe are glad to see they may go home for a month this year, but at whose discretion may they go? Do we still have them in their names & numbers & by Department? Or is it at our discretion to send home those whom we think fit?\n\nAlso would you please tell us whether they must have classroom work all the summer, except for that one month, or whether we may do as in former years.\n\nWe propose having their School closin\non Coronation Day, if possible, (June 22nd)\nand sending home all who can go on\nJuly 5th till August 5th.\n\nWe shall be much obliged if you\nwill please inform us as to whether\nthis course would be approved by the\nDepartment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nConstance, Sister Superior C.H.\nI herewith enclose a letter from Constance, Sister Superior of the All Hallows Indian Boarding School at Yale, B.C., asking for certain information with respect to Boarding Schools, which I must ask you to supply direct to her, as I will be absent from this city for at least two weeks. The opening paragraph refers to Clauses 14 and 15 of the Contract, which I forwarded to her. You will note that she desires to close the school on Coronation Day, June 22, whereas the Contract stipulates that the holidays shall be between 1st July and October 1st (for one month), unless some other course is sanctioned by the Superintendent General.\n\nI would suggest that the Department should furnish all principals of Boarding Schools with a copy of the Contract; also a copy of the Department's letter mailed to representatives of religious bodies interested in Indian education.\n\nA copy of the amended scale of payment should also be forwarded to all principals of Boarding Schools as well as to the various Indian Agents.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, June 15, 1911.\n\nMadam,\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn has forwarded to the Department your letter to him of the 2nd instant with the request that a reply be sent you direct. I, therefore, beg to inform you that under the terms of the new agreement relating to the future maintenance and management of boarding schools Clause 15 of the said agreement, which deals with the annual vacation, class-room work and the discretionary powers granted in allowing pupils to visit their homes, is as follows: \"To have school-room exercises on five and industrial exercises on six days in each week, legal holidays excepted; and excepting also a vacation day not to exceed one month between the first of July and the first day of October in each year, unless some other course is expressly sanctioned by the Superintendent General. During the vacation the pupils may, in the discretion of the Management be permitted to visit their homes, but the Superintendent General will not pay any part of the cost of transportation either going or returning.\"\n\nIt is thought that the above clause quoted from the agreement fully covers the matters dealt with in your letter to Inspector Ditchburn, excepting the time on which you wish to close the school for the annual vacation and the sending to their homes of all pupils whom you allow to go. The Department will allow you to close the school for the annual vacation on the 22nd instant, as you have arranged, but the full grant can only be paid for one month from that date.\n\nRev. Sister Constance,\nSister Superior,\nAll Hallows Boarding School,\nYale, B.C.\ndate and, should you permit the pupils to remain home till August 5th, you will lose the grant for such as are absent after July 22nd, the date on which the school should re-open and all pupils be in residence.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nOttawa, June 17, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 6th instant enclosing a communication from the Principal of the All Hallows Boarding School I beg to inform you that, as requested by you, a reply has been sent direct to the Principal.\n\nThe Department is having printed a further supply of the new agreement relating to the future maintenance and management of boarding schools, as well as copies of the Department's letter to the representatives of the different religious bodies interested in Indian education and as soon as they are received from the printer a copy of each will be sent to all Indian Agents and the Principals of the schools interested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. H. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B.C.\nTo the Secretary of the Indian Department for Schools.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am writing to say that I shall be leaving for England on the 23rd of this month, and shall probably be away till November. Sister Matilda will Principal of the school till then. Therefore sign all necessary papers in my absence.\n\nFinancial matters will be attended to by Sister Louise \"Dappo\" who will act as Sister in Charge of both schools, and make any changes in the Bank.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nConstance Fisher, Superior C.M.M.\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 120050/1, dated June 15th, 1911, regarding vacation of pupils, we decided upon receipt of the letter simply to hold the closing exercises of the School on June 22nd as already arranged, being Coronation Day. We will continue School work until July 5th.\n\nTherefore the pupils will not be allowed to leave School until July 5th so that they may return upon August 5th.\n\nYours Truly,\nSister Athelie C.A.H.\nSister in Charge - in absence\ninstead of the Sister Superior.\nAll Hallows' Boarding School\nYale B.C.\nApril 1st, 1912\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe are today forwarding to the Indian Agent at Lytton our Annual Report, with Financial Statement, also list of employees, and the Quarterly Register, list of Admissions and Discharges. We have not been asked this year for any further returns, so these are all we have sent.\n\nWe have been in serious difficulty over the non-arrival of the grant for the December Quarter. Our papers were filed in on, or just after, January 1st, but we have had no money yet. The same thing happened last year.\n\nWe applied last autumn, through our Indian Agent, for a new floor for the Children's Playroom, and two new flush-tanks for the two bathrooms, but, though we wrote again in December, we have had no reply at all about this.\n\nThe floor is badly worn, and the toilet in one of the bathrooms cannot be used, we have not had it in use for months. This has occasioned very great inconvenience all the while.\n\nIt is no use our writing to the Agent, we can get no answer to our\nletters. He has not been once to visit the school since he was appointed. About a year and a half ago (I think) he came down for a few minutes late one evening to speak about something, but did not wish to see the schools.\n\nMr. A. E. Green, the School Inspector, who visited us in January, promised to do something in the matter of our floor, and flush tanks, as well as some other things, but, though we wrote him in the meantime on another matter, we have had no word from him since we were promised a sewing machine for pupil No. 110, etc., on her leaving school nearly two years ago. We have lived in Chase (Shuswap) B.C. and Thompson have written again and again about nothing has been done.\n\nMr. Dilleyburn was most kind and helpful when we were in his inspectorate, but we do not know who the new Inspector is, and shall be very grateful if you can give us assistance in the above-mentioned matters.\n\nWe are needing more school supplies badly, but, when we sent our application through the Agent, it was about 7 months before we could get the things. May we send it direct to you?\n\nYours truly,\n\nConstance Sisson Superior.\nOttawa, April 16, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant in reference to the payment of the grant for the All Hallows Boarding School for the December quarter.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department regrets very much that this return has not come to hand and the Agent has been telegraphed to and asked to forward it immediately. In the meantime an advance of $1000.00 covering the December and March quarters is being sent you. The account will be finally adjusted when the returns are received.\n\nWith regard to the repairs to the building I may say that this building is not the property of the Department and it cannot be responsible for repairs.\n\nWith regard to your application for school supplies I have to ask you to be good enough to send your requisitions direct to the Department and the matter will receive immediate attention.\n\nYour remarks with regard to the purchase of a sewing machine for pupil No. 0110 are noted. I may say that this matter was also taken up with the Agent but no reply was received from him. He will be again communicated.\n\nRev. Sister Constance,\nSister Superior,\nAll Hallows Boarding School,\nYale, B.C.\ncated with. The Department regrets very much the delay.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nTo the Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs\nOttawa\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe wish to close the School for the Summer vacation on July 2 this year, and, as I am intending to leave for England on or about July 3, and propose to be absent about 3 months, we wish to know whether we may allow the girls to be away for two weeks longer, of course, forgiving the school for that extra fortnight?\n\nIt is most essential that their teachers should have the 6 weeks' holiday in the Summer, and, as I should not be here during the vacation this year, Archdeacon Pugh (who is in charge of the Indian Mission work) strongly advises our applying to the Department for the extra leave this year.\n\nThe Archdeacon says it will be good both for the children and their parents, as well as for the School.\n\nWe should be very grateful if the Department will kindly grant this leave.\n\nWe have two competent teachers ready to resume duties on August 15th.\n\nYours Truly,\n\n[Signature]\nVice-Master C.A.H.\n[Signature]\nMiss Superior\nOttawa, June 6, 1922.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd ultimo, and in reply I beg to say that the Department is prepared to grant an additional two weeks' holidays to the pupils of the All Hallows Boarding School upon condition that the grant will not be paid for that period.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Sister Althea, C.A.H.,\nVice-Principal,\nAll Hallows' Boarding School,\nYale, B.C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nAccountant's and Schools Branches -\n\nThe management of the All Hallows Yale Boarding school, B.C., represent that they are unable to meet their financial obligations under the present grant, and desire to have the school placed in Class A, although it is without the steam heating plant and the stone or cement foundation; these two they claim are not necessary there and consequently should not be insisted upon, in order to allow the school to be classified as requested. I am not at all convinced by the argument advanced, but at the same time if anything can be done towards helping them financially, it should be given careful consideration.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nAll Hallows' Boarding School\nYale B.C.\nDiv. 2. 1912.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have been advised that as some of the girls from the first families in the Province attend our Canadian School, and so the girls in our Indian School receive special care and attention, that this school ought to rank as a \"Class A\" School. If you could recommend this we should be very grateful.\n\nThe buildings have been put into thorough repair - we are still collecting funds to enable us to put up an entirely new building.\n\nYours Truly,\nConstance, Sister Superior C.H.S.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nNo.\n\nALSO TO DATE OF THIS LETTER.\n\nLyton, B.C.\n\nDec. 6th, 1912\n\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter received from the Sister Superior of All Hallows School Yale.\n\nI would like to suggest that the Sister Superiors request be granted and that this School be classed as a \"Class A\" School.\n\nI have visited this School regularly every month since I took charge of this Agency, and I haven't the slightest hesitation in making this request, as the children are all well advanced, and very good work generally is being done there, and I think that if this will assist them, which they certainly need, there is no doubt in my mind but that this request should be granted.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa, Ont.\nSir,\n\nWhen I visited All Hallows Indian School for girls, the Asst. Principal Sister Althea showed me the sewing machine that they had had for a great number of years to teach the girls sewing on, but which is now completely worn out and useless, quite beyond repair.\n\nShe asked if if I would apply to the Department for assistance in getting a new one at a cost of about $50.00.\n\nAs sewing is one of the trades taught the girls and a very useful one too, I would like to suggest that the Department sanction this Assistance to the School.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa. Ont.\nMEMORANDUM -\n\nMr. Redley:-\n\nIn reply to your memorandum of the 9th December, I would say that the grant for the All Hallows Yale Boarding School was raised from $60.00 to $100.00 from the 1st April, 1911, and no demands whatever have been made for improvements to qualify for this per capita grant.\n\nOur Architects have not been sent to British Columbia to inspect the buildings and to report what repairs and improvements if any must be made to bring the school up to the standard of Class \"C\". Pressure of other work has kept them at Headquarters. It should be possible, however, to do this next year.\n\nProbably the building would qualify for Class \"C\", but there is no doubt that it would not make the school eligible to Class \"A\". While the two items mentioned\u2014the heating plant and the stone or cement foundation\u2014are in Class \"A\", the general character of the building must also be considered.\nconsidered so that there is no argument to claim that they are not necessary to All Hallows, and, therefore, the school should be in a higher rank.\n\nI notice an enclosure with Agent Graham's letter of December 6th, from the Sister Superior in charge, - She states: \"We are still collecting funds to enable us to put up an entirely new building.\" If the plans for this building were passed upon by the Department and were found to entitle the school to be placed in Class \"A\", and if the School Authorities guaranteed to begin the erection on a certain date, it would be possible for us to begin to pay the grant at $125.00 per capita per annum, and I think this is the most favorable treatment that could be given them, and it is quite in line with our treatment of other schools.\n\nI see on this file an application from Agent Graham, dated December 6th, asking for a sewing machine for the school, which they should supply themselves under the contract.\n\nConsidering the various demands of these Boarding Schools in the past, I think the contract system has worked well in defining the lines of expenditure, and I think\nthink it would be wise to adhere as closely as possible to the contract.\n\nChief Accountant.\nJ. D. McLean Esq.\nAsst. Deputy and Secy.\nIndian Affairs.\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith enclose to you a letter from Sister Constance, Superior of All Hallow's School, Yale B.C., in which she asks to have the School placed in Class \"A\". I knew the conditions which surround the school and I do not hesitate to say that it is kept perfectly clean and airy and I can always testify to the good work this institution has been doing for years. Is it possible to have the request granted?\n\nWould you please supply me with the Department's regulations in regard to classifying schools.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nDear Sir,\n\nWe have been advised that, as some of the girls from the first families in the Province attend our Canadian School, and as the girls from our Indian School receive equal care and attention, that therefore this School ought to be a Class A School now, without waiting for a new building.\n\nOur M. P. - Mr. Taylor, said he would try and see this done, but we thought it would be a great help if you could very kindly recommend this?\n\nMr. Taylor points out that it does not say a Class A School \"must\" have either a furnace or a basement, but only that they \"should\" have them... & he says a furnace is not necessary in B.C. and a basement is very unsuitable on account of the dampness - it certainly would be so with both these in our case.\n\nThe buildings have all been put into good\nExtract from Inspector's Report on the All Hallows Boarding School for the month of January.

It would be well for you to familiarize yourself with the requirements of the various classes of schools as set forth in the agreement for their maintenance and management, a copy of which you have.\n\nReferring also to your other communication of the same date with regard to the sewing machine, you will see from this agreement that equipment of this kind must be furnished by the schools.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMarch 11th, 1914.\n\nDear Mr. Taylor -\n\nReferring to our conversation in regard to the status of the Yale (All Hallows) Indian Boarding School, I could state that this matter has been before the Department on previous occasions but I have now looked into it carefully myself and for your information I wish to give in detail a statement of the circumstances.\n\nOn the 1st of April, 1911, the Department entered into a contract with the various churches and bodies interested for the maintenance and management of boarding schools. All these institutions were divided into three classes:\n\nA.- First-class buildings owned by the churches or societies.\n\nB.- Buildings owned by the Government.\n\nC.- Buildings of a lower grade than A owned by the Churches.\n\nJ. D. Taylor, Esq., M.P.,\nHouse of Commons,\nOttawa, Ont.\nIn the best schools under Grade A are to receive $125.00 per capita and schools under B and C $100.00 per capita.\n\nThe requirements for Grade A call for a substantial building on a stone foundation, with a pure water supply, sanitary closets and drainage, hospital accommodation, modern system of ventilation and sufficient air space in dormitories and class rooms, modern heating apparatus and sufficient area of land for farms and gardens.\n\nClass C calls for buildings which must be sanitary and in good repair, with hospital accommodation, modern system of ventilation and sufficient area of land for farms and gardens; you will note that they are not required to have a foundation, modern heating, sanitary water closets and drainage nor a modern heating apparatus.\n\nInformation before the Department tends to show very clearly that the All Hallows could not qualify for Grade A, and in some respects it is doubtful whether it could qualify strictly for Grade C notwithstanding this the grant was at once raised in 1911 from $60.00 to $100.00 and has been paid at that rate since. They have not sufficient dormitory accommodation for the pupilage provided although they have for the number of children at present in attendance, nor have they a modern system of\nof ventilation, and as a matter of fact the building is in such bad repair that it is said to be very cold in the stormy winter months. The authorities themselves were so impressed with the need of new buildings that in a letter from the Principal, dated January 24th, 1911, it was stated that the main building was old, erected in 1890, with no basement, kitchen or laundry and that they wished to build a new school to qualify under Class A. Unfortunately, however, they were not able to arrange for the necessary finances and the matter was dropped.\n\nI would like very much to do something in the direction asked for by the Principal but I am sure you will appreciate the difficulty when it is remembered that we have a number of institutions throughout the country in the same category and it could hardly be considered politic to make an exception in favour of any particular school. I may say that in all cases we have rigidly adhered to our classification and I wish also to emphasize the substantial increase in the per capita grant above referred to, which was made without any restrictions.\n\nI hope, in the not far distant future, to have one of our architects visit the Province of British Columbia with a view to inspecting and reporting upon conditions at\nat all our residential schools and I shall await with interest the result of his inspection of this institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nDear Sir,\n\nIt has been decided that it will be necessary for me to leave for England early in June, to be absent for 6 months or possibly a year.\n\nThe Sister Superior (Principal) will superintend the work of the Indian School during my absence, with the aid of the necessary staff.\n\nYours Truly,\nSister Athina C.A.H.\nVice Principal\nOttawa, May 14, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Sister Althea, Vice Principal of the All Hallows Boarding School, in which she states that it is necessary for her to leave for England early in June to be absent for six months or possibly a year and that during her absence the Sister Superior will superintend the work with the aid of the necessary staff.\n\nThe Department approves of the leave of absence required by the Vice Principal and you will be good enough to inform her accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

Rev. A. W. Siletto, Bishop of New Westminster, as a precedent for this course being taken earlier, in connection with advances made from a Parliamentary Appropriation to the Church of England towards the construction of buildings for the Industrial Institution at Elkhorn in Manitoba.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\nJune 6th,\n\nMy Dear Bishop Sillitoe,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo; I understand that \"All Hallows\" was the school at Yale, the house purchased from Mr. Underwood, and that you wished to add to it, and to purchase a field owned by a man named Alloway, or some such name, who had an orchard adjoining; the sum of $1,500 for buildings, and $500 for the purchase of land were therefore voted by Parliament during the Session of 1889.\n\nIf a start can be made at once on the buildings, and a rough plan and estimate of cost of what is proposed to be erected sent to the Department before the 30th instant, with a request for the $1,500, and stating that it is your intention to prosecute the work to\nto completion, I will endeavour to secure the amount for you.\n\nNo difficulty should be experienced in closing for the land and in securing the $600. On a report from you that negotiations for the purchase of the land (here state the quantity) have been completed, I think we can pay you the $600. You might wire me whether your report can be sent in before the 30th instant.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRt. Rev. Bishop Sillitoe, D.D.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nNew Westminster,\nMay 30, 90\n\nMy dear Mr. Secretary,\n\nMany thanks for your letter.\n\nIt has been impossible for me to begin work on the new building for reasons as the character and extent of them necessarily depended upon the funds at my disposal. I did not suppose that I could calculate certainly in the vote being passed, or I would have gone to work earlier. However, I will do whatever we can as possible. The site is determined upon, and rough plans have been drawn, but we have gone no further yet. I presume that it will be sufficient for the securing of the appropriation that we should actually have commenced work, and not positively complete it before June 30th.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAlbion Westminister\nReport of school building goes forward today\n\nBishop of New Westminster\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to report to you that the contract for the new buildings in addition of Allakawin School, Yale, has been let.\n\nThe amount of the contract is $3300.00.\n\nTwo car loads of lumber have already been forwarded to Yale and the work will be actively proceeded. I have $500.00 in hand and under the Government grant there will be a deficiency of but $300.00 which I anticipate no difficulty in raising. I therefore beg to make application for the grant of $500.00.\n\nI regret to say that owing to a mortgage on Allaway's property I have been unable as yet to make an arrangement for the purchase of the additional land. I am still in negotiation with the mortgagee, Mr. O'Reilly, the Indian Revenue Commissioner, and I hope before the 30th to be\nin a position to wire you favorably.\n\nShould the unoccupied site be in any possibility of the $500 grant being applied towards the deficiency; and furnishing?\n\nI am, my dear Sir,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

To take from the owner a deed of the portion he needs;\n\n2. To execute a release of this portion from the encumbrance of the mortgage, in consideration of the Government grant of $500;\n\n3. To hold the mortgage on the remainder of the property himself; and in connection with his proposed acquirement of the property His Lordship asks that the sum proposed to be paid by the Department, viz., $500, be placed in Mr. Supt. Vowell's hands, to be exchanged for a\n\nHon. E. Dewdney,\n\nSupt. General of Indian Affairs.\nclear title as soon as ready, the undersigned begs to report that the quantity of land for which the Department agreed to pay $500 was to consist of six acres. His Lordship does not state in his letter that the portion of the land for which he proposes to take a deed from the owner thereof and to release from the encumbrance of the mortgage in consideration of the Government grant of $500 contains six acres or thereabouts.\n\nIn a previous letter received from the Bishop, dated the 23rd September 1889, he says the lot contains about six acres, and in a letter of the 23rd June 1890, he describes the land in question under the term \"Allways\" property, but he gives no other description of it.\n\nHis Lordship was informed, in reply to the letter last referred to, that the Department would require to obtain a perfect title to the six acres of land before it could pay over the $500 which Parliament had voted for the purchase of the same. If the Department was assured that the portion of land referred to by the Bishop, a deed of which he proposes to take from the owner, did contain about six acres and that His Lordship's title thereto was clear which could only be ascertained after the title deeds had been examined by the Crown Law authorities, there would then be no objection to forwarding the money to Mr. Visiting Indian Supt. Vowell, to be handed to the Bishop, as suggested by the latter.\n\nAs to the form of title the undersigned is of opinion that it should be in the shape of a deed from the Bishop of New Westminster, or from whomsoever it is vested in to Her Majesty; and that, in order that the land\nmay be properly described in the deed, it will be necessary to obtain a clear description of the same, as it would not appear that we as yet have such a description as would be sufficient to enable the Solicitor of the Department to correctly prepare the conveyance.\n\nDeputy Supt.

General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSir,\n\nReferring to the letter to your predecessor dated the 1st April 1892 respecting the site for the English Church Boarding School at Yale B.C., I now enclose a description and plan of the property to be purchased jointly by the Bishop of New Westminster and this Department but the title for which this Department is advised by Messrs Corbould, McColl, Wilson and Campbell, of New Westminster, Barristers, is now complete in the Bishop of New Westminster, and they ask that your Department instruct its Agent at the above place to see that the title is correct and that the proposed provisions are inserted in the conveyance referred to in my letter to your predecessor above quoted.\n\nMay I ask you to be good enough to communicate with your Agent at New Westminster with a view to his carrying out the suggestion made by the above named firm.\n\nI would be glad if you would return the plan and description when done with.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nSir,\n\nI would be very much obliged if you will give me all the information you can in reference to a certain sum of $500.00 which was given Bishop Sillitoe about the year 1893 in order that he might purchase 5 acres of land for the All Hallows Boarding School.\n\nIt appears that he bought the five acres, and paid over the money for the same, and only obtained a deed for one acre, that upon which the School now stands; the other five acres were not surveyed at the time so no deed could be given.\n\nBishop Sillitoe died in 1894, and presumably nothing more was done in the matter, the Sisters always taking for granted that the land belonged to them, as they have had the use of it eversince, but the man who pre-empted died without ever setting his deeds upon it, and now the land reverted to the Crown, and it has now been applied for by another man.\n\nI have lodged a protest with the Government Agent, against this pre-emption being granted.\n\nKindly advise me what steps to take in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa.

Jemett, D.L.S., and a plan and description submitted to and approved of by the Department and the money paid as above stated. On receipt of a letter from the Deputy Minister of Justice here saying that he had just received a letter from the Agent of the Minister of Justice at Vancouver stating that the conveyance of the site of the above named school to the Bishop of New Westminster and his successors in trust for the purposes of the proposed school is now complete and a good title to the property thereby vested in the Bishop.

Sir,\n\nWe are trying to get a teacher for our school here and I wish to appeal to you for any help or information you can give me.\n\nMy own children are the only white children in the vicinity but there are several Indian children which I am sure would take advantage of a school if a teacher was provided. Here is a good school house, well furnished. We have four children of school age.\n\nI took the matter of procuring a teacher up with the Dept. of Education at Victoria some time ago but was advised that a teacher could not be sup-\nplied unless an average of at least ten white pupils could be guaranteed.\n\nI understand however that the Dominion Government is responsible for the education of the Indian children. Is there no way therefore in which terms can be concluded whereby a teacher can be furnished?\n\nOur children have been here now nearly a year and a half with no school facilities and as before stated there are several Indian children whom I think would be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity of attending school. He would gladly pay $10.00 or $15.00 per month towards a teacher's salary if that would be any inducement or help out of the difficulty.\n\nPlease let me know at your earliest convenience what can be done.\n\nSincerely,\n\nP.H.

Puffer, of Spuzzum, B.C., has written the Department, recommending that it establish a day school there and stating that he would be willing to contribute not less than $100.00 a year towards the maintenance of the school.\n\nThe census return shows that there are about thirty children of school age and in your last annual report you state that some of them attend at Spuzzum Station and at All Hallows, Yale, but the last return shows only one at the latter institution.\n\nThe Department would like to know how many are attending the school at Spuzzum Station and how far it is from the reserve. From Mr. Puffer's letter it would appear that this school is closed, as he states that there is a good, well-furnished school-house available, and all that is required is a teacher.

I shall make a full report after I have carefully looked into the various conditions affecting those Indians. In the meantime I might be allowed to express the opinion from such knowledge as I have that the conditions do not appear favorable. The band is somewhat scattered, and divided religiously. Either denomination would prefer no school to one controlled by the other; and we could only hope to carry on a school in so small and sparsely settled a community in conjunction with missionary work, as the inducements otherwise would preclude the probability of securing a teacher. I am in favor of secular schools where conditions would warrant them.\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nA. Swin\n\nJ.D.

Please help us to get the school started as early as you can as we have twenty one children here old enough to go to school and a lot more small children will go to school as they get old enough too. You know the Win Johnson children was not accepted or admitted into the Lytton Indian School on account of not healthy. They cannot help being that way their father is crippled cannot work, has to live cheap or the best they can get along therefore his children looks sickly. But they want to go to school to better their future.\n\nJohn Chapman and Tommy Johnson and Patrick Charley has children old enough to go to school and a lot more small children.\n\nWin Bob wants his children to go to school here or at home if we get the school opened here. My children was ready to go to the St Mary's Mission School but on account of sickness.\nhad to keep them home one girl has heart trouble and the boy has kidney trouble into his bed every night.

I called a meeting in Chief James Paul's house Sunday March 22nd 1925, and I called their attention to the supplying of fuel to the schoolhouse. Everyone here was willing to supply and keep it supplied with fuel, secondly I called their attention of sending their children to school every school day. To this effect every parent here at Spuzzum promised before Chief James Paul that they will guarantee to send their children to school every school day. You will see their signatures on second sheet.\n\nAll of the young fellows will supply the cook stove and heating stove for the schoolhouse and keep it repaired. And all of the signatures is willing to promise and guarantee to you when you come here to inspect our schoolhouse.\n\nWm Bob and Mack Bob cannot promise to have their children come to Spuzzum because they are working at Yale for the C.P.R.

There is apparently a building on the reserve, which could be used for a classroom.

The desks have been all stowed away in the loft, so we could not quite see the exact number, but we think that there will be sufficient of them.\n\nAs the winter is now approaching, and the children all have to travel a considerable distance, besides some having to cross the river, we came to the conclusion that we would recommend that the school be given a trial, starting on the 1st of April, next, and that it should be run for five months until the last of September, when the children go with their parents to the hopfields, and by the end of that time we would be in a position to see whether we considered the Indians were sincere, and anxious enough to keep this school open. The Indians promised to provide fuel.\n\nUnder the circumstances I would like to recommend that the Department give this their favorable consideration, and make provision to provide a teacher.

Your recommendation that a school be given a trial, starting on the first of April, next, and running for five months, is noted.

Bearing this in mind I am convinced that we shall be considered unreasonable if we ask the Department to open another school near Kamloops, for a handful of children for whom provision already exists.\n\nKindly let me hear from you at an early date.\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n(signed) J.

It is considered that it will be possible in the near future to provide for the educational requirements of the children of this Band at the Kamloops and Lytton Indian Residential Schools.\n\nI have to thank you for your report concerning your visit to Spuzzum.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, B.C.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 602, Holden Bldg.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOttawa, November 18th, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a communication from Mr. R. H. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Schools, reporting on a visit made in company with yourself to the Spuzzum Reserve to investigate the application made by the Indians for a school. Mr. Cairns forwards a copy of your report, as well as a communication from Rev. Father Welch, O.M.I. We note that there are approximately 14 children of school age, half of whom are Anglican and the other half children of Roman Catholic parents. It is also noted that Father Welch states that, after consulting with several of the local missionaries of his Church, the general opinion is that the Catholic children of the Spuzzum Reserve should be sent to the Kamloops Indian Residential School, where there is sufficient accommodation to provide for them.\n\nI would, therefore, request that you take the earliest possible steps to have the Catholic children of school age and who are in good health placed in the Kamloops School. Applications for their admission and certificates of health should be forwarded in the usual manner. Relative to the children of Anglican parents, I may say that it is hoped in the near future to be able to enlarge the Lytton Indian Residential School and these children could then be sent there. At the present time we have no funds available to start day school operations for the children of the Spuzzum Band. I shall be pleased to hear later as to the success achieved in having the Catholic children sent to Kamloops. If there should be any vacancies later at the Lytton School, consideration should be given by the Principal and yourself to having some of the Anglican children sent to that school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter of the 15th inst., in regard to the application of the Spuzzum Indians for a day school on their reserve, and note that the Department is not in a position to open up a school for this band, and that the children should be sent (that is the Roman Catholic ones) to Kamloops Residential School.\n\nI will be obliged if it is the Department's wish that I should go to the expense of having the constable round up these children, and take them all the way to Kamloops. I might state that I have written to the Rev. James Maguire, principal of the school, and told him of the Department's wish, and suggested that he come down himself to get these children, as well as four others at Agassiz, that they are unable to take into the Mission School, that I have been in communication about. We are only too pleased to give him all the assistance in our power, but feel that the Department does not wish us to go to the expense of collecting these children and taking them to Kamloops.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nOttawa, December 2nd, 1925.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 24th ultimo, relative to the placing of the Roman Catholic children of school age of the Spuzzum Band in the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that if the Rev. Principal visits the locality for the purpose of recruiting the Catholic children you should render him any assistance you can, and, if necessary, utilize the services of the constable. The Department will be responsible for the expenses incurred, including the transportation of the children, but will not be responsible for the transportation or recruiting expenses of the Principal or any other party who comes from the school to obtain the children. You should be definitely assured that all children sent to Kamloops are Roman Catholic. Applications for admission and certificates of health should be forwarded in the usual manner.\n\nThe transportation of the 4 children referred to by you at Agassiz will also be paid, provided they are sent to Kamloops.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Say 12 months = $480.00\n(b) Cost of school furniture as per list $57.80.\n\nThe number of children who would attend school during the winter months would not be less than fifteen (15).\n\nThe attitude of the Indians toward commencing this school is favorable. They appear to understand the nature and benefits of such an institution, and I judge from my observations during a recent visit to this (Black Sparshaws) reserve that there should be no difficulty experienced in keeping up the stipulated attendance.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Besides five families with several children have moved out to Alkali Flat, so that it will be extremely difficult to have a daily average of more than six children.\n\nWe petition the Indians Department to enforce the attendance of the Indian children from the Reserves in the immediate vicinity and request that children who can come without much inconvenience shall be compelled to do so.\n\nThere are several children at Rikai Reserve over ten years of age, some six or seven at Spahiam Reserve, and a few more who can quite well come in from Alkali Flat.\n\nSincerely,\n\nYours truly,\nHally Blackford\nOttawa August 2, 1911.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of a letter addressed to you by Miss Blachford, teacher of the Lytton day school, in regard to the attendance.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like you to inform these Indians that it must insist upon their children attending school regularly or the Regulations relating to the Education of Indian Children will have to be enforced. A copy of these Regulations is being sent you herewith and I shall be glad to hear from you again in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B.

McLean\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nE. B. Drummond, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, April 25, 1912.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nReferring to our conversation when you were in Ottawa recently in reference to the salaries paid at the Sholus and Lytton Day Schools I beg to state as follows:\n\nOn February 12th, last, upon receipt of a report from Mr. Inspector A. E. Green on the Sholus School, in which the qualifications and work of Mr. R. C. Morris were spoken of in very commendatory terms, and as no salary had been fixed for Mr. Morris, the Department decided to pay him at the rate of $600.00 per annum and further to allow Mr. Morris a special grant for her work among the Indian girls and the women on the reserve, should future reports justify the Department in making such a grant. It is considered, therefore, that this is a fair salary at the commencement for Mr. Morris, when it is taken into consideration that he has also a residence provided.\n\nWith reference to the Lytton School, which is in charge of Miss Blachford, I beg to say that the salary paid now is $400.00 per annum, which is the usual Departmental grant to teachers of day schools in British Columbia. It must be remembered that Miss Blachford has no professional qualifications and also that the attendance at this school\n\nVen. Archdeacon Edward W. W. Pugh,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\nis comparatively low. No returns have been received since the September quarter, last, but the last two which came to hand showed an average attendance of six and seven respectively. The Department recognizes that Miss Blashford is a faithful worker and, should she be able to show in future returns any substantial increase in the enrolment and average attendance, the Department will be prepared to consider the granting to her of some increase to her present salary.\n\nI have to ask you to be good enough to request the teacher of both the Sholus and Lytton schools to forward duplicates of their returns for the December and March quarters in order that payment of the salaries due for these two periods may be made. These returns should be sent direct by the teachers to the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLEAN\n\nAssistant Deputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nLytton, B.C., June 19, 1912.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFile 319.651/1, Feb. 16, 1912.\n\nThe above covers the subject of the attendance of children at the Lytton Day School, and in reply, I wish to say that I have taken the subject up personally, with the Indians I have met, in Council and otherwise. I am very pleased to say that I find very little difficulty in getting a promise from them all to start their children at school after the Summer holidays, which will be some time in August. There should be very little difficulty, if an Agent has any interest in his work, in getting all the Indian Children within reach of the school, to attend it.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour Obedient Servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 28, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 19th instant in reference to the attendance at the Lytton Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department is very much pleased with the interest that you are showing in this, which is one of the most important features of Indian work. The Department believes that Mr. Morris is an efficient man and the help that he will receive from you, and it is hoped from the new Agent, will enable me to raise the standard of the Lytton Day School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nT. J. Gunniskey, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nOttawa, October 9, 1912.\n\nMr. Pedley,\n\nMr. Agent Graham, in his report on the Lytton Day School, states that Miss Blachford, the teacher, informed him that she had made an application to the Department for an increase in salary so as to be put in the same class as the teacher of the Sholus Indian Day School, who is in receipt of a salary of $600.00 a year while Miss Blachford is only paid $400.00 per annum. Mr. Graham states that he considers it only right that Miss Blachford should receive this salary, as she is not only a very good teacher but is of great assistance to him as she understands and speaks the language fluently.\n\nIt would be a matter of regret to the Department to lose Miss Blachford's services for want of a higher salary, as there is no doubt that teachers in British Columbia for Indian schools are not easily obtained and as the salaries paid in white schools are so much higher, ranging from $75.00 to $100.00 a month, the Department will be left\nleft without teachers unless it is prepared to consider-\nable increase the salaries it now pays. I would, there-\nfore, recommend that Miss Blachford's application be\nfavourably considered.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOFFICE OF THE DEPUTY SUPERINTENDENT GENERAL.\nOTTAWA. October 10, 1912.\n\nThe Schools Branch,\n\nThe reasons advanced against an increase in salary, as set forth in letter of the 25th of April last, have not been overcome from anything on this file,, as far as I can see.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nOttawa, October 18, 1912.\n\nMr. Fedley,\n\nI have pointed out in my memo. of the 9th instant that qualified teachers in British Columbia command salaries of from $900.00 to $1200.00 per annum. The demand is greater than the supply and any qualified teacher that would accept an Indian school would expect as high a salary as is paid by the Provincial Government and would only stay in the Department's service until more congenial surroundings could be found.\n\nThe frequent change of teachers does not work well in Indian schools, as it takes time to gain the confidence of the children, who are naturally shy.\n\nMiss Blatchford has had charge of the Lytton Day School since the first of January, 1908, and is paid $400.00 a year. She is reported to be a faithful worker and takes an interest in the welfare of the Indians on the reserve. She speaks their language and is known and liked by them and, as I mentioned before, the Agent says she is of great assistance to him in his work.\n\nI consider it would be a pity to lose her services for the sake of $200.00 a year, as she could not be replaced.\nreplaced by a qualified teacher for less than $1000.00\nand I doubt if a qualified teacher, who would have no\nexperience with Indians and know nothing of their habits,\ncharacter or language, would meet with equal success.\n\nThere is a letter from her on the file which\nis well expressed and shows that her scholarship is\nquite sufficient for teaching young Indian children,\nwho, when more advanced, have the opportunity of going\nto the All Hallows Boarding School and the Lytton Indus-\ntrial School to complete their education.\n\n[Signature]\n\nMartin Benson\nOttawa, October 30, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nReferring to that portion of your report on the Lytton Day School in which you state that Miss Blatchford, the teacher, wishes to receive an increase in her salary, I beg to say that, in view of your recommendation, the Department will allow her an increase of $100.00 from the first of the current quarter, bringing her salary up to $500.00 per annum. In view of her lack of professional qualifications and the small attendance this is the best that can be done at present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nOttawa. Ont.\nDuring the past Quarter the general health of the Indians was much better than it has been in the corresponding Quarter for some years, there were a fair number of Births and only very few deaths.\n\nThe attendance at the Day Schools suffers constantly at this time of the Year and will continue to do so until the Department can see its way clear to enforce a more regular attendance, as the parents are naturally inclined to take their children from School to work in the gardens and fields and also to take them with them when they go to the Fishagg Stations and Canneries. I think it would be good if the Department would enquire into the advantages and disadvantages of these annual trips, as they seem to me to have little to commend them.\n\nE. W. W.

Healthy and active.\n\nThis is a trying school. There can be no strong endeavour without hope. Miss Hobden thinks her task helpless. Judging from what I saw not much is being accomplished. I am not sure that the results justify the expenditure.\n\nGeneral Remarks.\n\nThe Indian Agent was away at the time of my visit. One feels at a loss to know what to say in summing up the case. The attendance is small and no prospect of an increase. The parents to whom I talked are very indifferent. The teacher is not in close touch with the Indian people. The pupils are marking time.\n\nSgd. R. H. Cairns,\nInep.\nOttawa, June 14, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nFrom reports received from yourself and Mr. School Inspector Cairns on the Lytton Day School the Department does not consider that it would be justified in continuing this school after the end of this quarter and you will be good enough to inform Miss Hobden, the teacher, accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOn visiting the Reserve here today\n\nI was informed by the Indians that the Indian Day School had been re-opened with about four or five children.\n\nAs you may remember you instructed me by Official letter No.319651/1 dated June 14th 1915, that according to Mr. Cairns and my own reports, that the Department had decided to close the school and that I was to inform Miss Hobden accordingly, which I did on receipt of the letter and asked her to leave the key of the School with me which she failed to do.\n\nThe Rev. Archdeacon Pugh took the matter up very strongly and said that if I would prosecute the Indians etc., for not sending the children, that there would be lots of children to keep the School open.\n\nI told him that I would not force any Indian to send small children to School when they had to cross a river like the Fraser.\n\nNaturally I was surprised to hear to-day that School was being held, as I have had no instructions from the Department to re-open it and will be much obliged if you will advise me if any instructions have been issued that I know nothing about.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 3, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th ultimo stating that you were informed by the Indians that the Lytton Bay School had been re-opened with about four or five children.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it was not the intention of the Department to have this school re-opened and no instructions have been given by the Department for its re-opening.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI should have written to you sometime ago, but have been away so much lately that I have been unable to attend to my correspondence. Since Mr. Eteson left the Nicola we have not yet put in another Clergyman there and so I have been a lot in the Nicola Valley myself, and then again my assistant at Lytton has gone to the Front.\n\nFirst of all in regard to the Shulus Day School. Apparently Mr. Eteson must have asked for Miss Williams' resignation, and then applied to the Department for the appointment for himself although he had been told by the Bishop and myself we would not consider such an arrangement, as Miss Williams had told the Bishop she would stay on for some time, when I found she had left and was going to the Old Country. In a hurry I found a young man named Harwood who was a scholar at a Grammar School in the Old Country and in recognition of his scholarship had to teach one of the Junior Classes every day, I asked him to take on the work temporarily. When Dr. Cairnes visited the School I told him how things were and asked his opinion, he said \"I think you have a real live man and am pleased with him.\" I told Harwood this, and also asked one of the Nurses at the Hospital to go to the School and teach the girls sewing! Suddenly while Harwood was away on his holidays The Indian Agent at Kamloops writes saying Dr. Cairnes is dissatisfied with the appointment. If Dr. Cairnes thinks it would be better to have someone else there I would be glad if he would write to me saying so then I can show the letter to Harwood and will try and get him other work, at present I cannot do that when I told the man how pleased Dr. Cairnes was with him as a teacher, and too when he had more children this term than there were there last term.\n\nThe only natural construction Harwood can put on my conduct would be that I personally wished to get rid of him; while I like the man.\n\nAnd now in regard to the Lytton Day School. This School is in a curious position as owing to the C.P.R. intending to \"double track\" I advised the Indians to look out for land and settle on it, and again as it was uncertain as to where the best place for a new School would be asked the Indian Agent - Mr. Graham - not to build a new School as the Government had proposed as it was so uncertain as to where the best centre would be, furthermore as you know so many people seize any\nopportunity of further exciting the opinion of our Indians against the present Agent that I could not ask him to insist upon a better attendance, both The Inspector of Indian Affairs for the Agency and he are agreed that it would be unfair at the present juncture. So that it had to be left, while it is really useless to tell the Chief he has to do so, the poor unfortunate Chief is only suspected when his actions meet with the approval of the Indian Agent of his particular district at any other time he is let down and consequently he has very little power today. The Ordinary policy of the Department has been rather to undermine the authority of the Chief, so that to say to him you must see that the attendance at the Schools improves is to insist that he attends to a duty which is just as difficult among the Indians as it is among White people. To my mind the only fair way to do this is to ask the Inspector of Schools to call a meeting of the Indians and then for him as representing the Department to tell them they must send their children to the Schools just as the White people have to and in their presence to tell the Indian Agent he wants a monthly report of the children who stay away from School and then to send the boys to the Industrial School and the girls to the Boarding School for girls, then when once the Indians realise that the Department mean to take a strong course they will soon settle down and recognise it.\n\nOne more fact in regard to Miss Hobden, she came out from England at the request of Mr Green, it cost her about \u00a350 = to pay her passage and get all fixed up. I know this because I had to lend her the money, Mr Green also assured her the Day Schools would be kept open without any doubt, so she came out on that understanding. Mr Green, as I believe in Day Schools, Dr. Cairnes does not, to his mind the only place is the Industrial School, as he was a Principal of an Indian Boarding this is natural, but what about the great majority of the Indian children whom the Industrial Schools do not reach? They are by far the greater number.\n\nI must ask you please to keep Miss Hobden on, and when I am in Ottawa sometime towards the end of September or early in October I hope you will give me an opportunity of discussing the Indian Day School question with you. I would like to suggest some radical changes, which I think would meet with your approval. In regard to the Lytton Day School I may say that Dr. McKenna, and the Chairman of the Indian Commission together with Major Megraw and Mr Graham all think it a mistake to close it.\n\n[Signature]\n\nEdward Hugh\nArchdeacon of Lytton.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI found the enclosed letter written Aug. 7th, unposted and also another. I am away so much and often writing up to the train time so that I frequently have to leave my letters in my rooms asking others to see that they are posted for me, unfortunately my wife too is away at present and somehow these letters were overlooked. I am exceedingly sorry and forward it now as it is.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nE. W. G. Pugh.\nOttawa, September 14th, 1915.\n\nDear Sir -\n\nIn further reference to your communication of the 16th ultimo, and the Departmental reply thereto of the 3rd instant, I beg to say that it has been decided to allow Miss Hobden to remain temporarily in charge of the Lytton day school. The Department trusts that there will be an improvement in the attendance, as the continuance of Miss Hobden's services will be dependent upon the success with which she meets.\n\nI would ask you to be kind enough to give her every assistance in your power towards maintaining a full and regular attendance.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSeptember 15th, 1915.\n\nDear Archdeacon Pugh -\n\nI have your communication of the last instant, enclosing a letter addressed to me, dated August 7th, which was inadvertently not forwarded.\n\nI read your representations with regard to the Lytton and Shulus Schools, and in view thereof it has been decided to allow Miss Hebden to continue at Lytton and Mr. Harwood at Shulus, until we have an opportunity of discussing matters in connection with these two schools more fully.\n\nI note that you are coming to Ottawa about the end of September or the early part of October; I expect to be absent from the city for some time, leaving in the early part of October, but if I am in the City when you come I shall be pleased to have an interview with you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVen.

By the quarterly return which I am enclosing under separate cover you will see there are only 7 pupils on the roll and these are all that are to be had unless they are made to cross the Fraser River. If this is done they have either got to cross in canoes or use the railway bridge, both routes the Indians claim are too dangerous to send the children alone and they have not time to bring them backward and forward every day.\n\nI certainly will do all in my power to maintain as regular an attendance as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nHQ/S\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 29, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd instant in reference to the attendance at the Lytton Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that it has been decided to keep this school open for the present.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nExtract from Inspector's Monthly Report on the Lytton Day School dated November 9, 1915. Original on 319651-6\n\nGENERAL REMARKS.\n\nThere is some improvement in the attendance. One of the girls in attendance is enrolled at the boarding school at Yale. She is likely to return. Then there will be only seven pupils available. The parents are indifferent. I interviewed several of them.\n\nArchdeacon Pugh was away from home at the time of my visit. However, he came to the office in Vancouver Nov. 26th, and we discussed the whole matter thoroughly. He contends that there are a number of children across the river who should attend this school. He promised to send me at once a list of the names and ages of these children referred to. He thought there were twenty of school age. This list has not come to hand yet. Dec. 7th.\n\nShd. R. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nThe average during the quarter of this school has shown a slight improvement, but owing to the very low age of the children attending the progress made is very small and I do not think the expenditure is warrantible as those children of boarding school age could be quite well taken care of in boarding schools.\n\nLetter dated, December 21st, 1915.\nExtract from report of Agent Graham on the Lytton Day School for the month of May, 1916. School visited on May 22. Original on 319651/7.\n\nOnly found five very small children present and these were too small to see whether there is any progress.\n\nI really cannot see the use of keeping a school open for such small children.\nOttawa, June 27, 1916.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe attendance at the Lytton Day School is so small and irregular that it is a question whether the Department is justified in continuing it in operation. I may say that the children who do attend are so young that it is impossible to know whether they are making any progress or not.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh.\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose Miss Hobden's Quarterly Return for the Lytton Day School for the quarter ending June 30th, from which you will see that the average attendance during this quarter has only been $4 \\frac{24}{29}$ and a number of these children are really too small for school. Under these circumstances I cannot see how I can conscientiously recommend the re-opening of this school.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc.\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.,\n\nSept 16th, 1916,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nMiss Hobden has had news from home in regard to her father's health which makes her anxious to be with her people this winter. Their family Doctor wishes her to return as the Father's health is very weak and he is afraid if he has another attack of Bronchitis he will not survive the winter. We shall be glad if you will kindly apply to the Department for six months leave of absence for her. Miss Hobden would like to go to her home sometime in November. Mr. Cairns approved when I spoke to him on the matter last Monday and you kindly did the same this afternoon. I shall be glad if you will please ask the Department for six months leave of absence for her. We will see that an efficient teacher carries on her duties while she is away.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Signed) E. W. W. Pugh.\nArchdeacon of Lytton.\n\nH. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Agent.\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a copy of a letter from Archdeacon Pugh asking for leave of absence for Miss Hobden, teacher of the Lytton Day School.\n\nI approve of the request being granted on condition that a suitable teacher be put in her place, and provided the school is kept open by the Department.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nEnc.\n\nHQ/EB\nOttawa, September 27th, 1916.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 16th, instant, enclosing a request from Miss Hobden for six months' leave of absence.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that this leave will be granted her, without pay.\n\nAs the average attendance at this school has been so small in the past, it is considered that, possibly, there is no necessity of engaging a substitute during Miss Hobden's absence.\n\nKindly advise the Department what your opinion is.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Archdeacon Pugh of the Department's decision in regard to not engaging a substitute during Miss Hobden's absence owing to the very small average attendance at this school.\n\nYou will see from my monthly report on this school that the average has been below the regulation every month and Inspector Cairns is of the same opinion. He advised me that he considered that this money could be far better expended in other parts of the Agency where schools are very badly needed.\n\nThe children of school age attending this school could be sent to the boarding schools.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nHG/BB\nOttawa, October 17, 1916.\n\nSir,-\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 11th instant I beg to say that the Department considers that the children who have been attending the Lytton Day School should be sent to the boarding schools. You will be good enough to take steps to have this done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir,\n\nI have been notified that the Department has kindly granted my six months' leave, in which I am most thankful; but I am extremely sorry to hear that the school is to be closed during that period. Some of the children are taking much keen interest in their studies, & I am afraid the long vacation will throw them back terribly.\n\nI believe Aberdeen Ruff expects to be in Ottawa at the end of next\nweek when he hopes to see you.\n\nWould it be possible for you to send me this a cheque for this month's salary by November 1st, as I leave Lytton on the 5th of that month.\n\nI shall be greatly obliged if you could arrange this.\n\nThanking you\n\nYours Truly,\n\nB.

In view of the small number of children the Department does not consider that it would be justified in re-opening this school and I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether you know of any other school that Miss Hobden could be sent to. In any event the Lytton school would not be re-opened until after the summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, July 13, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nThe Department is advised that Miss E. W. Ferryman, who has been teaching the Alert Bay Day School for some time, has resigned and that it is proposed to engage an Indian named George Martin Luther, an ex-pupil of the industrial school, to take her place.\n\nAs the Department is not favourable to the employment of an Indian if a white teacher can be secured, it has occurred to me that it might be well to offer this position to Miss Hobden, who was in charge of the Lytton Day School, as the attendance there is not sufficient to justify its continuance.\n\nI should be glad if you would submit this proposition to Miss Hobden and advise the Department of her decision. If she takes charge of the Alert Bay school she will paid at the same rate as at Lytton.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. Macdonald\n\nAsst., Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI should have answered your letter before this but have been away from home so much that I have had little opportunity. In regard to Miss Hobden\u2014as I wrote to Mr. Scott\u2014the first intimation I had that she was returning was a cable from London saying she was starting. I had asked her to stop off at Ottawa and call but she was unable to do this as her ticket would not allow it.\n\nYou have been misinformed as to the numbers of children attending the Lytton Indian Day School, the daily average has been seven and not three. Mr. Cairns, Inspector of Indian Day Schools told us before Miss Hobden applied for leave there would be no question of closing the School if the average did not fall below six. Seven was the number average before Dr. Fort suggested the School being closed on account of the heat. Miss Hobden started immediately on her return, and kept the School open for one month. There is no doubt there would be many more children attend School if a School was opened across the river, there are twenty-seven children of school age in the vicinity, the difficulty is the bridge, it is only a railway one and certainly not safe for children to cross as apart from the danger of trains we have often a very strong wind blowing, the Indians across the river are willing to build a school between the Nikaia and Nehomin Reserves. But even here if the Indian School Act was enforced there should be a better average, and as you know from your long experience Indians, any more than white people, will make their children come to School unless they are compelled.\n\nIn view of the fact that the average is higher than the Inspector laid down and also that Miss Hobden returned at a considerable expense to take up her work again I do not think it is fair to close the School, and I am sure you do not. So please let it go on for the present, I shall be in Ottawa in Sept. and will come in and we can talk the whole thing over. I may as well tell you that the Indian Agent so far from suggesting that he was going to recommend the closing of the School actually asked what new supplies were needed.\nThis neighbourhood is one where there should be a big Day School, but certainly the better place is the other side of the river, if the Government could put a foot-way on one side of the bridge, having railings and wire netting on account of the wind, I have no doubt if any serious attempt was made to enforce the attendance it would be possible to have a daily average of 18. If the Department should desire I will willingly ask either Senator Boastock or Mr. H. Barnard\u2014the member for Victoria\u2014to come and see things and send in their Report to the Department. Also I am willing in the event of the daily average being below six to forward to the Department quarterly when the Returns are made up a cheque for half of Miss Hobden's salary. I am quite certain Mr. Scott and yourself are anxious to do what is right, but you naturally must act on information, unfortunately that information does not always tally with facts.\n\nOne more thing I sent in with my last quarters Hospital Returns a C.P.R. receipt for the train fare of a destitute Indian woman bringing her child to Hospital for an operation on the knee\u2014on Jan. 14th last\u2014The Indian Agent says it was sent in. I often do things myself but did not have my instruments with me at the time and as well rather funked the job at the house as the knee is such an easy place to infect, the boy had run in a long sliver quite deep near the cartilage holding the knee-cap down, the sliver was quite two inches long, and there was no time to wait so I brought him along; when this sort of thing has happened with Mr. Smith I have always had the cheque for the amount returned with the cheque for the Hospital Returns.\n\nWith kindest regards, Believe me,\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nE.

McLean, Esq.\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 2, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo in regard to Miss Hobden's remaining in charge of the Lytton Day School.\n\nIn this connection I beg to refer you to official letter of the 13th ultimo in which it was suggested that Miss Hobden might take charge of the Alert Bay Day School. Kindly submit this proposition to her as soon as possible and advise the Department of her decision in the matter.\n\nYou will be further advised in regard to the cheque for the train fare of the destitute Indian woman who took her child to the hospital for an operation.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

Maclean\n\nDear Sir,\n\nArchdeacon Pugh has told me of your kind offer of the school at Alert Bay, thank you very much, but I prefer to remain in this mission, where I feel there is a real work for me to do.\n\nThe Archdeacon asked me to call on you when I passed through Ottawa, but I had no opportunity of doing so. I came away from England in a transport at 24 hours notice, & was obliged to travel by special\ntrain as far as Winnipeg.\n\nI was extremely sorry that I was unable to get back by the end of my 6 months leave, but at that time no passports were being issued to women other than Canadian soldiers' dependents.\n\nI came the very first chance I had.\n\nProbably I should not have risked the voyage just now had I known you intended closing the school.\n\nI arrived here on June 13th, & on the following Monday got the Indian children together; we had school for four weeks when it became intensely hot & we closed by the doctor's orders, & are still having holidays.\nI had 10 children on the register\n& an average of exactly 7 for the\n4 weeks. One child, a girl, walked\nin 2 miles, a boy also came about\nthe same distance. Three of the\nyounger children were often absent\nbeing taken by their parents when\nworking in their outlying gardens.\n\nTrusting you will see your\nway to re-opening\n\nYours Truly,\n\nB. Hobden.\nDear Mr. McLean:\n\nI am extremely sorry I did not make it clear in my last letter that I had asked Miss Hobden about the Alert Bay School and that she said she did not want to go there. I have again asked her today and she says the same. I may say we both know the attendance at the Indian Bay School at Lytton should not fall below the six, the number Mr. Cairns laid down, and furthermore if the attendance is enforced either at Lytton or else across the river there should be a much larger attendance.\n\nI have since received the cheque for the train fare of the Indian woman and child from Spuzzum; it reached me last week. I spoke to the Indian Agent about it and the receipt was evidently sent in.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nE. W. B. Pugh,\nArchdeacon of Lytton.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, August 17, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,-\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant stating that Miss Hobden does not want to go the Alert Bay Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to continue the Lytton Day School for the present and Miss Hobden and Mr. Agent Graham are being advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, August 17, 1917.\n\nMadam,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 9th instant stating that Archdeacon Pugh has told you of the Department's offer of the school at Alert Bay, but that you prefer to remain at Lytton, where you feel that there is work for you to do.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department has decided to continue the Lytton Day School for the present and Archdeacon Pugh and Mr. Agent Graham are being advised accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss E. Hobden,\nThe Mission House,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, August 17, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to official letter of June 26th, last, in regard to the re-opening of the Lytton Day School, I beg to say that the Department offered Miss Hobden the position of teacher of the Alert Bay Day School. She states, however, that she prefers to remain at Lytton.\n\nIt has, therefore, been decided to continue the Lytton Day School for the present and Miss Hobden and Archdeacon Pugh are being advised accordingly.\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns is being asked to visit this school and forward a full report in regard to it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, August 17, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nAs you are no doubt aware, Miss Hobden, who was in charge of the Lytton Day School, returned and reopened the school in June, last. As Mr. Agent Graham stated that there are only five children of school age on the reserve, the Department did not consider that it would be justified in re-opening this school and Miss Hobden was offered the position of teacher of the Alert Bay School. A communication has been received from her stating that she would prefer to remain at Lytton and the Department has, therefore, decided to continue the day school at this point for the present.\n\nThe Department would like you to inspect this school and forward a full report in regard to it. In your report you should state whether you consider the attendance at this school would be sufficient to justify the Department in continuing it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAss't Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian schools,\nRoom 18, 249 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B.C.\n249 Hastings St. East,\nVancouver, B.C.,\nSept. 1st, 1917.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nIn response to your letter of Aug. 17, numbered 319651/1 re the Day School at Lytton, I went to Lytton August the 28th. I also had a letter from the Agent, Mr. H. Graham, urging me to come as he expected the Inspector of Indian Agencies, Mr. A. Megraw, in Lytton on the 28th of August.\n\nWe fully discussed the school problems with special reference to the Day School at Lytton. The difficulty here is that the Fraser River divides the Indian people at Lytton, part live on one side and part on the other. On the side on which the school building is located there are five pupils of school age in attendance. There are three others who belong to this side of the river but they have been away with their parents for some time. On the other side of the river there are some twelve to fifteen of school age.\n\nAfter this I saw Archdeacon Pugh and the teacher Miss Hobden. The Archdeacon informed me that the school had not been opened on account of the extremely hot weather. The holidays of the Public schools had been extended for a week. Then I was informed that a number of the Indians were at the present time away from home.\nArchdeacon suggested that the matter of the Day School at Lytton be left till November, and that a meeting of the Indians be held at which the Indian Agent and myself be present. The Indians will all be home at that time. Perhaps some arrangement could be made in which all parties would concur that would settle the question for some time.\n\nIn the afternoon I visited St. George's Industrial School. The new building under construction is going ahead slowly. Mr. Dawson has found difficulty in procuring material. The boys had not all returned from their holidays. There were some 40 present. I did not go into the class-rooms to give an examination. I thought it would be better to leave it till later when the building was complete and the girls brought here from Yale. Conditions would then be normal and a report then would give a better idea of what was being accomplished.\n\nOn my way back to Vancouver I called at Yale. Here I found 21 girls who had returned early in August. They were in charge of three of the Sisters. The fourth Sister was away for holidays. The sister Superior had engaged a School teacher but she was not able to come at once. The Sisters were carrying on the work. The girls became restless and gave more or less trouble. The Sisters came to the conclusion that they would not carry on the school work any longer.\nThey sent a telegram to Archdeacon Pugh informing him of their decision. They explained to me that the arrangement which they made with the Rev. L. Dawson, Principal of the Industrial School, was that he would take over the girls when they returned after the holidays. They wanted this arrangement carried out as they did not feel able to stand the stress and strain of the responsibility of caring for the girls any longer and especially as the girls were so restless. Unless Mr. Dawson acts at once the Sisters intend to send the girls home.\n\nI sent a telegram to Mr. Dawson advising him to come to Yale at once. I informed him of the decision of the Sisters. I remained at Yale till the evening of the 30th., hoping Mr. Dawson would arrive. However he did not come. The problem is his. I did not feel called on to remain any longer.\n\nFor the information of the Department, I wish to say that there is a lack of harmony and co-operation on the part of those carrying on educational work here that is detrimental to the best interests concerned.\n\nIn conclusion, I wish to say that on my return from the north, I will visit these schools and hope by that time everything will be running smoothly, and that results will be attained in the class-room.\n\nI remain, Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.P.H. Cairns\n\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nOttawa, Sept. 11, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 1st instant containing a report of your recent visit to the Lytton Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will await a report from you after meeting the Indians at this point in November next. It is hoped that at this meeting some satisfactory arrangement can be arrived at in which all parties will concur and that will settle the school matters at Lytton.\n\nYour report concerning your visit to the Lytton Industrial School and the St. Hollows Boarding School at Yale, has been noted, and will be taken up with the church authorities.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nR. H. Cairns, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nRoom 14, 240 Hastings St., East,\nVancouver, B. C.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Benson,\n\nWill you kindly instruct Mr. Graham, Indian Agent at Lytton, to direct the constable to insure the attendance of the pupils at the Lytton Day school. He should inform the Indians that unless they make use of that school, the Department will, under the regulations, commit the children to the residential schools.\n\nD. S. G. I. A.\nExtract from report of Agent Graham on the Lytton Day School for the month of September, 1917. Original on 319651/7.\n\nOn two visits that I have made to this school this last month I found that it was being used as a sort of nursery, the Indians giving their smaller children of about two years of age to take to school to look after whilst they are away working, with a result that certain children are not learning anything whilst they are looking after these smaller children besides detracting the attention of the other children.\nOttawa, October 11, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to that portion of your report on the Lytton Day School for the month of September, last, in regard to the Indians sending their small children to the school to be looked after whilst they are away working I beg to say that you should inform the Indians that in future they must not do this. You should also inform the teacher that these small children are not to go to the school, as the Department wishes the pupils to give all their attention to their studies while they are in school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, October 13, 1917.\n\nVery Reverend Sir,\n\nIn a late report received on the Lytton Day school the Department is informed that it is being used as a creche and that the Indians are leaving their small children of about two years of age at the school to be looked after whilst they are working, with the result that the education of the children of school age is being neglected, as the presence of these infants distracts their attention and interferes with Miss Hobden's duties as teacher.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform Miss Hobden that this practice must cease, as her whole time during school hours should be devoted to the work of teaching the pupils.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAM\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nVen. Archdeacon E. W. W. Pugh,\nLytton, B.C.\nREPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS ON THE LYTTON DAY SCHOOL.\n\nI held a meeting with the Indians Feb. 16. Archdeacon Pugh, Mr Agent Graham, and twenty four Indians including two Indian women were present.\n\nThere are about twenty children of school age on the Reserve across the Fraser river. A number of Indians from this reserve were present. The problem is how to get these children across to the school. The most feasible way is to construct a foot bridge in connection with the C.N.Railway bridge which crosses the river at the point. The Agent has this matter in hand and is corresponding with the Department.\n\nIf these children could be brought across the river a good school would then be possible.\n\nWe had a very harmonious conference. There is now a better understanding of the policy of the Indian Department on the part of the Indians.\n\nDate of Inspection,-Feb. 20th, 1916.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Agent Graham, in his report on the Lytton Day School for the month of February, last, states that the attendance is very unsatisfactory, there being only six children available, and, with the Lytton Industrial School so near, he thinks that that is the proper place for all these children. He also states that as soon as spring starts the parents will be taking their children with them out to the ranches, and the attendance will be even less satisfactory than at present.\n\nThe Lytton Day school is held in a rented building, which is in a very dilapidated condition.\n\nThe following is an extract from the report of Miss Hoaden, the teacher, for the year ended December 31st, last, which bears out Mr. Graham's statements regarding this school:\u2014 \"Now the local industrial school is open to girls as well as boys some parents prefer to send their children there. The Indians are spending much more time cultivating their outlying ranches and of course the children accompany their parents, and for months together are unable to attend school regularly. This makes progress slow and discouraging.\"\n\nProvision is made for one hundred pupils at the Lytton Industrial School and there is now an enrolment there of ninety-one, and they would have ample accommodation for all the children who have been attending the day school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nOttawa, March 10, 1919.\nOttawa, March 14, 1919.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your report on the Lytton Day School for the month of February, last, in which you state that this school is very unsatisfactory, there only being six children available, I beg to say that, in view of the small attendance there and the close proximity of the Lytton Industrial School, the Department has decided to close this day school on the 30th of June, next. You will be good enough to advise Miss Hobden, the teacher, accordingly, and inform her that her services will not be required after that date.\n\nAfter the school is closed you should see that all the children of school age on the reserve are placed in the industrial school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLEAN\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nThis school was ordered to be closed by the Department on June 30th, but, as the teacher is leaving for England of the 15th of April, I intend to get the children moved to St. George's Industrial School if possible.\n\n(Sgd.)

McLean Esq,\nAsst Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs.\n\nSir:-\n\nI have the honor to enclose herewith a report of attendance at a day school held by Mrs Lamb at a wood camp twelve miles below Big Salmon.\n\nIt appears that there is a small band of Indians located there for the purpose of cutting cord wood. The Bishop of Yukon finding that Mrs Lamb was willing to teach the Indian children arranged with her to do so. His Lordship has made no appeal for a grant for this school but I presume that he requested the teacher to send in a return of attendance. There was no covering letter therefore I am unable to supply any particulars. I am forwarding the return for your information.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Superintendent.\nOttawa, Sept. 21, 1917.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 31st ultimo enclosing a report showing the attendance at a Day School conducted by Mrs. Lamb at Hendrickson's Camp at a point 12 miles below Big Salmon, Y.

I have given the matter considerable thought, and am deeply interested in the question of doing all that is possible in the way of providing schools for the Indians at both these two places and elsewhere. For a number of years we had a teacher at Forty Mile in fact school has been kept by our Church at this place since about 1891. A few years ago the Indians all practically left there, and made their headquarters at Eagle and Moosehide and elsewhere. For several years our School was continued on expecting that the Indians might return to Forty Mile, but year after year passed by without any material change in the situation, till at last we felt we were not justified in keeping a teacher there any longer, and he was accordingly removed to Selkirk. Recently some of the Indians have come back, and if they continue to remain there in any numbers, I shall be glad to do what I can in the way of opening up a school. It is rather expensive to keep a man there continuously. If school could be held regularly with a fair number of pupils, the Government grant given in such cases would be considerable help, but the movements of the Indian population are so uncertain that there is a certain amount of financial responsibility that is not easy to meet. I hope to visit Forty Mile before long, and will be glad again to consult with you on the matter.\n\nWith reference to Rampart House, the difficulties are somewhat similar. The Church of England has now a native clergyman, the Rev Amos Njootli in charge of the Mission. He does all he can in teaching the Indians to read and write in their own tongue, and with considerable success. He travels with the Indians to their hunting grounds, and holds school\nregularly. He does not however teach in the English language, and I know it would be a great advantage if we could have a regular teacher in English for the Indian children. Here again financial difficulties have been in the way. The Indians at Rampart House spend most of their time in hunting and trapping and are scattered all over the country. For a short time some of them gather together at one place, and during this period school could be held, but when the parents go off to hunt again, their children must accompany them, unless someone is prepared to keep them, and this would require a Boarding School of some kind. The Government grant for Day Schools is now given according to the number of days school is held. I am afraid under the circumstances at Rampart House, the grant would go only a very small way towards the expense of keeping a teacher. Because of the remoteness of the place it would be impossible for a man to come and go very frequently, and he would have to settle down for the year. The cost of salary and travelling expense would be considerable, and thus again financial difficulties are hard to overcome. However, I hope we may be able to do something in the course of time to provide a regular school at Rampart House, and I shall be glad to discuss the question with you again at any time.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n(Signed) Isaac O.

You should inform the Church of England authorities of the grant allowed and also request them to instruct the teacher to forward returns promptly at the end of each quarter. Only the names and attendance of the Indian children should appear on this return. A cheque for the amount of the tuition grant due as shown by the returns received for the past three quarters will be sent to His Lordship Bishop Stringer, as is done in the case of the salaries for the other day schools in the Yukon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

J. Welch, O.M.I., New Westminster, B.C. It was brought to the Department's attention that the St. Mary's Boarding School at Vernon City and the Squamish Boarding School, North Vancouver, are being called upon to pay very heavy taxes by the municipalities where they are situated. It appears that the first named institution will be taxed for the year for an amount over $1000.00, or practically twice their per capita earnings.\n\nThe Deputy Minister felt that these matters should be brought into your department and would be grateful for information regarding the heavy taxation. The municipalities in question should be approached with a view to lightening the tax burden. They should understand that the activity carried on at the two schools mentioned is Government approved and operated by the Church.\n\nobedient servant,\n\nRussell T. Ferrier,\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Agencies.\nOttawa, February 6, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nThe Reverend J. Welch, O.M.I., of New Westminster, B.C., made certain requests on behalf of the Sisters in charge of the Squamish Boarding School.\n\nIt was represented that financial difficulties at the Squamish Boarding School were such that the staff could not continue the work any longer under present circumstances. The church property here is very crowded and the per capita grant is barely sufficient to supply the food needed. They realize the unlikelihood that the Department build a new school and ask for an enlarged per capita grant, in order to make ends meet. Father Welch states that the Sisters at this school are deserving of our most careful consideration.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 10, 1922.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Scott:\n\nThe Rev. J. Welch, O. M. I., of New Westminster, B. C., drew our attention to the heavy taxes levied by the municipalities on the St. Mary's and Squamish Indian boarding schools. I am convinced that these institutions are in a peculiar situation in this connection. I have been unable to learn of any other Indian residential school that is called upon to pay municipal taxation.\n\nThe Rev. Father Welch mentioned taxes amounting to $900.00 and $500.00 for the St. Mary's and Squamish schools, respectively, for the past year. In all probability, these sums may be exceeded in future.\n\nIn view of the serious financial situation in which these institutions find themselves, I wish to recommend that the Department pay the taxes. This will give the St. Mary's and Squamish Indian boarding schools the same opportunity to educate and care for our Indian wards that other residential schools enjoy. The whole of the per capita earnings will be released for the legitimate current expenses.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education\nOttawa, February 10, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nAs you are aware, the site and property of the St. Mary's Indian Boarding School at Mission, B.C., belong to the Church. The Department of Indian Affairs, before planning any extensive alterations or improvements, will request a quit claim deed for the land on which the school is built. Will you ascertain how much property the Church authorities are willing to deed over to this Department. In view of the fact that Crown lands are exempted from municipal or other taxation, the authorities of your Church, or Order, might be in favour of giving us a quit claim deed for the major portion of the land in use by the St. Mary's Boarding School. Your early response in this connection is respectfully requested.\n\nI might add that the Department is seriously considering reimbursing the St. Mary's Boarding School and the Sisters of the Squamish Institution to the extent of the taxes levied on them by the municipalities during the past year. I will place an item in the supplementary Estimates for the current year, to cover this payment, if you will furnish the Department with receipted bills certified by the local Indian agent, or Inspector Ditchburn. This last named officer has been instructed to inquire into the taxation of the St. Mary's and Squamish Indian Boarding Schools.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, February 23, 1922.\n\nMemorandum for File:\n\nIn the Supplementary Estimates for 1921-22, an item of $900.00 was included to pay the municipal taxation bill of the St. Mary's Boarding School for the current year. It is intended to relieve this school and the Squamish Boarding School of municipal taxation in the future, so as to release the per capita earnings for diversion to proper channels.\n\nNo provision has been made in the Main Estimates for 1922-23 for extensive repairs or alterations to the St. Mary's boarding school at Mission, B.C.\nSquash Mission\n\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorth Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI know, Reverend Father, that you have done more than your share to help our school, but I cannot refrain from making a new appeal to your kindness and benevolence.\n\nKnowing that you will do all that is in your power to aid me in that narrow strain.\n\nI remain, Reverend Father,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThis course is for arrears of taxes on the five acre lot.\n\nReverend Father Melch. O.M.I.\n\nProvincial.\n\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nSquamish Mission\n\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorth Vancouver, B.C., February 20th, 1872\n\nReverend and dear Father:\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the Squamish Indian School.\n\nThis school was built in 1868 by late Doctor Hanna, on the initiative of the Sisters of the Child Jesus, in the city of North Vancouver, close to the Indian Reservation. By now at that time the land was not yet sold and the taxes on land were almost insignificant. But since the city has grown up and at the present time the taxes are so high that it has been impossible for the school to meet the entire bill for the year. We have lost what the school has been able to do with the help of the other members of the Community was to pay for the taxes on the acres on which the school buildings are located, the amount to $250. The tax for the acres adjoining the school where we need for pasture for the cows. The bill the school could not possibly meet, so the property will be sold this coming summer for \"unpaid taxes\", and the poor Sisters after having worked like slaves among the Indians for twenty-five years will be left penniless.\n\nAs a result we shall not be able to keep our cows\u2014for want of grazing ground\u2014and consequently our pupils shall be deprived of milk; for though we should buy milk (and that we will) we could never afford to be quantity supplied by our own good milk cows.\n\nThe Government, it is true, has raised the price Indians who need to provide their children, etc., hardly supply anything more.\nSquamish Mission\n\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorth Vancouver, B.C., February 20th, 1872\n\nReverend and dear Father:\n\nI beg to draw your attention on the Squamish Indian School.\n\nThis school was built in 1878 by late Bishop Murray, on the property of the Sisters of the Child Jesus, in the city of North Vancouver, close to the Indian Reservation. Of course, at that time the said city did not exist and the taxes on land were almost insignificant. But since the city has grown up, and at the present time the taxes are so high that it has been impossible for the school to meet the entire bill for the years 1870-1871. All what the school has been able to do, with the help of the other members of the Community, was to pay for the taxes on the 4 acres on which the school buildings are located; this amounted to $277.50. As for the 5 acres adjoining the school which are used for pasture for the cows, this bill the school could not possibly meet, so the property will be sold this coming summer for \"unpaid taxes\", and the poor Sisters, after having worked like slaves among the Indians for twenty-three years, will be left penniless.\n\nAs a result we shall not be able to keep our cows\u2014for want of grazing ground\u2014and consequently the pupils shall be deprived of milk, for though we should buy milk (and that we will) we could never afford to buy quantity supplied by our three good milk cows.\n\nThe Government, it is true, has raised the grant for Indians who need to provide their children with food, hardly supply anything now. But the number of expense is great.\nFebruary 22nd, 1922\n\nMr. Duncan C. Scott,\nDeputy Superintendent General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nIn reply to your favour of February 10th, 1922, No. 119704-1, I am pleased to say that the Principals of St. Mary's and Squamish Indian Schools will be prepared to submit to Mr. Ditchburn receipted bills of the taxes which they paid last year.\n\nThe enclosed communication to me from Sister Amy explains, in part, the situation in Squamish, and needs no comment.\n\nAs to your request that a quit claim deed be given the Government of the land on which St. Mary's School stands, I cannot give you an answer until I have placed the matter before our General Administration. I am writing today and hope to have an answer in five or six weeks. I will also ascertain how much land they are prepared to deed to the Department.\n\nCan you say if the Government would be willing to guarantee the Oblates fixture of tenure.\n\nYours respectfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ. Welch. O.M. 9.\nOttawa, March 2, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have to acknowledge yours of the 22nd ultimo, referring to the heavy taxation and related matters at the St. Mary's and Squamish Indian Boarding Schools, and enclosing a letter from the Principal of the last named institution.\n\nI have noted that the Rev. Sisters are prepared to submit to Mr. Inspector Ditchburn receipted bills for last year's taxes. As I intimated to you on the 10th ultimo, an item has been placed in the Supplementary Estimates for the current year to meet this expenditure. I trust that Parliament will see fit to vote these funds during the coming session.\n\nIf the General Administration of your Order sees fit to give a quit claim deed to the Government of the property on which the St. Mary's school is situated, in the future the Sisters there will be relieved, I believe, of this burden of taxation. We would, of course, guarantee the Oblates permanency of occupation. I am of the opinion that it would be better to arrange for this by an official letter of assurance, rather than by a formal long term lease. If the latter instrument were executed, the municipal authorities might consider that the church had a taxable interest and our action would be abortive.\n\nAs I examine the letter of the Principal of the Squamish School, I notice that it is the intention to be sold for taxes the five acres of pasture adjoining the building. This property is, of course, not large enough to warrant the Department of Indian Affairs holding it for boarding school purposes, and, in all fairness, I do not ask you to give us a quit claim deed at this time; the sole purpose is to be relieved of municipal taxes. Yet, I am loath to see such valuable property go to Indian work. If you can suggest any action that could be contemplated for the St. Mary's property, I shall be glad to give it consideration. If a satisfactory proposal be suggested, the Department might come to an agreement to pay the unpaid taxes on this five acres of pasture, in addition to the last calendar year's taxes on the land on which the buildings are located. The Sisters of the Oblates of the Squamish Boarding School might be instructed to convey the property to the Department, before the five acres of pasture is finally to be sold for arrears.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\nBlackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B.C.\nOttawa, April 1, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Scott,\n\nMr. Inspector Ditchburn has reported on the taxation difficulties at the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding Schools, B.C.\n\nSt. Mary's Boarding School:\n\nThe property at Mission, B.C., consists of 5 blocks of land and 3 town lots. Only one block of 165 acres, known as Sec. Gp. 3, Tp. 17, D.L. 2, is used solely for church and mission purposes. The rest of the property is leased to Japanese and white tenants and is not necessary to the management of the boarding school. 15 acres of the plot mentioned above is exempt from taxation and the tax on the remaining 140 acres of school property amounts to about $470.00 per annum.\n\nI wish to recommend, following the correspondence between Father Welch and yourself, that this Department pay the taxes on the block of 140 acres used exclusively for school purposes. This year, the amount is $468.60, and the Principal of the school is prepared to submit to Mr. Ditchburn a receipted bill for this amount.\n\nSquamish Boarding School:\n\nThe property at North Vancouver, held under title by Miss Marie Champlain, consists of Block 69 (4 acres) on which are the school building and garden, and Block 123 (5 acres) used as a pasturage and potato field. These two blocks are within the city of North Vancouver and are assessed on the same basis as surrounding residential property. The total valuation is $68,500.00. The annual taxes on Block 69, on which the school stands, amount roughly to $1,000.00, and have been paid from year to year. The unpaid taxes on Block 123 - the 5 acres used as pasturage - amount with penalties to $3,666.54. If Block 123 is to remain school property, this amount will have to be paid before the 30th of September, next. The Principal was prepared to allow Block 123 sold for arrears. I believe that both Blocks 69 and 123 (a total of 9 acres) are needed for school purposes.\n\nYou will remember that we discussed taking over this property at a nominal sum, until such time as it was not required for Indian educational purposes. The intention was to be relieved of the taxation and then return it to the present title holders. However, Section 208 of the Municipal Act at the 1919 session of the Provincial Legislature precludes such a procedure. It is stated that lands which are held or occupied other than by, or on behalf of, the Crown shall be liable to taxation, even when the fee of which lands is in the Crown.\nTwo possible courses of action remain:\n\n1. The Department could purchase at the tax sale Block 123, at a price which, I believe, would be much under the present valuation of $42,500.00. The Sisters at the school would probably sell us Block 69, on which the school stands, for about $20,000.00. We should remember, however, that we would never use the property if we built an Indian residential school. 9 acres is insufficient for this purpose and we would be forced to put the property on the market when the Squamish Boarding school is replaced by a modern building elsewhere.\n\n2. Block 123 could be sold for taxes and this Department pay taxes amounting to, roughly, $1,000.00 per annum on Block 69. This procedure would, of course, leave the institution with but 4 acres. They might be able to rent a pasture and potato patch from the new owners of Block 123, or elsewhere.\n\nI think that this second suggestion concerning the Squamish Boarding School property is far from what is desired, but, under the circumstances, I recommend that we give a grant to the school, of $1,000.00 per year, to pay the taxation on Block 69, on which the school stands. They will have to make arrangements for their potato and milk supply.\n\nI might state that funds are provided in the 1921-22 Supplementary Estimates for the payment, if you concur with my recommendations in connection with the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding Schools.\n\nR.J.F.\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIn connection with our larger program\n\nI believe we should buy suitable property shield for the Squamish work\n\nR.J.F.\nOttawa, April 20, 1922.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have to acknowledge your No. 15/362/P of the 23rd ultimo, referring to the taxation of the property at the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding Schools.\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General, who has been confined to his home, due to an injury, wishes me to thank you for your careful attention to this problem and your detailed report. I am directed to request that you secure a receipted bill from the St. Mary's Boarding School for the taxes for District Lot No. 2 (Sec. Gp. 2, Tp. 17) $468.60. The Department has decided that, as this property is used exclusively for school purposes, we should relieve the authorities of the expense in this connection.\n\nConcerning the Squamish Boarding School, this Department cannot assist in connection with Block 123, as the bill for taxes from year to year is so serious that the value of retaining the 5 acres for school purposes does not warrant the expenditure involved. The school authorities will have to make the best possible arrangements for their potato and milk supply. It might be possible to rent Block 123 from the new owners after the tax sale. Block 69, the 4 acres on which the school buildings and garden are situated, will of course have to be retained for school purposes, and you should request the principal of the Squamish Boarding School to submit to you the receipted bill for the 1921 taxes, amounting to $977.91. This Department will endeavour to settle this bill, and consideration will be given to the same account in future years. This will release the per capita earnings for diversion into the proper channels.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, May 26, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welsh:\n\nThere have been certain developments in connection with Department assistance to the St. Mary's and Squamish Indian Boarding Schools. As you are already aware, it is my intention to arrange for the payment of the taxes levied on the portion of St. Mary's Boarding School known as District Lot No. 2, amounting to $468.60, and for the Squamish Boarding School on Block 69, amounting to $977.91. I am at present discussing with the Minister the advisability of purchasing Block 123, on which two years' taxes, amounting to $5665.54, are due. Although this is somewhat in the nature of a speculation, I am convinced by both Mr. Inspector Ditchburn and Rev. Father Guy that when the property is no longer desired for the Squamish Boarding School, it could be sold without difficulty for at least as much as the Department puts into it at this time.\n\nI regret that I have been unsuccessful in having voted funds for the extensive improvements needed at the St. Mary's Boarding School. The laundry, kitchen, etc., at that institution and the barn at the Squamish Boarding School will have to remain over for another year.\n\nI will be grateful if you would inform the Sisters Superior of the two schools of the contents of this communication. You might suggest to the Rev. Mother Provincial of the Order that the Department would be pleased if she would offer us Block 123 at a nominal price, on the condition that the Department pay the arrears of taxes, amounting to $5665.54 and allow the property to remain exclusively for the use of the school.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welsh, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nOttawa, May 26, 1922.\n\nDear Father Guy:\n\nI wish to refer to your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a copy of the Rev. Father Welch's communication to you, concerning the needs at the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding Schools.\n\nIn view of your recommendation, and in the light of the report of Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, of Victoria, I am now prepared, upon receiving the definite offer of the Rev. Mother Provincial, to discuss with the Minister the advisability of purchasing the property known as Block 123 at the Squamish Boarding School.\n\nAs I have intimated in a communication to the Rev. Father Welch - a copy of which is enclosed for your information - nothing can be done this year towards the major improvements needed at the St. Mary's Boarding School. This matter will be kept in mind when the Estimates are being prepared next year.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. Jos. Guy, O.M.I.,\nUniversity of Ottawa,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, May 26, 1922.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nHonorable Charles Stewart:\n\nSome months ago the attention of the Department was drawn to the fact that the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding Schools, in British Columbia, were subjected to heavy municipal taxation. These institutions are situated on the outskirts of Mission City and North Vancouver and, as the properties are owned by Roman Catholic Church Orders, they have not been exempt from municipal taxation.\n\nIn order to release the per capita earnings of these schools for legitimate current expenses, I caused to be included in the Supplementary Estimates for 1921-22 an item of $1800.\n\nReceipted bills for the taxes for 1921 at the Squamish Boarding School ($977.91) and the St. Mary's Boarding School ($468.60) have, at my request, been presented to the Department. These taxes were levied on that portion of the properties in question used exclusively for Indian residential school purposes. I beg to recommend that authority be given to reimburse the management of the Squamish and St. Mary's Boarding Schools.\n\nAt the Squamish Boarding School the property consists of two blocks - one of 4 acres, on which the taxes mentioned above amounted to $977.91. This amount the Department proposes to pay. The school is situated on this block of land in the City of North Vancouver. Immediately across the street from the school, the Sisters in charge own Block 123 - a 5 acre parcel used for pasturage and for a potato patch. This property is assessed at $42,500; the taxes for 1920 and 1921 were, respectively, $1765.44 and $1653.13 which, with a penalty of $247.97, make a total of $3,665.54. I have not recommended that these arrears be paid, as the value value in retaining the property for school purposes is not commensurate with the amount of money involved.\n\nInformation is now to hand that the Sisters in charge of the school and the Rev. Mother Provincial of their Order would prefer to sell this 5 acre block to the Department at a nominal price (suggested $2,000) rather than have the property revert to the city because of unpaid taxes. Mr.\n\n- Inspector -\nInspector Ditchburn of Victoria, a valued officer of this Department, recommends that we purchase from the Sisters and offer the block to them for school purposes, until such time as the school is closed. Our representative reports that there would be no difficulty in getting our investment out of the property.\n\nI respectfully ask for instructions in this connection.\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nOttawa, June 26, 1922.\n\nDear Mr. Ditchburn:\n\nReferring to previous correspondence regarding the payment of taxes on the St. Mary's and Squamish Boarding School properties, I beg to say that cheques drawn in favour of the respective principals are being sent to Rev. Father Welch, New Westminster, B. C., for the payment of the taxes levied on the portion of St. Mary's Boarding School known as District Lot No. 2, amounting to $468.60 and for the Squamish Boarding School on Block 69, amounting to $977.91.\n\nWith reference to the purchase of Block 123 at the Squamish Boarding School, comprising 5 acres, on which 2 years' taxes are due, I beg to say that the Superintendent General has approved of the purchase of this block for the sum of $2,000 and payment of arrears of taxes for 1920 and 1921 and accrued taxes since that date. I have to request that you will arrange for the completion of the necessary documents in connection with the transfer of this property to the Crown, represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. These documents should be properly executed by the parties authorized to do so, and any expenses in connection with this matter will be paid upon receipt of properly certified vouchers covering the amount. The deeds should be duly registered.\n\nI will be pleased if you will forward a voucher covering the amount to be paid by this Department in the purchase of this lot as well as taxes due thereon up to date of transfer. Rev. Father Welch is being informed that you have been requested to arrange for the proper transfer of title in this lot to this Department.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan O. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nOttawa, June 26, 1922.\n\nDear Father Welch:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant, regarding payment of the taxes for the year 1921 on Lot 2 in connection with the St. Mary's Boarding School and on Block 69, comprising 5 acres at the Squamish Boarding School.\n\nI am pleased to enclose herewith cheques drawn in favour of the respective principals for the amount of taxes paid by the school authorities on the above properties for the year 1921, as per tax receipts forwarded. The taxes paid for that year on Lot 2 at St. Mary's amount to $468.60 and on Block 69 at Squamish, $977.91.\n\nRegarding Block 123, comprising 5 acres, which is situated across the street from the school, I beg to say that the Superintendent General has approved of the purchase by this Department of this property, and will pay therefor to the Rev. Sisters the sum of $2,000.00 together with arrears of taxes for the years 1920 and 1921 and accrued taxes from the first of January, last, to the date of purchase. After this land has been acquired by the Department, it is to be used by the Sisters for school purposes.\n\nI am requesting Mr. Inspector Ditchburn, of Victoria, to take the necessary action to arrange for the transfer of Block 123 to the Crown for the sum of $2,000.00 and the payment of arrears of taxes. As soon as the documents for the transfer of this property are completed a cheque will be sent covering the payment at the above figure and the taxes due.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. J. Welch, O.M.I.,\n59 Blackwood St.,\nNew Westminster, B. C.\nSquamish Mission\n\nIndian Boarding School\n\nNorth Vancouver, B.C., July 8, 1922.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nI must in the first place thank you very, very much for the cheque you so kindly sent me through Rev. Father Welch also for the promise of purchasing block 43 for the sum of $250.00 together with an acre of land.\n\nPlease let me extend my gratitude and may Almighty God guard you and all those who understand as well as you do the difficulties and tribulations of the Indians.\n\nWe have had the visit of Dr. R. Ferrier and both male and female enjoyed it immensely.\n\nIt is good to think we have friends in Ottawa who will always help us in time of need.\n\nThanking you once more for your kindness,\n\nI remain dear Sir,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\n**GOVERNMENT OF THE DOMINION OF CANADA**\n\n**Department of Indian Affairs, British Columbia**\n\n---\n\n**NEW WESTMINSTER AGENCY**\n\n*To Marie Chaminade, Squamish Indian School, North Vancouver, B.C.*\n\n---\n\n| DATE | DETAIL                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n|      | To reimbursement arrears of taxes 1920-21 and accrued taxes for seven months 1922, on Block 123, District Lot 271, North Vancouver, as below: |        |\n|      | 1920\u2014Taxes.................................................................................. | $4,765.44 |\n|      | Interest..................................................................................... | 223.66 |\n|      | 1921\u2014Taxes.................................................................................. | 1,901.10 |\n|      | Interest..................................................................................... | 86.75 |\n|      | 1922\u2014Taxes to Aug. 1st (seven months)...................................... | 941.02 |\n|      | To purchase price of Lot agreed upon                                  | 2,000.00 |\n\n---\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just; also that all expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\n---\n\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies.\n### CORPORATION OF THE CITY OF NORTH VANCOUVER\n\n#### Taxes 1922, Arrears and Delinquent\n\n| Number | Name | Address | Amount | Interest |\n|--------|------|---------|--------|----------|\n| 2      | 151  | 5595    | $42,300 | $260.10 |\n\n**Total:** $42,560.10\n\n---\n\n**Dear Sir or Madam:**\n\nYou are hereby notified that the taxes on the property herein mentioned are as follows, and are now due and payable at the City Hall.\n\n---\n\n**Interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the 1st of the year following that in which they became due, must be added to all taxes in error, and delinquent taxes, 1922, an additional interest of 6% will be added to all postmarked August 1st or previous, not subject by statute, addition, interest, or penalty, or other charge, otherwise there may be a delay in mailing your receipt.\n\nIf the property herein described has been transferred since forward, the new owner is liable for the taxes.\n\n---\n\n**C.

Ellis & Brown, solicitors of Vancouver, to carry out all the legal details in connection with the transfer and registration of the property in the name of the Crown as represented by the Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs. The title was searched and found to be held in the name of Marie Chaminade, (Sister Mary Amy, Principal of the Squamish Mission Indian Boarding School). In order that the property could be transferred free of all encumbrances I had the Reverend Sister clear up the taxes to the 1st of August received bills for which are attached to Voucher No. 24A, which I am herewith submitting. The voucher is for $6,919.97 in favor of Marie Chaminade made up as hereunder:\n\n| Year   | Taxes          | Interest |\n|--------|---------------|---------|\n| 1920   | $1,765.44     | $23.66  |\n| 1921   | $1,901.10     | $86.75  |\n| 1922   | $941.02       |         |\n\nTo purchase price of lot agreed upon: $2,000.00\n\nTotal: $6,919.97\n\nYou will observe that on the tax receipts the arrears for 1921 are set down as $1,901.10. This comprises the amounts of $1,653.13 plus a penalty of $247.97, as shown in my letter of 23rd March last.\n\nPlease forward me cheque for the above amount as soon as convenient and I will turn it over to the Reverend Sister and take her receipt therefor.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nW.

The voucher which you submitted, covering the purchase price, arrears of taxes for 1920 and 1921 and accrued taxes since that date, together with receipt for payment of taxes to the Corporation of the City of North Vancouver, has also been received.\n\nCheque No. 1454 for Six Thousand Nine Hundred and Nineteen Dollars and Ninety-seven Cents ($6919.97) is enclosed herewith, drawn in favour of Marie Chaminade and Ellis & Brown, Solicitors, covering the amount of the above voucher. You will please hand this cheque to the Solicitors, which they should certify and turn over to the Rev. Sister Superior, upon the completion of the signing of the deeds for the transfer of the property. The deed should be registered and a copy of same forwarded for our files.\n\nI would be pleased if you will expedite the completion of the transfer of this property and forward a copy of the deed at an early date.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nChief Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVictoria, B. C.\nSQUAMISH BOARDING SCHOOL.\n\nEverything possible should be done for this institution, as there is no farm and but a small garden. All the boys are little fellows. If we purchase Block 123, we might do well to arrange for its levelling and cultivation - this would enhance its value in case of sale in later years. Before paying the taxes for 1923 on Block 69, we should endeavour to have two acres assessed at the agricultural rate. The Sister Superior would be very grateful if one of our representatives could look into this for her.\n\nThe furnaces are bad in this school. Two sewing machines and two large washing machines (hand) are badly needed.\n\nThe work done in the classrooms at this school is splendid: one of the best speeches I ever heard from an Indian pupil was delivered at the time of my visit. They have 20 day pupils here and we should give them a day school grant.\nCopy.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS, BRITISH COLUMBIA\nNew Westminster Agency.\n\nTo J.N.

All the boys are little fellows. If we purchase Block 123, we might do well to arrange for its levelling and cultivation - this would enhance its value in case of sale in later years. Before paying the taxes for 1923 on Block 69, we should endeavour to have two acres assessed at the agricultural rate. The Sister Superior would be very grateful if one of our representatives could look into this for her.\n\nThe furnaces are bad in this school. Two sewing machines and two large washing machines (hand) are badly needed.\n\nThe work done in the classrooms at this school is splendid: one of the best speeches I ever heard from an Indian pupil was delivered at the time of my visit. They have 20 day pupils here and we should give them a day school grant.\nPugwash Boarding School\nNovember 11, 1922\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI feel it my duty to thank the Department and you in particular, for the cheque you so kindly sent me, to cover the taxes on block 69 for the year 1922.\n\nI also wish to express my gratitude for the salary of $600.00 allowed to the teacher of the day pupils. This salary will enable me to make some urgent repairs in the school, for instance, the two furnaces which I had mentioned to Rev. Dr. MacLachlan.\n\nThanking you most heartily, I remain,\ndear Sir,\n\nRespectfully Yours,\n\nSister Mary Amy\nPrincipal\nSir,\n\nReferring to Departmental Letter dated the 2nd inst., File 122050-1, I beg to inform the Department that Miss Dynes interviewed the Assessor at the City Hall, North Vancouver, B.C., in connection with having a portion of Block 69 assessed at the agricultural rate, on which the Department pay the taxes for Squamish Mission Boarding School.\n\nThe Assessor requested her to have a representative of our Department appear before a Board of Directors that will deal with cases of this kind, on the 8th of February next.\n\nI will appear before the Board on the date mentioned and have this matter in order before the taxes are due next Fall.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nChas.

L. 271 - North Vancouver.\n\nI beg to advise that at the sitting of the Court of Revision held this morning the case of the above Squamish Indian School was fully discussed, and the assessment on the Block was upheld on the ground that it was equitably assessed with surrounding property.\n\nThe Court had no power to grant a reduction on the basis of the land being used for Agricultural or Horticultural purposes, as it is not wholly used for this purpose.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCITY ASSESSOR.\nSir,\n\nWith further reference to your letter of November 2nd last, No.122050/1, having reference to the desire on the part of the Department to have the Municipal Authorities in North Vancouver assess a portion of Block 64, which is being used for school purposes at the agricultural rate, I beg to advise you that I attended two sittings of the Court of Revision at North Vancouver, in connection with the above.\n\nIn the first place, the Court functions only to assess values, in which connection a letter of the Assessor received at the conclusion of the Court sittings is sent you herewith.\n\nI asked the Court to consider any possible reduction that might be made under the Municipal Act, by way of eliminating the actual improvements, that is the actual site of school and out-buildings, or improvements, but the City Solicitor advised the Court that there was nothing in the Municipal Act to give authority for immunity from taxation in respect of property such as referred to. I then asked the Court if it thought the school portion of the taxes could be eliminated if the matter were brought to the Council's attention. The Court's reply was that as the school in question is not a city school it would have to pay taxes as other schools not being city schools in the vicinity were paying.\n\nReference was made smilingly by the Court Chairman to the purchase by the Department of Block 122, under which purchase the land being vested in the Crown became immune from taxation, detrimental to the best interests of the Municipality from a financial standpoint, and it was thought there would be no disposition on the part of the City Council to make any arrangement for tax reduction below assessed values in view of this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC.C.

SUTTON\n\nVANCOUVER, B.C., March 19th, 1923.\n\nThe Honourable\nThe Minister of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nSir,\n\nI have been instructed by the Municipal Council of the City of North Vancouver to communicate with you and bring to your attention the following matters, in reference to certain lands situate in the City of North Vancouver, and upon which is situate a school, and which has for several years past been conducted by the Sisters of the Roman Catholic Church. The following are the facts:\n\nOn 9th December 1897 one, Elliott B. Burne conveyed to Marie Chaminade, the Sister Superior, Block 123, District Lot 271 in City of North Vancouver, the consideration as expressed in the Deed being $3,900.00; on the 28th July 1922 Marie Chaminade made a transfer of this Block to His Majesty the King in right of the Dominion of Canada as represented by the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, the expressed consideration being $6,919.97, the property being valued on the assessment roll of the city at $42,500.00.\n\nThis transfer was made after the Owners of this lot had appealed to the Court of Revision, sitting to revise the assessment roll of said city, and after such appeal had been refused.\n\nThe Municipal Council view this transfer as a colorable transaction and made with the express intention of evading payment of the lawful taxes to said city, falling due annually thereon; and I have been instructed to ask that your Department make an enquiry in this matter and if you find what the City Council believes to be correct, to have this land returned to the actual owners, thereby rendering the same liable to taxation.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"A. C. SUTTON\"\n\nCity Solicitor for\nCity of North Vancouver.\nSir,\n\n595-23\nRe: Block 123, D.L. 271, North Vancouver.\n\nI have the honour to hand you herewith copy of communication just received from the City Solicitor for North Vancouver addressed to the Minister of Justice relative to Block 123, District Lot 271 in that city and referring to transfer thereof to the Crown as possibly a colourable transaction made with the express intention of evading payment of taxes. Might I ask to be instructed in this regard please? I have merely acknowledged receipt of the solicitor's letter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n\"Encl.\"\n\nAsst.

It is the policy of this Government to meet, from parliamentary appropriation, capital as well as current expenses at Indian residential schools, provided that funds can be found for the purpose. This Department has been paying and will meet, annually, the taxes on block 69 on which the school buildings are situated. Arrears of, and accrued taxes, as on the first of August, 1922, on block 123 amounted to $4,919.97. The school authorities, under cover of February 20, 1922, informed us that they could not possibly pay the taxes on block 123 and that it would be sold during the coming summer. This Department intervened, for the property was absolutely necessary for the satisfactory conduct of the school; and we acquired it by a payment of $6,919.97.\n\nTitle for block 123 D.L. 271 North Vancouver is now in the Crown, and when the property is no longer necessary for our educational work, it will be publicly sold and the proceeds considered as public moneys. You may assure the City Solicitor for North Vancouver that we are the actual owners of the property in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW.

Perry,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nA. AITKEN GRAY  \nCity Solicitor  \nNORTH VANCOUVER, B.C.  \nJune 18th, 1925.\n\nThe Deputy Minister of Justice,  \nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Block 123, D.L.271, City of North Vancouver  \nYour file B.5312.\n\nYour letter to the Corporation of the City of North Vancouver has been referred to me for reply.\n\nThe City does not for a moment contend that it can assess and levy taxes on property the fee of which is in the Crown nor had the block in question been assessed since its transference to the Crown.\n\nThe facts are that up until July, 1922 the property in question was registered in the name of Marie Chaminade of North Vancouver. Block 122 adjoining was also assessed in her name. There are various buildings consisting of a school, priest's house etc. erected on Block 122; Block 123 being a vacant piece of ground. The school referred to is not one for the education of Indian children, but receives any child of the Catholic faith.\n\nOn the 27th of July, 1922, taxes due were as follows:\n\n| Year | Amount |\n|------|--------|\n| 1920 | $1765.44 |\n| 1921 | 1901.10 |\n| 1922 | 1620.16 |\n\nAccrued interest to 27/7/22\n\n$5286.70  \n312.41  \n$5599.11\n\nOn the 27th of July, 1921, there was paid\n\non account of taxes $4607.56  \ninterest 312.41 $4919.97\n\nleaving a balance due of 679.14  \nadd percentage addition for non payment previous to a certain date 101.87\n\nMaking a total due at date Crown acquired property of $781.01\nUnder the provisions of our Municipal act the 1922 taxes had been assessed some months before the Crown acquired title. The Crown therefore acquired the property with taxes properly assessed against it, and the Municipality is simply exercising its rights to sell the lands for taxes assessed prior to the Crown acquiring the property. You will observe that under Sec. 233 our Municipal act (R.S.B.C. 1924, Chap. 179) taxes are considered to have been imposed on and from the 1st day of January in each year. When you have considered the matter in this light, I have no doubt that you will appreciate and agree with the viewpoint of the City.\n\nThe Council has no desire to indulge in litigation and feels sure that, with the facts as outlined herein before you, you will agree that the Corporation is entitled to taxes due prior to the acquisition of the land by the Crown and amounting to $781.01 with interest thereon.\n\nThe Council further regrets that the remarks of my predecessor have given umbrage. It would be idle to deny that the transaction did not at the time of its completion seem curious to the citizens of North Vancouver. At no time however has the Council suggested that the Crown was party to any colourable transaction, but at time it was felt that the Crown might have been made an innocent party to a transaction detrimental to the City's interests owing to all facts not having been put before the proper Ministers.\n\nThe facts as I am advised are that in 1922, the Council was approached by a party other than the Crown with a view to having said Block 123 exempted from taxation. Apart from there being no authority under the Municipal act...\nfor so doing, the Council in any case could see no valid reason for complying. The statement was then made by the applicant that the owners could get exemption in some other way. Shortly after, the Block was transferred to the Crown and has ever since been left undeveloped and unused with the local improvements charged against it payable by the City, in addition to the loss of revenue from taxes. I take it however from your letter that you are satisfied that the Crown was not made use of by the former owners of the land without being made aware of all the facts. There is, as you no doubt know, an Indian Reserve within the City Boundaries.\n\nI shall be glad to hear from you and if you agree that the City is rightly entitled under the circumstances to $781.01 with interest thereon, the whole situation will be cleared up.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"A. AITKEN GRAY\"\n\nCity Solicitor.\n\nAAG/ALJ\n\nP.S. I shall be glad to give you any further information you desire either as to taxes or as to conditions when the Crown took over.\nI have the honour to refer to your letter of May 20th, 1925, and to pass you here-with copy of letter just received from the City Solicitor, North Vancouver and your departmental file and Certificate of Title No. 77653-I covering Block 123, D.L.271. I should be glad of any remarks or further instructions you may have to give us herein and would ask for return of your file and papers should such instructions call for further consideration of this material.\n\nSo far as taxes attaching as of January 1st of the year of assessment are concerned, I might say that in 1922 this department was in correspondence with the Municipality of Point Grey upon a similar question, which eventually became the subject of suit. The case did not come to trial, having been settled as a result of negotiations. The point involved was whether, under the circumstances of that case, the taxes accrued January 1st of the year of assessment or later as of the date of notice to the land owner, the Crown having purchased in the interim and being inclined to contend that taxes should be adjusted as of the date of purchase. Our agents advised us at the time that...\nthe Government had a reasonable prospect of success in the litigation, but the officers of the municipality during their presence in Ottawa represented very strongly what they considered to be the injustice of the Government's contention, pointing out that the municipality put in extensive water works, sewers, streets, sidewalks etc., improving the neighbourhood with the expectation that the cost would be covered by rateable taxation over all the property affected by the improvements; that in the absence of these improvements the property would not have been suitable for the Government purposes and therefore would not have been taken, and that it came as a surprise to the municipality that the Government should in the circumstances repudiate liability for its proportion of the taxes for the year in which the property was acquired. While these people realized that for the future there would be no legal liability and therefore no claim they considered that for the single year in question, seeing that the law of the case was doubtful and the merits of their claim, from their point of view, so well established, the Government should admit and pay the claim to the extent of the principal amount, the municipality agreeing to remit the balance and pay its own costs of the litigation. This department, on that occasion, felt that we had an arguable case with a fair chance to succeed, but that in the case of most lawsuits it was impossible to predict the ultimate result.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

It is the intention of this Department to follow the precedent established by your Department in 1922 in a case with the municipality of Point Grey, i.e., to pay the taxes in full without interest for the year in which transfer was made. I am corresponding with the Collector for the City of North Vancouver, in an effort to effect this settlement.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. Stuart Edwards, Esq.,\nDeputy Minister,\nDept. of Justice,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 1, 1925.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to refer to your notice, No. 6634, dated the 26th of March, last, which is relative to Block 123, D. L. 271, North Vancouver. I referred this matter to the Department of Justice and they have been in correspondence with Mr. A. Aitken Gray, City Solicitor. This gentleman's letter to the Deputy Minister of Justice, dated the 18th of June, last, explains the viewpoint of the City of North Vancouver. I now understand that the 1922 taxes had been assessed some months before the Crown acquired title and that you are asking payment of the taxes in full for that year. I am advised that the law in this case is doubtful and, although I consider we have a reasonable prospect of success in the event of litigation, the Department of Indian Affairs will be willing, in view of the representations of your City Solicitor, to pay the balance of taxes for the year 1922, amounting to $761.01. If this is satisfactory to the corporation, I should be pleased if you would let me have an account in duplicate for this amount.\n\nIn the light of the fact that this Department received a few weeks ago for the first time information that the City of North Vancouver considered the balance of taxes for 1922 should be paid, I cannot agree to pay interest on the principal amount.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I find that both in Vancouver and Victoria the Government has always commuted the local improvements and paid the City. This would seem to be only fair and equitable.\n\nFor your information I am enclosing herewith particulars of local improvements charged against the above property under by-laws 49, 61, 171, and 204, together with a summary. All statements are sent to you in quadruplicate. I believe that the Government has some special form which it desires to be completed in such cases, these being, I believe, supplied by the Department of Public Works. If you wish these completed and will send me a supply, I shall be glad to arrange for their proper completion.\nI feel sure that you will agree that the City of North Vancouver should be treated in exactly the same way as other Cities and Municipalities in British Columbia, and that therefore the Local Improvement rates should be settled by the Government through your department.\n\nAwaiting the favour of your reply,\n\nI remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCity Solicitor.\n\nAAG/C.\n", "source": "olmocr", "added": "2025-10-06", "created": "2025-10-06", "metadata": {"Source-File":
