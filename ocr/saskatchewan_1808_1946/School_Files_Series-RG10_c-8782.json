Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payments be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Chas. F. Stewart\n\nDated: June 30, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lytton this June 30, 1950\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F.

PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Peter's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lytton this June 30, 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3668\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND ON RESERVE |

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupil in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupil in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL NATION, R.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Ind.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL and tuition at the LYNNON, B.C., School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND RES SCHOOL LYTON, B.C. School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Sept. 30, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lyton this 21 day of Sept., 1950.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed

Volume 6463, file 888-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet or the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL and tuition at the LYTON, B.C. School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated DECEMBER 31, 1950.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lyton this 31st day of January, 1951.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA. 403 R. 3008\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | BAND OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL

**Average attendance of pupils during Quarter:**\n- **Amount of per capita grant due for Quarter:**\n\n---\n\n**NOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column.**\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL and tuition at the LYTTON, B.C. School for the Quarter ended DECEMBER 31, 1951.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: DECEMBER 31, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: Lytton, this 9th day of January, 1952.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA. 403 R. 5008\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**Lytton Agency**\n\n**REPORT of the St. George's School at Lytton, B.C.**\n\n**Reserve for

pupils\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance at the Sr. GEORGE'S IND.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Ind.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Ind. Res. School, Lytton, B.C., School for the Quarter ended MAR 31, 1954.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: MAR 31, 1954.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Lytton, B.C., School for the Quarter ended MAR 31 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated MAR 31 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Lytton this 16 April 1951\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | RANK OR RESERVE | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...............................................................School for the Quarter ended.........................................................19.........\n\nPrincipal..............................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................................19.........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nLYTTON, B.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ...............................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19.........\n\nPrincipal.................................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils enrolled on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ......................................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 28th, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at LYTON, B.C.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. IA-403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended December 31st, 1951.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 28th, 1951.\n\nI have carefully examined

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Ind. Res. School, Lytton, B.C., School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 5, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDated at: Lytton, B.C.\n\nthis APRIL 15, 1952.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided

\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended March 31st, 1952.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 5th, 1952.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nDated at APR 15 1952\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Ind. Res. School... School for the Quarter ended... January... 30... 1952.\n\nPrincipal... Charles F. Wilson\n\nDated...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8.

PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nLYTTON, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupil during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended:\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nLYTTON, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ..............................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................19......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nLYTTON, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended .................................................. 19 ..........\n\nPrincipal ................................................................. 19 ..........\n\nDated ................................................................. 19 ..........\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nLYTTON, B.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the .................................................................School for the Quarter ended..................................................10......\n\nPrincipal..................................................................\n\nDated.................................................................19......\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nLYTTON, B.

Volume 6163, file 888-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. GEORGE'S IND.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Ind. Res. School, Lytton, B.C., School for the Quarter ended DEC 31 1952.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: DEC 31 1952\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDated at: JAN 16 1953\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively, according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL School for the Quarter LYTTON, B.C. ended DEC 31 1952 19 Principal Charles F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\nActing Principal: [Signature]\n\nDated: September 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Lytton, B.C., this Oct. 1st, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the care of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the feet thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's Residential School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1941.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated September 30, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated October 12, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I A. 408\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pinging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Chas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1941.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Brown\n\nDated Dec. 31, 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this date, Dec. 31, 1941\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

grant due for Quarter:** $\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 1, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this April 6, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Sevres School for the Quarter ended Jan. 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1942.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this June 30, 1942.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When going to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance on the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1942.\n\nPrincipal Chas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Charles H.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY Certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended 30th June 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Chas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter's per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Eugene School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1940.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Harris\n\nDated Oct. 1, 1940\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Oct. 15, 1940\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. James' School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: Peter F.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupil in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated Oct. 1st, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated Oct. 1st, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

NOTE\u2014Additions to be correctly made and entered at the foot of column. |\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 4, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 4, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Patrick's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Jan. 3, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: April 3, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at this April 3, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A.403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Saviour's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Harvey\n\nDated July 1, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated July 5, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Charles H. Steele\n\nDated: Oct. 4, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Harris\n\nDated Oct. 4, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at Lytton, Oct. 16th, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Chas.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate\" number of days pupils in residence during quarter by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Howard\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1944\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Patrick's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Where, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Hirsch\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0294            | Anna Phillips   | I3  | I   | Lyton|                |                   |                          |                           | 806574323    |\n| 0295            | Agnes Frank     | I3  | I   | Cook's Ferry|             |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0296            | Alana Dick      | I3  | I   | Lyton|                |                   |                          |                           | 92 51        |\n| 0297            | Pearl Abbott    | I0  | I   | Boothroyd|              |                   |                          |                           | 92 45        |\n| 0298            | Maggie Dick     | I0  | I   | Ashcroft|               |                   |                          |                           | 92 32        |\n| 0301            | Ramona Bent     | II  | I   | Shulus|               |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0302            | Marjorie Aled   | I2  | I   | Lyton|                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0303            | Phyllis Dunstan | I3  | I   | ..   |                |                   |                          |                           | 92 45        |\n| 0304            | Hazel Munro     | I2  | I   | Sicke|                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0305            | Jane Samson     | I2  | I   | Lyton|                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0306            | Amy Samson      | II  | I   | ..   |                |                   |                          |                           | 92 45        |\n| 0307            | Helen Machelle  | I3  | I   | Kanaka Bar|              |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0308            | Annie Frank     | I2  | I   | Cook's Ferry|             |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0309            | Nancy Hance     | I4  | I   | Kanaka Bar|              |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0311            | Dora Hance      | I2  | I   | ..   |                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0312            | Ruth Samson     | II  | I   | ..   |                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0313            | Marion Samson   | I0  | I   | ..   |                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0315            | Amelia James    | I3  | I   | Lyton|                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0316            | Martha Fraser   | I3  | I   | Boothroyd|              |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0317            | Loretta May Smith| I3 | I   | ..   |                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0318            | Rosie Spinke    | I2  | I   | Lyton|                |                   |                          |                           | 92 52        |\n| 0319            | Mary L.

No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Paul's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1944\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginating No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly stipulated grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated April 3, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this... 19...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Charles F. Hare\n\nDated April 7, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this day of this month, 1945.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated June 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated July 9, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nResp.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added, and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the rate of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1945.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Oct. 5, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated: Oct. 14, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance-in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL and tuition at the LYTTON, B.C.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Charles L.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ST. GEORGE'S IND. RES. SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended Mar. 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Charles J. Hume\n\nDated: April 11, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nO.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: July 6, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: July 16, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 463\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated July 6, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated July 16, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paginat No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Sept. 30, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Charles T.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u2014means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. Then, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, but another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended.\n\nDated:\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated:\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days' attendance of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Oct. 2, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter's per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day of the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is determined by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarter per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. George's School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residences of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

10 Volume 6463, file 888-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertainable by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: Dec. 31, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Affairs\n\nDated: Jan. 7, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Patrick's School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 7, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated April 12, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Sh. Povesh School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: [Signature]\n\nNOTE:\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-2, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for whom grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging if No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Peter's School for the Quarter ended Sept. 30, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 1, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated Oct. 1, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will

PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\nThe amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI declare that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended\n\nDated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. LA 403 R. 3608\n| REGISTER NUMBER |

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY/GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|----------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|\n| 0435            | Doreen Hanco   | 8   | I       | Boothroyd      | K                 |                         |                           | 30/18       |\n| 0439            | Annette Munro  | 7   | I       | Siska          | K                 |                         |                           | 30/18       |\n| 0440            | Mercy Nelson   | 13  | I       | P.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertainable by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the St. Joseph School for the Quarter ended January 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 31, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: [Signature]\n\nDated: [Date]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Training & Welfare,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI shall need some money to care for this quarter's expenditures.\n\nAt this time of the year, I realise that it is rather a proposition for the Department to make advances, but if there is any way other than raising enough money at the Bank to take care of my needs, I should very much appreciate a cheque to the amount of some $2500.00. This will get me by but a cheque of $3000.00 would practically clear my books and give me a clear balance, or close to a balance on the right side for this year.\n\nThe reason, of course, for this shortage this year is very obvious. Had I had the children in the School and my average had been around 165 instead of 136/8, I should have been well away on the year's work.\n\nI shall be glad if you will let me know by return what the Department can do in the way of forwarding a cheque to take care of the remainder of the financial year, as I have a number of bills which should be paid, in the way of grocery, light and clothing.\n\nI might point out that last quarter I was able to take care of a great many bills by using the money forwarded for the heating installations and changes. As you will note by the report these installations were not entirely paid for until January 24th., the reason being that they were subject to the acceptance of the Boiler Inspector before being fully taken over by the School.\n\nThanking you for immediate attention,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\n**DEPARTMENT:** MINES & RESOURCES  \n**BRANCH:** INDIAN AFFAIRS  \n**DATE:** February 10, 1938\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE No. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Rev.

I note that you state that this condition is due to the fact that you have not been able to obtain your authorized enrolment.\n\nWhen you visit Ottawa you should come prepared to discuss with the officials of this Branch the reason why it has not been possible to secure the number of pupils for which per capita allowance is authorized at the St. George's Residential School. The majority of our Indian Residential Schools are overcrowded and it is difficult for us to explain why a school with accommodation for 150 has only had an average enrolment of 136.5.\n\nI would also point out that the last quarterly financial statement from the St. George's School covered the quarter ended March 31, 1937. The June, September and December quarterly financial statements have not yet reached us. It is felt that as you keep your books up to date at all times there should be no trouble in forwarding the quarterly financial statement immediately after the close of the quarter. Please let me have the three statements mentioned above by return mail.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett, L.S.T.,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nUnder separate cover you are being forwarded a cheque for $3,000.00 which it is noted from the second paragraph of your letter will enable you to end the current fiscal year with a clear balance.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n| Item | Description          | Amount |\n|------|----------------------|--------|\n| 1    | General              |        |\n| 2    | C.P.

I also have made out a statement for the nine months which shows a slightly different balance than that showing on the December monthly sheet.\n\nLast spring auditor Willis changed my system of bookkeeping a bit and as I am not a book keeper I have found it hard to adjust myself. While I was aware that the Dept. wished a quarterly statement, I had hoped that this would have been overlooked until I had another Audit. I however hope that you will find in them the information you require. While I am a little out yet they will give you some idea of Receipts and Expenses.\n\nIf there is anything needing explanation, I shall be glad to make such.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nP.S.: I hope you will excuse the handwriting.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-3, part 3)\nFinancial Statement April 1st------ Dec. 31st.\n\nReceipts---\nB.C.F.------------------- 376.38\nGovt.

In regard to my visit in the East, I shall have with me about 160 ft. of coloured 16 mm film and would be glad to show these to you when in Ottawa. They are extremely interesting and I think you would find them very entertaining.\n\nI am hoping to show in some of the Churches and if it is possible for you to loan a 16 mm projector from, say, the Dept. of Natural Resources, it would be very convenient indeed.\nProvince: BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended...

Kelan,\nDept. of Dominion Affairs,\n\nAtlanta,\n\nDear Mr. Kelan,\n\nI am getting anxious about my Per Capita allowance cheque. It generally arrives about the 20th month following the census and I am wondering whether or not it has been forwarded.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6463, file 888-3, part 3)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOctober 11, 1938.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have just had an opportunity of reviewing the report submitted by Auditor T. G. Willis with reference to his examination of the books at the St. George's Indian Residential School on September 20 last.\n\nThe following are extracts from his report:\n\n\"The cash was only written up to July 31st and no bank reconciliation had been made since June 1937. Although the Principal had formerly made up a reconciliation every month he was unable to do so when he had a debit balance and as a result he did not make any from then on. It was therefore impossible to make a reconciliation, but after taking off a receipt and expenditure balance for the period I was able to verify the balance of $410.78 as shown in statement.\n\n\"Several adjustments were necessary as three cheques had been entered wrong and the bank charges for overdraft had been omitted in Credit cash book. Two notes were signed by Principal to the Bank of Commerce, Ashcroft, in the amounts of $700.00 and $2000.00 while awaiting per capita cheque from Department, but have both been paid and the charges were less than $5.00.\n\n\"The operation costs show the cost per child per day to be 68 cents and $250.16 per year. This is quite an increase over last year and with only an average attendance of 140 and staff of 18 the Principal will have difficulty in financing on the school's earnings.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\"\n\"The books and records were not found to be in as good condition as previous years and were not up to date. With the books now balanced there should be no difficulty in keeping them up to date and making a reconciliation every month.\"\n\nIt is hoped that with the books having been balanced you will be able to keep them up to date and make the necessary reconciliation every month.\n\nIncidentally it is noted that you have not submitted the quarterly financial statements for the quarters ended March 31 and June 30, 1938. The September quarter financial statement is also due. I realize from correspondence recently received from you that owing to the death of your mother you have been obliged to be absent from the school for a few days but I trust that you will prepare the quarterly financial statements for these three quarters and forward them to the Department. In future these statements should be forwarded promptly at the end of each quarter.\n\nIn official letter of February 27, 1936 you were requested not to obtain loans from the bank but to request advances on your per capita grant if necessary. The Department trusts that you will strictly comply with these instructions in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.R.L.

This\nwould be sufficient to take care of the arrears.\n\nI still have farm produce to the amount of some\n$700 to collect and which should come along in the very near\nfuture, but if possible for the Dept. to do so, I could use an\nextra $1000.\n\nThanking you for any help you may be able to\ngive us in this regard,\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nEnclosure\n\nA.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch.\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nFind enclosed herewith reports covering financial yearly accounts.\n\nYou will notice that the figures are much less this year than they have been, in total. The auditor did not wish me to include the value of farm produce consumed with the receipts, and consequently they were also left out in the food column expenditures. The value of food consumed in the School is \u00a37502.47.\n\nExcepting for extra wages, which item is down some \u00a31300, the expenditures individually run about the same.\n\nAdding the farm cash receipts to the farm produce consumed would make a regular farm intaking of \u00a311494.55.\n\nI am also enclosing monthly, quarterly and yearly statements, which I hope you will find satisfactory. If there is an explanation you need, I shall be very glad to try and make it.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nEnclos/\n## Financial Statement for Year Ending March 31st, 1939\n\n### Receipts\n\n| Description                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Balance carried forward              | 169.46   |\n| Gov't per capita grants              | 24408.97 |\n| Special grant for plumbing           | 4330.00  |\n| Extra per capita grant               | 1000.00  |\n| Farm produce sold                    | 4192.08  |\n| Manual training grant                | 300.00   |\n| Other sources                        | 476.70   |\n| **Total**                            | **34877.21** |\n\n### Expenditures\n\n| Description                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Salaries                             | 12131.29 |\n| Clothing                             | 2243.00  |\n| Food                                 | 3773.17  |\n| Fuel, light, water and phone         | 2241.36  |\n| Buildings and repairs                | 5369.26  |\n| House equipment                      | 384.34   |\n| Farm and garden                      | 3451.46  |\n| Transportation, freight, travel      | 1563.65  |\n| Extra labour                         | 2973.76  |\n| Miscellaneous                        | 712.74   |\n| **Total**                            | **34744.66** |\n\n### Capitulation\n\n| Description                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Debtor cash book total               | 34877.21 |\n| Credit cash book total               | 34744.66 |\n| Cheques unpresented                  | 158.71   |\n| Difference                           | 43       |\n| **Total**                            | **291.69** |\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT FOR QUARTER ENDING MARCH 31st, 1959.\n\nRECEIPTS\n\nBalance carried forward ........................................... 105.27\nGov't per capita grants ........................................... 3501.25\nAdvance grant ...................................................... 1000.00\nDairy ................................................................. 38.91\nFarm and garden .................................................... 1599.51\nOther sources ....................................................... 359.51\n\n6604.05 6604.05\n\nEXPENDITURES\n\nSalaries .............................................................. 2983.31\nClothing .............................................................. 418.25\nFood ................................................................. 1281.17\nFuel, light and phone .............................................. 375.79\nBuildings and repairs ............................................... 434.13\nHouse equipment .................................................. 6.40\nFarm and garden ................................................... 88.20\nTransportation, travel, freight .................................. 405.16\nExtra labour ......................................................... 224.85\nMiscellaneous ....................................................... 253.81\n\n6471.07 6471.07\n\nCapitulation\n\nDebtor cash book total ............................................. 6604.05\nCredit cash book total ............................................. 6471.07\nCheques unpresented .............................................. 132.98\nBalance in bank .................................................... 91.69\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nOriginated by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1619)\n\nLytton, B.C., April 4th, 1939.\n\nM.F.R.A.

The reason for this overdraft was simply that I did not receive my cheques in time to show on my first month's balance sheet and as the Department does not wish such to occur again, I would ask them to pay special attention, if possible, to at least part of my earnings being sent during the present month.\n\nI am aware of the fact that perhaps there is a difficulty because of the end of the fiscal year, but wish to point out the above facts in preparation for a possible repetition of last year.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\n\nOriginated by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1849)\n\nLytton, B.C., April 19th, 1939.\n\nMr. A.

I should like again to carry this out as there are two advantages in this manner of providing ourselves with meat.\n\n(1) The Indians receive cash for their produce and (2) it gives us an opportunity by feeding these cattle in our own feeding sheds in training the boys in finishing beef cattle, so necessary in this district where cattle raising is a big industry.\n\nThanking you in advance, I am\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nProvince of BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended December 31st 1938.\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

To ensure the necessary supply of clothing, I was obliged, because of conditions, to put in a year's supply, which bill for clothing amounts to some $2000.00. There is also a bill for boots and rubbers to an amount of some $400.00, and together with these our coal supply must be taken care of at this time of the year.\n\nThis, as you will note, will total $4500.00 in advance on a possible per capita earning return of $7,100.00; thus as it were spending in advance the greater part of the quarter's earnings. While this is so, there is no need to worry, as while I do expect a deficit, it will not be over $1500.00, and this could come to us, if available, from the New England grant to arrive during the quarter ending March 31st, in time to take care of salaries for the month of March.\n\nI am, therefore, contemplating a deficit on the year's work of $1500.00. I should be extremely grateful if the additional cheque could be forwarded to me as soon as possible so that I can take care of the condensed bills which conditions demanded this year. In other years I have been able to spread them out. I sincerely trust that I am not asking too much, and that you will see the necessity which has arisen and for which I wish to make provision.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n**REQUISITION FOR CHEQUE**\n\nTO BE USED FOR ADVANCES OR AUTHORIZED PAYMENTS FOR WHICH THERE ARE NO ACCOUNTS\n\nDEPARTMENT: MINES & RESOURCES\n\nBRANCH: INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nDATE: December 3, 1940.\n\nAPPLICATION IS HEREBY MADE FOR THE ISSUE OF THE FOLLOWING CHEQUE OR CHEQUES:\n\n| CHEQUE NO. | IN FAVOUR OF | AMOUNT |\n|------------|--------------|--------|\n|            | Rev.

The fact that my cheques have been held up, through no fault of my own, is creating a rather embarrassing financial position.\n\nI shall be obliged to explain to my staff and also to dry goods and other firms with whom I carry on school business that my cheques from the Department are somewhat delayed. I should be really glad if you would give immediate attention to these advances as I am really in need of cash with which to carry on. Prices for farm products have been very low this year, and I have not realized the cash subsidy which at this time of the year should be in. As you know, there is only the farm to rely upon, and unless the Department comes to my aid I cannot take care of my accounts. The Department has been very particular heretofor in specifying that I must take care of school expenditures through advanced grants.

This is being issued in favour of Mr. Stewart and yourself and should be endorsed by both of you and deposited in the school account which, I understand, is in the Bank of Montreal, Ashcroft, B. C. This amount should permit immediate payment of all outstanding accounts. Please advise me when this has been done.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. A.

Strang, Indian Agent,\nLYTTON, B.C.,\n\nDear Mr. Strang: This is to advise you that the following outstanding accounts as listed by Mr. Coleman, Inspector of Indian Agencies, in his July 15 financial statement of this school have been attended to. Cheques have gone forward today to the various firms, and in each case I have asked for the receipt in quadruplicate for government purposes.\n\nIt was necessary for me to hold back $100 in the account of Gillespie Grain Co and $200 in the case of Vancouver Inland Coal, since the $3000 sent to me by the Department in Ottawa was not enough to cover all outstanding accounts, since the accounts receivable as list on the July 15th statement have not been forthcoming to date. I trust the Department will realize it was necessary for me to leave certain accounts as not fully cleared off, as in the case of the two just mentioned above.\n\nI might add also there was $36.14 Indian wages for farm workers here in July due and had to give these attention, since the Indians were very restless over the matter.\n\nAccounts paid as per list of Mr. Coleman, July 15 are:\n\n| Name                        | Amount |\n|-----------------------------|--------|\n| J.

Additional\u2014there are the following accounts at present outstanding and not yet submitted to the Department in Ottawa. The delay is in the fact that Rev. Lett must in each case...\ncertify the bill is in order before submit it to Mr. Coleman for transmitting to Ottawa. I have sent on the following outstanding accounts for Mr. Lett's signature and trust he will attend to them soon, so the matter might be settled.\n\n- Leckie Shoe Co., Account\u2014many months old\u2014\u2014$548.76\n- Kelly Douglas Co., year old account\u2014\u2014$332.45\n- Mark Dummond Account\u2014This is additional to their account of $77.44 on July 15 statement\n\nVancouver Motors \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 $13.95\nConsolidated Optical Company \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 $243\nSinger Sewing Machine Company \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 $124.00\nB.

It may be however, he will consider only one half ($320) belongs to his term of office, till July 15, in such case only $320 would be staff wages owing to July 15.\n\nApart from above, $465.56 regular wages for July to staff is now due. These include two farm hands, manual training instructor, who has worked here all summer, cook, engineer and office worker. This is for the period of July 16 to July 31. There are also some extra wages for help during the canning period to be paid also.\n\nTherefore if you would kindly notify the Department of the situation here I would greatly appreciate it. The school bank account at present has a debit balance of about $180.00\n\nI shall see to it that all expenditure is kept to the minimum and that proper records are kept for inspection and investigation. Thanking you for your valuable help and assistance to me, I remain,\n\nVery truly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nActing Principal.\nLytton, B.C., August 15, 1941.\n\nSir,\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter dated July 30, 1941, I beg to enclose herewith a statement from Mr. Noel Stewart, Acting Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, giving the financial standing of the School up to date.\n\nThe enclosed statement shows the accounts paid from the $3000.00 received from the Department and outstanding accounts, records of which were not at hand at the time of Inspector Coleman's audit. It is respectfully requested that a further sum be made available as soon as possible to the Acting Principal in order that the outstanding accounts as listed may be paid. I would further suggest that the Department advise Bishop Adams to see that the late Principal endorse the outstanding accounts submitted to him with as little delay as possible as I fear they will receive the same consideration as the originals.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAS/RS.\nenc.\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my letter of even date regarding outstanding accounts owing by St. George's Indian Residential School, I would advise that I have just received advice from the Acting Principal of the following, amounting to $91.76:\n\n- Lytton Garage June account: $24.68\n- B.R. Meat Market: $33.00\n- Fraser Valley Milk Producers: $34.08\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nFor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, August 29, 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nUnder date of June 15th last, when the Department received from the Reverend A.R. Lett, Principal of the above-noted school, a letter tendering his resignation to be effective July 15, 1941, we wrote you requesting that you arrange for Mr. Coleman to visit the school and make an audit of the books and financial records for the period January 1st to July 15th, and also to advise the Department of any outstanding accounts as at that date.\n\nThe audit report and statement of outstanding accounts submitted by Mr. Coleman disclosed outstanding accounts amounting to $3,356.87 and accounts receivable of $469.60. Mr. Coleman recommended that an advance of $3,000.00 be made to pay these accounts. This amount was forwarded on July 30, 1941, and on August 14th Mr. Strang, the Indian Agent, furnished the Department with information as to the accounts paid. He also advised of further outstanding accounts of over $2,000.00.\n\nIn a letter received from Mr. Coleman on August 16th the outstanding accounts had increased to $2,372.72, and a further letter from Mr. Coleman of August 18th advises of additional accounts amounting to $91.76, while a letter from the Lytton Electric Company Limited encloses a statement showing light and power accounts due as at July 31st, 1941, of $356.32. Indian Agent Strang has recommended a further advance be made in order\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\norder that all these accounts may be settled.\n\nThe Department is greatly concerned over these accounts. When Mr. T.G. Willis visited this school on January 24, 1941, for the purpose of auditing the records, these outstandings were not disclosed by the Principal and no mention is made by Mr. Willis of them in his report other than that the Principal still found difficulty in financing on the school's earnings. It was only on Mr. Coleman's audit of July 15, 1941, that the outstanding bills were disclosed.\n\nBefore advancing any further monies, the Department is requesting that you visit the school and satisfy yourself that the articles purchased as represented by these accounts were necessary for the proper administration of the school and that they have been received at the school, and to determine as far as possible if all the outstandings have been disclosed.\n\nFor your information I enclose copies of the following:\n\nMr. Coleman's letter of July 21 enclosing his report of July 15.\nCopy of the account of the Lytton Electric Company Limited.\nMr. Coleman's letter of August 16.\nMr. Strang's letter of August 15 enclosing a letter from Mr. Stewart.\nMr. Coleman's letter of August 18.\n\nOn receipt of your report the Department will give consideration to the recommendation of advancing further monies.\n\nYours truly,\n\nActing Director.\n\nLWMc/S\nProvince of BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended September 30 1941.\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Mr. Noel Stewart, c/o | ST.

In addition to the information furnished on the report which you forwarded you should point out to the Principal that in future the following statement should also appear:\n\n**STATEMENT OF CURRENT ASSETS & LIABILITIES**\n\nat --------- 31st. 1942\n\n**ASSETS:**\n\n- Cash on Hand: $000.00\n- Cash in Bank: $000.00\n- Accounts Receivable: $000.00\n- Stock on Hand: $000.00 $0000.00\n\n**LIABILITIES:**\n\n- Accounts Payable: $000.00 $000.00\n\n**CURRENT SURPLUS:** $0000.00\n\nCertified Correct:\n\n.......................\n\nPrincipal\n\n**NOTE:**\n\nInclude proportion of earned per capita in Accounts Receivable. Attach lists of Accounts Receivable and Payable.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nI wish also to direct the attention of both the Principal and yourself to official letter of October 24, 1941, in which both of you were informed that the financial statement should be forwarded at the end of each month. The Department will expect that these instructions will be followed in future. If the bookkeeping is kept up to date as it should be there is no reason why the financial statement should not reach the Department within two weeks of the end of each month.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nFeb. 24, 1942\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWill you kindly send an advance per capita grant cheque to the amount of $2000.00. I am going to have difficulty in meeting all my obligations before the regular grant comes due. I don't think this difficulty will arise again, but owing to fuel, household equipment and repairs, our expenses have been high during the last quarter.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you will kindly forward cheque any time during the month of March.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas.

I was hopeful that you would find it unnecessary to make such applications. However, my primary purpose in writing this letter is to point out that there appears to be a tendency on your part to follow the same procedure as caused much of the trouble that existed between your predecessor and the Indian Agent. As previously intimated to you, we are anxious to avoid this state of affairs. I, therefore, suggest that you consult Mr. Strang and have him apply for an advance if necessary. When applying to him you should advise him why you consider an advance is needed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nLYTTON, B.C. Dec. 7, 1942.\n\nI have been approached by the Rev. C.F. Hives, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, with the request that he be advanced an amount of $2500.00 on the current quarterly per capita grant.\n\nI am pleased to recommend that this amount be advanced in order that he have sufficient funds on hand at the end of the month to pay his Staff, and would respectfully recommend that the Department give this request favourable consideration.\n\nAIR MAIL.\n\nA.

M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner, P.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, enclosing the October and November financial statements of the Principal of the St. George's Residential School. Please point out to him immediately that the financial statement should be sent at the end of each month. It is rather interesting to review these statements and I would like to bring the following to your attention:\n\n| Date       | Current surplus |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| September 30 | $6,775.65      |\n| October 31   | $5,102.47      |\n| November 30   | $4,807.05      |\n\nYou will note from the above that the current surplus has dropped over $1,900.00 in the last three months. There may be a good reason for this, but we have had such previous, unfortunate experiences regarding financing at this school that these figures have worried us a little. I might also draw your attention to the fact that the September statement showed salaries in arrears to the amount of $985.00. This item had increased to $1,253.50 at the end of November. The Principal should supply an explanation of why salaries are allowed to become in arrears.\n\nPossibly either you or Inspector Coleman would have an opportunity of discussing the financial situation at this school with the Principal some time in the near future following which interview you should write to me.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nDec. 3, 1943\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Strang:\n\nOur school financial situation is in rather a bad way; and I am writing you to ask if you will kindly place before the Commissioner a request that financial assistance be given us from the New England Company funds, if they are available.\n\nI have tried in every way to meet all our current expenses on the per capita grant allowance, and the return from the farm. Our farming returns this year were very much below normal. The fruit was almost a total failure; the potatoes were blighted; and the yield throughout was light. Salaries have had to be increased in order to obtain a staff of workers in the school. Food and clothing prices have advanced. Owing to epidemics of measles and colds we have had to use nearly two months of fuel extra; and our fuel bill is high in proportion. But the most serious extra expense is the advance in salaries; which we have had to increase 50 and 60 per cent in order to obtain workers.\n\nWe urgently require the sum of two thousand dollars to clear ourselves of all debt and pay all salaries by the end of the year.\n\nWill you kindly give this matter your careful consideration; and if at all possible give your approval to my request of financial assistance at this time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nLYTTON, B.C. December 4, 1943.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, VANGUVER, B.C.\n\nI enclose herewith a duplicate letter written by the Reverend Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, B.C. in connection with his request for financial assistance for the School.\n\nI beg to draw your attention to the effect that the poor output of the School farm this year can, in no way, be attributed to mismanagement of the farm but is due to lack of assistance and to poor climatic conditions.\n\nI would respectfully recommend that the Reverend Principal's request receive your favourable consideration.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMM.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI enclose herewith a letter dated the 3rd instant addressed to Mr. Indian Agent Strang by the Reverend Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School and Mr. Strang's letter of the 4th instant covering the request of the Principal for a grant of $2,000.00 from the New England Company funds in order to meet the additional burden placed upon the school finances by their farm crop failure and increase in school costs.\n\nUnder the circumstances outlined by the Reverend Principal and the Indian Agent, I would recommend approval of the application if the amount applied for is available from the New England Company funds.\n\nD.M.

George's School\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDec. 26, 1943\n\nCommissioner D.M. MacKay,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have just disposed of Christmas Day, with seventy\nin bed with the Flu. No nurse, in spite of all our efforts\nto cure one. We have no Laundress; and last week had to\nreally take charge of the laundry work with two or three\nto help. At present we have no Engineer. Our man went\nwith the Flu, and has since had to leave for Vancouver, where\nhe is very seriously ill. I have had to be up at four and\nlock in the morning to look after the heating of this\nwhich at present resembles a hospital. We have no Farm\nand so I have had more outside supervising to do. I don't\nfeel so much like a one man orchestra. Yet, withal,\nthings are going wondrously well. How long one can stand the\nstrain I don't know, but conditions cannot get much worse, and the\nhope is they will improve.\n\nIn reply to your anxious letter of the 21st inst., I beg\nyour pardon for owing to illness, pressure of work, and shortage of\ntime in making out my October Financial Statement.\nI have been late; and anyone who has the\nidea what I and others have been going through since\nthe end of the term, in the matter of epidemics of\ncough and Flu, will recognize some justification\nfor the statement in your letter that the Department are\nnot concerned over the financial situation of our school.\nIt is not at the present time a very pressing concern; but\nit is not in debt, if one takes into consideration our\nlosses. When I took over the administration of this\nschool there was not only no current surplus, there was a large\nIn reference to the drop in the Current surplus during the month of October, I have this to say: I received an order to deliver 25 tons of potatoes to Coqualeetza Hospital. In our Spring planting, provision was made for this; and during the month of September, the Farm Manager assured me that we should have plenty of potatoes to fill the order. When I made out the Financial Statement at the end of September, the Farm Manager assured me I could safely include $1000.00 for potatoes which would be delivered at Coqualeetza during the month of October. I included that amount, but the $1000.00 did not materialize. \"Counting chickens before they are hatched\" you say.\n\nIn regard to the salaries being in arrears, I have never been later than the third or fourth day after the end of the month. I used to pay salaries before the end of the month, but so many of the staff held their cheques over, so that I had to carry them as cheques outstanding. I have been issuing the cheques immediately after the end of the month. I did not realize that such procedure meant salaries in arrears. There has been quite a bit of fluctuation in the monthly total salary amounts. I have had considerable difficulty in securing staff workers, who are generally of a unreliable type. They come and stay for a week or so, and leave as soon as they hear of higher wages elsewhere. I have had to raise all salaries twice during the year, and still they are low compared with general rate of salaries, and we are short staffed.\n\nI wish to assure the Department I have tried in every possible way to economize, so that I would not have to ask for an advance on the Quarterly per capita grant allowance. My reason for asking for $2000.00 was so that I might leave the per capita grant allowance intact. I don't suppose there has ever been a time in the history of the school when the New England Copper Company grant was more urgently needed for the general maintenance of the work.\n\nI feel sure the Department realize that the present financial assistance we receive is quite inadequate to meet the needs of present day demands. The only way I know to make that financial assistance suffice is to cut down on the food and clothing for pupils, and to put more boys to work instead of hiring extra labour. But we cannot do these things. At least I would rather leave than do them. Fifty cents per day which we receive as our per capita allowance, seems too small compared with two dollars per day allowed in the hospitals; and yet most of these children require a great deal of care, and certainly much more nourishing foods than they now receive. As charts were received from the Department a short time ago, along with the information regarding the diet these children should be receiving.\nare all very fine; and I have no doubt required a great deal of time and expense to produce them, but we cannot carry them out as they should be; simply because our per capita grant allowance is not sufficient to enable us to do so. Our school is not unique in this respect. If a survey were made of all the schools, I have no doubt one would find that very few schools come anywhere near to what the pupils should be having in the way of nourishment. Several times staff members have come here from other schools, and I have enquired of them about the way Indian children have been fed at the schools they have left. Our dietics, if anything, is a little better than the majority of schools, because we have the advantage of tomato juice and fruit. But I would certainly like to see our meals improved.\n\nI assure you, sir, it is not my intention to be disrespectful, but as the Department are inclined to be critical of our financial situation and worried about matters, it is just as well if they hear my views on the subject. I have been in this work for thirty years, and know pretty well what I am talking about.\n\nA careful survey should be made of all the schools. If possible by people who have a thorough and practical knowledge of what is best for the welfare of Residential Schools.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nFinancial Statement for month ending December 31, 1943\n\nCash book balance December 31, 1,732.90\nCheques outstanding 236.80\nBank balance December 31, 1,969.70\n\nReceipts\nCash book bal.

I presume that you have made every possible effort to bring the pupilage to the authorized number, but evidently you are still considerably below that figure. Is there any agent who might be able to assist you to secure additional pupils? If so, let me know, and we will write to him.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nReverend C. F.

C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal\n\nJan. 9, 1945\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the December Financial Statement, you will note that I have great difficulty in making ends meet. This is partly due to the fact that we have had a number of new pupils crowded on us, who have all had to be outfitted etc. And partly because salaries for staff workers are higher. But I find the proper upkeep and maintenance of the institution is a big expense. It is very necessary that the building and the equipment be kept in repair and in order. We have received very little from Department funds for this purpose; and in consequence our per capita grant allowance is far too heavily drawn on.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would please place this matter before the Department. If there are New England Company funds available at this time, I would be very much obliged if we could have $2,000.00 for the purpose of replenishing household equipment in the school building, and repairing and replacing implements on the farm.\n\nWe have worked extremely hard during the last four years. Personally, I have worked harder than I have ever been called upon to work at anytime in my life; but we have held things together, until now, it looks as though there are brighter times ahead. I would very much like to put our equipment in order. During the last few weeks, I have been able to secure three fine young men from the Services. They will stay if I can make life interesting for them. And they will give good service too, and make life interesting to the boys.\n\nI do try in every possible way to take care of funds entrusted to my care; and I wish to assure you that I shall continue to do so.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas.

A review of your recent Financial Statements for the months September, 1945 to January, 1946, inclusive, indicates that the current surplus has dropped from $7524.57 to $4339.43, despite the fact that in January of this year you received a grant of $2000.00 from the New England Company funds.\n\nIn anticipation of an enquiry from the Department in this connection it would be appreciated if you would advise if there is any particular reason for the large decrease in the current surplus.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nD. M. Macay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nRev. C. F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nI have just received your letter of the 14th inst. It was my intention to be in Vancouver to see you today; and started away with the car to go to the station to meet the early train this morning; but during the wind storm last night, a large tree had blocked the road and I had to return.\n\nThe financial situation is always giving me concern. Sometimes, I feel so concerned over the matter. I would give a lot if I could decently pull out. But, at this time of the year, expenses are much higher than at other times. The fuel, light, clothes, and shoes are items that demand more expense at this time of the year. And, moreover, there is little or nothing coming in excepting the per capita grant allowance. One thing, I can honestly say, we have no large and old debts; and because we have a good attendance of pupils, there should be a substantial amount of earnings for the current quarter.\n\nI expect to be in Vancouver on Monday to try and settle the matter of our domestic hot water supply, and hope to be able to see you at that time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D.

Our expenses during the last six months have been extremely high, and I have had great difficulty in making ends meet.\n\nThe following is a true idea of how things have been. Our expenditure during the six months ended March 31st amounted to $21,899.92. Our per capita grant allowance amounted to $16,156.24 for that period. We also received $300.00 toward the Manual Instructor's salary, and $2,000.00 from the New England Company funds. The balance we have had to make up ourselves; and during the Wintertime, there is not much coming in from the farm.\n\nI think you know, without my saying, that I have tried in every possible way to take care of funds entrusted to me, as well as keep up a decent standard of living.\n\nDoctor Alderwood was here last week, and seemed to be quite thrilled with what he saw of our life here. And was extremely surprised to know that we had been able to keep ourselves fairly clear of debt. They have an overdraft of over $200,000.00.\n\nWill you kindly let me know about the grant from New England funds.\n\nKindest regards and best wishes,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas. F. Hives,\nPrincipal.\n\nMr H. A.

We seem to be always in a state of penury these days. In spite of all the care we try to exercise with things like clothing, shoes, utensils and machinery, they wear out, and need repairing or replenishing. And prices have advanced so in many lines.\n\nAt present, we are in need of a conveyance which we use for light delivery, for bringing out bread and such like. We call it the Station wagon. In reality it is a Panel Delivery with seats built in so that we can take care of the transportation of pupils to and from home or hospital. It was bought in 1936, and is not in very good condition; especially for these mountain roads. I would like to replace it this year with another Station Wagon. Next year, I would like to replace the Farm tractor, which is in very poor shape.\n\nIf possible, will you kindly send me $2,000.00 from New England Company funds. I assure you, we need it, and the very best care will be taken of it.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nChas. F. Hives\nPrincipal.\n\nColonel B. F.

The Fraser River is quite unsafe here for swimming purposes, and the boys are absolutely forbidden to bathe in it. So far, since I have been here, we have had no drowning accidents; but the Indian people are extremely nervous of their children playing by the river, and I am anxious to avoid any accidents.\n\nWe have no swimming pool, and there is none within fifty miles of us. Years ago a dam was built across a ravine, which was then filled with water from the irrigation ditch. This afforded quite a bit of fun for the girls and boys. But it was a very poorly constructed affair and has broken down and become useless.\n\nRecently I received from the Department a New England Company cheque for the amount of one thousand dollars, for the purpose of buying a much needed Station Wagon, to replace the old one we now have. I have been told that I shall not be able to buy one until the latter part of August. In the meantime, the thousand dollars is in a Special account.\n\nWill you please let me know by wire if I may make immediate use of this thousand dollars for the purpose of buying cement, reinforcement and lumber for the immediate construction of a dam, so that we may have a safe and decent swimming pool for our girls and boys. And in the event of this sanction from you, may we have a similar amount during the month of August for the purpose of buying the Station Wagon.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nRev. Canon C. F.

February 18, 1948.\n\nW.S. Arneil, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nForwarded herewith is the usual financial statement submitted by the Reverend Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, for the month of January, 1948, accompanied by a letter from the above Principal.\n\nIn view of the seriousness of the financial situation of the school I would respectfully recommend that the Principal's request for assistance receive all possible Departmental consideration.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nFeb. 14, 1948  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe enclosed Monthly Financial Statement, will, I feel sure cause the Department some concern, in anticipation of which, I am writing you, with the request that you will give your best consideration to my letter, and make whatever comments you think best before sending it on to the Department in Vancouver and from there to Ottawa.\n\nUntil this present month, I have taken quite a bit of pride in sending to you my Financial Statement, but you will notice, I am sure that the enclosed will reveal the fact that we are slipping financially. And that, unless we can receive special financial help we shall be in debt. As indeed we now are.\n\nDuring the six and a half years that I have been in charge of St. George's School, I have paid a total of $10.65 to the bank for overdraft interest. I have always paid my staff before the end of the month, so that their salaries have always been shown on the current month. I have tried not to draw on the Quarterly allowance until the last month of the quarter. Unless we can secure financial help other than the current quarter's allowance, I shall have to do so this month.\n\nTaking into consideration that this is always the most expensive period of the year, on account of fuel, light and lack of farm produce, there are still other reasons why we are having such great difficulty in financing our school business. There are many more demands made on our financial resources these days than were ever made before. Each time a new idea leaves the Ottawa office, new demands are made on our financial resources. Diet sheets, posters, full time classroom hours for all pupils; all these mean more financial commitments. We receive appetizing diet posters, with instructions to explain what balanced diet meant. The amount of milk and butter and fish and fruit juices that should be taken so many times a day. They are all very well, and, I have no doubt they are all very necessary in the building up of a strong healthy body. But common-sense should tell us that to comply with all that advice it is absolutely impossible to do it on 70 cents per capita per day, and take care of all\nexpenses that come from increased salaries, increased prices on foods, clothing, fuel etc., etc. I have good reasons for saying that it cannot be done.\n\nWe read letters and articles in the newspaper about the poor attention Indian pupils are receiving in the Residential schools. Many of these articles and letters are written by well meaning people. But I don't suppose anyone of them realize that in order to treat Indian pupils in residential schools the same way as children of well-to-do parents would be treated in a private residential school, the per capita allowance would have to be doubled twice and more. And I don't suppose for one minute the rate payer would stand for it.\n\nBut, I do feel sure that there is a happy medium that could be reached. Owing to the advanced cost of living, the per capita allowance we now receive is not sufficient to meet the necessary expenses which we must incur.\n\nTo tide us over until the end of the present quarter, when prices may possibly take a dip down, we should have three thousand dollars exclusive of the current per capita allowance. We must have two thousand dollars in order to pay our debts. If that amount is to be found in the New England Company funds, I shall be exceedingly grateful for it, and it will take a great load off my mind. If it is not to be found in New England Company funds, I want you to know that we shall not be able to meet our obligations when they come due.\n\nIt has taken some years to bring this school back to a position of respectability and honour in this community and with the business houses. I would like, if at all possible, to retain that position.\n\nEnclosed, you will find attached to the Financial Statement, a comparison of salaries and prices etc. between the years 1941 and 1947. These prices are conservative, and I have no doubt the Department are fully aware of them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. A. Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nI am forwarding Mr. Indian Agent Strang's letter of February 13th and enclosures referred to therein regarding the financial situation at St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nYou will note that the current surplus during the period December 31st, 1947 to January 31st, 1948, decreased from $5,068.78 to $1,180.73 and that the Rev. Principal anticipates a deficit of $3000 before the end of the present quarter unless increased financial assistance is secured from the New England Company funds or elsewhere.\n\nI have reason to believe the financial difficulties being encountered by St. George's School at this time are not in any way greater than the difficulties being encountered by other residential schools in British Columbia and have no doubt that the Department is being pressed for increased per capita and other grants to meet the deficits. Presumably consideration is being given to methods of meeting residential school financial problems but in the meantime if there are funds available from the New England Company a special grant would be of considerable assistance to St. George's School.\n\nW. S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nFebruary 26, 1948.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nIndian Commissioner Arneil has forwarded to the Department your letter of February 14, 1948, in connection with the financial situation at the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nYesterday we were advised that approval had been given for an increase of $17% in the per capita allowance of each residential school, effective from October 1st, 1947. In the case of the St. George's Residential School this will mean an extra payment on the December quarter of $1,736.63. Cheque for this amount will go forward in the near future. In addition, we will forward you a cheque for $1,000.00 from New England Company funds. You will recall that we forwarded you $800.00 from the New England Company funds about the end of November last.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard N. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nRev.

I don't know how long I can stand it, but unless some help comes in the near future, I am afraid something will break. I hate to bring myself into the matter, but the doctor tells me that my condition is not good, and I am losing too much sleep and running too high a blood pressure. I assure you it is not caused from high living.\n\nI know it is terribly difficult for you, but surely the matter of adequate financial support for the proper and decent administration of this and other schools should be of paramount importance to the Government of Canada.\n\nAs far as outward appearances go, people think we are in wonderful shape. We have a lovely school, lovely buildings, fine lot of children and a fairly efficient and fairly well-paid staff. And we are looked upon with not a little envy by the other schools. And yet, those other schools receive far more than we do. They receive all girls' clothing from the W.A., while we have to buy every bit of ours. They receive all boys' clothing, up to twelve years of age. And they receive all bedding for the whole school from W.A.\n\nI don't think it is possible to finance this school on a per capita grant allowance of $257.00 per annum, paying a decent living wage to the staff, and giving decent meals to the pupils. We have had a long hard Winter. Three months of cold weather, with two days of mild weather. You can imagine how serious has been the matter of fuel expenses. Yet I have received no complaint from any member of my staff concerning cold rooms, and we have had no freeze-ups. Last night, the middle of February, it was below zero. Seven years ago I bought coal for $1.10 per ton, f.o.b. the mines. For the same coal I have to pay $4.65 f.o.b. the mines, and you know how freight rates have advanced. Everything else has advanced in like proportion. But you know all this, and I am sure you must become weary of hearing it.\n\nI don't want to leave this place, and I feel that I should not pass out at my age. And I would like to feel that this work will continue to prosper, if I should\nhave to move on.\n\nThe hope of a fall in prices for everything we have to buy, seems to have been a matter of wishful thinking. The only thing that I know of that has not advanced during the last seven years is my own salary, which has to remain the same because to increase it would be depriving an Indian child of some of the little it now has.\n\nI do not know if we have anything in New England Company funds; but if there is anything, I would greatly appreciate receiving it right now. But, in any case, I am of the opinion that we must either receive more financial support from the Dominion Government for the proper and decent administration of this and other schools; or that this and other schools should be closed, and the children sent home to be the care and responsibility of their parents.\n\nYou will, I know forgive me for writing you this way. I am not able to run into your office and give you the \"woiks\" as I used to do. But you are our best hope in this time of trouble; and you do know conditions, probably better than any other man who has preceded you in office you now occupy. And I also know, from past associations with you, that you will do your part in alleviating this difficult situation.\n\nWith kindest regards and every good wish.\n\nI remain,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor D.

That amount is approximately $5,000.00. However, due to restrictions on exporting funds from England at the present time, the amount which we actually receive is slightly over $3,000.00 a year.

These reports present a fairly accurate picture of the situation and provide information on which representations for revision of rates may be made.\n\nThe cost of operating our residential schools is a subject that is constantly under review and it is hoped that, as a result of the information supplied by the auditors, it will be possible to make the adjustments indicated.\n\nAt this date, the balance in the New England Company account stands at $1,608.80. Of this amount the sum of $1,500.00 is being forwarded and should reach you within the next few days.\n\nI was sorry to note from your letter that you were not feeling up to the mark.

We have had to burn very much more fuel during the Winter months than ever before. And the price of fuel is three times higher than previous years. Our electric light bill has been running over two hundred dollars a month, and there seems to be no decrease in the price of other commodities.\n\nI am hoping that the Spring may bring some release.

E.g., salaries are doubled in January as compared with July. Food for July (1) costs three hundred times as much as June. There is no apparent consumption of fuel or light in October.\n\nThe method of entering deficits and cash book balances, outstanding cheques and accounts payable, per capita grant due rather than \"earned\", makes any month's figures of less than true significance.\n\nThere must be some less mystifying analysis possible.\n\nC.A.T. Clark\n1/4/44\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI was very glad indeed to get your letter yesterday, calling for Financial Statements, which I herewith enclose. In spite of the fact that the one ending Feb. 28th., is not a very encouraging one, I am rather proud of our shewing; for we have had a very very difficult time making ends meet. I don't think there is much reason for me to explain why, for you would get only a repetition of what you have heard from every other quarter. However, we are over the worst of it, I hope, and next quarter should enable us to pick up a little.\n\nBut not only are prices for all commodities abnormally high, we also have to try and satisfy the new demands that are being made. I mean, for instance, we get a write-up from Dept. of National Health, every once in awhile, telling us what we are to feed our pupils. We cannot possibly comply with their requests under the present per capita allowance without going into debt. We do our best, and in order to produce the milk required, we have to buy feed for the cows; and you will note that the farm expenses come high. Then there is the matter of classroom. The inspectors come along, and their one idea is academic training. If they had their way about it, the girls and boys would be attending school full time, and because work outside of the classroom makes the pupils tired in the classroom, we should have an army of servants to do the work in the different and various departments. They should know we are not able to afford this, but they don't stop to consider. I try to be as efficient as possible and I believe, from what the inspector says, we have one of the best, if not the best, teaching set-up in the province.\n\nWhat I am trying to get over to you is that with each demand comes extra expense, and on the top is the abnormal cost of living.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nFinancial Statement for Month ended Feb. 28, 1949\n\nBank Balance as at Feb. 28th.

I don't know if we shall gradually evolve from the mire or not, but it is hard, slow work. The future does not loom up very bright, unless some definite policy is made by experts in this particular kind of education and training, and financial assistance given adequate to meet the policy and situation.\n\nI am working harder now than I have ever worked in all the years I have been engaged in this work.\n\nThis matter of education and academic training for Indian children requires more than just the ideas of some young educationist. School inspectors come around, and of course, they specialize in classroom education. They want all boys and girls to attend school full time, if at all possible. That is their stand. Alright from their standpoint, and they have every right \"sell their goods!\" But there is the danger of making educated bums of the boys and girls, and if they all go to school all the time, we should engage more servants. We have not the money to do so, and people, these days, are afraid of being benevolent, and require high wages. Today, we have one boy out of the classroom in the morning to help with the work on the farm.\n\nThe auditor comes around, and he asks me who does my office work. I tell him, and he says I have no business to be doing office work as well as administering. I could not afford a secretary. Just as soon as I have written this, I shall have to don a pair of dirty old overalls and go either fencing or hoeing.\n\nThings seem to pile up these days, and they don't make a lovely pile either. But, I suppose the only thing is to plug along to the bitter end, which I hope may be, at least, peaceful, when it does come.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. P.

So the radio says, and also the fact that we cannot get anywhere by road or rail, on account of landslides and washed-out bridges. We have not suffered, excepting that when the builders provided rain disposal for the roofs of our building, they did not figure on the torrential rains of last Saturday, when we were bailing water out of the basement during the best part of the night.\n\nWill you kindly send an advance cheque on the current quarter to the amount of $5,000.00.

It has been a very worrying time keeping things at a fairly even keel, and you will notice that our financial obligations are quite heavy at the end of November. In future the Financial Statement will be on time each month, as I have, since receiving your letter with the good news of an increase in the Allowance, engaged a secretary. Since I have been here, I have done all the office work myself, and tried also to give as much of my time as possible to the farm activities. Had it not been for our farm produce, both in regard to what we consume and what we have been able to dispose of, we would have been in poor shape.\n\nComparing salaries of today with those of 1942, you will notice that I have had to increase them. All have been increased considerably, my own excepted. It has remained the same throughout.\n\nI am still waiting patiently or otherwise for that promised large cheque.\n\nThanks very much for your kindly wishes. Please accept the same from me to you and yours. At present we are really snowed under four feet of snow, and the going is pretty tough.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nJanuary 13th, 1950.\n\nRev.

We received the cheque on that day also; so I felt that Friday the 13th was not a day to be despised. I assure you it was a most welcome help, and I would like to say how much I appreciate it. I have no doubt you had your share in bringing about the small increase. You and I have been in this business a long time. In fact, we might almost be classed as \"old-timers!\" I think, therefore, you will know that an appreciation from me is something real and sincere.\n\nWe are having quite a terrible time of it right now, for we have over five feet of snow, and it looks like more to follow. I hope there will not be very much more, for we are having a very difficult time getting out of this hole, and bringing in provisions and fuel. Even the very dim recollections you may have of this place will give you a picture of what we are having to go through down in this hole with all this snow. At present, I am a little worried about six or seven children who started from Hazelton two days ago on the C.N.R. I don't know when they will arrive, for trains are all at a stand-still in B.C. Hazelton is a long way off. I mean, it takes a long time to make the trip, and it is quite expensive. If they go by way of Prince Rupert, it takes about four days; and the way by C.N.R. is almost three days. We do need a residential school in that vicinity in the worst way.\n\nKindest regards,\n\nYours sincerely.\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nLYTTON, B.C.\n\nFinancial Statement for Month ended December 31st 1949.\n\nBank Balance as at Dec. 31st 2,158.17\nLess Outstanding Cheques 3,427.58\n\nCash Book Balance 1,269.41\n\nReceipts:\nCash Book Balance 2,492.06\nPer Capita Grant 5,000.00\nNew England Company\nMutual Training Grant\nFrom Farm and Garden 260.89\n\nExpenditures:\nSalaries 2,349.80\nClothing 2.60\nFood 11.40\nFuel, Light, etc. 1,073.22\nBuilding and Repair\nHouse Equipment 96.47\nFarm and Garden 4.32\nTransportation and Travel 173.68\nCasual Labour Misc. 327.45\n\nAssets and Liabilities: (Current)\n\nBank Balance, less O/S Cheques 1,269.41\nPer Capita Grant Due 8,567.60\nAccounts Receivable:\nFrom Farm and Garden H.S. grant 255.00\nAccounts Payable: Manual 50\n\nAccounts Payable 6,132.24\nCurrent Surplus 1,802.32\n\n9,203.97 9,203.97\n\nCertified Correct,\n\nPrincipal\nProvince of BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended December 31st, 1949.\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|----------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| Rev.

That amount with what is already there will almost pay for the truck I have arranged to purchase. Our old truck has gone to pieces so badly, it is now but a bill of expense keeping it running. And it is so important our having a truck. The one I have arranged to buy is an International, and a good size. The cost is a little over three thousand dollars, complete with body and other equipment.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would send to me all we can have from the New England Company fund, so that I may pay for the truck as soon as it is delivered. I will send to you the receipted bill for the truck, or at least a copy of same.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nChief, Educational Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nFinancial Statement for Month ended November and December 1950.\n\nBank Balance as at Dec. 31st 1950. $596.45\nLess Outstanding Cheques $2,643.15\n\nCash Book Balance Def. $3,239.60\n\nReceipts:\nCash Book Balance Def. $154.82\nPer Capita Grant $5,000.00\nNew England Company\nManual Training Grant\nFrom Farm and Garden $617.46\nMisc. $269.50\n\nExpenditures:\nSalaries $3,827.24\nClothing $875.94\nFood $2,809.99\nFuel, Light, etc. $509.79\nBuilding and Repair $13.05\nHouse Equipment $957.19\nFarm and Garden $97.08\nTransportation and Travel $154.08\nCasual Labour\nMiscellaneous Def. $26.12\nInt. $9.90\nTelephone call $1.00\n\nAssets and Liabilities: (Current)\nBank Balance, less O/S Cheques $3,239.60\nPer Capita Grant Due $9,040.00\nAccounts Receivable:\nFrom Farm and Garden $315.00\nAccounts Payable $5,252.15\nCurrent Surplus $1,163.25\n\n$9,655.00 $9,655.00\n\nCertified Correct,\n\nPrincipal.\nProvince of BRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH\n\nPer Capita Allowances\u2014Residential Schools\n\nFor Quarter ended March 31st, 1951.\n\n| PRINCIPAL | NAME OF SCHOOL | ANNUAL PER CAPITA ALLOWANCE | AMOUNT DUE |\n|-----------|---------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| Bank of Montreal, Ashcroft, B.C., for deposit to credit of: St. George's Indian Res.

I received a letter from Sir Arthur Cochrane last week, in which he said New England Company were increasing the amount of their donation to us from 750 pounds to 1125 pounds. The school car has come to the stage where it will now be a bill of expense. As you are well aware, this part of the country, with its wicked mountain roads is not only very hard on a car, but, unless a car is in first rate shape, driving becomes hazardous. A short time ago, I was driving to Lilloet on important school business, and one of the front wheels came off. Luckily it was on the side furthest away from the four or five hundred foot drop, and so I just ran into the bank. Also, I was by myself at the time.\n\nI would require $1500.00 to make the replacement on a Chevrolet car, and I would like to have it during the month of July.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would let me know as soon as possible if this amount would be available at that time.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Philip Phelan,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nMay 14th, 1951.\n\nRev.

Orr Esq\nArchitect for\nThe Department of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe acknowledge receipt of your letter containing instructions for wiring The St Georges School at Lytton, B.C.\n\nRe Generating Equipment:\n\nWe note you wish to use the gas engine installed at the Laundry, as it will require a 3 Kilowatt generator for this installation which will require the full 6 H.P. of this engine to drive it. This leaves no margin for use in the Laundry and makes it impossible to operate both together.\n\nThis being the case it will be necessary to run the engine after the Laundry work is done and well into the night to supply necessary lighting and charge up the batteries, also changing belts every time, and will not be automatic in operation, this last is important in an isolated plant where there is not expert operators. It will also be necessary to enlarge the Building for generator and storage batteries and which will have to be practically Frost proof. This building will cost approximately between two and three hundred dollars.\n\nIn view of these facts the writer is of the opinion that an Independent Generating Set might be considered. I have\ndiscussed this matter with Mr Graham & The Principle who are in favour of an independent set and advised me to submit comparative cost to you for consideration. Further such a set could be installed in the basement of the School only a foundation being needed.\n\nProposal No 1\n\nItem 1\nTo supply 1 Canadian General Electric Type RC 3 K.W.- 1700 R.P.M. 125 Volt Generator complete with base and pulley, and regulating rheostat, suitable to be driven by present engine, Price F.O.B., Lytton $264.00\n\nItem 2\nTo provide storage Capacity in accordance with specifications we propose to furnish,\n56 Cells of storage battery Type KKH-13 special Exide storage battery rated at 160 amp hours complete with Electrolyte, Price F.O.B., Lytton $872.00\n\nItem 3\nFor switch board for this generator we propose to supply\n1 Generator pannel on which will be mounted, ammeter, voltmeter, rheostat mounting, bracket lamp, main generator switch, 2 circuit switches and storage battery charging pannel.\nPrice F.O.B., Lytton $175.00\n\nProposal No 2\n\nItem 1\nAs an Alternative to the above we offer-\n1 - Size 5 Kilowatt - 125 RPM Allis Chalmers gasoline engine driven generator complete with generator pannel, and special charging pannel\nPrice F.O.B., Lytton $1722.00\nProposal No 2\n\nItem 2\nRegarding Storage capacity for this unit we recommend the battery as quoted in proposal No 1\n\nPrice F.O.B., Lytton ----------------- $872.00\n\nTotal\n\nProposal No 1\n\nGenerator ----------------------------- $261.00\n22 ft Belting -------------------------- 44.00\nSwitchboard ---------------------------- 175.00\nBattery ------------------------------- 832.00\n\nAddition To Building say -------------- 250.00\n200 Ft Pole Line No 2 Copper, conduit entrance & exit to buildings --------- 130.00\n\nTotal -------------------------------- $1732.00\n\nProposal No 2\n\n5 - Kilowatt Generating Set as specified in item No 1 ------------------------ $1722.00\n\nStorage battery Item No 2 --------------------- $72.00\n\nTotal -------------------------------- $2,592.00\n\nWe are of the opinion that if the cost is not prohibitive that No 2 will prove the most satisfactory it will give a margin for future extensions, and will be easy to move to the new school when built, we are therefore submitting the alternative costs for your approval before having the generating equipment brought forward, please advise by wire.\nW.J.Orr\n\n(4)\n\nyour selection and oblige,\n\nYours truly\n\nL.

Now these will take away a lot of space from the loft, besides the weight of the hay will come onto them and thus throw the weight onto the sill to which these are attached. Would it not be possible to leave these out altogether, as the way the roof is braced now, there can be no movement whatever? These braces will no doubt take up a lot of space in the barn besides making it very inconvenient to work along the edge.\n\nI also notice that the gable ends have no bracing to prevent them bulging. At the end that the hay is taken in at, hay will bump it and will certainly make it bulge, and the far end when filling the barn, hay will roll against this gable, and will certainly make it bulge without strengthening timbers right across both gable ends.\n\nThere was no door allowed in the event of requiring to take any hay out of the loft. There is only one high door at which hay is taken by the derrick fork, so I have had a door put in underneath this one at the floor level.\n\nEverything is going very satisfactorily, and if the steel stanchions, etc., turn up in time, I hope we will be able to occupy it by Christmas.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

In erecting this barn the Indian Agent took into consideration the possibility of building a new school in the near future, and the barn is located at a point where there is an ideal site for the building of a new school. This location is approximately a half mile from the old school building.\n\nOne of the big difficulties at the present school building is the water supply, and in choosing the new site care was taken to see that a good supply of water could be obtained. At a distance of 2400 feet behind the barn and at an elevation of approximately 175 feet there is an excellent spring, which has been running for many years both winter and summer. This spring will provide all the water that is required for the farm and school on a gravity system. When the new school is built it will be necessary to build a small tank at the source of supply, but for the present I am of the opinion that it is not necessary to clean out the spring and place a large barrel in order to supply water to the barn. It will be necessary to run a four inch pipe from the spring to the barn, a distance of 2400 feet. This pipe will be large enough to be used later if a new school is built to supply it with water.\n\nThe cost of this work will be approximately $900.00 and I beg to recommend that the contractor for the barn be authorized to proceed with the installation on a proven cost plus ten percent basis. The new barn is nearing completion and the water supply system should be installed as soon as possible before the ground freezes too hard.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nLYTTON BC DEC 12TH\n\nDEPT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOTTAWA, ONT.\n\nKINDLY ADVISE ME WHAT ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE ABOUT PUTTING IN WATER INTO THE NEW BARN AT STGEORGES SCHOOL FROST WILL SOON MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DIG TRENCH AND IT IS ESSENTIAL TO HAVE WATER AT THE BARN WIRE INSTRUCTIONS\n\nH GRAHAM\n\n1033PM\n\nUSE OUR DIRECT ALL-CANADA SERVICE TO VANCOUVER, VICTORIA AND BRITISH COLUMBIA POINTS\n\nfour inch pipe from the spring to the barn, a distance of 2400 feet.

Indian Affairs.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nWhen I was at Lytton School the Reverend Principal and the Indian Agent pointed out to me the necessity of providing immediately a small dairy building for use in connection with the barn now being erected.\n\nI advised them that it would be impossible for the Department this year to erect any further buildings, but I explained to the Reverend Principal that if he was willing to perform the necessary labour the Department might consider allowing for the materials required. I asked him to let me have an estimate of the cost of the materials. I have today received a letter from the Indian Agent in which he states that all of the materials required will cost approximately $200.00. This will provide for a building 16 x 18 feet and will meet their requirements. The principal will, of course, supply all the labour required in the erection of the building.\n\nAs it is necessary that they have this building to carry on their work I beg to recommend that the Indian Agent be authorized to purchase the necessary materials.\n\nArchitect.\nSir,\n\nWe have been waiting patiently to hear from you since you left, in regard to the installing of the water system for the new barn at St. George's School.\n\nI wrote you so that you would get the letter on your return to Ottawa, about December 1st, but have had no reply.\n\nI now beg to confirm the following night-telegram just sent you.\n\n\"Kindly advise me what arrangements have been made about putting in water to the new barn at St. George's School.

All of the lights to be installed to be operated by drop-lights and no switches. There is a present located in the laundry gasoline engine which it is proposed to use for operating the dynamo. This dynamo should be 110 volt and capable of supplying current to 75% of all lights installed. It will also be necessary to install a storage battery 56 cells capable of supplying light to 75% of the lights for 8 hours with generator not running, the battery to be manufactured by the Hart Battery Manufacturing Company. There also will be required the regular switch-board. You will notice that a portion of this building is already wired for electric lights, this wiring, however, was installed some time ago and I do not think is in a safe condition - new conduit wiring should therefore be run throughout the building.\nI have also to ask that you supply and install the necessary wiring to connect up with the new barn now being erected. The Reverend Principal of the school will supply and erect the necessary pole line.\n\nAll of this work is to be carried out in accordance with the rules and regulations covering such work in the Province of British Columbia and also to the full and entire satisfaction of the Indian Agent.\n\nAll accounts for the work should be submitted in duplicate to Indian Agent Graham who will forward them to the Department.\n\nAny further information you desire regarding this work please communicate with me, The Department of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nArchitect for\nThe Department of Indian Affairs,\nMr. J.

Mr. Lett, principal of St. George's Indian Industrial School, which will speak for itself.\n\nI trust that the Department will be able to put an appropriation through for the purchase of a truck, which is a very essential article for the school. The distances that work has to be carried out make it almost impossible with horses, and a manure spreader is another thing that is very essential for good farming especially in an irrigated country.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nLytton, B.C., January 25th, 1924.\n\nMr. H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nJust a line to remind you to notify the Dept. of our farm needs. The truck which I applied for last Autumn, we hope to receive ere the harvesting begins next fall. As you know we are in good shape for a bumper production this year and a truck would greatly aid transportation. The manure spreader asked for is highly necessary especially so for this irrigated land as the machine pulverizes or breaks it up so that no straw is apt to gather in the ditches, and so block up the small streams which run over the land.\n\nI asked for a span of horses, but with a colt ready to break, we can, I hope, fit out a light team, which will be able to be used for lighter work, cross harrowing, mowing, raking, &c., and make the heavier team unnecessary for the time being, if we can get the truck.\n\nIt is my desire herewith to thank the Department for so liberally coming to our assistance this past year in building us a barn which is now the greatest asset we are in possession of, and also the lights in the school which take away the jeopardy of coal oil lamps, and give such a brilliant light in comparison. We are truly grateful for these needed acquisitions.\n\nAgain thanking you and hoping you will see fit to endorse the above needs asked for.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nI regret to have to report the very great inconvenience at St. George's Indian Industrial School, this winter, owing to the lack of domestic water. This matter, I think, will be dealt with in Mr. School Inspector Caffin's report.\n\nSome two and a half years ago, we put in a wooden pipe for domestic water to the spring from which the supply was obtained. This worked very well until last summer when, owing to the very dry summer the spring dried up, practically altogether, and during the summer the school was relying upon irrigation water. In the fall the spring supplied just about sufficient water, but as soon as the very cold weather came, everything froze up, and for the last month the school has practically been without water, except for odd days. At one time there was none at all and every atom of water used in the school had to be hauled a considerable distance in barrels. The staff has worked practically day and night trying to thaw out and get what little water they can down.\n\nAt the present time there is an outbreak of measles in the school, and when I was there yesterday, they had no water for toilets or other purposes. During the remainder of this winter they will just have to carry on as they are doing today, and in the spring try to collect every spring available and live in hope that the original spring may come back to its own after the spring freshets, otherwise some other source of water supply will have to be found for the coming winter.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, Feb. 1, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nReplying to your letter of the 25th instant regarding the unsatisfactory conditions of the domestic water supply system at the St. George's Indian Industrial School, Lytton, B.C., would it be possible that you consult with Mr. Lett, Principal, and investigate the existing conditions, with a view to finding, if possible, some temporary means of providing, economically, the quantity of water necessary for this institution.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mr. Lett, of the Lytton Indian Residential School, has urged again that the Department provide him with a truck for the use of the institution. Although this institution has special need for such equipment because of the distance of their main farm from the school, I hesitate to make a recommendation. I should be pleased to know your wishes.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, February 7, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 1-06 of the 25th ultimo, enclosing a copy of a letter from the Reverend Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School, in which the Department is requested to arrange for the purchase of a truck.\n\nIn reply I wish to state that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that favourable consideration be given to this request, and he has suggested that a Ford truck or other light machine might be suitable for the hilly country at Lytton. Please give this matter further consideration, and recommend to the Department whether or not a light truck would be adequate for the purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

Orr, contractor for the barn at St. George's Indian Industrial School, which has been completed and is now in use.\n\nI have already reported to you making an inspection of this barn with Mr. School Inspector Cairns and the principal, and everything was found quite satisfactory.\n\nYou will notice that there is a second lot of extras, amounting to $467.06. A separate account for these is attached. You authorized certain of them yourself when here, which authority you promised to send back to me in writing when you returned to Ottawa, but which has not arrived yet\u2014although I wrote sometime ago for this, viz.\u2014the high cement mangers, the extra iron posts and single stalls for horses, extra light switches and twenty-six galvanized window shields. The loft door I authorized, and advised you about at the time, as there was no means of getting hay out of the loft at any time that it might be required. The extra strengthening of the gable ends, and putting the silo down to the depth of the cellar, were both authorized by departmental letters.\n\nI am enclosing three photographs of the completed barn, which I thought might be of interest to you.\n\nI am also enclosing a written agreement signed by Mr. Orr, in which he is to be responsible for keeping the barn in entire repair for one year, as called for by the specifications.\n\nTrusting that you will find everything in order,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter dated February 1st, in reply to mine of the 25th ult., when I reported the unsatisfactory condition of the domestic water supply at St. George's Industrial School.\n\nI might say that my reason for reporting this was in the event of something having to be done at a later date, the Department would then be conversant with the conditions.\n\nI have talked the matter over with the principal, and although there is no shortage of water at the present time, owing to the thaw we have lately experienced, yet we have no assurance that the spring that originally supplied this school, and which dried up like many others in the district, last summer, will ever come back. We will connect up every available source of supply in the hope that these may continue to run next winter. During the summer we are able to turn in the irrigation ditch, which of course gives us an ample supply, but of very inferior dirty water.\n\nIf the springs do not come back to normal, the only solution that we can see will be the installation of a pump system, which will be quite expensive, owing to the distance that the water will have to be pumped.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Perrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter dated February 7th, advising me that the Deputy Superintendent General has directed that a favorable consideration be given towards supplying the Lytton Indian Industrial School a suitable truck, and he suggests that a Ford truck be supplied, if it be adequate.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that I have shown this letter to the principal and am now enclosing a letter from him on the subject.\n\nI might also add that I have had considerable experience in what trucks can do in this district. There have been Ford trucks used here and everyone of them has been discarded or turned in for heavier trucks, as they found they were not at all suitable, they had not the power and only being one ton capacity, they become really far more expensive to operate than a larger truck of greater power and larger capacity. With the hills that we have to negotiate here I feel sure that a Ford truck would be too expensive and too much time would be wasted in hauling such a small load for the distance that we have to travel.\n\nFor instance, this coming season, if all goes well, we hope to have a large quantity of hay to sell from Lot 47, which is 6\u00bd miles from town, with a 3\u00bd mile hill to traverse, so unless we had a large truck, it would be very slow work hauling out with a one ton truck. Then again there is the heavy hauling of firewood, which could hardly be done with a light truck.\n\nThanking the Department for their kind consideration of this matter, and trusting that they will favorably consider a heavier and stronger make than a Ford,\n\nAssist.

Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nRe Purchase of Truck.\n\nYou indeed brought us good news when you conveyed to us the word that the Department had allowed you a grant with which to purchase a truck for the school.\n\nA truck will be of untold advantage to us, in time and energy. While we appreciate all the Department has lately done for us and feel that no suggestion on our part should be made on what kind of a truck we should have, yet may we be allowed to say, that owing to the nature of these mountain roads, a Ford truck would not be the most economical with so much heavy up-hill work. It would not stand up under the strain. I would suggest that a heavier truck should be given us which would be capable of handling greater tonnage per trip, as hauling from Lot 47 will be our greatest portage a round trip of ten miles and more.\n\nThe men who had the experience of using Ford trucks have found that in two years they were obliged to change them, and replace them with either International or Federal trucks.\n\nI trust that these few suggestions will not be amiss and that the Department will not think that I am being in any way forward.\n\nThanking you and the Department for your kind attention to this matter.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nS.

The situation is becoming a chronic nuisance.\n\nOn the other hand, with no place to keep books and papers of importance, one or two members of the staff have taken the opportunity from a busybody standpoint to go through books and papers, and consequently the business of the school has been circulated from a non-official source.\n\nI would be obliged if you would endorse this and ask the Department to provide me, if possible, with a roll-top desk, with drawers on both sides in which I can keep school account books and other notes and letters of importance.\n\nI am,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir,\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from the principal of St. George's School, in which he makes a request for a roll-top desk.\n\nI would strongly recommend that this be purchased for him, as Mr. Lett mentioned in his letter, owing to the crowded state of the school his private residence has to be used for the staff, with the result his office is made to free use of.\n\nI have often commented to Mr. Lett on this and the only solution we can see, is to give him some means of locking up his books and papers.\n\nI think perhaps we could get a second hand desk, from some of the secondhand stores, fairly cheaply.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nRussell T.

Orr, when in Vancouver.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHg/MD\nSir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 8th inst re Delco Lighting Plant supplied to the St Georges School Lytton, B.C., we advise you as follows.\n\nOn receipt of your telegram of Dec 5th I wrote to the Canadian Westinghouse Co, Candain General Electric, Bruce Robinson Electric Co, Canadian Fairbanks Morse Co, for quotations on a 3 to 5 K.W, 110 volt Generating Set direct connected to Gasoline or Kerosene Engine, quotations to be F.O.B, Lytton C.N.R, and to state time of delivery. Replies were received from Can, Fairbanks Morse, stating they had nothing of that size and could not quote.\n\nCan Westinghouse Co, Advising they had nothing of that size listed at Vancouver but would quote from head office in about 10 days, nothing further received to date.\n\nCanadian Allis Chalmers for C.G.E.Co, Quoteing on a 5 K.W, set water cooled complete with 160 amp hour Battery Price without sales tax F.O.B, Lytton $2,594.00\n\nShipment from factory 6 weeks from receipt of order.\n\nBruce Robinson Electric Co, Advising they did not make 5 K.W, Sets, and quoting on their Standard 3 K.W, Delco Lighting Set complete with 160 amp hour battery F.O.B,\nLyttom without sales tax $2,129.65\n\nDelivery 2 weeks from receipt of order\n\nOr as an alternative we can supply a 5 K.W., English Crude Oil Engine & Generator mounted on one base but belt driven, complete with 160 amp hour battery F.O.B., Lyttom $2,190.00\n\nDelivery 2 weeks from receipt of order,\n\nIn considering the relative merits of the figures obtained it was advisable to keep before us the following points,\n\nReliability,\nSimplicity of Operation,\nType of help available for operation,\nEase of obtaining Spare parts in case of break down,\nDelivery if to be used this winter.\n\nThe Allis Chalmers Set requiring 6 weeks at factory and 2 to 3 weeks in transportation could not arrive until about the end of February, also this set was not self starting, Spare parts would have to come from Milwaukee, so we set it aside for something that could be obtained quicker.\n\nThe English Crude oil Engine, quotation appears favourable as to price. This engine has no positive ignition & is fired by the hot tube system and requires to be heated up before starting, is not self starting, requiring compressed air to start with, and requires somewhat expert operator to run it. The writer has had considerable experience with this type of engine on Irrigation Plants and fully realizing the difficulty of operation and cost of upkeep.\nthought it would not be suitable for the St Georges School,\nand therefore selected the 3 K.W. Delco Set because it\nwould fulfill all the requirements that was necessary,\nThis Plant was obtained and we had light in the residence\npart of school on the 5th of January, and put the balance on\nas fast as they was installed. It is now operating on all\nlights and is giving good satisfaction both in the building\nand outside.\n\nThe operation of this plant is very economical in operation\nusing 5 galls of gas or kerosene for 2 days which is\nabout one quarter the amount used for lamps.\nThis installation is now complete in every respect and the\nfinal vouchers will be submitted in a few days,\n\nYours very truly\n\nC.

He considers that a two ton truck is really the lightest for the work and for economy's sake. The lighter truck would use practically as much gasoline and labor in operating it, as the heavier, and the difference in price of the heavier truck would be offset in a very short time.\n\nThe principal further advises me that now that he has not been able to have the use of this for the spring he can wait until July, but would certainly like to have one by then. If it is impossible to supply this size then I suppose we will have to do with a 1\u00bd-2 ton truck.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

The only other labor was for linemans services performed by W.

I trust with this explanation you will find everything in order and that we may receive your check at an early date.\n\nYours truly,\n\nC. L. Wain\nSir,\n\nI would like to bring to your attention the great need of a touring car for the principal of St. George's Industrial School. Mr. Lett, when he came out here, brought his car with him, which car has been used steadily for the last two and a half years, and is now completely done.\n\nMr. Lett as you know has worked very hard and has raised the school to a very high standard, which has only been done by constant attention to duty. He has been practically on duty day and night running here, there and everywhere with his own car. This now practically refuses to go any longer.\n\nOwing to the location of the farm and the great deal of work to be done with this and also with the school the car is practically indispensable, so he is now at his wits end to know how to get about. It is absolutely essential that he should have a car, and as he has now worn out his own, I think that the Department should replace it.\n\nThe old car could be turned in and would realize about $125.00 upon the purchase of a new one, and I sincerely trust that the Department will be able to see their way clear to do this, as it is too much to expect the principal to buy another car out of his own pocket.\n\nHoping to get an early and favorable reply,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Mr. Lett, Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School, has used his own Ford car in connection with his duties for the past 2\u00bd years and it is now completely worn out. The agent recommends - and I concur - that a new car should be supplied for the principal and I wish to suggest that funds be found in the New England Company quarterly payment. Mr. Lett could be instructed to turn in his old car and realize $125 (estimated by the agent) towards the purchase of a new one. The balance would be approximately $550 and he could meet this from school finances and send the receipted account to the Department. We could then give him a grant from the New England Company money which would be deposited in a Trust Account.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 9, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your No. 3-06 of the 22nd ultimo, with reference to the advisability of providing a Ford car for the use of Rev. Mr. Lett, of the Lytton Indian Residential School. The Department proposes to retain in Ottawa, for replacements and repairs, etc., the New England Company quarterly grants and the Deputy Superintendent General has been pleased to authorize that the expenditure for the Ford touring car be taken from this fund.\n\nThe Rev. Mr. Lett should turn in his old car to the agent of the Ford Company and secure a new touring car for the best possible price. He should pay for this by School Cheque and send the receipted account, properly certified by yourself, to the Department. A cheque on the Trust Fund will then be issued in his favour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.

It would mean that the car would have to be relined practically every trip it made to Lot 47, as there is four miles steep hill to come down. The Ford car is quite all right for a city or flat country, but is quite unsuitable for a district like this.\n\nTrusting the Department will reconsider this matter,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHC/MD\nLytton, B. C., May 20th, 1924.\n\nMr. H. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nRe the Department's offer to allow me to purchase a Ford Car out of the proceeds of the N.E.C. Grant to this school. I might say that we can ill afford at this time to lose this Grant as a whole, or even to the extent of $650, the price of said car, nevertheless, I shall endeavor, if possible, to carry on less this amount as I must have some means of conveyance other than horse and cart. This, of course, is providing the Department sees fit, after the following, to insist that a Ford Car must be installed.\n\nWhile I have no personal objection to riding in a Ford, there are several reasons why it would not be economical to have one here when the initial cost would not be very great in the purchase of a Chevrolet, a three speed car. The difference in cost would not exceed $100 as correspondence from the Ford Agents shows that they do not want to handle the old car, while the Chevrolet people have offered me $150 for it on a new car. This means that I would have to pay $650 cash for the Ford and run the risk of selling my old car myself for whatever I can realize for it. I would much rather prefer to hand the old car over on a new one and have nothing more to do with it.\n\nAgain the expense of running a Ford around these hills in the way of lining brakes and gears, would be much greater. I can readily see where the Ford would spend a great deal of its time in the local garage instead of giving service to the school and as you know I have no time to wait on this kind of thing. If I was buying a car myself I certainly would not spend my money on a Ford car expecting it to give the best services in this country.\n\n$650.00 plus $150.00 would be $800.00. The difference between this amount and a new Chevrolet is $50.00. I would be quite willing to pay this difference myself rather than expend a great deal of time waiting on a two speed car and after it is installed eternally fixing up some part that will not stand the strain of so much heavy hill work.\n\nI trust the Department will see fit to change their decision allowing us to purchase or spend the above arranged amounts on a Chevrolet which will give the desired satisfaction.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMay 27, 1924.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nTwo weeks ago, with your approval, the Department authorized the Rev. Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School to purchase a Ford car, after turning in his old machine, and send the receipted account to the Department. The funds were to be found in the New England Company's quarterly grant for this institution. It is now reported that Mr. Lett's old car is a Chevrolet and that a three speed car is practically necessary for the hilly country in the neighborhood of the school. I know the situation myself and I agree that a new Chevrolet touring car would give much better service.\n\nI should be pleased to have your authority to make a payment to the Rev. Mr. Lett from the New England Company grant of $680 in place of the promised $550. A Chevrolet touring car will cost $880. Mr. Lett will get $150 when he turns in his old one and is willing to add $50 from his own funds.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 27, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 3-06 of the 20th instant, enclosing a communication from the Rev. Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School with reference to the purchase of a touring car. I have noted that a Chevrolet would give much better service than a Ford car and in reply I am pleased to inform you that the Department will allow $680 for the purchase of a Chevrolet. As was explained in my 165-0-5 of the 9th instant, the Rev. Principal should turn in his old car and secure a new one for the best possible price. He should make payment by school cheque and send the receipted account, properly certified by yourself, to the Department.

Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nTwo years ago this having season our horses ran away with the McCormick Mower breaking the gears and cracking the frame. We replaced the parts broken and the machine did good work the remainder of that season and last year. This year owing to the heavy crop of hay the frame being unable to stand the strain has given way.\n\nI have taken it upon myself to purchase a new machine feeling that we could not afford to wait until we could get authorization from the Department, it being an emergency case. As you know we have a large acreage to cut this year and to depend absolutely on one mower would be too slow because of so much other work pending.\n\nI bought this machine from the International people at Ashcroft getting the best terms possible.\n\nI trust you will see fit to approach the Department with a view of getting a grant to cover price of this machine. I also trust they will be patient with me having in this case gone over their heads.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose voucher number 81, amounting to $118.75, in favor of Mark Dumond, together with a letter from the principal of St. George's Industrial School, which will speak for itself.\n\nAs the principal is having difficulty in financing the institution and getting the place out of debt, he finds it rather hard to meet these unforeseen expenses, and I would like to recommend that the Department assist him with this.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nRussell T. Ferrier, Esq.,\nSupt. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nOttawa, June 21, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing a voucher amounting to $118.75 covering the cost of a mower purchased by the principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School, together with a communication regarding the purchase.\n\nThe urgency in making the purchase of this mower is not understood. The principal was, no doubt, aware that such equipment would be required and he should have obtained authority from the Department, through your office, before incurring the expenditure. In order to meet the requirements of the Government Contracts Supervision Committee and the Auditor General, it is necessary that competitive prices be obtained, and, when forwarding a voucher, it should be supported by an abstract showing the firms asked to quote and the prices quoted. This is required in order that full particulars be available, as required by the Auditor General. The Department cannot in future be responsible for the payment of accounts when the expenditure has not first been authorized, except in the case of purchases of the utmost necessity.\n\nPlease state whether the mower purchased is of Canadian manufacture and if competitive prices were obtained. If so, they should be forwarded for the information of the Department and the Auditor General. Payment of the account is being withheld until full information is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of June 21st, acknowledging voucher for $118.75, covering cost of purchase of mower by the principal of the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nYou ask for reasons for the emergency for the purchase of this machine. I thought that this was fully explained in the principal's letter. The old machine had been broken and repaired, but it suddenly gave out during haymaking season and as the principal was going to Ashcroft to get his auto, he took it onto himself to purchase a new mowing machine. Although he knows about the requirements of the Government Contract Supervision Committee, he did not say one word to me, and therefore competitive prices were not obtained. I knew nothing of this purchase until the machine was here. The principal's excuse was that a machine had to be had at once, as they were in the middle of haymaking, and they could not wait to obtain competitive prices. The mower in question was bought from the International Harvester Company of Canada. The parts are assembled and put together by a Canadian firm, and are therefore looked upon as a Canadian make.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

The expenditure for the purpose should, if possible, not exceed the amount stated. This will be paid from the funds from the New England Co., grant upon receipt of a voucher, certified by you, covering the expenditure incurred.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nEXTRACT FROM INSPECTOR'S REPORT ON THE LYTTON RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL? JUNE 3rd -- 4th, 1924\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:-\n\nOne of the needs of this school is a principal's residence. Mr. and Mrs. Lett feel that they would like to be able to have a home of their own, so that they might be free of the strain and turmoil of the life of the institution.\n\nR. H. Cairns,\nInsp.\nLyttion, B.C., Aug 20/24\n\nMr. H. Graham  \nIndian Agent  \nLyttion  \n\nDear Mr. Graham-\n\nWe have this year a great deal more silage corn than will fill the present silo at the barn & I thought it would be an advantage if the old silo which is in perfectly good condition could be moved down so that it could be used to store the over plus of corn & filled with the third crop of alfalfa. The advantage of the second silo would be twofold. The silage could be used to substitute the summer pasturage & it would also be a time saver in harvesting the third crop of alfalfa & do away with the difficulty of curing this crop in bad weather which usually exists in the autumn ensuring better fodder.\n\nThe moving of the old silo would cost approximately $110.00 which amt. my financial status will not allow me to spend. I therefore wish to submit same to you for approval with a view of getting a grant from the Dept. to cover the same.\n\nI would suggest that you ask the Dept. to wire their decision as it is now drawing nigh to the time when we should harvest the corn.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir:-\n\nI herewith beg to enclose a letter from Mr. Lett, principal of St. George's School, asking for some assistance to move the silo from the old barn to the new one.\n\nWhen applying for the new barn, I might say, I made application for two silos, but only one was given us, and we find that we have too much ensilage this year for the one and the second one can be put to good advantage.\n\nWithin the next two years we hope to have the new barn completely filled with milking cows, and when we have this, the two silos will not hold a bit too much ensilage. In talking this over Mr. Lett suggested that this money might be taken from the New England grant.\n\nAt any rate I would strongly recommend that this be approved and if the Department does, will you kindly wire me, as it is necessary to get this up as soon as possible.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

F. MacKenzie.\n\nChg. Dept. I. A.\nSir:\n\nMr. William Orr, the contractor for the barn at St. George's School, reports to me that he is $140.00 short in the final payments.\n\nI have gone into this matter very carefully and I find that vouchers 421 I amounting to $356.49, and 422 I amounting to $244.42, amounting to $580.91, were sent in from this office. The Department sent Mr. Orr a cheque for $440.11 on these two vouchers, which left a balance due him of $140.80, the amount which he claims is short.\n\nThese vouchers were in connection with the water works and why the Department deducted this amount I do not know.\n\nTrusting that you will put this right with Mr. Orr and send him a cheque for the balance due,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

The amount deducted was made up as follows:\n\nWages . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $128.00\nAccount on wages . . . . . . . . $12.80\n\n$140.80\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n(J.D.

Orr when payment of his accounts was made for work on the barn at St. George's School, I beg to say that, in making settlement the Department allowed Mr. Orr 10% commission on the total cost of the work. It was considered, therefore, that he should not also be paid wages as per voucher No. 421-1, but, after looking further into the matter it appears that Mr. Orr performed the services of a workman in addition to having oversight as a contractor, and consequently, the Department has allowed him payment of $128.00 by the cheque herewith inclosed for personal work. He has not been allowed commission on his own work. It is hoped that this payment will be regarded as a satisfactory adjustment of Mr. Orr's claim.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D. McLean\nAsst.

I have to confirm my answering telegram of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"Purchase to best advantage ensilage cutter for Lytton School.\"\n\nThe expenses of this agricultural equipment will be met from the New England Company grant and I should be pleased if you would mention that on the voucher when it is being forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to confirm the following nightlettergram sent you in connection with the ensilage cutter and blower at St. George's School, Lytton.\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\n\nSt. George's School ensilage cutter and blower completely broken down; and still about one hundred and twenty tons of ensilage to cut. May I purchase new one, price about one hundred and fifty dollars, may be allowed something on the old machine. Can be charged against New England grant. Please wire reply. Urgent.\n\n(signed) \"H. Graham, Indian Agent.\"\n\nIn regard to this I beg to state that we had just been started two days cutting ensilage when the machine broke down completely. Something must have got into it, and the whole machine was practically wrecked. We sent to Vancouver to see if new parts could be had, but they wired back that they could not supply them there, but might get them in the East. The machine has been in use for a great number of years and is an old model, and as we have at least 120 tons of ensilage still to cut, we thought that it would be very much better to purchase a new machine, rather than run the risk of not being able to replace the parts in the East.\n\nI trust that the Department will see their way clear to granting this request as it is a much needed machine at the present time. The Canadian Fairbanks-Morse advised us that they might be able to allow us something on the old machine.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nOttawa, November 4, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nYour general letter of October 15th has caused me much concern. His Lordship the Bishop of Ottawa and Mr. Perrier were in my office yesterday and we discussed remedial measures at some length. Relative to your general financial condition, I believe you have done as well as could be expected, considering the difficulties. There is being directed to you under separate cover a cheque for $1270, which is on hand from the New England Company. Please use this for outstanding accounts, so that some of the worries of current financing will be relieved.\n\nTo further release per capita earnings for regular current expenses, you should request authority for all repairs and replacements other than those of a minor nature. Whenever funds are available, favourable consideration will be given to meeting these costs from Appropriation or future payments from the New England Company.\n\nI understand from your letter that you are in favour of capital expenditure in connection with:\n\n1. Hogpen and henhouse.\n2. Milch cows, hogs and chickens.\n3. Employees' residence.\n4. Bath and toilet accommodation for two residences.\n5. Principal's residence.\n6. Proper living quarters for boys.\n\nI believe funds can be found for some of these needs now and I am prepared to place an item in the Estimates for the more costly undertakings. If the Government allows the item the work could be undertaken next spring. Give serious consideration to the various questions and telegraph me, estimating the cost concerning what you would like to undertake immediately.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nIndicate if the building activity you request in your telegram can be undertaken by day labour, under your supervision and that of the Indian agent. Further, let me know if stock should be purchased this fall, as I notice you have plenty of feed.\n\nIn the light of your letter, I consider that one of the most important requirements is the provision of a residence for yourself and family. You might let me know if a building of this type could be erected now and indicate the probable duration of the building season at Lytton. Upon receipt of your telegram, I will endeavour to secure the authority of the Superintendent General for the activity that is considered necessary now, provided the funds are available.\n\nAs it may not be possible to provide a new main building at Lytton in the near future, I am inclined to ask for a vote for a boys' dormitory and playroom combined. Please let me know by letter what you think of such a building and indicate whether it would be satisfactory to place it on the site that would be suitable for a new main building. We could perhaps use such a structure for classroom purposes in the future. In your letter you might intimate whether or not residence accommodation could be provided in the main building for the two employees who are not well housed, if the boys' dormitories, wash rooms, etc., were released by the provision of a special boys' building.\n\nI was very pleased to learn that you have done so well on the farm and I wish to assure you of my active interest and assistance.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

Sup. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nRe Estimates forwarded you by night lettergramme.\n\nI might say that these estimates were roughly put together. I have however tried to give you the approximate cost including freight cartage & hauling of material for building & gravel for cement work.\n\nMy suggestion to wait over until the spring to commence operations is twofold. The winter has this year set in very early as since the first of the month we have had considerable snow & frost. Secondly that during the interval to get everything in readiness, would possibly lessen the cost by at least $2000.00 Dollars, as during the slack months of Jan. & Feb., we could, with our own teams do the hauling & excavating. A purchasing Agent could be had in Mr. Orr of Chilliwack who could by close observation pick up, in Car Load lots, the lumber needed. Cement could be shipped in by Car Load this would save considerable in freight charges.\n\nWith all the work going on at the same time, money could be saved on Plumbing & Plastering &c., as the one firm could be given the work, & having it done at the same time would save train fares for men & the whole job would be a fairly good pick up for one Firm.\n\nI would not be able intelligently to supervise the work & would therefore suggest that Mr. Orr be given the supervision, & the work done by Day Labor on a cost plus basis.\n\nI have not taken the Boys' Dormitory into consideration as I am dealing fully with this in a further report.\n\nI omitted to say that we needed the cows as soon as purchase could be made. These cows to freshen shortly, if possible to obtain. This, I think, would not be a hard problem & could be had very reasonable in price, as feed is not in great abundance in the valley. We should then be able to turn over some ready cash which is so much needed.\n\nThanking you for hearing & interest & trust the above will to some degree explain the contents of telegramme of last evening.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nOttawa, November 26, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nUpon receipt of your letters with reference to building activity at the Lytton Indian Residential School, I immediately made arrangements to ask Parliament for a substantial vote which could be used during the coming building season. I have discussed a proposed programme with Mr. Warner and Mr. Orr and it is my aim to erect a farmer's residence, a hen house and a hog pen on the new site as soon as weather permits next spring. This activity could be undertaken by a competent builder, who could purchase the materials and supervise the work as foreman.\n\nI suggest that the residence near the present school, which would be vacated by the farmer, be decorated and fitted up as a temporary home for yourself and family. A septic tank, plumbing and whatever else is needed could be provided. A cold storage building is, no doubt, needed; but my thought is that this could wait until it could be placed on the new site.\n\nI am asking both Parliament and the New England Company for funds to erect a portion of a new main building. The wing would contain heating plant, dining room, kitchen and assembly hall. Until the main wing is erected, the dining room, kitchen and assembly hall could be used as boys' quarters.\n\nIt is true that such an arrangement would be somewhat inconvenient at mealtime, but the general supervision ought not to be more difficult. The farmer could be living near the new wing and the new barn and temporary quarters could be provided for another male officer with the boys. I believe that this arrangement would effect a saving in the long run and I will await with interest your answer to this communication. Mr. Indian Agent Graham is receiving a copy for his information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, November 28, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your information, a copy of the Deputy Superintendent General's letter of the 26th instant to the Rev. Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School. You might discuss the proposed building activity with Mr. Lett and submit a recommendation at your convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Sir:\n\nMr. Inspector Cairns, in a report on his recent inspection of the Lytton Residential School, draws attention to the condition of a drain which if not given immediate attention may become a source of menace to the health of the pupils.\n\nI have to request that you will arrange to have the drain referred to by the Inspector thoroughly cleaned out and put in a good sanitary condition and any repairs required made in order to provide against any danger from an outbreak of typhoid. I am sure you will realize the necessity of having this drain put in proper order at the earliest possible date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nReferring to yours of the 26th ultimo, I have read the contents with interest & must say that I thoroughly appreciate the proposed programme of building mapped out for erection in the spring. We are in great need of such equipment & needless to say that I shall endeavor to make each a payable proposition.\n\nMay I ask if there is anything I might be able to do in the way of preparation such as excavating & drawing of gravel. I believe the men could make time to do some of this work later on in the season.\n\nRe. the possibility of fitting out the present residence occupied by one of the farm hands to be used temporarily for a Principal's Residence cannot be carried out to any degree of satisfaction, as this shack is a small log house & is already beginning to fall to pieces. This being the reason why I asked that a new residence be built for the farm hand. The building is no longer occupiable.\n\nI trust you will pardon my frankness but I wish you could see the building & you would easily realise the fruitlessness of your suggestion. It really would be throwing money away.\n\nI might say that building a Principal's residence on the new sight would not, to any great degree, hinder my work & connection with the present school Building. My whole aim is to get Mrs. Lett & the younger away from the present environment. This cannot come too soon as it would give better satisfaction & more contentment & consequently better service. The old house which would be vacated is well down on the farm & not far off the new sight hence repairing this would not make much difference in so far as convenience is concerned.\n\nI believe the right step is being taken regarding the commencement of a new School & I trust & pray that you will be able to accomplish your aim. The advantages would, I believe offset the disadvantages. We at least could house the older boys thus separating them from the smaller. They would also be in the centre of operations & could be supervised by one of the farm hands together with one of the teachers. This would do away with the position of House-master thus making a substantial saving. The Matron would be able to handle the smaller boys. There would be more room for playgrounds & rooms hence easier & better supervision.\n\nThanking you very sincerely,\n\nYours very obediently\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of Nov. 23rd, enclosing a copy of a letter signed by Mr. Duncan C. Scott and addressed to the Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School.\n\nI have discussed this matter very fully with the Principal, and it is very gratifying to learn that the Department intend erecting the farmer's residence, hen house and hog pen, as soon as the weather permits in the spring. We are certainly very much in need of all these and they will allow a profit being made for the school from these sources.\n\nIn regard to the suggestion that the Principal take over the farmers cottage that is to be vacated, this is quite out of the question, as it is an old log building that has been condemned, and has really become uninhabitable.\n\nIt is certainly great news to us to hear that it is proposed to ask for an appropriation, in order to start the main wing for the new school. When this is completed, it will certainly get over a great many of our difficulties, as the boys quarters as suggested could be taken care of there.\n\nIt might not be out of place here to mention the water shortage that is threatening us, at the present school site. Everything possible has been done to get all the water available collected together, but with all that it looks as if it might run short, as some of the springs, that used to run a good head of water have completely dried up. A great deal depends now on the severity of the winter, if we have it very cold, it may dry up some of the springs now running, but if it remains a fairly open winter they may not be affected.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, December 15, 1924.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the proposed building programme at the Lytton Indian Residential School. I note that the farm hands' residence could not be fitted up as a temporary principal's home.\n\nIt is extremely desirable that the principal live in a residence that is attached to the boys' wing. The home can be planned as if it were a detached building, but one wall is that of the main building. One door, admitting into the institution on the ground floor is all that is required. You will understand the advantage of this arrangement in the matter of supervision.\n\nIt is, therefore, not advisable to erect a principal's residence until the boys' wing of the main building is being built. I have to suggest, however, that a farmer's residence be erected on the new site at Lytton and that this building be occupied temporarily by yourself and family.\n\nIf we are able to build a portion of a new main building, as indicated in the third paragraph of my letter of the 28th ultimo, the older boys could use this as living quarters and temporary accommodation could also be found, no doubt, for a farm hand and one of the teachers.\n\nAs soon as building is possible next spring, the hen house and hog pen could be erected on a day labour basis. A contract could be let for the farmer's residence and the wing of the main building, if the funds are provided. There will be no advantage in any excavating or hauling of gravel for work that is to be done by contract. You might direct to the Department rough sketches of a suitable hen house and a hog pen.\n\nIn a separate letter, I shall be pleased if you will indicate what accommodation should be provided in the new main building. The number of pupils that you are confident of securing should be stated and the number of officers who will live in the building should be mentioned.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nSt. George School\nLytton B. C.\nDec 16/24\n\nMr. A. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Deputy & Secretary.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRelating to yours of the 9th inst. No. 165-0-5\nthis drain has already been attended to.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nSir:\n\nThe Reverend Principal of St. George's School, showed me, a short time ago, your letter to him in connection with the proposed starting of the new building in connection with this institution.\n\nIt is very gratifying to note that it is your intention, if possible, to get an appropriation put through to start the first unit this coming spring. The last four days have shown how very essential it is that a new building be installed as soon as possible. The present building is completely done as far as housing anyone during the winter. The heating plant is quite incapable of heating this building sufficiently. It has been running at full capacity ever since the cold weather started, and the highest that they can get the temperature in any room is 52\u00b0 and in some of the rooms it was only registering as high as 36\u00b0. The members of the staff are to be seen going about their duties inside the building with overcoats on, and I am very much afraid that it will be difficult to keep the staff over another winter in this building. If there is a chance of getting the building started, would it not be possible to get the whole building built at once, as it is not fair to either staff or pupils to have them housed in such a cold building as the present one is.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nI hope you will pardon me for submitting a report at this time, but as you have stated you are expecting to ask for appropriations for the beginning of a new school, I thought the following would perhaps be of some use toward getting out a report on further conditions existing at the school.\n\nThe weather has dropped from 64 degrees above on Sunday evening last, and now registers 12 below zero this morning. Since Monday morning, we have been suffering terribly with the cold, not being able to obtain sufficient heat, owing to the fact that our heating-system is over capacitated.\n\nHave not been able to allow the children to occupy the schoolrooms, as the temperature there has registered a minimum of 32 degrees, and a maximum of 52 yesterday noon, with the sun streaming through the windows. This condition of affairs is not by any means ideal, nor conducive to the work, and health of children and teachers. The children are in the midst of their Christmas Exams, and last night on entering the senior schoolroom, I noticed that the Senior Teacher was trying, with what results I do not know, to conduct an exam with the temperature at 50 degrees.\n\nThis condition is general throughout the building, all departments being more or less stopped through the intense cold, which, should we have an adequately heated plant, would not be minded at all.\n\nThere is no gainsaying the fact that the age and condition of repair of this building adds to the labour of heating it, as there is hardly a wall in the place that does not let the wind and cold blow through it like a piece of cheesecloth; the windows are ill-fitting and the sills loose; doors have to be padded to try in some way to keep the drafts down.\n\nYesterday morning the doctors appeared on the scene, prepared to operate on the children selected for the removal of tonsils. Needless to say they were unable to think of operating under the existing condition of the temperature. We were unable to select one room in the whole building which we could heat to a degree of heat which would warrant these operations, and then would follow the return of the children after the operation to the cold dormitories. No doubt you will receive in due course, a report on their attempt and findings.\nDuncan C Scott, Esq.,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nThe building, from a living standpoint is almost an impossibility, and it is only under the feeling that, having a promise of the commencement of a new school, that myself and staff can carry on at all, under such existing circumstances.\n\nI sincerely trust that the above will be of some help towards opening up the hearts of members of the Legislature when the time comes for voting the necessary money to carry on this work. People do not seem to realise the conditions under which men in the field are obliged to labour.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n(Rev) [Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL.\n\nARL/FEA.\nOttawa, December 31st, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the general unsuitability of the main building at the Lytton Indian Residential School and the desirability of completing a main building at the first opportunity. There is no probability that funds will be provided for a complete main building next year, as there are so many pressing claims on Parliamentary Appropriation. It is hoped, however, that a start will be made on the new plant.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nOttawa, December 31st, 1924.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the 17th instant, and I note with regret that the recent cold snap has resulted in a season of considerable hardship to the staff and pupils at the Lytton Indian Residential School. The facts presented in your communication will strengthen our request for funds to enable us to commence a new building next year.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nIndian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nMr. Duncan G. Scott,\nDept. Sect. Gen. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRe letter No. 838-5 of Dec. 15th last; I may say that I have hesitated to answer same at once as I wished to consider thoroughly the proposition of occupying the farm residence which you purpose in building with the new addition Unit if you are able to put estimates through for the erection of same.\n\nI quite see your point in the question of supervision. On the other hand I hesitate somewhat in moving into this new residence as from the point of view of living quarters this man is existing under by no means ideal conditions & it is only that me & his wife have been looking forward to moving out of the old shack that he has exercised such patience. We, myself & Mrs. Lett with the baby who is now a very spoiled child, will have to try & carry on in our present abode & under present existing conditions with the sincere hope that no ill effects may develop. It is a rather hard two years future, or perhaps more to look forward to but in talking the matter over with Mrs. Lett we have concluded to make the best of it for the time. This may not be a final outlook on the situation as when the time comes & the farm residence has materialized circumstances may be such that might warrant our occupying it temporarily.\n\nThere is no reason why room could not be provided for two members of the staff who would be able to supervise & attend to the needs of the boys housed in the new quarters.\n\nI trust you will see in the above my view & feel certain that you will exercise your utmost to have us changed around at the earliest possible period.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nLytton B.C.\nJan. 2nd/24\n\nMr. D.

Mr. Lett, Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School, when in Ottawa a few weeks ago, discussed with the Department the erection of two cottages on the new school site for the staff. It was understood that one of these homes would be used by the Rev. Principal and his family for the time being.\n\nI am pleased to state that $3,000 is available for the purpose of erecting the two cottages and the Department Architect is convinced that the Rev. Mr. Lett's plans for these two buildings will be satisfactory to the Department. You, in conjunction with the Rev. Principal, are authorized to purchase the materials necessary for these two buildings, after securing competitive prices. When you are submitting certified accounts in duplicate, in favour of the firms given the business, you should attach memoranda showing those asked to quote and the prices quoted. Labour returns, in duplicate, should be kept for any labour employed, showing the hours of the men engaged and their receipts for wages. A supply of these time sheets is being directed to you under separate cover and there is also being directed to you an accountable cheque for $800 with which to pay labourers. It is understood that the school staff, teams and older boys will work whenever possible on the two cottages. None of the funds directed to you should be used for the payment of materials. These accounts should be directed to the Department for payment.\n\nBoth you and the Rev. Principal, who is receiving a copy of this letter, should keep in mind the fact that only $3,000 is available for this purpose and that the expenditure should be kept within this amount.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJ.

From this had to be deducted the amount of board which was credited to the school, of $233.00, leaving a balance of $1097.75 due for wages. I have paid out the $800.00 advanced and sent to me by the Department, and Mr. Lett advanced the difference, of $297.75, for which I am enclosing a voucher, No. 301K. Mr. Lett advises me that the Department has this amount to the credit of the buildings in Ottawa.\n\nTrusting that these will be found in order,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

The paylists in question should be made out in duplicate in accordance with instructions contained in official letter of the 30th July. There is an error of $20.00 in the addition of the pay-sheet for the 31st October. If you received $297.75 from Mr. Lett to complete the payment of men's wages you should forward a receipt for him to be attached to the voucher, for that amount, which you submitted in his favour.\n\nThe expenditure authorized in the official letter of July 30th was $3,000.00, but the accounts amount to $1,876.22 and the pay-sheets to $1,310.75, or an aggregate of $3,186.97, which is $186.97 in excess of the amount authorized.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D.

Graham, ESQ.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDecember 2nd, 1925\n\nSir,\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 26th November with which you forwarded certain vouchers, one of which is in favour of Mr. Wm. M. Orr, amounting to $108.40 and covers expenditure in connection with the erection of two cottages at St. George's Residential School, and in reply I may say that before dealing with the matter of payment, the Department desires particulars regarding the charge in the said voucher for eight railway fares from Chilliwack to Lytton and return. You should state whether Mr. Orr made the said trips purely on business in connection with the erection of the cottages or whether he went from Chilliwack to Lytton to transact private business. If the latter was the case it is considered that the Department should not be charged with his travelling expenses.\n\nThe question of the payment of the voucher mentioned will not be dealt with until your report is received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(J.D. McLean)\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\nSupported by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1649)\n\nLytton, B.C., Dec 1st/25\n\nMr. D.C. Scott\nDep. Sup. General\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nRe. your telegram concerning the possible postponement of the building of the New School. I answered same stating that \"Delay would mean great inconvenience and grave risk practically impossible to wait.\" From the point of view of the former:\n1. The school is now so far away from the farm that the boys are obliged to drive one half mile to do the milking. This means out of bed at five o'clock in the A.M. in order to be back for breakfast with the milk for seven.\n2. In some cases when the farm work is being done on the north east of the farm the men & boys are obliged to travel about one mile to their work. This naturally curtails a great deal of lost time & money in the payment of staff whereas if the school were moved to the new site the greater part of this lost time would be taken up in actual work and the school would then be situated in the middle of operations. By this move being done it would not only save me the worry of seeing so much unnecessary waste of time but would also help financially.\n3. I am now living one half mile away from the school having just completed the cottage which I spoke of occupying for the few intervening months expecting the School to be built on block or the greater part beginning next spring. This will continue for over a year or perhaps two the extra running entailed.\n4. The constant fear of staff resigning owing to the unalterable inconveniences through unsanitary conditions & lack of equipment.\n5. Having to haul water to auxilliate the present exhaustive supply & very often necessitating the carrying of water to flush closets in the dormitories.\n\nGrave Risk:\n1. Overcrowding of dormitories and the evils attached to it.\n2. No separation older from younger pupils. We have what we might call divisions in the boys dormitories but the girls are all together.\n3. No isolation for sick. Contagious diseases must needs be let run riot.\n4. Cold building. Drafty. Heating system overradiated. Children at the present time have heavy colds & do not seem able to shake them. Two children are in the hospital having developed pneumonia.\n5. Insufficient water for sanitary purposes & fire protection. Seeing irrigation ditch which is full of disease germs keeping us in constant dread of disease outbreak.\n6. Insufficient sanitary equipment.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6464, file 888-5, part 1)\nThe newly appointed Bishop of Cariboo has lately visited the school & has cabled the N.E. Co. asking them to refrain from putting anything into the way of the Dept. which might hinder you from building the coming spring. The Bishop was not a little disappointed at the state of the buildings on the whole especially noting the foundations of the old part of the building. No doubt you have heard something from him by this time. The N.E.C.O. appointed him visiting Bishop before he left England & as this will be his Diocesan School he is interested in its welfare.\n\nI do hope you will be able to go on with the building next spring we need it so badly from so many viewpoints. The building of a New School would relieve us all of so many difficulties and risks to the health & morals of the children.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, December 12th, 1925.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge your letter of the last instant with reference to the urgent need for a new main building at the Lytton Indian Residential School.

A.R. Lett, of St. George's School, Lytton, as an advance on wages paid carpenters in building cottages in connection with the school, has been paid. The paylists for wages have been credited against the advance, but I may say that the note on the paylists in regard to $233.00 for board of men is not sufficiently explicit. Kindly report in the matter stating whether the amount was deducted from the men's wages and paid to the school, or whether the men were boarded at the school without charge.
