It is difficult to imagine how much more difficult it would be without these basic necessities. The women who have been forced to work in these conditions have faced many challenges, but they have also found ways to overcome them. Their resilience and determination have inspired others to stand up for their rights and demand better working conditions.\"\n\nThe Poor Road.\n\n\"To help improve the lives of those who are struggling, it is important to provide them with access to resources that will enable them to improve their living conditions. This can include access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. By providing these resources, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to live a better life.\"\n\nUnlikely Alliance.\n\n\"Even though there are differences between the French and English speaking communities, there is still an opportunity for cooperation and understanding. By working together, we can create a stronger society that is more resilient and better able to address the challenges we face.\"\n\nOUR REPRESENTATIVES.\n\n\"It is important for us to be aware of the representatives who are elected to represent our interests. By staying informed about the issues that affect us, we can ensure that our voices are heard and that our needs are met.\"\nOUR TERMS.\n\nWe have placed our yearly subscription at the low rate of ONE DOLLAR, with the object of enforcing advance payment. We can much better afford to publish a paper at that price when we know that every dollar given is paid for, than if we run the chances of collecting accounts at a higher figure. Besides we will thus specially secure a larger circulation, which will enhance the value of our advertising columns, and thus render easier your name and a dollar, and get your neighbor to subscribe, and you will obtain full value for your money in interesting reading from now till January 1st, 1887.\n\nLivery.\n\nDOOLITTLE'S LIVERY\n\nFeed and Sale Stable,\n\nQU'APPELLE ST.\n\nSingle and Double Rigs for Hire.\n\nFREIGHTING A SPECIALTY\n\nALL KINDS OF COAL\n\nKept Constantly on Hand at the Lowest Prices.\n\nCash Paid for Hides & Skins\n\nQU'APPELLE.\n\nL.

H. V. Bolyea of this town, but a registered letter by the burglar of the C. P. R. postal card office at Winkler, was stolen.\n\nMr. W. S. Redpath, manager of St. John's College Farm, has hung out his signboard as a barrister. He occupies part of Mr. F. L.

Mr. Jackson would not be able to keep his promise if he had no doubt the Northwest grizzlies would descend.\n\nMr. Jackson said that Mr. Jackson had met at least one of his promises. Mr. Jackson said that it was not necessary to deal with the half breed and Indian question and concluded by saying that it was not possible to say that there was nothing to do before the council but because he knew what the Indians wanted and to meet their wishes he always did so.\n\nAt the time of the meeting, he could say from his personal knowledge that the Indians knew that he was not an advocate of the half breed and Indian question and concluded by saying that it was not possible to say that there was nothing to do before the council but because he knew what the Indians wanted and to meet their wishes he always did so.\n\nThe debate was adjourned till 2 o'clock the next day.\n\nIn the debate\u2014His Honor took the chair at 2:15 p.m.\n\nOn resuming the debate on the address in reply to his Honorable speech, Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Jackson said that he would occupy the time of the House for moments in his honor. Mr. Jackson said that he brought against him by the Lieutenant-Governor on Friday evening. The Lieutenant-Governor thereupon brought Mr. Jackson's remarks to Mr. Jackson's attention and asked him if he knew, unless it was to throw a glamour over the charges in his report, that Mr. Jackson said \"I have not been convinced that Mr. Jackson\" did not refer to \"degradation,\" at which the Governor had been silent. Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Jackson was acting in accordance with his duties, because as Indian Commissioner he was charged with the care of the half breed and Indian rising and did not take the proper steps to bring the matter prominently before the Dominion Government. If the Lieutenant-Governor's representations were not attended to, then he could do the same thing. His Mr. Land\u2014He could resign.\n\nHis House\u2014Mr. Land did not return to resign.\n\nMr. Jackson said that he prepared an answer to prove he did resign. He referred to the attempt of Mr. Dewdney to prevent the publication of his (Mr. Jackson's) statement in the (Governor's) speech, and inserted an extract from Mr. Dewdney's letter to Mr. Land about the death Indians five of them died of starvation. The Indians were not able to maintain life and were forced to give up their lives by the Indian Agents.\n\nHis Honor\u2014False! False! False!\n\nMr. Jackson\u2014I can prove the matter on oath. He then stated that Mr. Dewdney had committed frauds and misappropriated provisions by the Indian Department in the delivery of provisions, etc. The Governor said the Indians and the people of this town that matter should not be pushed up.\n\nHis Honor\u2014It was not smothered.\n\nMr. Jackson\u2014Isn't it? Then how were the parties punished? That year passed by and by and by.\n\nMr. Jackson mentioned his honesty and that he had never before been accused of any impropriety or misconduct. He could assure his honor if Mr. Dewdney went for election again, he would vote very few votes for Mr. Dewdney.\n\nFew would regret his honest departure from the territories. In fact he had no doubt the Northwest grizzlies would descend.\n\nMr. Jackson said that Mr. Jackson had met at least one of his promises. Mr. Jackson said that it was not necessary to deal with the half breed and Indian question and concluded by saying that it was not possible to say that there was nothing to do before the council but because he knew what the Indians wanted and to meet their wishes he always did so.\n\nThe debate was adjourned till 2 o'clock the next day.\n\nIn the debate\u2014His Honor took the chair at 2:15 p.m.\n\nOn resuming the debate on the address in reply to his Honorable speech, Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Jackson said that he would occupy the time of the House for moments in his honor.
