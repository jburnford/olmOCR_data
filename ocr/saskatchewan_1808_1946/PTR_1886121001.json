It is a question often asked at the present time, and we must confess that in the light of recent events recorded in Canada, the Liberals may, in most cases, be put down as men who place party considerations\u2014whether they be personal or party\u2014above any other consideration it may be to the principles involved by a Radical Liberal, Brown, providing he can get his party into power. In the good old days of Robert Blair, the Liberals were a party of principle, and stood or fell by them. They were men who loved principles, but they placed them above party considerations; their interests were at stake, and law and order were to be maintained. Now we find them, in the person of Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Blake, promoting a particular set of principles to which they feel bound to adhere. In Prince Edward Island, Mr. Macdonald's Government sought to abolish the Upper House of the Assembly, which is elected by the voters, and which costs about $250, while the Lower House is elected by manhood suffrage; but the Liberals under Mr. Macdonald have opposed the abolition of the second chamber, and succeeded in prolonging its existence. This is a Liberal victory. In Nova Scotia the Liberals are successful, at least that is what they appear to be doing, and they have been successful in throwing off the late Government. In Quebec, they, with the exception of the English-speaking minority, have joined the Rielites, the party of vengeance, and are now engaged in a war against the man Mr. Blake characterized as \"red-handed villains,\" and offered $10,000 for their heads. The Liberal party have taken, along with the \"martyr\" Riel, much neglected (?) Indians of the Northwest, who are now apathetic, though the sympathies of the English-speaking minority are still strong. Although every Liberal in this country knows that the Indians of the Northwest have very little sympathy for them, and a good deal more than they deserve considering their best magnanimity. The appearance of the Liberal party in the P.E.R., a work to which the Northwest owes its development more than anything else, is a Liberal victory. The position to-day would have been much different from what it is. The Northwest remains now, as it has always been, a land, to drive from power the man who wishes to see one, by any means, however sordid, to secure the votes of the Canadian politician, however dangerous to national interests. In Manitoba, the Liberal party have joined the Rielites in disowning the late Bishop McLean. The first was taken from St. Matt. vii., 12. \"And if thy brother shall sin against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.\" The second was taken from St. Matt. vii., 12. \"And if thy brother shall sin against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.\"\n\nTHE LATE BISHOP MCLEAN.\n\nWe give the following from the London Advertiser:\n\nThe Rev. Canon Richardson, in his letter to the Memorial Church, London, on the subject also of the resignation to the late Bishop McLean. The first was taken from St. Matt. vii., 12. \"And if thy brother shall sin against thee, go and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.\"\n\nTHE WEST END STORE\n\nLadies' Six-Button Kid Gloves in White, Cream and Delicate Shades, And Full Lengths do in Silk Thread, Just Received at CHAS.
