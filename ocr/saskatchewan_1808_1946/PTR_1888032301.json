Canon Macdonald.\n\nWAR AND RUMORS OF WAR\nUnder the above caption the Battlefield Herald of the 2nd inst. made an article which seems to create an impression that there is great danger of an Indian uprising in the spring. It says that trouble is foreshadowed in many ways, but fails to give a single instance for its belief. We believe there is no rumor of something of the same kind in 1885, and that rumor was followed by an Indian war. We have made careful inquiries into the feelings of the Indians throughout the district, but at Battlefield, and we cannot find that there is the slightest cause for uneasiness. From the general tone of the Herald we would infer that this article has been written in order to create a feeling of uneasiness among the people, and that there will be a large mounted police expenditure there the people of the place will be in a very bad plight. In other words, the Herald wants a large force of soldiers there, not so much to increase the taxes as to spend money in the place. We hope they will get the additional Police required and that the settlement will prosper accordingly, instead of being made worse.\n\nThis paper will settle the vexed question of disallowance, but whether it will settle all the future questions is not known. It must be borne in mind that even though the monopoly clause may have been repealed, yet the Federal authorities have exactly the same right to direct matters of the Local Legislature of Manitoba as they had before, and will, doubtless\u2014should the necessity arise\u2014find as good an excuse for doing so as they did in the past, unless under the present laws now being made a definite guarantee is given that the power shall not be exercised.\n\nThe people of Manitoba are justly gratified no doubt at the victory they believe they have achieved, and are sincerely thankful for the protection that has been given to their territory, and we heartily join in their rejoicing; but they should not stop short of a direct assurance that the monopoly clause will not be exercised in the future as it has been in the past, lest they wake up some morning to find that the abolition of the hated monopoly clause was only a rise on the part of the Government to put the people in the wrong, and that they will continue to deal with the local railway acts in the same spirit as they have dealt with them in the absence of any other.\n\nTHOS.

To each are attached four yokes of oxen to twenty large oxen. The train consists of fifteen or eighteen wagons in all and covered by heavy canvas. Each team has one driver who uses a long and heavy whip which he uses with great skill and appropriate language. The whole team is called a \"bull train\" and the cook and night herder make up the \"outfit,\" as the common western term goes. It takes nine days to travel the thirty-five miles a day and has carried sixty-five tons of hay into Macleod at one time, though the total load is from fifty-five to fifty-eight tons.\n\nThe night herder drives the oxen to pasture, watches them and returns them for the day's work, as the animals get nothing but grass.\n\nOne of these trains is an eight-wheeled, and the most eastern vehicle standing out in the prairie. Some of the teams are trying to knot their harnesses so that there are simpler things than the \"bull train.\" One team of two of that whip, a sorcerer, named John \"Jeff Davis,\" the boss, and one of his helpers, named \"Old Man,\" ride upon itself, and yet they laugh. It seems so simple, but reader, if you want to see a real bull train by making a five-cent run, hold dinner by the side of one pole of each in your best clothing.\n\nEDMONTON.\n\nFrom the Edmonton News, March 12.\n\nIt is reported that Chief Factor Hare shortly came to an agreement between himself and the Government regarding the sale of the R. S. Co. for the North West Mounted Police.\n\nOn the trip back the last outgoing stage failed to make the Lion Pass and returned on Monday night. After dark a party of Indians had been seen near the pass and the next morning a number of Indians were seen near the stage, who were said to be on the lookout. When the stage came to was plainly sight of and only a short distance from the stopping place.\n\nNOTICE.\n\nSealed Tenders accompanied by the usual deposit, signed and sealed, will be received at the undersigned Agent's Office, in Edmonton, until Monday, the sixteenth day of April, 1886.\n\nJ.

What he wants is a chance to complete amnesty for men and all who took part in the North-West rebellion.\n\nOttawa, March 21.\u2014This has been a dull day in the building of the new House. It has been raining all day.\n\nThe debate on unrestricted reciprocity was continued this afternoon by Messrs. Gignillat, Macdonald, Brown and Wood, of Westmorland.

A month ago he suffered a loss of a team horse and a few days later his partner, Mr. Hansen, was claimed by a very stable keeper of Calgary, who represented that he had purchased the horse and now he is again in the stable. He arrived here from Medicine Hat Saturday night and was obliged to remain there until the next day when he came out and turned his horses loose. On getting up this morning two of them were missing, and although he has searched the country within a radius of twenty miles, he could not find them. It is feared that the Indians have stolen them off. A couple more are now coming down the river tonight that night and have not since been heard of.\n\nBATTLEFORD.\n\nFrom the Herald, March 2.\n\nOwing to the detention of the train on Tuesday week by snow the last mail was a very small one.\n\nSept. 1st left for Regina or thereabouts, arriving last.
