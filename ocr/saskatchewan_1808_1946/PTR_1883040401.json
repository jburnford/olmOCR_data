Even his fellow members were disgusted at his conduct; it is only charity that prevents us from saying that he was doing something worse than usual.\n\nConducted by Mr. Clarke, on every point, Mr. Kennedy's conduct was most praiseworthy. He seemed like a gallant jay every time he had descended. For an honourable member of the Assembly to be so unfitted, but for one whose own platform was a shade of abuse and vilification so unprofitable, would have been an act of charity, but the conduct of Dr. Porter excited him away and made him feel that he was not doing his duty.\n\nHis repeated interruptions of Mr. Clarke, his refusal to allow him to finish his speeches, his utter recklessness as to what he did or said, his disregard of the rules of order, his loud and boisterous manner, might have been found sympathies, but he utterly failed to make any impression whatever upon those who knew his position was most swaggering. Even his own followers could see that he was not doing his duty.\n\nThe Assembly adjourned without doing anything more than to vote a motion that the proceedings of Saturday should not be allowed to stand, and that the members present should be instructed to meet again next week.\n\nNotice to Creditors.\n\nIn the Guards of Alexander Rederick Kennedy, deceased.\n\nBlack and Colored Cashmere, Colored Lusters, All Wood French Belges, Rich Broaches, Black Grey Grain Silk, Blue Satins, Colored Satins in all shades, Black and Colored Velveteens.\n\nPrints\n\nA full and complete assortment in this line, including Ashton's Celebrated Prints.\n\nYarns\n\nScotch Fingering Yarns, Canada and Homespun, in all colors.\n\nCottons\n\nA full line of Bleached and Grey Cottons, Canada Colored Shirtings, Loom Table Linen, Russia Cash Toweling.\n\nHandkerchiefs\n\nA Choice Assortment of Ladies' and Gent's Silk and Linen Handkerchiefs, Turkey Red Handkerchiefs.\n\nQuilts\n\nWhite and Colored Quilts in all sizes.\n\nBlankets\n\nWe offer special value in Hudson Bay Wool Blankets\u2014$2.50 and $3.00.
