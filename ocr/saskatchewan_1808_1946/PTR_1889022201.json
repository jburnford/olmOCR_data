Alexander Macdonald, who had been sent from Montreal Lake after the Indians had been removed from their homes in the Red River District to Fort Carlton in 1876. On their arrival at Montreal Lake some two hundred Indians were there, and they were given a hearty welcome in Indian fashion\u2014firing off guns and band shaking. The Indians were anxious to see the new Territorial government, and the opening of June 1st was eagerly anticipated.\n\nThe balance of our winter goods will be sold at cost.

In addition to the usual symptoms, there is a high fever, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The disease is said to be caused by the consumption of contaminated water. The death rate is high, and many cases have been reported. The authorities are taking every precaution to prevent the spread of the disease.\nFRIDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1869.\n\nTHE PRINCE ALBERT TIMES\nAND\nSASKATCHEWAN REVIEW,\nPUBLISHED BY\nJ. D.

One reason for this was that we did not consider the opinion of those referred to as meriting attention, and another reason was that we expected to make such fundamental arrangements as would enable us to improve our facilities for publishing a larger and generally improved journal. In the latter we have been, so far, disappointed. We would ask those who are so ready to find fault and to require that it should be possible to carry on a newspaper or any other enterprise, without a certain amount of capital. Unfortunately, like most business men in Prince Albert, we have conducted our affairs too much on the credit system, and now when we want money we find it an utter impossibility to collect a cent. It is painful to reflect, too, that none of those gentlemen, who are so anxious to build up the finances of the Territorial government, stand on their books with large sums on the debit side of their accounts. If those parties were half as honest as they would wish to appear they would come forward and settle up, until they do so we will expect them to be in common decency to reserve their abuse. They should bear in mind that in order to secure the services of a good journalist we require money; it is a requirement that cannot be met by telegraphic news. If our delinquent patrons will kindly come forward and settle up, we will endeavor to make this paper the best in the Territories. If they do not, we shall have no alternative but to cease our depleted resources which may not be of the most pleasant kind.\n\nWhile the Town Council is engaged in legislating for the good of the ratepayers, and endeavoring to bring order out of the chaos of the past three years, we are sorry to see that there are a certain number of shrewd and sagacious leaders in town who lack of better judgment on account of a preference for idleness, would fail to realize the best efforts of the Council, by holding the members up to ridicule and endeavoring to create a feeling against them. To the individuals referred to we would say, mind your own business, or if you have none, then do not interfere with others. We do not say that the actions of the Council should not be criticized, or that they are not deserving of criticism, but there is a great difference between intelligent criticism and malicious slander; the latter appears to be freely meted out, and so far has been effective in its results. We will not hesitate to condemn the actions of the Council where we believe they merit condemnation, and we reserve to every ratepayer the same right. A great deal of harm has been already done by the idle talk which has been going on of late, and we regret that at times councils appear to be influenced thereby, mistaking such rubbish for public opinion. It is not public opinion. It is simply the vaporing of a set of individuals who have nothing else to do. To the members of the Council we say, do not give any heed to store or street politics, be guided by your own judgments and a healthy public opinion and do what you consider best for the municipality, and a discerning electorate will not be slow to approve of your motives and actions. A great deal of censure is heaped on the Council on account of its action with regard to the reduction of the salary. We hold that the Council acted rightly in the matter, first in reducing the salary, and second in making the appointment when they did. The Council, to all intents and purposes, had refused many late applications for positions, and it seems that it would not accept the office at the reduced salary. His friends, or would be friends, are entirely to blame if he was not appointed. We have heard it said that men who have more sense, and a higher self respect, that they would do all in their power to stir up strife in the Council and make it unpleasant for his Worship the Mayor as possible. Such feelings are the result of mischievous and nothing else. We hope that we will not be compelled to allude to this subject again, and that those who are prompted by the green eyed monster to create mischief will in future desist.\n\nEvery Night I Scratch'd\n\nUntil the skin was raw, body covered with spots like spots of matter.\n\nBy Cultural Remedies.\n\nI am going to tell you of the complete formula which I used for my cure. I applied it over my body, but thought nothing of it at first. After a few days I began to notice spots of matter spotted me, and who could have thought that they would grow? I would scratch every night until I could hardly move. I thought I was going off again. In vain did I consult all the doctors, and in vain did I try every remedy, giving up all hopes of recovery. I came near losing my life, but I finally chanced upon my drug, and obtained complete relief. I am now well and free of all disquietude by one, and am convinced that others will benefit by my experience before I begin to take the CULTURAL remedies. My case was extremely varied. My disease was uncommon, and I thought that I was going off again. I am now convinced that others will benefit by my experience before I begin to take the CULTURAL remedies.

As we have mentioned, the hives have been few days been, an abundant supply of honey and very little trash in the hives, except as far as the bees were not boarded. There was every prospect of the bees coming through the winter safely.\n\nSupt. Graham has arranged to distribute blankets and other articles of half-sacks at St. Albert. The conditions are that all who are able must work or make a contribution toward the expenses. The number of those to want is much smaller than last year and is confined entirely to such as were for months exposed to the intense weather, and who are weak, infirm people and children.\n\nThere is very little demand for barley at present, but there is plenty of supply. Buyers do not care to invest and farmers do not want to sell at present prices. The market is quoted at 40 cents for 50 and 40 cents for barley in trade. Wheat is in good demand for cash at $1.40 to $1.50 per hundred. The market for eggs was quoted at $1.10 to $1.15 per quarter.

This will be the last season that this stream will have to be taken into account, because the permanent site will be completed in time to carry the surplus of next year.\n\nCALGARY.\n\nFrom the Tribune, Feb. 6.\n\nThe telegraph says that he was somewhat surprised at Montana's offer to lend us a plow for our use, as other grangers coming up quite green.
