The report alluded to in A, to be ready on or before the first day of the regular session of Congress.\n\nII. Extracts from a late publication of Hon. Darey McGee, member of the Canadian Parliament.\u2014(C a.)\n\n1. \"Whilst we were interrogating our ministers as to the policy on the Hudson bay question, the Americans from St. Paul were steaming down to Fort Garry. It is not the first time that we have received a lesson in enterprise from our republican neighbors; to be our leaders on our own soil, though creditable to them, is not, in this case, particularly creditable to us.\"\n2. \"The Red River, let me observe, is no inhospitable desert, repugnant to the increase of the human race.\"\n\n3. \"In the valleys of the Saskatchewan and Assiniboia, Professor Hind estimates that there are above 11,000,000 acres of arable land of the finest quality.\"\n\n4. \"If justice were even now done, it would become the Illinois or Iowa of our future British American nationality.\"\n\n5. \"And this country is not only valuable in itself, but valuable for that to which it leads. The distance from a given point on our side of Lake Superior to navigable water on Frazer river, in British Columbia, does not exceed 2,000 miles\u2014about twice the distance between Boston and Chicago. It has been shown by every explorer how, with some inconsiderable aids from art, a continuous steamboat navigation might be obtained from Lake Winnipeg to the base of the Rocky mountains. By these aids and corresponding improvements on the other side of the mountains, Toronto might be brought within ten or twelve days of British Columbia.\"\n\n6. \"But there is a more important consideration still, connected with the territory; for we know that through its prairies is to be found the shortest and best railroad route to the Pacific. Every one can understand that the American route from western Europe to Asia, which lies furthest to the north, must be the most direct. Any one, glancing at a globe, will see where the 46th parallel leads the eye from the heart of Germany, through the British channel, across the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and from our gulf westward to the Saskatchewan, to Vancouver island\u2014the Cuba of the North Pacific; and from Vancouver to the rich and populous archipelago of Japan. This course was demonstrated by Captain Syngte to be 2,000 miles shorter between London and Hong Kong than any other in existence. It has but one formidable engineering difficulty to be overcome\u2014an elevation of 6,000 feet above the sea-level\u2014in crossing the Rocky mountains into British Columbia.\"\n\nEXHIBIT C b.\n\nB.\u2014Compendium of the revenue laws of the district of Assiniboia, passed March 14, 1861.\n\nI. \"Article I. That all goods imported into the district of Assiniboia, from all parts of the British dominions, or from any foreign country, shall be subject to a levy of four per cent. ad valorem duty, to be estimated at the price current of the original place of export, London, or New York, &c., excepting such articles as shall be otherwise specified. The following shall be admitted free from customs duty.\"\n\n1. Then follows a list of thirteen articles.\u2014(C b.)\n\nII. By article IV. parties transporting merchandise beyond the district of Assiniboia, (which is limited to the valleys of the Red River of the North, and its principal tributary, the Assiniboia,) are exempted from the payment of duties on the execution of a transportation bond. \"This provision embraces the American outfits for the fur trade of the Saskatchewan region, which is already attracting considerable attention.\"\u2014(C b, 4.)\n\nIII. \"Article VI. That a duty of 5s. per gallon be imposed upon all fermented and spirituous liquors imported into the settlement, except such as shall be proved to have been directly imported from the United Kingdom by the consignee.\"\nIV. The people dissatisfied with \"article VI.\"\n\n1. Extracts from \"Nor'wester,\" the paper published at Fort Garry, dated April 1, 1861, and April 15, 1861:\n\na. \"Observe, we do not object to this 5s. impost; we highly approve of it; but we maintain that this being done, the admission free of intoxicating beverages from England cannot be defended. It is simply a piece of favoritism\u2014an odious exhibition of selfishness on the part of the Hudson Bay Company, and a proof of the subserviency of our council to that wealthy corporation. We protest against the law as it stands, and in doing so we but speak the sentiments of the great majority of the Red River people.\"\n\nb. \"The present distinction is too marked, too wide, too decided to be defensible on any principles of honest legislation.\"\u2014(C b.)\n\nC.\n\nEXHIBIT E.\n\nA.\u2014Operation of Canadian reciprocity treaty.\n\nI. Security of northeastern fisheries, embarrassed under vague and restrictive terms of treaty of 1818\u2014placed on a satisfactory basis by reciprocity treaty.\n\nII. Importance to the northwest of free navigation of St. Lawrence, especially as to the transportation of grain to market, and the movement of iron and copper from Lake Superior.\n\nIII. Canadian exhibits of exports and imports for the year ending December 31, 1860.\n\n1. The total value of imports into Canada from the United States alone, during the above-named year, was $17,273,020, more than equalled her imports with the rest of the world. Her total importation was $34,447,935.\u2014(E.)\n\n2. The total value of Canadian produce and manufactures during 1860 was $18,427,968.\n\nIV. General remarks:\n\n1. Canadian and American tariffs; their respective changes since 1854; no ground for recrimination.\u2014(E.)\n\n2. The value and extent of the Canadian market for all forms of American industry, especially manufactures and agriculture.\u2014(E.)\n\nD.\n\nEXHIBIT Fa.\n\nA.\u2014Dissatisfaction of the Assiniboians with British inadequacy.\n\nI. Extracts from \"Nor'wester,\" the newspaper published at Selkirk settlement:\n\n1. From the \"Nor'wester,\" of October 15th:\n\n\"The progress of our republican neighbors in opening up, settling, and organizing new Territories, is something wonderful. Idaho, Nevada, Dakota, and Chippewa were heard of, for the first time, as names indicating important geographical areas of the North American continent. Just before these we had Oregon, Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and Washington. What an array of names! What amazing progress in occupying and settling a wild unpeopled country! We cannot regard with indifference the rapid march of civilization at our very doors, * * * * * while we, a large, pop-\nulous, and well-to-do community of fifty years' standing, are still in swaddling clothes, under a foster-mother's patronizing rule. Shame on the British government that this is the case! How much longer is it to continue? Are they waiting until we make short work of our destinies by voting annexation to Minnesota or Dakota? or till we take the reins of government with a rude grasp, and proclaim independence of both British and American rule?\n\n\"One or the other alternative will surely come, some day, unless a change in our governmental system takes place.\n\n\"We speak advisedly when we say that the people of Red River are becoming indifferent to British connexion.\"\n\n2. \"That we shall not always smart under our present mortification is most certain. Time and the force of circumstances will give us our coveted status; and we must, for the present, bear our humiliation with the best grace possible.\"\n\nII. The \"Nor'wester,\" in spite of this strong language, is hardly abreast of the public dissatisfaction. The party favoring annexation to the United States is numerous:\n\n1. Annexation to be advocated through the press:\n   a. A new paper to be started, which shall be \"uncompromisingly hostile to the Hudson Bay Company\" and in favor of \"annexation;\"\n   b. The people can only be quieted by speedy organization as a \"Crown Colony;\"\n   c. Unless England respond, she will surely lose the colony, either by revolution or \"annexation.\"\n\nIII. In case of a war with England, the competency of Minnesota to \"hold, occupy, and possess\" the Red River to Lake Winnipeg:\n\n1. The defenceless condition of the valley:\n   a. No British troops at Fort Garry;\n   b. Indians depredate with impunity;\n   c. The \"Nor'wester\" confesses weakness, demanding \"a change\" as \"absolutely necessary.\"\n\n2. Hardihood of the lumbermen and laborers of Minnesota.\n\n3. Facilities for military operations:\n   a. Accessibility by way of the Minnesota and Pacific railroad route\u2014commonly known as the \"Wood Road.\"\n\nB.\u2014Compendium of letter dated June 12, 1862.\u2014(Vide Exhibit Fb of Appendix.)\n\nI. Further extracts from \"Nor'wester,\" of May 28:\n   1. \"Can it be expected that we should not become Americanized, when Britain shows perfect indifference to us?\"\n   2. \"We have no postal communication with any part of the civilized world, except through the United States!\"\n   3. Importation from American States easy; from England, tardy.\n   4. \"The only decent route for immigrants through the States. Consequently, new settlers are, for the most part, Americans.\"\n   5. Vicinage to the United States promotive of disloyalty to Britain, to whom the Red Riverites now say:\n   6. \"Do something for us at once, or lose us forever.\"\n\nII. Victoria (Vancouver island) desires a reciprocity treaty with the United States.\nE.\n\nExhibit G, (May 1, 1862.)\n\n\"GEOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF NORTHWEST BRITISH AMERICA, AND ITS RELATIONS TO THE REVENUE AND COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES.\"\n\nA.\u2014Introductory letter to the Secretary of the Treasury, embodying a historical sketch of our relations with England and Russia, and the progress of opinion in England relative to colonization.\n\nI. A chronological view compiled from the above letter:\n\n1822.\u2014Russia issues a \"ukase,\" declaring the North Pacific a closed sea from 51\u00b0 (or north end of Vancouver island) to 49\u00b0, on Asiatic coast.\u2014(North latitude.)\n\n1822.\u2014United States claiming as high as 54\u00b0 40', resist the above, demanding that American whalers should not be excluded from the North Pacific.\n\n1824.\u2014Treaty between Russia and the United States, making 54\u00b0 40' the boundary, and declaring the Pacific an open sea.\n\n1825.\u2014Great Britain and Russia agree on the following boundary:\n\n\"Commencing in north latitude 54\u00b0 40', between 131\u00b0 and 133\u00b0 west longitude, at the southernmost part of Prince of Wales island; thence proceeds up Portland canal to 56\u00b0 north latitude, and from the last-mentioned point the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains, parallel to the coast, as far as the intersection of 141\u00b0 of west longitude, and then along that meridian line to the Frozen ocean.\"\n\nArticle nine states that whenever the summit of the mountains shall exceed ten marine leagues from the ocean, the line between the British possessions and the Russian line of coast shall be formed by a line parallel to the windings of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues from the same.\n\n1844.\u2014Controversy with Great Britain as to the northern boundary of Oregon.\n\n1846.\u2014Prior to this date Russia and England became jealous of each other on account of the disposition of the former to occupy California. Except for the Mexican war, European intervention would probably have appropriated the bay of San Francisco.\n\n1846.\u2014It was during this year that the opinion was expressed in the British House of Commons that the whole country north of the Columbia was not worth \u00a320,000.\n\n1848.\u2014Sir J. H. Pelly, governor of the Hudson Bay Company, thus expresses himself in a letter to Lord Grey:\n\n\"As far as I am concerned, (and I think the company will concur if any great national benefit would be expected from it,) I would be willing to relinquish the whole of the territory held under the charter under similar terms to those which it is proposed the East India Company shall receive on the expiration of their charter, viz: securing the proprietors an interest on their capital of 10 per cent.\"\n\n1849.\u2014Minnesota Territory organized.\n\n1857.\u2014The people of Canada West induce the British Parliament to institute the inquiry whether the region in question is adapted by fertility of soil, a favorable climate, and natural advantages of internal communication for the support of a prosperous colony of England.\n\n1857.\u2014July 31. The select committee of the House of Commons, appointed to consider the state of those British possessions in North America which are under the Hudson Bay Company, reported testimony, but made no decided recommendations. They \"apprehend that the districts on\nthe Red River and the Saskatchewan are among those most likely to be desired for early occupation,\" and deprecate any difficulty between the government and the company. They deemed it proper to terminate the connexion of the Hudson Bay Company with Vancouver island for the advantage of that interesting colony, which would be extended to the main land as soon as possible. British Columbia, they thought, suitable for a permanent settlement.\n\n1858.\u2014Gold discovered on Frazer river.\n1858.\u2014Puget's sound assumes new importance on account of the above and the California mines.\n1858.\u2014Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton proclaims, in the name of the government, the policy of continuous colonies from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and a highway across British America as the most direct route from London to Pekin and Jeddo.\n1858.\u2014The eastern boundary of British Columbia fixed on Rocky mountains.\n1858.\u2014Canada explores the route from Fort William, on Lake Superior, to Fort Garry, on Red River, and gives impressive summaries of the natural resources of Lake Winnipeg basin.\n1858.\u2014A report to the New York Chamber of Commerce announces that the region of Lake Winnipeg, like the valley of the Mississippi, is distinguished for the fertility of its soil, and for the extent and gentle slope of its great plains, watered by rivers of great length, and admirably adapted to steam navigation.\n\n\"It will, in all respects, compare favorably with some of the most densely peopled portions of Europe. In other words, it is admirably fitted to become the seat of a numerous, hardy, and prosperous community. It has an area equal to eight or ten first class American States. Its great river, the Saskatchewan, carries a navigable water-line to the base of the Rocky mountains. It is not at all improbable that the valley of this river may yet offer the best route for a railroad to the Pacific. The navigable waters of this great subdivision interlock with those of the Mississippi. Red River of the North, navigable (in connexion with Lake Winnipeg) for 800 miles directly north and south, is one of the best adapted for steam in the world, and waters one of the finest regions on the continent. Between its headwaters and St. Paul, Minnesota, a railroad is in process of construction, which, when completed, will open up half a million of square miles for settlement.\"\n\n1858.\u2014November 3. Lord Caernarvon \"regrets\" the conduct of the Hudson Bay Company, and insists on a \"decision\" by the judicial committee of the privy council.\n1858.\u2014Proposition to Hudson Bay Company to refer questions concerning charter and territorial limits to judicial committee of privy council\u2014made and rejected.\n1859.\u2014Canadian government demand of England prompt adjustment of the relations, &c., of the Red River and Saskatchewan districts.\n1859.\u2014Condition and prospects of English colonization in Northwest America. First steam voyage Fort Abercrombie to Fort Garry.\n1859.\u2014Minnesota received as a State.\n1859.\u2014Railroad projected to Pembina.\n1861.\u2014Commerce of Minnesota with Selkirk and the Saskatchewan doubles the preceding year.\n\n\"Cariboo district\" rapidly filling up with a mining population.\n\nThe mountain ranges, which are alike the sources of the Columbia, the Frazer, the Peace, the Athabasca, and the Saskatchewan, with an average of latitude 54\u00b0, of longitude 120\u00b0, must, inevitably, be transformed into an active scene of mining adventure.\nThis will necessitate the prompt organization and settlement of British America, that is, of the plains of the river basins converging to Lake Winnipeg, and closely connected with our northwestern States.\n\nContents 400,000 square miles.\n\nE.\n\nExhibit G, G1.

Wheat, often, however, destroyed by frosts.\n   c. Saskatchewan, swift in current, navigable for boats for 700 miles in a direct line, but, by the actual course of the stream, nearly double that distance.

They produce 76 ounces of gold dust, all of which was found on the west side of the mountains; but they also assert that in many places on the Saskatchewan, between Fort Edmonton and the Rocky Mountain House, they successfully prospected for gold, \"raising the color\" frequently, but with no return exceeding one cent to the pan, or five dollars a day. Such were the indications, however, that, with their experience on the Pacific, even this moderate result encourages Messrs. McLaurin and Love to return with a year's supply of provisions, having left two companies on the upper Saskatchewan. They express confidence that an extensive auriferous region exists east of the Rocky mountains, between 49\u00b0 and 55\u00b0 north latitude.

P. Chase,\nSecretary of the Treasury.\n\nJames W. Taylor, Esq.,\nSpecial Agent, &c., Washington, D. C.\n\nExhibit C a.\n\nSaint Paul, July 10, 1861.\n\nSir: By a communication from the Treasury Department, dated March 8, 1861, I was instructed to proceed with a report previously undertaken upon the relations of trade and revenue between the United States and the districts of Central British America, extending from Canada to the Rocky mountains, and to communicate to the department the period required for making said report.\n\nHaving occasion, in the general discharge of the duties assigned to me, to forward an abstract of recent revenue laws at Selkirk, on the Red river, I beg leave to inform the department that I expect to present my general report on or before the first day of the regular session of Congress.\n\nIn preparing this paper, I desire the privilege of recapitulating some of the contents of special reports made by me from time to time, but which are more adapted for the information of the department than for publication.\n\nHaving reason to believe that what is known to the English and Canadian people as the \"Red River and Saskatchewan districts of British America\" will be speedily organized, with the powerful co-operation of the Hudson Bay Company, as a crown colony of England, and that active measures for its colonization in the interest of a continental confederation of the provinces, and a railroad...\nfrom Lake Superior to the Pacific, north of our boundary, will promptly follow. I am solicitous to present to the American government and people a full and satisfactory compilation of the natural resources, present civil and commercial organizations, and future relations of the interesting region in question, with which circumstances have made me familiar. In this connexion, I shall urge that no unnecessary restrictions shall be imposed upon the intercourse, already very considerable in extent, between the States of the northwest and this rising dominion of England upon the waters of Lake Winnipeg.\n\nThus animated, I am now occupied with what will prove, if published, a document of 300 pages, and which I shall submit to the department at the earliest possible moment. It will constitute the report above referred to. I desire to return my acknowledgments to the head of the Treasury Department for the opportunity of preparing and presenting it for his consideration.\n\nIn conclusion, as some confirmation of the views often advanced by me within the last five years, and which will be elaborate in my forthcoming report, I here present an extract from a late publication of Mr. Darcy McGee, the accomplished member of the Canadian parliament from Montreal, who may soon (judging from late elections) succeed to a seat in the Canadian ministry. Mr. McGee says:\n\n\"I have always felt an active, living interest in everything that concerns what is usually called among us 'the Red River country.' In the very heart of the continent, on a territory 500,000 square miles in extent, where Lord Selkirk, half a century ago, declared there was field enough for a population of 30,000,000 souls, the only speck of settlement is some 7,000 or 8,000 of our fellow-subjects in and about Fort Garry. No American community has ever undergone a sterner apprenticeship to fortune, or been so unwisely underrated by imperial and Canadian statesmen. The greater part, if not all that region was an integral part of Canada at the conquest, and to Canada the people of the Selkirk settlement most naturally looked for protection against the monopolizing policy of the Hudson Bay Company. It is not creditable to us to be forced to admit that hitherto they have looked this way in vain. No Canadian can have read with satisfaction the latest intelligence from that kindred community; no Canadian can learn with satisfaction that it was left for the infant State of Minnesota, with a census not exceeding altogether this little island of Montreal, to do for them what they naturally expected from us; that while we were interrogating our ministers as to their policy on the Hudson Bay question the Americans from St. Paul were steaming down to Fort Garry. It is not the first time that we have received a lesson in enterprise from our republican neighbors. To be our leaders on our own soil, though creditable to them, is surely not in this case particularly honorable to us.\n\n\"That Red River country, let me observe, is no inhospitable desert, repugnant to the increase of the human race. Modern science has exploded the ancient error that climate is determined by the latitude. The best authority on the climatology of our continent (Mr. Lorin Blodgett) has pointed out the existence of a vast wedge-shaped tract, extending from the 47\u00b0 to the 60\u00b0 of northern latitude, 10\u00b0 of longitude deep at the base, containing 500,000 square miles of habitable land, subject to few and inconsiderable variations of climate. This author gives a summer of ninety-five days to Toronto, and of ninety days to Cumberland House, in 54\u00b0 north. Mr. Simon Dawson, from personal observation, compares the climate of Fort Garry to that of Kingston. Professor Hind places its annual mean temperature at 8\u00b0 lower than that of Toronto, for though the fall of rain is 17 inches more, the fall of snow is 33 inches less, than at Toronto. Herds of buffalo winter in the woodland as far north as the 60\u00b0 parallel; Indian corn grows on both banks of the Saskatchewan; wheat sown in the valley of the Red River early in May is gathered in by the end of August. The altitude and aspect of the country nourish in it a temperature which one would not ex-\npect to find so far northward. Blodgett asserts that spring opens almost simultaneously along the vast plains from St. Paul to the Mackenzie river; and assuredly where cattle can winter out, where the rivers are generally free of ice by the first week of May, where wheat can be grown 'twenty years in succession without exhausting the soil,' there must be something woefully wrong in the system of rule when, after fifty years of settlement, we find a total population of less than 10,000 souls! The lake and river system of that region are almost as wonderful as our own. Lake Winnipeg has an area equal to Erie, and Lake Manitobah nearly half that of Winnipeg. In the valleys of the Saskatchewan and Assiniboin Professor Hind estimates that there are above 11,000,000 acres 'of arable land of the first quality.' Of this region about one-half is prairie to one-half woodland; it is the only extensive prairie country open to us east of the Rocky mountains, and if justice was even now done it, it would become the Illinois or Iowa of our future British-American nationality.\n\n\"And this country is not only valuable in itself, but valuable for that to which it leads. The distance from a given point on our side of Lake Superior to navigable water on Frazer river, in British Columbia, does not exceed 2,000 miles, about twice the distance between Boston and Chicago. It has been shown by every explorer how, with some inconsiderable aids from art, a continuous steamboat navigation might be obtained from Lake Winnipeg to the base of the Rocky mountains. By these aids, and corresponding improvements on the other side of the mountains, Toronto might be brought within ten or twelve days of British Columbia. But there is a more important consideration still connected with the territory, for we now know that through its prairies is to be found the shortest and best railroad route to the Pacific. Every one can understand that the American route from western Europe to Asia, which lies farthest to the north, must be the most direct. Any one glancing at a globe will see where the 46\u00b0 parallel leads the eye, from the heart of Germany, through the British channel, across to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and from our Gulf westward to the Saskatchewan, to Vancouver's island, the Cuba of the North Pacific, and from Vancouver to the rich and populous archipelago of Japan. This course was demonstrated by Captain Synge to be 2,000 miles shorter between London and Hong Kong than any other in existence; it has but one formidable engineering difficulty to be overcome\u2014an elevation of 6,000 feet above the sea level\u2014in crossing the Rocky mountains into British Columbia. Such, at least, is the carefully guarded statement of Mr. Stevens, the late American governor of Washington Territory, and such is said to be the result arrived at by Captain Palliser's more recent explorations. By a short tunnel at the favorable pass the elevation may be reduced to 5,000 feet, 'whose gradients,' it has been calculated, 'need not exceed sixty feet per mile from the head of Lake Superior to Puget's sound.' An elevation of 5,000 feet is not an insuperable obstacle, as has been shown at Mount Cenis and the Alleghanies. (On the Philadelphia and Pittsburg road, at Altoona, the gradient of 96 feet to the mile has been found practicable.) The name 'Rocky mountains' is more formidable to the ear than to the engineer; as the latitude has misled us with regard to climate, so the altitude has been overrated with regard to cost; but the science of this age once entered upon any experiment, will neither be deterred by regions represented as uninhabitable nor by mountains reputed to be impassable.\"\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJAMES W. TAYLOR.\n\nHon. S. P. Chase,\nSecretary of the Treasury.\nExhibit C b.\n\nSaint Paul, July 10, 1861.\n\nSir: I enclose (appended and marked A) an authentic copy of \"An act passed by the governor and council of Assiniboia March 14, 1861,\" prescribing a tariff and revenue regulations for the Red River district of Central British America.\n\nIts leading features are as follows:\n\n1. A levy of four per cent. ad valorem duty upon all importations, whether from England, the United States, or elsewhere, \"estimated at the price current of the original place of export, London, New York, &c.\" Goods introduced from Chicago or Saint Paul, it is presumed, would be charged only at New York cost.\n\n2. Section one enumerates a liberal free list consisting of thirteen items.\n\n3. By section six \"a duty of five shillings sterling per gallon is imposed upon all fermented and spirituous liquors imported into the Red River settlements, except such as shall be proved to have been directly imported from the United Kingdom by the consignee.\"\n\n4. By section four, parties transporting merchandise beyond the district of Assiniboia (which is limited to the valleys of the Red River of the North and its principal tributary, the Assiniboia,) are exempted from the payment of duties on the execution of a transportation bond. This provision embraces the American outfits for the fur trade of the Saskatchewan region, which is already attracting considerable attention.\n\nThe regulations for the collection of the revenue are ample, but do not require recapitulation.\n\nThis system of revenue is now in force. It is generally satisfactory to all parties interested, except the discrimination in favor of English liquors. I append, marked B, some forcible criticism in this respect by the Nor'wester newspaper, published at Fort Garry, the centre of the Red River settlement.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJames W. Taylor\n\nHon. S. P. Chase,\nSecretary of the Treasury.\n\nA.\n\nRevenue laws passed by the governor and council of Assiniboia on the 14th March, 1861.\n\nTo secure the more efficient and equitable collection of the revenue, it is\u2014\n\nResolved, I. That all goods imported into the district of Assiniboia, from any part of the British dominions, or from any foreign country, shall be subject to a levy of four per cent. ad valorem duty, to be estimated at the price current of the original place of export, London or New York, &c., excepting such articles as shall be otherwise specified. The following shall be admitted free from customs duty, viz:\n\n1. All iron and steel, cast or malleable, wrought or unwrought.\n2. All books and publications, whether imported for use or merchandise.\n3. All scientific instruments and mechanical tools.\n4. All agricultural machines and implements.\n5. All baggage, all apparel and utensils that have been or are in present use of the owners.\n6. All seeds, roots, or plants, tending to the improvement of agriculture.\n7. All stationery and school slates.\n8. All unopened packages of goods originally destined for parts not within the district of Assiniboia.\n9. All cases, boxes, barrels, bottles, or cloth covering, which contain goods or fluids of any description.\n10. Monumental tablets or tombstones.\n11. All grindstones.\n12. All skins, peltries, parchment, untanned leather, and all produce of the chase generally.\n13. All goods gratuitously given, and originally designed for the benefit of the Indian missions of Rupert's Land.\n\nII. There shall be four collectors of customs, residing severally at each extreme and middle of the settlement and at White Horse Plains, whose residences shall be houses of clearance. A collector of customs shall have power to administer oaths, to search for and seize contraband goods, and to prosecute defaulters; he shall have power to call constables and all loyal subjects of her Britannic Majesty to his aid, and all persons, not constables, so called upon, shall be paid by the collector, at the public expense, as special constables extraordinary, say, ten shillings per diem. A collector of customs shall have power to exact and receive payments of customs duty and to give receipts in discharge of the same. He shall, twice in every month, pay into the hands of the governor, who is ex-officio receiver general, all revenues received by him, together with a list of the persons paying, and the value of the goods on which the duty has been paid. That each collector shall, once every week, transmit to the next clearance house a list of all clearances made by him. Each collector shall have an annual salary of forty pounds sterling, besides being entitled to one-fifth part of the proceeds of all seizures he shall make or cause to be made.\n\nIII. Every person bringing goods liable to duty into the district of Assiniboia, whether owner, agent, or conductor, shall be provided with an invoice or manifest, which shall combine, with the name of the consignee, an accurate account of the quantity and prime cost of all goods contained in any carriage, vehicle, or vessel, or any conveyance whatsoever, whether by land or water. This invoice or manifest shall be attested by the signature of the owner or his representative, and on arrival within the settlement it shall be produced to the collector, who may verify its accuracy by an oath administered to the party, or by examination of the goods, opening packages if necessary. On being therewith satisfied he shall exact payment of the duty, or, at his discretion, accept a bond payable for the amount within a period of not more than three months\u2014which bond may be sued for and recovered the same as any other contract debt.\n\nThe collector, on receiving satisfaction for the duty as above defined, shall write on the back of the manifest the words \"Examined and passed,\" attaching his signature and the date thereof, and this shall be held as a sufficient clearance.\n\nBe it observed that in any case where the want of a manifest is or has been unavoidable, the collector may accept of the sworn declaration of the party as to the value of the goods, or otherwise satisfy himself of their value.\n\nIV. Every owner or importer or consignee of goods shall, within twenty-four hours of the arrival of such goods, exhibit his manifest (if not already cleared) to the collectors of customs, and any owner, importer, or consignee of goods failing to do so, shall, in addition to the duty, forfeit a sum of not more than fifty pounds sterling, or less, at the discretion of the court, which penalty may be sued for and recovered in the same manner as a contract debt; and any\npackage or goods in bulk not entered into any manifest shall be seized as contraband and forfeited to the Queen, or to the governor and council acting in her name; and in the event of any person refusing to show his invoice or manifest, or refusing to pay the duty or to give a bond for the payment of the same, the collector shall be authorized to seize all his goods as contraband.\n\nAny person making a false declaration under an oath administered by a collector may be indicted for wilful perjury.\n\nPersons claiming exemption from duty because of their goods being destined for parts beyond the circle of Assiniboia shall give a bond not to dispose of any such goods, nor open them, or allow them to pass from their possession within the district, under penalty of half the amount of their invoice, which bond shall be recoverable in the same manner as a contract debt.\n\nPersons leaving the settlement with goods under a bond shall call on the last collector of customs on their route, for the purpose of having the said bond cancelled.\n\nV. All goods liable for duty shall be held as contraband if, under the following circumstances, they are unprotected by a clearance:\n\n1. If they have been within the premises of the proprietor or consignee for more than forty-eight hours.\n\n2. If they have been opened or any way disposed of, or otherwise have passed from the original importer or consignee.\n\n3. If not being liable for duty because of their original destination being beyond the bounds of this district, they shall have been opened or disposed of, or any way have passed from the possession of the original importer or consignee within the bounds of the district, all such goods, unless otherwise provided for, shall be forfeited to the Queen by the governor and council acting in her name.\n\nAll goods so seized shall be deposited in the court-house, and afterwards, at authorized times, be sold by public auction for the benefit of the revenue, saving expenses and the rights of the collectors.\n\nVI. That a duty of five shillings per gallon be imposed upon all fermented and spirituous liquors imported into the settlement, except such as shall be proved to have been directly imported from the United Kingdom by the consignee.\n\nThe above laws for regulating the collection of customs shall be in force from and after the first day of April next ensuing.\n\nW. MACTAVISH, Governor.\n\nB.\n\n[From the Nor'wester, (Fort Garry,) April 1, 1861.]\n\nTHE NEW LAWS.\n\nA great portion of our present issue is occupied with the doings of council. We invite attention to the report of their proceedings generally, but to the revenue and liquor laws in particular. The Red River people have now the result of half a year's deliberations\u2014for that is the interval since the matters now decided were first mooted in council\u2014and they have it, too, in a very acceptable form, namely, printed. No manuscript copies, this time, to perplex anxious readers; the new laws are printed, as should always be the case, and they will be widely circulated through the settlement, in pamphlet form and through the medium of the Nor'wester. Extensive publicity is very important, and the council will receive due credit for discarding the absurd old system of giving a copy of their resolutions to each magistrate, and to nobody else. Under such a system not half the people knew what laws were passed by the\ncouncil, or if ultimately hearsay came to their assistance, it would be so long after that, for aught they knew, the laws might have been amended or repealed. Whatever, therefore, may be the merits or demerits of the laws per se, let the councillors receive credit for making them known throughout the length and breadth of the colony.\n\nHereafter we shall fully analyze these laws and discuss their merits; at present we must confine ourselves to what we consider a very objectionable clause in the revenue series, No. 6, which imposes 5s. on every gallon of liquor imported from the States, but admits free all liquor from England. The injustice of this distinction will excite a general feeling of indignation, because it bears on its face evidence of that secret but all-powerful influence of the Hudson Bay Company over the Red River council.\n\nIn favoring importations from the mother country we are but complying with long-established usage and with the dictates of patriotism; but this is no sufficient reason for such a wholesale, such a sweeping, distinction as the council has made in regard to liquor. To believe that patriotism prompted them to take the course they did would require too much faith, at the expense of reason and common sense. As a whole, the council does not care a sixpence either for the manufacturing interests or export trade of Great Britain, and, we presume, did not spend a thought about them when framing this measure. Let us suppose that they made the distinction on the ground just indicated, namely, that the liquor is British. We ask, then, why not tax all American goods higher than English? Why limit the heavy duty to liquor? Logic and consistency alike demand that the principle be carried out; but what is the fact? Dry goods, groceries, and hardware come in upon the same footing from both countries\u2014that is, by paying four per cent. ad valorem duty.\n\nOn the other hand, if the majority that voted to levy this heavy impost on American liquor did so on the ground that it injured the best interests of the community, we say again that the same reason called for a check on spirits imported from any quarter whatsoever. The conclusion must follow, if you grant the premises.\n\nObserve, we do not object to this 5s. impost; we highly approve of it; but we maintain that this being done, the admission free of intoxicating beverages from England cannot be defended. It is simply a piece of favoritism\u2014an odious exhibition of selfishness and self-interest on the part of the Hudson Bay Company, and a proof of the subserviency of our council to that wealthy corporation. We protest against the law as it stands, and in doing so we but speak the sentiments of the great majority of the Red River people.\n\n[From the Nor'wester, April 15]\n\nRED RIVER COUNCIL.\n\nThe public have now had time to examine and consider the recent enactments of council, and we believe they will agree with us in thinking that, on the whole, they are the most thorough and comprehensive passed for many a day. The councillors are, fortunately, roused to the conviction that matters are in an unsatisfactory condition, and, bowing to the pressure of a stern public opinion, they have diligently set themselves to allay dissatisfaction by making timely concessions. This is so far creditable for a non-elective, irresponsible council.\n\nThe new tariff is, to a small extent, discriminating; so far, namely, as to exempt a variety of articles from all duty whatsoever. This is a decided improvement, and we approve of it in a twofold sense\u2014approve of the principle of exemption in itself, and of the actual exemptions made. In other words, the council, in our opinion, have done wisely in resolving to admit certain articles\nduty free, and have made a judicious selection of the articles to be so admitted. We would like to have seen this new system extended so as to distinguish between various classes of goods; but as it requires time and care to do this well, we must, meanwhile, be satisfied with the instalment given us. A correspondent points out section 8 of the first resolution as being as objectionable as the clause against which we protested in our last number. He is quite mistaken. The company cannot be expected to pay duty on goods intended for the interior, if such goods be duly bonded through, and not opened or disposed of within the jurisdiction of our council. This privilege is everywhere conceded; and although the section referred to was evidently framed for the company's benefit, there is no injustice in it. Very different, however, is their imposing 5s. per gallon on liquor from all foreign countries, while admitting it comparatively free from England. This is an inexcusable piece of favoritism, against which we, as impartial journalists, must protest. We by no means desire the 5s. impost to be diminished or cancelled, but we do desire to have something imposed on British liquors. The present distinction is too marked, too wide, too decided, to be defensible on any principles of honest legislation.\n\nEXHIBIT D.\n\nSAINT PAUL, July 17, 1861.\n\nSir: The newspapers at Saint Paul contain statements of the discovery of gold on the north branch of the Saskatchewan river.\n\nThese rumors originate as follows: D. F. McLaurin, formerly a citizen of Minnesota, and known to be a man of veracity, and T. M. Love, lately in the employment of Mr. Campbell, the American commissioner for the survey and location of the northern boundary, have arrived in Saint Paul from the headwaters of the Frazer river, in British Columbia. They produce seventy-six ounces of gold dust, all of which was found on the west side of the mountains; but they also assert that in many places on the Saskatchewan, between Fort Edmonton and the Rocky Mountain House, they successfully \"prospected\" for gold, \"raising the color\" frequently, but with no return exceeding one cent to the pan, or five dollars a day. Such were the indications, however, that with their experience on the Pacific, even this moderate result encourages Messrs. McLaurin and Love to return with a year's supply of provisions, having left two companies on the upper Saskatchewan. They express confidence that an extensive auriferous region exists east of the Rocky mountains, between latitudes 49 degrees and 55 degrees. If so, its occupation by adventurers will be hastened by the following circumstances hitherto indicated by me in former communications, and which I propose to more fully illustrate in my general report to the department.\n\n1. The eastern base of the mountains, including the sources of the two branches of the Saskatchewan, is well adapted to agriculture\u2014far more so than the eastern Piedmont in American territory.\n\n2. The climate at Edmonton is milder in winter than at Saint Paul. The Saskatchewan is clear of ice in the spring as soon as the Mississippi river between St. Anthony Falls and Galena.\n\n3. Steamboat navigation, now established on the Red River of the North, can readily be extended through Lake Winnipeg and up the Saskatchewan river to Fort Edmonton, the supposed eastern limit of the new gold district. I have collected and will present ample evidence that the Grand Rapids (so-called) of the Saskatchewan is no obstacle to navigation.\n\n4. Full half of the population at Selkirk settlement\u2014farmers, voyageurs,\nhunters\u2014will promptly remove to the mountain districts. A late inundation at Red River, producing discouragement in their present homes, will stimulate such an exodus. The Minnesota frontier will send a considerable re-enforcement. Meagre as the present information from the upper Saskatchewan is, so much can be predicted with certainty.\n\nI anticipate, also, if further explorations shall attract the attention of the world to the sources of the Saskatchewan and Athabasca in the same degree as in 1858 to Frazer river, that the scale will be decisively turned in favor of the following measures, which are even now prominent at London:\n\n1. An act of Parliament, organizing a crown colony northwest of Minnesota with an inhabitable area of 300,000 square miles.\n2. An union of all the American provinces of England, having for a prominent object a common highway from ocean to ocean on British territory.\n3. An overland mail, to be speedily followed by colonization adequate to the achievement and support of a continental railroad.\n\nThese measures do not require for their consummation a gold excitement; they are in the natural and inevitable course of events; but a sudden transit of thousands of people to the region in question, however stimulated, would greatly hasten their accomplishment.\n\nOne thing is very apparent: Unless the English government shall promptly respond to the manifest destiny of the great interior of British America\u2014the basin of Lake Winnipeg\u2014the speedy Americanization of that fertile district is inevitable. The indispensable requisites to the integrity of British dominion on this continent are such action in behalf of the Saskatchewan and Red River districts as the Frazer river excitement secured for the area fronting on the north Pacific three years since.\n\nThe revenue interests of the United States will be the first to be affected by so important a change in the situation and relations of Central British America. I shall endeavor to keep the Treasury Department fully advised of all that may transpire.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJAMES W. TAYLOR.\n\nHon. S. P. Chase,\nSecretary of the Treasury.\n\nEXHIBIT E.\n\nSAINT PAUL, November 8, 1861.\n\nSir: On the 2d of May, 1860, I communicated to the Treasury Department some statistics and observations upon the practical operation of the treaty with Great Britain of June 5, 1854, commonly known as the reciprocity treaty.\n\nAs a supplement thereto I desire to submit some further statistics, with the same object, with a few preliminary observations.\n\nI am in no situation to estimate the commercial value of the stipulation contained in the first article of the treaty by which we secured the right of fishing on the coast of the British North American provinces, with advantages equal to those enjoyed by British subjects. It is an historical fact, however, that under the convention of 1818 we were in constant danger of collision with England, and our fishing interests were greatly embarrassed.\n\nThe leading provision of the reciprocity treaty certainly placed our northeastern fisheries in as favorable a situation as could be asked\u2014exceeding even the liberal stipulations at the peace of 1783.\n\nIn behalf of the northwestern grain districts it will be pertinent to refer to events now transpiring as evidence of the great practical value of article four of\nthe treaty of 1854, which secures to the citizens and inhabitants of the United States the freedom of navigation on the river St. Lawrence and the canals of Canada, while we yield to British subjects the same right upon Lake Michigan. With the Mississippi interrupted by insurrection, the Baltimore and Ohio railroad in a large degree unavailable, the Pennsylvania Central railroad almost exclusively chartered by government, the northwest finds the value of its great staple depreciated by excessive freights; and it is highly probable that vessels of 1,000 tons burden will be introduced upon the great lakes and the lower St. Lawrence, transshipping through the Canadian canals in craft equal to their capacity, and thus more directly communicate with Europe. Only with the aid of such agencies of transportation by sea, inland and ocean, can the cultivation of wheat be advantageously pushed into the vast areas of the northwest, which nature has adapted by soil and climate for the production of that important staple. We earnestly represent the injustice to this section, besides the general inutility of relinquishing the largest liberty of the St. Lawrence at this critical juncture.\n\nIndeed, the time has come, hastened by the wonderful harvests of 1860 and 1861 and the scarcity of Europe, which seems likely to become chronic, when the language of John A. Dix in 1849 will be justified. \"I have no hesitation,\" said he, \"in predicting that vessels will be laden with wheat at Chicago, Green Bay, Detroit, and Cleveland, and unloaded at Liverpool. Ship-owners, producers, all will be greatly benefited by this free commerce, which will have an advantage in avoiding transshipment between the point of embarkation and the sea or the foreign market.\"\n\nThe mineral wealth of Lake Superior, particularly its south or American shore, is forced upon our attention in this connexion. The last two years have witnessed a production of iron and copper which, with the freedom of the St. Lawrence for the transportation of the ores, or articles manufactured from them, may prove of immense national importance. The rapid progress of these mines is not generally appreciated. A new and extraordinary impulse to the commerce of the northwest will be thence derived, which will, however, greatly depend on the freedom of the whole channel of the river St. Lawrence.\n\nIt is possible that except for the advantages secured to the citizens of the United States in respect to the eastern fisheries and western transportation to the markets of the world, the third article of the treaty would not have been proposed by the President or ratified by the Senate of the United States. That article admits the products enumerated in a schedule annexed, being the growth and produce of the British colonies and the United States, respectively, free of duty. It is alleged that the operation of this clause is more advantageous to the Canadians than to the citizens of the adjacent States. Even if so, no argument is afforded against the treaty as a whole. It was probably intended and expected that it would be so. The removal of all restrictions previously existing upon our fisheries on the Newfoundland banks and the adjacent shores, and upon the egress from the American lakes to the ocean, were distinctly regarded by the contracting parties as a consideration for some advantage to the colonists in the reciprocal exchanges authorized by the third article.\n\nBut I fail to appreciate the correctness of the assertion that the mutual commerce under the treaty has been more advantageous to the British provinces than to the American States. From the following table, published in the United States Treasury Report on the Finances for 1860, the experience of the last nine years, two prior and seven subsequent to the date of the treaty, suggest an opposite conclusion.\nStatement exhibiting the exports to and the imports from Canada, and other British possessions in North America, from July 1, 1851, to June 30, 1860.\n\n| Years ending | Exports | Imports |\n|--------------|---------|---------|\n| June 30, 1852 | $10,509,016 | $6,110,299 |\n| 1853         | 13,140,642 | 7,550,718 |\n| 1854         | 24,566,860 | 8,927,560 |\n| 1855         | 27,806,020 | 15,136,734 |\n| 1856         | 29,029,349 | 21,310,421 |\n| 1857         | 24,262,482 | 22,124,296 |\n| 1858         | 23,651,727 | 13,806,519 |\n| 1859         | 28,154,174 | 19,727,551 |\n| 1860         | 14,183,114 | 18,861,673 |\n| Total        | 195,303,984 | 135,555,671 |\n\nIt also appears, by the official statement of the Register's office, (page 433, Report on Finances,) that $140,393,956 of the exports from the United States have been the growth or manufacture of the United States.

permanent wealth of the United States.\n\nUpon the topic of the practical operation of the third article of the treaty, I beg leave to present the following abstracts, compiled from \"Tables of the

practical observations upon the foregoing tables.\n\n1. I anticipate no further complaint upon the relative rates of the Canadian and American tariffs. If, in 1857, the American legislature sensibly reduced\nthe tariff, it was found expedient, in 1861, materially to advance the duties. In this we followed the Canadian example of 1858-9. In neither case exists any just ground of complaint. The interests of revenue were exclusively consulted by both governments.\n\n2. It will be seen, from the table of Canadian importations from the United States, that articles valued at $8,532,535 paid Canadian duties, and consisted for the most part of American manufactures. Including a nearly equal amount of articles admitted free under the reciprocity treaty, they comprise a trade which benefits almost every possible form of American industry.\n\n3. The above is an enumeration of our commercial relations with the United Canadian provinces. I refer to the United States treasury report upon commerce and navigation for the year ending June 30, 1860, for similar statistics in respect to other British possessions in North America, of which only Newfoundland, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia are included within the provisions of the reciprocity treaty.\n\n4. With the permission of the department I shall reserve for another communication the subject of our commercial relations with the territory northwest of Minnesota, now occupied by the Hudson Bay Company, and with British Columbia. These rest on a basis so distinct from the trade and intercourse of the lake and Atlantic coasts as to suggest a separate discussion.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJAMES W. TAYLOR.\n\nHon. S. P. Chase,\nSecretary of the Treasury.\n\nEXHIBIT F a.\n\nSt. Paul, December 17, 1861.\n\nSir: I beg your attention to the following extracts from the \"Nor'wester,\" the newspaper printed at Selkirk settlement. The italics are those of the Toronto Globe.\n\n[From the Nor'wester of October 15.]\n\n\"The progress of our republican neighbors in opening up, settling, and organizing new territories is something wonderful. Idaho, Nevada, Dakota, and Chippewa, were heard of for the first time as names indicating important geographical areas of the North American continent. Just before these we had Oregon, Kansas, Nebraska, Utah, and Washington. What an array of names! What amazing progress in occupying and settling a wild unpeopled country! We cannot regard with indifference this rapid march of civilization at our very doors. The boundary lines of Minnesota and Dakota sweep past us at the short distance of but 60 or 70 miles, and the progress of settlement in those regions must to a great extent affect us here. The first Dakota elections came off yesterday fortnight, and our neighboring communities, Pembina and St. Joseph, have taken their part in them. Messrs. J. McFetridge and Hugh S. Donaldson\u2014both well known here\u2014have been candidates. The former ran for the upper house and the latter for the house of representatives. Mr. Donaldson has been elected without opposition. Mr. McFetridge is not certain of his election, as his council district includes some portions of southern Dakota, where he will get no votes at all. The total number of votes polled at Pembina and St. Joseph was 186. We congratulate our friend Mr. Donaldson on his election, and we hope we may be able to do the same to Mr. McFetridge. We have said that Pembina and St. Joseph have, for the first time, cast their votes. Auspicious era for them! Lucky they truly are to be thus early enfranchised, when\nwe, a large, populous, and well-to-do community of 50 years standing, are still in swaddling-clothes, under a fostermother's patronising rule! Shame on the British government that this is the case! How much longer is it to continue? Are they waiting till we make short work of our destinies by voting annexation to Minnesota or Dakota, or till we take the reins of government with a rude grasp and proclaim independence of both American and British rule? One or other alternative will assuredly come some day, unless a change in our governmental system take place; but why tempt such a result by delay and indifference? Why alienate this important community and jeopardize Central British America, by making us such nonentities as we are at present? We speak advisedly when we say that the people of Red River are becoming indifferent to British connexion. They care very little for it; they would bear a severance without much regret. And can they be reasonably blamed for this questionable loyalty? Has anything been done by the mother country to retain, strengthen, and foster allegiance to the British crown? Nothing\u2014literally nothing. But more of this by and by.\"\n\nAgain:\n\n[From the Nor'wester of November 15]\n\n\"Assiniboia.\n\n\"We have not, as yet, the honor of ranking ourselves among the 'Colonies,' technically so called, of Great Britain. In the strict and literal sense of the term, we are; but this affords poor consolation to our pride and our ambition, when we remember the important distinction existing between the literal or etymological sense in which we are a colony, and the conventional, technical sense in which we are not. We are upon British territory; our population consists of British-born subjects and their descendants; this place or district was first colonized by immigrants from the old country. These facts warrant our denominating ourselves a colony of the British empire. But there is an emptiness in the appellation which jars unpleasantly with our self-importance. In conversing or corresponding with foreigners, we assume the name with self-complacency or pretended satisfaction; but when we reflect upon the hard facts of our actual condition, position or status, our forced pleasure at once gives place to a feeling of mortification. The sense in which we are not a colony of Great Britain, and in which we desire and ought to be, is this: that we have no official recognition at the colonial office; that our governor does not hold a commission directly from her Majesty, and that 'Assiniboia' does not figure in the same list as Barbadoes, New Brunswick, Queensland, Cape of Good Hope, British Guiana, and Canada. This is our grievance and our mortification. Not being recognized at Downing street\u2014our governor having nothing to do with the secretary of state for the colonies\u2014we are nothing, nowhere, of no consequence. Canada, Nova Scotia, and even such an upstart as British Columbia, repudiate relationship with us; the colonies deny us the honor of their society; being themselves sisters of equal standing, they set us down as a stranger or pretender, and question our legitimacy.\n\n\"That we shall not always smart under our present mortification is very certain. Time and the force of circumstances will give us our coveted status, and we must, for the present, bear our humiliation with the best grace possible. When the change does come, and we have reason to think it not far, important questions will at once arise regarding the form of our government, the nature of land tenure, administration of justice, interests of education, public revenue, &c., &c. It is needless as yet to speculate and theorize on any of these topics. Important as they are even now, they will at once become tenfold more so under a change, and they will receive what they deserve, a full and earnest discussion.\"\nThe writer then proceeds to discuss the name of the future colony, expressing a preference for \"Assiniboia.\"\n\nAnd yet, notwithstanding this decisive language, the Nor'wester is hardly abreast of the public dissatisfaction. The party which favors annexation to the United States is so numerous, especially among the French population, as to suggest the scheme of a rival newspaper, as will appear from the following paragraph in the Nor'wester of October 15, also copied into the Toronto Globe:\n\n\"ANNEXATION TO BE ADVOCATED THROUGH THE PRESS.\n\n\"The Nor'wester says: 'The last mail brought us a prospectus from Minnesota of a new journal to be published in this settlement. The projectors are Ohio men, and have only recently arrived in Minnesota. It is their intention to come this fall, if possible, but if not, assuredly next spring. The projectors are Catholics, but say that they will deal fairly with Protestants of every denomination, their paper being purely secular. The leading principles of this journal (which, by the way, is to be $3 a year) are said to be \"determined, uncompromising hostility to the Hudson Bay Company,\" and \"the annexation of the Red River country to the United States.\" Of these two planks in their platform we must say that we have uniformly refused to adopt the former or its opposite, though urged thereto by many here and abroad, and we have yet to learn that our moderate, middle course should be abandoned. The second will, we hope, be utterly impracticable. Though we have some reason to complain, still we go decidedly for British connexion; and we have such confidence in the Red River people that we believe they will scorn to support any journal of contrary opinions.'\"\n\nThe people can be satisfied only by a speedy organization as a British province, with such recognition and encouragement of local interests as is usual on the part of the mother country when a crown colony is established.\n\nAs I have previously assured the department, the Americanization of this important section of British America is rapidly progressing. Unless the British Parliament acts promptly\u2014for instance, during the session soon to transpire\u2014I shall confidently expect a popular movement looking to independence or annexation to the United States.\n\nIn case of a collision with England, Minnesota is competent to \"hold, occupy, and possess\" the valley of Red River to Lake Winnipeg. There are no British troops at Fort Garry, the Canadian rifles whom I saw there in 1859 having returned to Quebec, by way of Hudson bay, during the summer just passed.\n\nTo illustrate the defenceless posture of affairs, as well as the dissatisfaction with the administration of Hudson Bay Company officials, I annex another paragraph from the Nor'wester:\n\n\"'MORE TROOPS NEEDED.'\n\n\"Under this heading, in our last number, we gave instances of Indian assumptions at Pembina. We are now, alas! able to illustrate the necessity for troops by occurrences in our very midst. Yesterday fortnight, a band of Indians, fifty or sixty in number, went to the house of August Schubert, liquor dealer, and helped themselves to a cask of whiskey and almost everything in the house. He remonstrated and protested, but to no effect; might took the place of right, and he was compelled to give way. There were two or three others besides Schubert at the time in the house\u2014Mr. Solomon Hamelin, magistrate, being one. It was he that interpreted between Schubert (who is a German) and the Indians. They were powerless, however, to check or prevent the spoliation, and dreading an appeal to force, they allowed the Indians to have...\"\ntheir own way. This is a signal proof of what we have frequently affirmed, that the government of Red River is unsuited to the times. We require a change; we need more vigor, more energy, more strength, more vigilance, more general effectiveness. Let it come how it may, and whence it may, but a change is absolutely necessary. Allowing that we would have to pay some taxes, we would rather do that and have security of life and property than continue to be under a rule which is cheap, certainly, but which fails to afford security.\"\n\nI hasten, sir, to lay before you these facts in regard to the Red River settlement, as confirming my conviction that no portion of the British territory on this continent is so assailable, so certain of occupation by American troops in case of a war with England, as Fort Garry and the immense district thence extending along the valley of the Saskatchewan to the Rocky mountains. If our struggle is to be, in the fullest sense, a struggle for national existence, against foreign foes as well as domestic traitors, Minnesota, however remote from the scene of the southern insurrection, will claim the distinction of a winter campaign for the conquest of central British America. I append a rough diagram, exhibiting that portion of British territory (enclosed in heavy black lines) which 1,000 hardy Minnesotans, aided by the French, American, and half-breed population, could seize before the 4th of March.\u2014(See diagram on following page.)\n\nThe winter weather would not deter the lumbermen and borderers of Minnesota from the march to Pembina and Fort Garry. The line from St. Paul marked \"M. & P. R. R.\" (Minnesota and Pacific railroad, for whose construction Congress has granted 3,840 acres per mile) traverses the country, is known familiarly as the \"wood road,\" and along which such a march, with proper equipments, could be made. In 1858, at the depth of winter, an ill-appointed party of adventurous men transported the machinery, furniture, and lumber of a steamboat from Crow Wing, on the Upper Mississippi, to Shayenne, on the Red River of the North, where the vessel was reconstructed, and has since made trips to Fort Garry. Indeed, there is some reason for the opinion that the frozen prairies, marshes, and lakes of Minnesota afford facilities for military operations in winter months much greater than the army will find in Virginia or Kentucky. The snow-fall is no obstacle, the cold can be guarded against, and, on a route well supplied with wood for camp fires, the journey can be made with security if not comfort.\n\nI am led into this train of remark by the news of the morning, forcing me to consider the possibility of war with England. Probably to no one will the news be more unwelcome. My correspondence with the Treasury Department, and the investigations which I have been encouraged to pursue, have had, for their permanent predicate, the peace of the two great nations who speak the English tongue. The telegrams of this date surprise me in the midst of labors, the object of which was to demonstrate how much the United States and the British districts northwest of Minnesota are identified in geographical situation and material interests of all kinds. To the advancement of the latter I had not deemed annexation essential. By treaty stipulations and concurrent legislation it seemed possible to work out the mutual destiny of the American States and British provinces of the northwest. I trust that such agencies will yet be suffered to shape and advance events on this frontier. But if otherwise\u2014if war is unavoidable\u2014the budget on which I am engaged, and of which some installments are on file in the Treasury Department, may prove of some advantage to the government in our altered relations to England, and to the immense central region of which Minnesota has hitherto been the commercial key, and may yet prove a military highway.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJAMES W. TAYLOR,\nSpecial Agent.\n\nHon. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury.\nSt. Paul, June 12, 1862.\n\nSir: Upon the general subject of a customs union of British America and the United States, I invite your attention to recent developments, as follows:\n\n1. In Canada.\n\nThe new minister of finance, Honorable William P. Howland, is a native of New York city, and as a member of Parliament from the Toronto district, and a member of the committee on commerce at several sessions, is fully committed to the most liberal policy of intercourse with the United States. In 1859 he presided at a meeting in Toronto, which was addressed by myself, and followed me in expressions of cordial concurrence with our Minnesota propositions. Lately I met Mr. Howland in Quebec, and received additional assurances of his sentiments, whatever policy may be suggested by party expediency.\n\n2. In Central British America.\n\nAt the Selkirk settlements the general dissatisfaction with the neglect of the home government finds renewed utterance. The following article is copied from the local newspaper of a late date:\n\n\"From the Red River settlement\u2014Strong talk to the British Government\u2014Threats of Annexation to the United States.\n\n\"The Red River Nor'wester of May 28 contains the following article upon the relations of the Red River people with England and the United States:\n\n\"It is high time that the British government should take into earnest consideration the affairs of this country. They have hitherto been utterly indifferent to the condition of Central British America; but careless neglect will no longer be indulged with impunity. The present imperial cabinet must at once take up the subject of a change in this country, or they will soon wake up to a very unpleasant state of things here.\n\n\"Annexation to the United States is the universal demand of the people of this country, seeing that the home government will do nothing. The sentiment has been growing ever since commercial intercourse with Minnesota commenced; and it is increasing in intensity to such an extent that a little agitation would ripen it into a formal general movement. British-born residents who have ever looked fondly to the dear old fatherland now ask themselves, What is the use of our British connexion? The name is something, for by the association of ideas it suggests a participation in all that is enlightened and liberal in government, all that is advantageous in commerce, all that is glorious in history. We would fain, they say, be connected with Britain; but what is the use? Of what advantage is it, seeing that the connexion is nominal, empty, worthless? Now, when old British-born settlers hold this tone, what can be expected of that overwhelming majority consisting of natives (whether half-breed or whites) and foreigners? These care not one great for English institutions or English connexion, unless they bring or confer palpable advantages. And really we cannot expect anything else, nor is their course altogether without excuse.\n\n\"Can it be expected that we should not become Americanized, when on the one hand Britain shows perfect indifference to us, and we enjoy none of the commercial or governmental advantages which we have a right to expect, and upon the other hand American influences of every kind are operating upon us? Mark the following facts:\n\n\"(1.) We have no postal communication with any part of the civilized world except through the United States! For two or three years previous to 1860 the Canadian government maintained a monthly mail to and from this settlement,\nvia Fort William, on Lake Superior. This was a step in the right direction, though the arrangement was very unsatisfactorily carried out. But irregular as were the mails, we had a right to expect that they would continue, and gradually, through experience of the route, would work better. The Canadian government has, however, discontinued this small boon, and we are at this moment entirely dependent on the favor of the American government for our means of communicating with the outer world. They have, at great expense, established a fortnightly mail to our frontier, sixty miles from this settlement, almost entirely for our own benefit. Does this fact not present the British government to our view at a disadvantage?\n\n\"(2.) If we except the round-about, slow, and very uncertain route through the arctic straits of Hudson bay, it is only through or from the United States that we can import goods\u2014by an American route alone can we export furs, skins, cattle, or anything else! Is this favorable to loyalty? An importer from Britain can at present get but one supply of goods in the year, and counts himself very lucky indeed if, considering the many possible mishaps, he does get it; whereas the dealer in American goods can get twenty supplies during the same time if he chooses. Almost any week from May to October, inclusive, a splendid steamboat may be seen at Fort Garry discharging her cargo of goods, and taking off packages of furs for the St. Paul, Boston, or New York market: whose boat is this? American citizens, whose enterprise, in the eyes of Red Riverites, throws into shade the slow-going, do-nothing Britons, whom, nevertheless, we are expected to admire, imitate, and hold as our indispensable fellow-subjects.\n\n\"(3.) The only decent route into this country for emigrants is through the States. The consequence is that the foreigners who are settling amongst us are for the most part American citizens, or persons thoroughly Americanized. Is their influence favorable to loyalty?\n\n\"(4.) By frequent intercourse with the Americans, and occasional visits to Chicago, Boston, New York, &c., the impression is fast gaining ground that there is no people like our republican neighbors. We see their fine cities, their railroads, and their steamboats; we read of the rapid settlement of new territories, and of the liberal system of legislation by which the sudden development of the resources of new districts is a matter of every day experience. Meanwhile, we see nothing of England's prosperity and greatness, and get none of her vast wealth, and the inference from all is, that our best plan is at once to become part of Minnesota.\n\n\"These are a few of the reasons why the people of Red River now say to England, Do something for us at once, or forever give us up and let us shape our own destinies.\"\n\nI reserve for a subsequent communication some details of the measures by which the new governor general of the Hudson Bay Company is instructed by the London directory to check or divert the general dissatisfaction at Selkirk.\n\n3. ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF BRITISH AMERICA.\n\nThe following article from the British Colonist, of April 15, published at Victoria, Vancouver island, indicates quite distinctly that no adjustment of our relations with the British provinces is now desirable, unless its proportions are continental:\n\n\"Reciprocity.\u2014We hope some of our legislators will not allow the present session to pass over without devoting some attention to a reciprocity treaty with the United States. A little more attention to the commercial and industrial interests of the country would assist materially in the development of the island. Beyond the ordinary routine of voting money to pay officials, passing a few private bills, and spending a few pounds on the roads, nothing substantial and expansive has been done. It is high time that something beyond nursery legis-\nlution should be taken in hand. If we want to grow rapidly in wealth and importance we have to turn our natural advantages to account. If we desire to advance in the only path to distinction open to the colony\u2014a maritime and commercial one\u2014we will have to take up the question of a reciprocity treaty with the United States at as early a date as possible. The sooner it is taken in hand the quicker the treaty will be inaugurated. If the preparatory steps be taken this session, it will in all probability require a year or so before such a treaty can be ratified. Two years hence the reciprocity between the United States and the eastern provinces will expire. If success should not crown our efforts before that period, by proper management it may then, when that treaty is renewed, as it most certainly will be. It is even not unlikely that the Red River settlement (Assiniboia) will be included. The subject has already been agitated there, and in all probability the only delay in advancing it there lies in the neglect of the colonial office to emancipate Assiniboia from the Hudson Bay Company. Were that once done\u2014and the way events are tending it cannot be long before it will be\u2014that isolated community will be knocking at the doors of the United States Congress to be included in the renewed reciprocity treaty. After Assiniboia, all that would be left of British North America to be included in a reciprocity treaty would be British Columbia, Vancouver island, and the Hudson Bay territories. With the interest that we have at stake in this matter there should be as little delay as possible.\n\n\"In fact, we are not the only parties interested. It cannot be said that the advantages would be one-sided. On the contrary, reciprocity would be an equal advantage to California or Oregon with ourselves. If the San Francisco consumers can get our coal a dollar cheaper a ton, or our sawn lumber 20 per cent less a thousand feet, or other articles at an equally reduced rate, it will require no further argument to convince them that they are interested in promoting reciprocity, and interested in a way that every one will feel it in his pocket. These commodities we can supply San Francisco cheaper than they can be had elsewhere on the coast. Consequently the demand would steadily increase. As the demand increased, so would the consumption of California or Oregon produce increase here, and the development of our country stimulate the industry of theirs. The prospective importance of British Columbia would readily induce Oregon and California to seize the opportunity to send in their produce free. They would find that there was no commercial barrier to trade, but that they enjoyed international free trade. The farmers' interests of British Columbia would not suffer, as the remoteness of the farming districts from the seaboard is a more effectual protection than a tariff. Whilst the consumer at present would get the necessaries of life cheaper, the revenue of the colony would be raised by higher duties on luxuries that only the wealthy would buy. Any scheme of reciprocity ought to include the whole British territory of the Pacific\u2014even British Siberia.\"\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nJAMES W. TAYLOR.\n\nHon. S. P. Chase, Secretary of the Treasury.\n\nEXHIBIT G.\n\nGEOGRAPHICAL MEMOIR OF NORTHWEST BRITISH AMERICA, AND ITS RELATIONS TO THE REVENUE AND COMMERCE OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\nST. PAUL, MINN., May 1, 1862.\n\nThe commercial relations of the United States with Northwest British America were of no practical importance prior to 1858. The controversy of 1844, as to\nthe northern boundary of Oregon, turned more upon considerations of national pride than of material advantage, neither government holding the country which was the subject of negotiation to be desirable for colonization.\n\nVancouver island, commanding the Straits of Juan de Fuca and the harbourage of Puget Sound, was considered valuable in a strategic sense; but the district of the main land west of the Rocky mountains, and then called \"New Caledonia,\" was held in no higher estimation than all geographical authorities now regard Labrador, its equivalent of latitude on the Atlantic coast. During the discussion in the British House of Commons, in 1846, the opinion was expressed by a member that the whole country north of the Columbia river was not worth \u00a320,000.\n\nTwenty years before, or in 1825, Great Britain manifested still greater indifference to territorial occupation of the North Pacific coast of the American continent. At that time Russia was foremost, the United States next, and England last, to assert rights of possession. In 1822 Russia issued an ukase, declaring the North Pacific a closed sea from 51\u00b0, or the north end of Vancouver island, to latitude 49\u00b0 on the Asiatic coast. This was resisted by the United States, who claimed as high as 54\u00b0 40', and was interested that American whalers should not be excluded from the North Pacific.\n\nNegotiations followed, resulting in a treaty, of 1824, between the United States and Russia, making 54\u00b0 40' the boundary between the two nations, or at least that the United States would not settle above nor Russia below that latitude, and declaring the Pacific an open sea.\n\nIn 1825 Great Britain made a boundary treaty with Russia. In the third article the boundary commenced at the southernmost part of Prince of Wales island, in latitude 54\u00b0 40', between 131\u00b0 and 133\u00b0 west longitude, thence up Portland canal to 56\u00b0 of north latitude, and \"from the last-mentioned point the line of demarcation shall follow the summit of the mountains parallel to the coast as far as the intersection of the 141\u00b0 of west longitude,\" and then along that meridian line to the Frozen ocean.\n\nArticle nine states that whenever the summit of the mountains parallel to the coast exceeds ten marine leagues from the ocean, the limit between the British possessions and the line of coast which is to belong to Russia shall be formed by a line parallel to the windings of the coast, and which shall never exceed the distance of ten marine leagues therefrom.\n\nDuring the war of England and France with Russia an agreement between the Hudson Bay Company and the Russian Fur Company not to disturb each other was ratified by the English government, and no effort was made to take possession of the coast from Portland canal to Mount St. Elias. The fur trade, in the language of a British journal, \"was considered of more national importance than 9,000 square miles of territory, with an extensive archipelago, stretching over ten degrees of longitude along the coast.\"\n\nCentral British America, including the basin of Lake Winnipeg and the Mackenzie river, was only known as the territory of the Hudson Bay Company, with no other destiny admitted to be possible than to remain a preserve of the fur trade. With great assiduity the climate of Labrador was assumed to prevail in corresponding latitudes of the Pacific coast, and by systematic suppression the physical analogies of the European coast were overlooked.\n\nPrior to the gold discovery in California Russia had shown a disposition to occupy that country, exciting the jealousy of England. Except for the Mexican war, an European intervention would have probably appropriated the bay of San Francisco and the Gulf of California.\n\nThe organization of colonial governments for Vancouver island and British Columbia was the result of the discovery of gold upon Frazer river and the sudden irruption of adventurers in 1858. The colonization of California under the same impulse ushered a new era upon the Pacific coast of North America,\nand the events of 1858, concurring with imperial legislation, assures for the harborage of Puget's Sound a political and commercial importance only equalled by San Francisco.\n\nCentral British America, or the district extending from Lakes Superior and Winnipeg to the Rocky Mountains, next invited the attention of the world.\n\nEven before the commencement of the discovery of gold upon Frazer river and its tributaries, the people of Canada West had induced the Parliament of England to institute the inquiry whether the region in question is not adapted, by fertility of soil, a favorable climate, and natural advantages of internal communication, for the support of a prosperous colony of England.\n\nThe parliamentary investigation had a wider scope. The select committee of the House of Commons was appointed \"to consider the state of those British possessions in North America which are under the administration of the Hudson Bay Company, or over which they possess a license to trade;\" and therefore witnesses were called to the organization and management of the company itself, as well as the natural features of the country under its administration.\n\nOn the 31st of July, 1857, the committee reported a large body of testimony, but without any decisive recommendations. They \"apprehend that the districts on the Red River and the Saskatchewan are among those most likely to be desired for early occupation,\" and \"trust that there will be no difficulty in effecting arrangements between her Majesty's government and the Hudson Bay Company by which those districts may be ceded to Canada on equitable principles, and within the districts thus annexed to her the authority of the Hudson Bay Company would of course entirely cease.\" They deemed it \"proper to terminate the connexion of the Hudson Bay Company with Vancouver island as soon as it could conveniently be done, as the best means of favoring the development of the great natural advantages of that important colony; and that means should also be provided for the ultimate extension of the colony over any portion of the adjacent continent, to the west of the Rocky mountains, on which permanent settlements may be found practicable.\"\n\nThese suggestions indicate a conviction that the zone of the North American continent, between latitudes 49\u00b0 and 56\u00b0, embracing the Red River and the Saskatchewan districts east of the Rocky mountains, and the area on their western slope, since organized as British Columbia, was, in the judgment of the committee, suitable for permanent settlement. As to the territory north of the parallel of 56\u00b0, an opinion was intimated that the organization of the Hudson Bay Company was best adapted to the condition of the country and its inhabitants.\n\nWithin a year after the publication of the report a great change passed over the North Pacific coast. The gold discovery on the Frazer river occurred; the Pacific populations flamed with excitement; British Columbia was promptly organized as a colony of England; and, amid the acclamations of Parliament and people, Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton proclaimed, in the name of the government, the policy of continuous colonies from Lake Superior to the Pacific, and a highway across British America as the most direct route from London to Pekin or Jeddo.\n\nThe eastern boundary of British Columbia was fixed upon the Rocky mountains.\n\nThe question recurred with great force, What shall be the destiny of the fertile plains of the Saskatchewan and the Red River of the North? Canada pushed forward an exploration of the route from Fort William, on Lake Superior, to Fort Garry, on the Red river, and, under the direction of S. J. Dawson, esq., civil engineer, and Professor J. T. Hinde, gave to the world an impartial and impressive summary of the great natural resources of the basin of Lake Winnipeg. The merchants of New York were prompt to perceive the advantages of connecting the Erie canal and the great lakes with the navigable channels of Northwest America, now become prominent and familiar designations of com-\nmercial geography. A report to the New York Chamber of Commerce very distinctly corrected the erroneous impression that the valleys of the Mississippi and St. Lawrence rivers exhausted the northern and central areas which are available for agriculture.\n\n\"There is in the heart of North America,\" said the report \"a distinct subdivision, of which Lake Winnipeg may be regarded as the centre. This subdivision, like the valley of the Mississippi, is distinguished for the fertility of its soil, and for the extent and gentle slope of its great plains, watered by rivers of great length, and admirably adapted for steam navigation. It has a climate not exceeding in severity that of many portions of Canada and the eastern States. It will, in all respects, compare favorably with some of the most densely peopled portions of the continent of Europe. In other words, it is admirably fitted to become the seat of a numerous, hardy, and prosperous community. It has an area equal to eight or ten first class American States. Its great river, the Saskatchewan, carries a navigable water line to the very base of the Rocky mountains. It is not at all improbable that the valley of this river may yet offer the best route for a railroad to the Pacific. The navigable waters of this great subdivision interlock with those of the Mississippi. The Red River of the North, in connexion with Lake Winnipeg, into which it falls, forms a navigable water line, extending directly north and south, nearly eight hundred miles. The Red River is one of the best adapted to the use of steam in the world, and waters one of the finest regions on the continent. Between the highest point at which it is navigable and St. Paul, on the Mississippi, a railroad is in process of construction; and when this road is completed another grand division of the continent, comprising half a million square miles, will be open to settlement.\"\n\nThe sanguine temper of these remarks illustrates the rapid progress of public sentiment since the date of the parliamentary inquiry, only eighteen months before. Of the same tenor, though fuller in details, were publications on the subject in Canada and even in England. The year 1859 opened with greatly augmented interest in the district of Central British America. The manifestation of this interest varied with localities and circumstances.\n\nIn Canada no opportunity was omitted, either in parliament or by the press, to demonstrate the importance to the Atlantic and lake provinces of extending settlements into the prairies of Assiniboia and Saskatchewan\u2014thereby affording advantages to provincial commerce and manufactures like those which the communities of the Mississippi valley have conferred upon the older American States. Nevertheless, the Canadian government declined to institute proceedings before the English court of chancery or queen's bench, to determine the validity of the charter of the Hudson Bay Company, assigning, as reasons for not acceding to such a suggestion by the law officers of the crown, that the proposed litigation might be greatly protracted, while the interests involved were urgent, and that the duty of a prompt and definite adjustment of the condition and relations of the Red River and Saskatchewan districts was manifestly incumbent upon the imperial authority.\n\nThis decision, added to the indisposition of Lower Canada to the policy of westward expansion, is understood to have convinced Sir E. B. Lytton that annexation of the Winnipeg basin to Canada was impracticable, and that the exclusive occupation by the Hudson Bay Company could be removed only by the organization of a separate colony. The founder of British Columbia devoted the latter portion of his administration of the colonial office to measures for the satisfactory arrangement of conflicting interests in British America. In October, 1858, he proposed to the directors of the Hudson Bay Company that they should be consenting parties to a reference of questions respecting the validity and extent of their charter, and respecting the geographical extent of their territory, to the judicial committee of the privy council. The company \"reasserted their right to the privileges granted to them by their charter of in-\ncorporation,\" and refused to be a consenting party to any proceeding which might call in question their chartered rights.\n\nUnder date of November 3, 1858, Lord Caernarvon, secretary of state for the colonies, by the direction of Sir E. B. Lytton, returned a despatch, the tenor of which is a key not only to Sir Edward's line of policy, but, in all probability, to that of his successor, the Duke of Newcastle. Lord Caernarvon began by expressing the disappointment and regret with which Sir E. B. Lytton had received the communication, containing, if he understood its tenor correctly, a distinct refusal on the part of the Hudson Bay Company to entertain any proposal with a view of adjusting the conflicting claims of Great Britain, of Canada, and of the company, or to join with her Majesty's government in affording reasonable facilities for the settlement of the questions in which imperial no less than colonial interests were involved. It had been his anxious desire to come to some equitable and conciliatory agreement, by which all legitimate claims of the company should be fairly considered with reference to the territories or the privileges they might be required to surrender. He suggested that such a procedure, while advantageous to the interests of all parties, might prove particularly for the interest of the Hudson Bay Company. \"It would afford a tribunal pre-eminently fitted for the dispassionate consideration of the questions at issue; it would secure a decision which would probably be rather of the nature of an arbitration than of a judgment; and it would furnish a basis of negotiation on which reciprocal concession and the claims for compensation could be most successfully discussed.\"\n\nWith such persuasive reiteration, Lord Caernarvon, in the name and at the instance of Sir E. B. Lytton, insisted that the wisest and most dignified course would be found in an appeal to and a decision by the judicial committee of the privy council, with the concurrence alike of Canada and the Hudson Bay Company. In conclusion, the company were once more assured that, if they would meet Sir E. B. Lytton in finding the solution of a recognized difficulty, and would undertake to give all reasonable facilities for trying the validity of their disputed charter, they might be assured that they would meet with fair and liberal treatment, so far as her Majesty's government was concerned; but if, on the other hand, the company persisted in declining these terms, and could suggest no other practicable mode of agreement, Sir E. B. Lytton held himself acquitted of further responsibility to the interests of the company, and proposed to take the necessary steps for closing a controversy too long open, and for securing a definite decision, due alike to the material development of British North America and to the requirements of an advancing civilization.\n\nThe communication of Lord Caernarvon stated, in addition, that, in the case last supposed, the removal of the exclusive license to trade in any part of the Indian Territory\u2014a renewal which could be justified to parliament only as a part of a general agreement adjusted on the principles of mutual concession\u2014would become impossible.\n\nThese representations failed to influence the company. The deputy governor, Mr. H. H. Baren, responded that, as, in 1850, the company had assented to an inquiry before the privy council into the legality of certain powers claimed and exercised by them under their charter, but not questioning the validity of the charter itself, so, at this time, if the reference to the privy council were restricted to the question of the geographical extent of the territory claimed by the company in accordance with a proposition made in July, 1857, by Mr. Labouchere, then secretary of state for the colonies, the directors would recommend to their shareholders to concur in the course suggested; but must decline to do so, if the inquiry involved not merely the question of the geographical boundary of the territories claimed by them, but a challenge of the validity of the charter itself, and, as a consequence, of the rights and privileges which it\nprofessed to grant, and which the company had exercised for a period of nearly two hundred years. Mr. Barenus professed that the company had at all times been willing to entertain any proposal that might be made to them for the surrender of any of their rights, or of any portion of their territory; but he regarded it as one thing to consent, for a consideration to be agreed upon, to the surrender of admitted rights, and quite another to volunteer a consent to an inquiry which should call those rights in question.\n\nA result of this correspondence has been the definite refusal of the crown to renew the exclusive license to trade in Indian territory. The license had been twice granted to the company, under an act of parliament authorizing it, for periods of twenty-one years\u2014once in 1821, and again in 1838. It expired on the 30th of May, 1859. In consequence of this refusal the company must depend exclusively upon the terms of their charter for their special privileges in British America. The charter dates from 1670\u2014a grant by Charles II to Prince Rupert and his associates, \"adventurers of England, trading in Hudson bay\"\u2014and is claimed to give the right of exclusive trade and territorial dominion to Hudson bay and tributary rivers. By the expiration of the exclusive license of Indian trade, and the termination in 1859 of the lease of Vancouver's island from the British government, the sway and influence of the company are greatly restricted, and the feasibility of some permanent adjustment is proportionately increased.\n\nThere is no necessity for repeating here the voluminous argument for and against the charter of the Hudson Bay Company. The interest of British colonization in Northwest America far transcends any technical inquiry of the kind, and the Canadian statesmen are wise in declining to relieve the English cabinet from the obligation to act definitely and speedily upon the subject. The organization of the East India Company was no obstacle to a measure demanded by the honor of England and the welfare of India; and certainly the parchment of the Second Charles will not deter any deliberate expression by parliament in regard to the colonization of Central British America. Indeed, the managers of the Hudson Bay Company are always careful to recognize the probability of a compromise with the government. The late letter of Mr. Barenus to Lord Caernarvon expressed a willingness, at any time, to entertain proposals for the surrender of franchises or territory; and in 1848 Sir J. H. Pelly, governor of the company, thus expressed himself in a letter to Lord Grey: \"As far as I am concerned, (and I think the company will concur if any great national benefit would be expected from it,) I would be willing to relinquish the whole of the territory held under the charter on similar terms to those which it is proposed the East India Company shall receive on the expiration of their charter, namely, securing the proprietors an interest on their capital of ten per cent.\"\n\nAt the adjournment of the Canadian parliament and the retirement of the Derby ministry, in the early part of 1859, the position and prospects of English colonization in Northwest America were as follows:\n\n1. Vancouver's island and British Columbia had passed from the occupation of the Hudson Bay Company into an efficient organization. The gold fields of the interior had been ascertained to equal in productiveness, and greatly to exceed in extent, those of California; the prospect for agriculture was no less favorable, while the commercial importance of Vancouver and the harbors of Puget's sound is unquestionable.\n\n2. The eastern slope of the Rocky mountains and the valleys of the Saskatchewan and Red River were shown by explorations, conducted under the auspices of the London Geographical Society and the Canadian authorities, to be a district of nearly four hundred thousand square miles, in which a fertile soil, favorable climate, useful and precious minerals, fur-bearing and food-yielding animals\u2014in a word, the most lavish gifts of nature, constituted highly satis-\nfactory conditions for the organization and settlement of a prosperous community.\n\n3. In regard to the Hudson Bay Company, a disposition prevailed not to disturb its charter, on condition that its directory made no attempts to enforce an exclusive trade or interfere with the progress of settlements. All parties anticipated parliamentary action. Letters from London spoke with confidence of a bill, drafted and in circulation among members of Parliament, for the erection of a colony between Lake Superior and Winnipeg and the eastern limits of British Columbia, with a northern boundary resting on the parallel of 55\u00b0; and which, although postponed by a change of ministry, was understood to represent the views of the Duke of Newcastle, the successor of Sir E. B. Lytton.\n\n4. In Canada West a system of communication from Fort William to Fort Garry, and thence to the Pacific, was intrusted to a company\u2014the Northwest Transit\u2014which was by no means inactive. A mail to Red River, over the same route, was also sustained from the Canadian treasury; and parliament, among the acts of its previous session, had conceded a charter for a line of telegraph through the valleys of the Saskatchewan, with a view to an extension to the Pacific coast, and even to Asiatic Russia.\n\nSimultaneously with these movements in England and Canada, the citizens of the State of Minnesota, after a winter of active discussion, announced a determination to introduce steam navigation on the Red River of the North. Parties were induced to transport the machinery and cabins, with timber for the hull of a steamer, from the upper Mississippi, near Crow Wing, to the mouth of the Shayenne, on the Red river, where the boat was reconstructed. The first voyage of the steamer was from Fort Abercrombie, an American post, two hundred miles northwest of St. Paul, down north to Fort Garry, during the month of June. The reception of the stranger was attended by extraordinary demonstrations of enthusiasm at Selkirk. The bells of Saint Boniface rang greeting, and Fort Garry blasted powder as if the governor of the company were approaching its portal. This unique but interesting community fully appreciated the fact that steam had brought their interests within the circle of the world's activities.\n\nThis incident was the legitimate sequel to events in Minnesota which had transpired during a period of ten years. Organized as a Territory in 1849, a single decade had brought the population, the resources, and the public recognition of an American State. A railroad system connecting the lines of the lake States and provinces at La Crosse with the international frontier on the Red river at Pembina was not only projected, but had secured aid in aid of its construction a grant by the Congress of the United States of three thousand eight hundred and forty acres a mile, and a loan of State credit to the amount of twenty thousand dollars a mile, not exceeding an aggregate of five million dollars. Different sections of this important extension of the Canadian and American railways were under contract and in process of construction. In addition, the land surveys of the federal government had reached the navigable channel of the Red river, and the line of frontier settlement, attended by a weekly mail, had advanced to the same point. Thus the government of the United States, no less than the people and authorities of Minnesota, were represented in the northwest movement.\n\nThe foregoing statement of the condition of things at the beginning of 1860 is not materially changed. The Palmerston ministry has not prosecuted to effect the masterly and comprehensive policy of Sir E. B. Lytton. The commerce of Minnesota with Selkirk and the Saskatchewan valley has increased, being double in 1861 what was transported in 1860. Selkirk settlement is still unrecognized as a province of England; its population not materially enlarged, and mostly by American emigrants.\n\nAt this juncture a new impulse is given to the gold discoveries of British\nColumbia. The \"Cariboo district\" becomes the destination of thousands from every portion of the civilized world; and it is ascertained that the mountain ranges, which are alike the sources of the Columbia, the Frazer, the Peace, the Athabasca, and the Saskatchewan rivers, with an average latitude of 54\u00b0 and an average longitude of 120\u00b0, must inevitably be transformed into an active scene of mining adventure. If so, Central British America, as I designate the plains of the river basins converging to Lake Winnipeg and closely connected with the northwestern States, is sure of prompt organization and settlement.\n\nWith these expectations I propose in this report to indicate the physical aptitude of Northwest British America, and other considerations favorable to its colonization. Those made apparent, the relations of commerce and revenue incident to such an extension of Anglo-American civilization will suggest themselves.\n\nI propose the following subdivision of topics:\n\nPART I. The physical geography of Northwest British America.\nPART II. The history and organization of the Hudson Bay Company.\nPART III. Selkirk settlement, its foundation, institutions, and agriculture.\nPART IV. The gold discoveries and their influence.\nPART V. Relations of Northwest British America to the United States.\n\nPART I.\n\nTHE PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF NORTHWEST BRITISH AMERICA.\n\nThe mean annual temperature of 35\u00b0 is the limit of the north temperate zone. South of this isotherm, but adjacent thereto, are the districts on both continents best adapted to the growth of the cereals and the sustenance of cattle\u2014the production of bread and meat.\n\nBeginning on the northwest coast, this line touches Sitka, in Russian America, thence bears with a southeast inclination to Lake Winnipeg, pursues the north shore of Lake Superior, crosses the St. Lawrence, and extends to St. John's, Newfoundland.\n\nOf the area south of this boundary to successful agriculture, fully two-thirds is west of the longitude of St. Paul, Minnesota, and is the subject of the present investigation. I premise a detailed statement of the advantages and prospects of civilized settlement by some general observations upon climate.\n\nCLIMATE OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE.\n\nBriefly, Vancouver's island has the littoral climate of Ireland; while the southern districts of British Columbia, which are within the latitude of Vancouver, are not unlike England, making proper allowance for the exceptional influence of mountain elevations. The analogy between the Atlantic coast of Europe and the Pacific coast of North America will hold from Sonora to Sitka, Spain and Italy is the climatic equivalent of Sonora and southern California; northern France, of Oregon and Washington; while Great Britain presents the same analogy to British Columbia. Glasgow, in Scotland, and Sitka, in Russian America, of about the same latitude, are nearly identical in geographical position and in climate.\n\nCLIMATE OF CENTRAL BRITISH AMERICA.\n\nEast of the Rocky mountains the great northwestern plains have a continental climate, and I can best illustrate my own conclusions in the premises by a comparison with a similar area of European Russia. Draw a line from St. Petersburg twenty degrees east, and another ten degrees south, extending them into\nthe form of a parallelogram, and a region is described whose area corresponds with that between Lakes Superior and Winnipeg on one side, and the Rocky mountains on the west, and extending from latitude $44^\\circ$ to $54^\\circ$. No two sections of the respective continents more closely resemble each other than do those above delineated. Both are immense plains, developing the silurian, carboniferous, and, in some measure, a cretaceous geological formation. The Missouri, Mississippi, and Saskatchewan may be set off against the Dnieper, the Don, and the Volga, of Russia; while, in respect to climate and productions, the American district resembles the following particulars of European Russia.\n\nIt is usual to consider Russia in Europe in four distinct divisions: a polar region, including all the country north of latitude $67^\\circ$; a cold region, extending from $67^\\circ$ to $57^\\circ$; a temperate region, from $57^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$, and a warm region, from $50^\\circ$ to $37^\\circ$. Our continental latitude, from $44^\\circ$ to $54^\\circ$, represents the Russian temperate zone from $50^\\circ$ to $57^\\circ$, as well as three degrees of the cold division, namely, to the latitude of St. Petersburg, or $60^\\circ$ north.\n\nThe temperate region of Russia has a mean annual temperature of from $40^\\circ$ to $50^\\circ$, and includes within it the finest and most populous portion of the empire; though even here the thermometer has a very wide range, the summer heat, which suffices to grow melons and similar fruits in the open fields, being often succeeded by very rigorous winters. Even the sea of Azof, much further south, usually freezes about the beginning of November, and is seldom open before the beginning of April. The oak is seldom found below latitude $61^\\circ$; few fruit trees are found beyond $56^\\circ$, and their regular culture cannot be profitably carried on north of the $53^\\circ$ parallel. In this latitude (still speaking of Russia) apples, pears, and plums become abundant; and still further south peaches, apricots, &c., flourish. The northern limit of rye is $65^\\circ$, of barley $67^\\circ$, and oats even further north.\n\nWheat is cultivated in Norway to Drontheim, latitude $64^\\circ$; in Sweden to latitude $62^\\circ$; in western Russia to the environs of St. Petersburg, latitude $60^\\circ$ $15'$; while in central Russia the limit of cultivation appears to coincide with the parallel of $58^\\circ$ or $59^\\circ$. It is well understood that the growth of the cerealia and of the most useful vegetables depends chiefly on the intensity and duration of the summer heats, and is comparatively little influenced by the severity of the winter cold or the lowness of the mean temperature of the year. In Russia, as well as in Central America, the summer heats are as remarkable as the winter cold. The northern shore of Lake Huron has the mean summer heat of Bordeaux, in southern France, or $70^\\circ$ Fahrenheit, and Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan, exceeds in this respect Brussels or Paris. It is remarked by Sir John Richardson, (and such also is the analogy of Russian Europe,) that the prairies south of $55^\\circ$ enjoy milder winters than the more eastern districts.\n\nI have no doubt that potatoes and the hardier garden vegetables, oats, rye, and barley, can be profitably cultivated as far north as $54^\\circ$ in the Saskatchewan district; that wheat, and such fruits as yield cider, are safe as far as $52^\\circ$; and that maize may be cultivated at least to latitude $50^\\circ$; while the country between $44^\\circ$ and $51^\\circ$ is as nearly as possible the counterpart of the temperate zone of European Russia. With the same system of canalage and a reasonable degree of railroad connexion, our vast northern plain can sustain as dense, and, with our institutions and land tenures, a denser population than the heart of the Russian empire.\n\nIts capacity to support life is shown by the variety and abundance of wild animals. Many of these might be domesticated, and would constitute a great resource. Besides innumerable fur-bearing creatures, there are four different kinds of deer; the cariboo or reindeer ranges from $50^\\circ$ to $66^\\circ$; the Rocky mountain goat, whose wool is highly prized in the manufacture of shawls, frequents the highlands from $40^\\circ$ to $60^\\circ$; the bison swarms in the prairies west of longitude $105^\\circ$, and south of latitude $60^\\circ$; and the streams and lakes abound\nin choice varieties of fish. No region of the globe is more richly endowed with these allies and slaves of the human race.\n\nThe rigorous winter climate is no obstacle to the future occupation of these northern plains. The corresponding district of Russia, with the same climate, is, as already shown, the most populous and flourishing portion of the empire. There is much misapprehension on this subject. Mr. E. Merriam, a distinguished meteorologist, states, in a review of the recent Arctic expeditions, that nature has qualified man to breathe an atmosphere $120^\\circ$ above zero, or $60^\\circ$ below it, a difference of $180^\\circ$, without injury to health; and the doctrine of physicians that great and sudden changes of temperature are injurious to health is disproved by recorded facts.\n\nWith this general analysis, I proceed to more specific delineation, proceeding in the narrative of the general features of the country west from the British coast of Lake Superior.\n\n**ITINERARY OF SIR GEORGE SIMPSON.**\n\nFrom the \"Overland Journey Around the World in 1841-'42, of Governor Simpson, who was for more than thirty years the executive of the Hudson Bay Company,\" it is proposed to furnish an abstract of whatever seems pertinent to the present discussion, during his journey from Fort William, on the northwest shore of Lake Superior, to the summit of the Rocky mountains. These details have been gleaned from the pages of his published volume, and are arranged under dates as follows:\n\n**May 29.**\u2014Ascended the Kamanistaquoia river through forests of elm, oak, pine, birch, &c., the stream studded by islands not less fertile and lovely than its banks, reminding the party of the rich and quiet scenery of England. Of flowers, the violet and rose, and of fruits, the currant, gooseberry, raspberry, cherry, and even the vine, are mentioned as abundant. Simpson anticipates that this \"fair valley\" will become the happy home of civilized men, and furnish a near and cheap supply of agricultural produce to the mines of the northern shore of Lake Superior.\n\n**May 30.**\u2014Crossed the Dog Portage, about two miles in length, to the waters flowing westward into Rainy lake. The river from the summit is described as \"a panorama of hill and dale, checkered with the various tints of the pine, the aspen, the ash, and the oak, while through the middle there meanders the silvery stream of the Kamanistaquoia.\"\n\n**May 31.**\u2014A succession of difficult portages.\n\n**June 1.**\u2014Another vexatious day's journey.\n\n**June 2.**\u2014Arrived at Fort Francis, on Rainy lake. Until reaching the lake former difficulties of navigation continued. The river which empties Rainy lake into the Lake of the Woods is described as \"decidedly the finest stream on the whole route, in more than one respect. From Fort Francis downwards, a stretch of nearly a hundred miles, it is not interrupted by a single impediment; while yet the current is not strong enough materially to retard an ascending traveller. Nor are the banks,\" he adds, \"less favorable to agriculture than the waters themselves to navigation, resembling, in some measure, those of the Thames, near Richmond. From the very brink of the river there rises a gentle slope of green sward, crowned in many places with a plentiful growth of birch, poplar, beech, elm, and oak.\" And in this connexion, also, the tourist indulges in a vision of \"crowded steamboats and populous towns.\"\n\n**June 3.**\u2014Lake of the Woods was reached and nearly traversed. Its shores are represented as more rocky than those of Rainy lake, yet as very fertile, producing wild rice in abundance, and bringing maize to perfection. The lake is studded with wooded islands, which, on account of their exemption from natural frosts, are especially adapted to cultivation.\nJune 4-7.\u2014After two and a half days' journey on the river Winnipeg, (which connects the lake of that name with the Lake of the Woods, and is described as a \"magnificent stream,\" but constantly broken into falls and rapids,) the party reached Fort Alexander, and crossed to the mouth of Red river, thence ascending twenty-three miles to Fort Garry, in longitude 97\u00b0, and a little beyond latitude 50\u00b0, and situated at the forks of the Red and Assiniboine rivers.\n\nHere Governor Simpson remained during the month of June. He confirms other accounts of the Selkirk settlement\u2014that the soil is a black mould of great depth and fertility, sometimes producing forty returns of wheat, and never less than fifteen to twenty-five bushels an acre; that the wheat produced is plump and heavy; that there are also raised large quantities of other grains, besides beef, mutton, pork, cheese, and wool in abundance; that within the settlements cattle find food for themselves about seven months, but during the remainder of the year they are maintained on the straw of the farms, and on hay cut on the boundless commons behind; that the occasional inundations to which the alluvial plain of the Red River is subject renew the fertility of the fields in an extraordinary degree; but that these inundations and the intense cold winter (the thermometer for weeks together, at some hour in the twenty-four, marking 30\u00b0 below zero, and the mercury often freezing) are the material disadvantages of the country.\n\nEarly in July Governor Simpson resumed his journey to the Pacific, taking a northwestwardly direction to Edmonton House, near latitude 54\u00b0, and longitude 113\u00b0, four degrees of latitude north, and six degrees of longitude west of Fort Garry. Whatever notices of the intervening country may relate to its natural capacity for settlement will be abstracted under dates as nearly successive as the narrative indicates.\n\nJuly 3.\u2014The scenery of the first day's journey is described as generally a dead level: \"On the east, north, and south, there was not a mound or a tree to vary the vast expanse of green sward, while to the west were the gleaming bays of the Assiniboine, separated from each other by wooded points of considerable depth.\"\n\nJuly 4.\u2014Forded the Champignan. Country same, except that the path occasionally ran through a clump of trees. The beds of many shallow lakes were crossed, which contain water only during the spring, and bear luxuriant grass as high as a horseman's knees, while the surface of the hard ground was beautifully diversified with a variety of flowers, such as the rose, the hyacinth, and the tiger lily. The rankness of vegetation is likened to that in the torrid zone; but it was observed, during the afternoon ride, that the character of the country completely changed. The plain gave place to a rolling succession of sandy hills, generally covered with brush, but with spots which looked like artificial shrubberies. \"This ridge,\" it added, \"is evidently one of nature's steps from a lower to a higher level, and may be traced from Turtle mountain, in the neighborhood of the international boundary, to the branch of Swan river, in latitude 52\u00b0 30', and even round to the Basqua Hill, on the waters of the lower Saskatchewan. It appears to have been in former days the shore of an inland sea, comprising, in one indistinguishable mass, Lakes Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Winnipegos, with many of their feeders. This view may, perhaps, derive confirmation from the fact that the largest of the primeval sheet of waters, namely, Lake Winnipeg, still continues to retire from its western side, and to encroach on its eastern bank.\"\n\nAt their evening camp the travellers deemed themselves fortunate in the vicinity of a running stream, instead of being doomed to swallow the seething dregs of half-dried lakes.\n\nJuly 5.\u2014On resuming their journey the party passed among tolerably well-wooded hills, while on either side of them there lay a constant succession of small lakes, some of them salt, which abounded in wild fowl. In the neighbor-\nhood of those waters the pasture was rich and luxuriant; and they traversed two fields (for so they are termed in the narrative) of the rose and the sweet-brier, while each loaded the air with its own peculiar perfume. The evening encampment was in the \"pretty valley of the Rapid river.\"\n\nJuly 6.\u2014Hitherto Governor Simpson had been travelling at the daily speed of horses, but his subsequent progress was retarded by that of loaded carts, which had preceded his own departure from Fort Garry. He mentions, during the day's route, numerous small lakes, a large salt lake, and a shoal lake, lying in a hilly and well-wooded district.\n\nJuly 7.\u2014Reached, after an hour's ride over hilly and rugged ground, what is called George Sinclair's encampment, on Bird-tail creek, a rapidly flowing tributary of the Assiniboin, and beyond this stream was an undulating prairie of vast extent, with the Assiniboin in the distance. On a neighboring height three bands of antelopes were seen\u2014the first animals observed since leaving Red River settlement, although the prairies immediately before the party, the writer remarks, are well known as the home of many varieties of the deer.\n\nJuly 8.\u2014Reached Fort Ellice, (post of the Hudson Bay Company,) sending carts and baggage across the Assiniboin in a bateau belonging to the post, swimming the horses over, and the travellers making their own passage in the barge's last trip. Those facts indicate the Assiniboin to be a considerable stream, perhaps navigable by steamers quite near its western source.\n\nJuly 9.\u2014Passed through extensive prairies studded with clumps of trees. It is mentioned that, during the day, considerable inconvenience with regard to provisions was suffered from the heat of the weather. The afternoon's march was through a swampy country beset with underwood, the rout constantly winding, like a river, round the extremities of lakes and marshes.\n\nJuly 10.\u2014Prairie harder and more open; vegetation withering from drought; antelopes bounding over the hillocks. A cold rain fell all the afternoon and night. The party \"spent a miserable night under the pouring torrent, while wolves and foxes rendered the position more hideous by their howling.\"\n\nJuly 11.\u2014Quite a landmark of the journey was attained, the Butte aux Chiens, Dog Knoll, towering with a height of about four hundred feet over a boundless prairie as level and as smooth as a pond. This vast plain, which the writer supposes to have once been the bed of a lake, with an islet in its centre, is covered with an alluvial soil of great fertility, is strewed with water-worn stones, and presents various aqueous deposits. On leaving, the day's route traversed about thirty-five miles of prairie among several large and beautiful lakes. At this time the ordinary rate of travelling was four or five miles an hour for ten, twelve, or fourteen hours a day.\n\nJuly 12.\u2014Followed, for about twenty miles, the shores of Lac Sale, or Salt Lake, having waters as briny as the Atlantic. A curious circumstance is noted in respect to these saline lakes, that they are often separated from fresh water only by a narrow belt of land.\n\nJuly 13.\u2014Marched till 10 o'clock in a soaking rain. The weather improving in the afternoon, the route for a long distance was through \"a picturesque country, crossing the end of an extensive lake, whose gently sloping banks of green sward were crowned with thick woods.\"\n\nJuly 14.\u2014Under this date an extract is appended: \"In this part of the country we saw many kinds of birds, geese, loons, pelicans, ducks, cranes, two kinds of snipe, hawks, owls, and gulls; but they were all so remarkably shy that we were constrained to admire them at a distance. In the afternoon we traversed a beautiful country with lofty hills and long valleys full of sylvan lakes, while the bright green of the surface, as far as the eye could reach, assumed a foreign tinge under an uninterrupted profusion of roses and blue-bells. On the summit of one of these hills we commanded one of the few extensive prospects we had of late enjoyed. One range of heights rose behind another, each becoming\nfainter as it receded from the eye, till the furthest was blended, in almost undistinguishable confusion, with the clouds, while the softest vales spread a panorama of hanging copses and glittering lakes at our feet.\"\n\nThe travellers had now reached the Bow river, or the south branch of the Saskatchewan, \"which,\" says Simpson, \"takes its rise in the Rocky mountains, near the international frontier, and is of considerable size, without any physical impediment of any moment. * * * At the crossing place the Bow river is about a third of a mile in width, with a strong current, and, some twenty miles below, falls into the main Saskatchewan, whence the united streams flow toward Lake Winnipeg, forming at their mouth the Grand Rapids of about three miles in length.\"\n\nA smart ride of four or five hours from the Bow river, through a country very much resembling an English park, brought the party to Fort Carleton, on the Saskatchewan; latitude 58\u00b0, longitude about 108\u00b0. Governor Simpson speaks of large gardens and fields in the vicinity of the fort, producing an abundance of potatoes and other vegetables, but adds that wheat is often destroyed by the frosts of autumn.\n\n\"The Saskatchewan,\" he remarks, \"is here upward of a quarter of a mile wide, presenting, as its name implies, a swift current. It is navigable for boats from Rocky Mountain House, in longitude 116\u00b0, to Lake Winnipeg, upwards of seven hundred miles in a direct line, but by the actual course of the stream nearly double that distance. Though above Edmonton the river is much obstructed by rapids, yet from that fort to Lake Winnipeg it is descended, without a portage, alike by boats and canoes, while even on the upward voyage the only break in the navigation is the Grand Rapids, already mentioned.\"\n\nThe party remained several days at Fort Carleton. Frequent reference is made in the narrative to parties of Indians, the whole number in the Saskatchewan district being estimated at 16,730, and also a party of emigrants from the Red River settlement to the Pacific. In the latter connexion occurs the following touching incident, itself a high tribute to the attractiveness of the unexplored Saskatchewan:\n\n\"Among the emigrants was one poor woman, upwards of seventy-five years of age, who was tottering after her son to his new home. This venerable wanderer was a native of the Saskatchewan, of which, in fact, she bore the name; she had been absent from this the land of her birth for eighteen years, and, on catching the first glimpse of the river from the hill near Carleton, she burst, under the influence of old recollections, into a violent flood of tears. While the party remained at the fort she scarcely ever left the banks of the stream, appearing to regard it with as much veneration as the Hindoo regards the Ganges.\"\n\nThere remained a week's journey to Edmonton, and among its incidents were the following: The route on the first day \"lay over a hilly country so picturesque in its character that almost every commanding portion presents the elements of an interesting panorama;\" buffalo soon became very numerous, and, in addition, the party frequently met wolves, badgers, foxes, beavers, and antelopes; raspberries, a sort of cross between the cranberry and black currant, called the serviceberry, and the eyeberry, very nearly resembling the strawberry in taste and appearance, were found in abundance. A sharp frost before sunrise, followed by a heavy dew, occurred on the 22d of July. Near Edmonton they crossed a vast plain, which was covered with a luxuriant crop of the vetch, or wild pea, almost as nutritious a food for cattle and horses as oats; while the vicinity of the fort is represented as rich in mineral production, a seam of coal, ten feet deep, having been traced for a considerable distance along both sides of the river.\n\nWe will not follow the governor of the Hudson Bay Company through the gorges of the Rocky mountains, or his subsequent adventures on the Pacific coast.\nThe area comprised within the rivers converging to Lake Winnipeg is estimated to contain 400,000 square miles. Familiar as the American public is with the progress of the Mississippi States, I am inclined to review the basin of Lake Winnipeg from the western stand-point of its capacity, to be divided and occupied as States or provinces, each having an average area of 50,000 square miles. Starting, therefore, from that point of the western boundary of Minnesota, which has become the head of steamboat navigation on the Red river, I proceed, in convenient subdivisions, to describe the vast district enclosed between latitudes 49\u00b0 and 55\u00b0, and extending from the shores of Lake Winnipeg to the Rocky mountains.\n\nTHE AMERICAN VALLEY OF THE RED RIVER.\n\nOf this district Lac Traverse in one direction, and Ottertail lake in a line nearer north from Saint Paul\u2014either point not more than two hundred miles distant\u2014may be regarded as its extreme southern limits; Pembina and the international frontier the northern, while the longitude of Red lake on the east, and of Minnewakan or Spirit lake on the west are convenient designations of the remaining boundaries. This area would extend from about latitude 46\u00b0 to 49\u00b0, and from longitude 95\u00b0.30 to 99\u00b0.\n\nCaptain Pope, in his exploration of 1849, remarks that for fifty miles in all directions around Ottertail lake is the garden of the northwest. The outlet of the lake, constituting the source of the Red River of the North, has been very favorably described by Dr. Owen, of the United States geological survey. It presents a succession of lakes and rapids, while at other points rolling prairies extend from its banks, crested with beautifully-dispersed groves of timber. It was in this section of Minnesota that the magnesian limestone containing silurian fossils, identical with those in the bluffs of the Mississippi below St. Paul, was recognized by Dr. Owen in situ\u2014showing that the primary formation which divides Minnesota from northeast to southwest is succeeded to the northwest by the ascending series of sedimentary rocks.\n\nThere is ample testimony that westward from Ottertail lake for at least one hundred miles, and northward to Red lake, if not beyond, no more favorable distribution of beautiful prairies and forests can be imagined. The lakes are numerous but small, and almost invariably skirted with timber, the sugar maple largely preponderating. Seldom is the traveller out of sight of these groves, while the soil is unsurpassed.\n\nFrom Dr. Owen's Geological Report it appears that below the head of navigation the western bank of the Red river is a vast plain, but on the east, where the country is level, timber is more abundant on the river banks; the soil is congenial to the ash, which attains a large size. Below the mouth of Red Lake river strong chalybeate springs ooze from the clay banks; saline springs are also found, and all accounts concur that hardly an acre but is eminently adapted to the cultivation of wheat. This great staple, with the aid of machinery, will hereafter be cultivated more advantageously over the northwestern areas of the continent than in the Mississippi basin.\n\nASSINIBOIA.\n\nThis is the official designation of the district of British America occupied by the Selkirk settlements. It embraces the lower or northern section of the Red river and the productive valley of the Assiniboia. Here is a civilized and interesting community of ten thousand souls, with schools, churches, a magistracy, and a successful agriculture.\n\nA sketch of Selkirk settlement is postponed to a subsequent division of this report.\nCUMBERLAND.\n\nNorth of the Red River settlements is a region, almost a discovery of recent explorers, which is even more attractive than the prairie district contiguous to the Red and Assiniboin rivers. Immediately west of Lake Winnipeg are Lakes Winnipegoos and Manitoba, with an outlet flowing into Lake Winnipeg, in latitude 52\u00b0. Tributary to Lake Winnipegoos are the Red Deer and Swan rivers, which drain a country of rare beauty and fertility. A traveller, writing to a Canadian newspaper, describes its general features as rich prairies, interspersed with belts of heavy oak and elm; while the itinerary of Sir George Simpson affords a most glowing picture of the sources of Swan river. Under date of July 14 he observes: \"In this part of the country we saw many sorts of birds, geese, loons, pelicans, ducks, cranes, two kinds of snipe, hawks, owls, and gulls; but they were all so remarkably shy that we were constrained to admire them from a distance. In the afternoon we traversed a beautiful country with lofty hills and long valleys full of sylvan lakes, while the bright green of the surface, as far as the eye could reach, assumed a foreign tinge, under an uninterrupted profusion of roses and blue-bells. On the summit of one of these hills we commanded one of the few extensive prospects we had of late enjoyed. One range of heights rose behind another, each becoming fainter as it receded from the eye, till the furthest was blended in almost undistinguishable confusion with the clouds, while the softest vales spread a panorama of hanging copses and glittering lakes at our feet.\"\n\nAs Cumberland House is situated north of the valley of Swan river, upon the Saskatchewan, its name has been chosen to designate the district between longitude 100\u00b0 and 105\u00b0 and from latitude 52\u00b0 to 55\u00b0. An equal area immediately south, and between the parallels of 49\u00b0 and 52\u00b0, is no less attractive and fertile.\n\nSASKATCHEWAN.\n\nThere remains, from longitude 105\u00b0 to 115\u00b0, and from latitude 49\u00b0 to 55\u00b0, the respective valleys of the North and South Saskatchewan\u2014ample in area and resources for four States of the extent of Ohio. I propose to consider the whole interval westward from the junction of the two rivers to the Rocky mountains without subdivision, as, indeed, it is presented by Colton's map of North America.\n\nThe prairie districts adjacent to the South Saskatchewan are described by the Canadian explorers as inferior to the rich alluvial plains of the Red and Assiniboin rivers; but Sir George Simpson's sketches of his route from Fort Carleton to Fort Edmonton are suggestive of a superior agricultural region.\n\nAn authority in regard to the more western portions of the Saskatchewan is Father De Smet, the devoted Jesuit missionary to the Indians of Oregon, mentioned by Governor Stevens, in a recent address before the New York Geographical Society, as \"a man whose name is a tower of strength and faith,\" possessing high scientific attainments and great practical knowledge of the country. His \"Oregon Missions\" is a publication of much interest, consisting of letters to his superiors; and a portion of this volume narrates his explorations and adventures in the Saskatchewan valleys of the Rocky mountains. In September, 1854, he left the source of the Columbia river in latitude 50\u00b0, and crossed the Rocky mountains, descending their eastern slope in latitude 51\u00b0. He entered, on the 18th of September, \"a rich valley, agreeably diversified with meadows, forests, and lakes, the latter abounding in salmon trout.\" This was a mountain valley, however, and it was not till three days afterwards that he reached Bow river, on the south of the Saskatchewan. Thence he continued northward, noticing sulphurous fountains and coal on the Red Deer, a branch\nof the Bow river. Descending the valley of the Red Deer, which is also described in very glowing terms, at length he emerged upon what he describes as \"the vast plain\u2014the ocean of prairies.\"\n\nOn the evening of the same day the missionary reached and was hospitably received at the Rocky Mountain House, latitude 53\u00b0, and longitude 115\u00b0, and on the 31st October started for another journey on the plains; but after two weeks' absence was compelled to seek refuge from the approach of winter (now the middle of November) at Edmonton House, on the upper Saskatchewan. From this shelter he thus writes in general terms:\n\n\"The entire region in the vicinity of the eastern chain of the Rocky mountains, serving as their base for thirty or sixty miles, is extremely fertile, abounding in forests, plains, prairies, lakes, streams, and mineral springs. The rivers and streams are innumerable, and on every side offer situations favorable for the construction of mills. The northern and southern branches of the Saskatchewan water the district I have traversed for a distance of about three hundred miles. Forests of pine, cypress, thorn, poplar, and aspen trees, as well as others of different kinds, occupy a large portion of it, covering the declivities of the mountains and banks of the rivers.\n\n\"These originally take their rise in the highest chains, whence they issue in every direction like so many veins. The beds and sides of these rivers are pebbly, and their course rapid, but as they recede from the mountains they widen, and the currents lose something of their impetuosity. Their waters are usually very clear. The country would be capable of supporting a large population, and the soil is favorable for the production of barley, corn, potatoes, and beans, which grow here as well as in the more southern countries.\n\n\"Are these vast and innumerable fields of hay forever destined to be consumed by fire, or perish in the autumnal snows? How long shall these superb forests be the haunts of wild beasts? And these inexhaustible quarries\u2014these abundant mines of coal, lead, sulphur, iron, copper, and saltpetre\u2014can it be that they are doomed to remain forever inactive? Not so. The day will come when some laboring hand will give them value; a strong, active, and enterprising people are destined to fill this spacious void. The wild beasts will, ere long, give place to our domestic animals; flocks and herds will graze in the beautiful meadows that border the numberless mountains, hills, valleys, and plains of this extensive region.\"\n\nLife at Edmonton during the winter season is thus sketched:\n\n\"The number of servants, including children, is about eighty. Besides a large garden, a field of potatoes and wheat belonging to the establishment, the lakes, forests, and plains of the neighborhood furnish provisions in abundance. On my arrival at the fort the ice-house contained thirty thousand white fish, each weighing four pounds, and five hundred buffaloes\u2014the ordinary amount of the winter provisions. Such is the quantity of aquatic birds in the season, that sportsmen often send to the fort carts full of fowls. Eggs are picked up by thousands in the straw and weeds of the marshes. I visited Lake St. Anne, a missionary station fifty miles northwest from Edmonton. The surface of this region is flat for the most part, undulating in some places, diversified with forests and meadows, and lakes teeming with fish. In Lake St. Anne alone were caught, last autumn, more than seventy thousand white fish, the most delicious of the kind. They are taken with a line at every season of the year.\n\n\"Notwithstanding the rigor and duration of the winter in this northern region, the earth, in general, appears fertile. Vegetation is so formed in the spring and summer that potatoes, wheat, and barley, together with other vegetables of Canada, come to maturity.\"\n\nOn the 12th of March Father De Smet started on his return trip, proceeding with sledges drawn by dogs over the snow to Fort Jasper, situated northwest\nfrom Edmonton, on the Athabasca river, half a degree north of latitude 54\u00b0. Here occurred the following hunting adventure:\n\n\"Provisions becoming scarce at the fort at the moment when we had with us a considerable number of Iroquois from the surrounding country, who were resolved to remain until my departure, in order to assist at the instructions, we should have found ourselves in an embarrassing situation had not Mr. Frazer come to our relief by proposing that we should leave the fort and accompany himself and family to the Lake of Islands, where we could subsist partly on fish. As the distance was not great, we accepted the invitation and set out, to the number of fifty-four persons and twenty dogs; I count the latter because we were as much obliged to provide for them as for ourselves. A little note of the game killed by our hunters, during the twenty-six days of our abode at this place, will afford you some interest; at least, it will make you acquainted with the animals of the country, and prove that the mountaineers of the Athabasca are blessed with good appetites. Animals killed: twelve moose deer, two reindeer, thirty large mountain sheep, or big-horn, two porcupines, two hundred and ten hares, one beaver, ten muskrats, twenty-four bustards, one hundred and fifteen ducks, twenty-one pheasants, one snipe, one eagle, one owl; add to this from thirty to fifty-five white fish and twenty trout every day.\"\n\nATHABASCA.\n\nThe valleys of the Peace and Athabasca rivers, eastward of the Rocky mountains, from latitude 55\u00b0, share the Pacific climate in a remarkable degree. The Rocky mountains are greatly reduced in breadth and mean elevation, and through the numerous passes between their lofty peaks the winds of the Pacific reach the district in question. Hence it is that Sir Alexander McKenzie, under the date of May 10, mentions the exuberant verdure of the whole country\u2014trees about to blossom, and buffalo attended by their young. During the late parliamentary investigation similar statements were elicited. Dr. Richard King, who accompanied an expedition in search of Sir John Ross as surgeon and naturalist, was asked what portion of the country visited by him was valuable for the purpose of settlement. In reply, he described, \"as a very fertile valley,\" a \"square piece of country,\" bounded on the south by Cumberland House, and by the Athabasca lake on the north. His words are as follows:\n\n\"The sources of the Athabasca and the sources of the Saskatchewan include an enormous area of country. It is, in fact, a vast piece of land surrounded by water. When I heard Dr. Livingstone's description of the country which he found in the interior of Africa, within the equator, it appeared to me to be precisely the kind of country which I am now describing. * * * It is a rich soil, interspersed with well-wooded country, there being growth of every kind, and the whole vegetable kingdom alive.\"\n\nWhen asked concerning mineral productions, his reply was: \"I do not know of any other mineral except limestone; limestone is apparent in all directions. * * * The birch, the beech, and the maple are in abundance, and there is every sort of fruit.\" When questioned further as to the growth of trees, Dr. King replied by a comparison with \"the magnificent trees around Kensington park, in London.\" He described a farm near Cumberland House under very successful cultivation\u2014luxuriant wheat, potatoes, barley, and domestic animals.\n\nA suitable supplement to these statements is found in the impressive language of a writer in the Knickerbocker Magazine for October, 1858:\n\n\"Here is the great fact of the northwestern areas of this continent. An area not inferior in size to the whole United States east of the Mississippi, which is perfectly adapted to the fullest occupation by cultivated nations, yet is almost wholly unoccupied, lies west of the 98th meridian, and above the 43d parallel\u2014that is, north of the latitude of Milwaukie and west of the longitude of Red\nRiver, Fort Kearney, and Corpus Christi; or, to state the fact in another way, east of the Rocky mountains and west of the 98th meridian, and between the 43d and 60th parallels, there is a productive, cultivable area of 500,000 square miles. West of the Rocky mountains, and between the same parallels, there is an area of 300,000 square miles.\n\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that the temperature of the Atlantic coast is carried straight across the continent to the Pacific. The isothermals deflect greatly to the north, and the temperatures of the northern Pacific are paralleled in the high temperatures in high latitudes of western and central Europe. The latitudes which enclose the plateaus of the Missouri and Saskatchewan in Europe enclose the rich central plains of the continent. The great grain-growing districts of Russia lie between the 45th and 60th parallels; that is, north of the latitudes of St. Paul, Minnesota, or Eastport, Maine. Indeed, the temperature in some instances is higher for the same latitudes here than in central Europe. The isothermal of 70\u00b0 for the summer, which on our plateau ranges from along latitude 50\u00b0 to 52\u00b0, in Europe skirts through Vienna and Odessa in about parallel 46\u00b0. The isothermal of 55\u00b0 for the year runs along the coast of British Columbia, and does not go far from New York, London, and Sebastopol. Furthermore, dry areas are not found above 47\u00b0, and there are no barren tracts of consequence north of the Bad Lands and the Coteau of the Missouri. The land grows grain finely, and is well wooded. All the grains of the temperate districts are here produced abundantly, and Indian corn may be grown as high as the Saskatchewan.\n\n\"The buffalo winter as safely on the upper Athabasca as in the latitude of St. Paul, and the spring opens at nearly the same time along the immense line of plains from St. Paul to Mackenzie's river. To these facts, for which there is the authority of Blodgett's Treatise on the Climatology of the United States, may be added this, that to the region bordering the northern Pacific the finest maritime positions belong throughout its entire extent, and no part of the west of Europe exceeds it in the advantages of equable climate, fertile soil, and commercial accessibility of coast. We have the same excellent authority for the statement that in every condition forming the basis of national wealth the continental mass lying westward and northward from Lake Superior is far more valuable than the interior in lower latitudes, of which Salt Lake and upper New Mexico are the prominent known districts. In short, its commercial and industrial capacity is gigantic. Its occupation was coeval with the Spanish occupation of New Mexico and California. The Hudson Bay Company has preserved it an utter wilderness for many long years. The Frazer river discoveries and emigration are facts which the company cannot crush. Itself must go to the wall, and the population of the great northwestern area begins.\"\n\nI add a briefer synopsis of the corresponding districts west of the Rocky mountains, mostly compiled from the results of the parliamentary inquiry into the affairs of the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nVANCOUVER'S ISLAND.\n\nThis island is fertile, well timbered, diversified by intersecting mountain ranges, and small prairies, with extensive coal fields, compared to the West Riding of Yorkshire coal, and fortunate in its harbors. Esquimaux harbor, on which Victoria is situated, is equal to San Francisco. The salmon and other fisheries are excellent, but this advantage is shared by every stream and inlet of the adjacent coast. As to the climate, the winter is stormy, with heavy rains in November and December; frosts occur in January, but seldom interrupt agriculture; vegetation starts in February, progressing rapidly in March, and fostered by alternate warm showers and sunshine in April and May, while intense heat and drought are often experienced during June, July, and August.\nThe island has an area of 16,200 square miles, or as large as Vermont and New Hampshire.\n\n**FRAZER AND THOMPSON RIVERS.**\n\nNorthward of Vancouver, the mountains trend so near the Pacific as to obstruct intercourse with the interior, but \"inside,\" to use the language of a witness, \"it is a fine open country.\" This is the valley of Frazer river. Ascending this river, near Fort Langley, \"a large tract of land\" is represented as \"adapted to colonists;\" while of Thompson river the same witness says that \"it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world;\" climate capable of producing all the crops of England, and much milder than Canada. The sources of Frazer river, in latitude fifty-five degrees, are separated from those of Peace river, which flows through the Rocky mountains eastwardly into the Athabasca, by the distance of only 317 yards.\n\n**SOURCES OF THE COLUMBIA.**\n\nI suppose that no portion of the continent is so little known, and still so attractive in all its natural features and resources, as the district which is watered by the Upper Columbia and its tributary, the McGillivray or Flatbow river. David Thompson, in 1807, selected the source of the Columbia as a site of a trading post with Kootanais or Flatbow Indians. Since that date these Indians have made sensible progress to civilization under the influence of the Oregon missions, as also have other more southern tribes on the western slope of the Rocky mountains. Indeed, the relations of their missionary bishop, Father De Smet, constitute a most glowing sketch of the oval district between Flatbow river and the Upper Columbia, and which must have an extent of 20,000 square miles.\n\nI select some passages of description by De Smet, after passing north of the boundary in latitude forty-nine degrees:\n\n\"Advancing toward the territory of the Kootanais, we were enchanted with the beautiful and diversified scenery. * * * An extensive plain at the base of the Portage mountain (probably near the western extremity of the Kootanais Pass) presents every advantage for the formation of a city. The mountains surrounding this agreeable site are majestic and picturesque. They forcibly recalled to my memory the Mapacho mountains that encompass the beautiful capital of Chili, (Santiago.) * * * The quarries and forests are inexhaustible, and, having remarked large pieces of coal along the river, I am convinced that this fossil could be abundantly procured. Great quantities of lead are found on the surface of the earth, and, from the appearance of its superior quality, we are led to believe that there may be some mixture of silver. * * * After a few days' journey we arrived at the Prairie du Tabac, the usual abode of the Kootanais. Their camp is situated in an immense and delightful valley, bounded by two eminences, which, from their gentle and regular declivity, appear to have originally bounded an extensive lake. * * * Thence I journeyed on towards the sources of the Columbia. The country we traversed was highly picturesque, and agreeably diversified by beautiful prairies, smiling valleys and lakes, surrounded by heavy and solemn pines, gracefully waving their flexible branches. We also crossed dark alpine forests, where the sound of the axe has never resounded. * * * On the 4th of September I found myself at the source of the Columbia.\n\n\"When emigration, accompanied by industry, the arts, and sciences, shall have penetrated the numberless valleys of the Rocky mountains, the source of the Columbia will prove a very important point. The climate is delightful; the extremes of heat and cold are seldom known. The snow disappears as fast as it falls; the laborious hand that would till these valleys would be repaid a hundred-fold. Innumerable herds could graze throughout the year in these...\"\nmeadows, where the sources and streams nurture a perpetual freshness and abundance. These hillocks and declivities of the mountains are generally studded with inexhaustible forests, in which the birch tree, pine of different species, cedar and cypress abound. * * * The advantages nature seems to have bestowed on the source of the Columbia will render its geographical position very important at some future day. The magic hand of civilized man would transform it into a terrestrial paradise.\"\n\nIt is an interesting coincidence that De Smet published in a St. Louis paper, in 1858, a similar description of this region, adding that it could be reached from Salt Lake City along the western base of the Rocky mountains with wagons, and that Brigham Young would lead a Mormon exodus to the vicinity of Portage mountain. The fact that the Mormons had established a flourishing half-way post on the Salmon river, a branch of the Columbia, gave an aspect of probability to De Smet's prediction; but, so far, events have not developed such a movement by the Mormon hierarchy.\n\nTHE ARCTIC DISTRICTS.\n\nThe district of British America west of the lakes which, by soil and climate, are suitable for agricultural settlements, I estimate as follows:\n\n| Location                        | Square miles |\n|---------------------------------|--------------|\n| Vancouver's island              | 16,200       |\n| Frazer and Thompson rivers      | 60,000       |\n| Sources of Columbia             | 20,000       |\n| Athabasca district              | 50,000       |\n| Saskatchewan, Red River, Assiniboin, &c | 360,000     |\n\nTotal: 506,200\n\nThis area would constitute twelve States of the size of Ohio.\n\nAll of British America, without these divisions, is surrendered to the sterility of an Arctic climate; but the absence of agriculture may be compensated by mineral resources. This will appear from a general survey of the geology and mineral features over the whole territory formerly occupied by the Hudson Bay Company.*\n\nGEOLOGY, MINERAL WEALTH, ETC.\n\nFrom the shore of Lake Superior to the eastern bank of Lake Winnipeg, the geological formation is that of the crystalline rocks, a system which is not generally favorable to agriculture, although here and there many fertile spots are to be found. This comparatively sterile region extends northward to the Arctic sea, Lake Athabasca, and Great Slave lake being situated on its most westerly limit. To the westward of these lakes and Lake Winnipeg, and between them nearly to the Rocky mountains, the whole territory is of the silurian and devonian formations, both eminently favorable to agriculture, the former prevailing throughout the fertile peninsula of Upper Canada. At its base, the silurian deposits range a thousand miles from east to west, and extend about five hundred miles to the northward, where the devonian commences and continues to the Arctic sea. It is this part of the territory through which the Saskatch-\n\n* A geological map, with an accompanying memoir by Professor Isbister, of London, a native of Red River settlement, is the authority for the statements in regard to the geology and mineral wealth of Northwest British America.\newan and the Mackenzie rivers flow, which is so highly praised for the fertility of its prairie lands. About one hundred and fifty miles east of the Rocky mountains the great coal bed commences, which gives our territory so great an advantage over that which lies to the south. So far as has yet been ascertained, it is over fifty miles in width and extends continuously over sixteen degrees of latitude, to the Arctic ocean.\n\nThe difficulty of deciding upon the age of the beds through which the lower part of Mackenzie river flows is increased by the occurrence among them of a lignite formation, covered in parts by deep beds of sand, capped by boulders and gravel. The soft friable shales forming the bank of the river near its termination in the Arctic sea are also strongly impregnated with alum. These aluminous shales cover a large portion of the delta of Mackenzie river, are continued along the banks of Peel's river to the foot of the Rocky mountains, and have been traced for a considerable distance along the coast, and also along the shores of Great Bear lake. The aluminous shale is constantly associated with the bituminous formation into which it often passes.\n\nThe lignite formation is still more extensively developed; and as the occurrence of coal in any form in these high latitudes is a question of much interest, I shall here state briefly the results of Sir John Richardson's observations and inquiries on the subject, to which he has given much attention.\n\nThe Mackenzie traverses very obliquely the basin in which the lignite formation is deposited, while Bear Lake river cuts it more directly across, and it is at the junction of these two streams that the formation is best exposed. It there consists of a series of beds, the thickest of which exceeds three yards, separated by layers of gravel and sand, alternating with a fine grained friable sandstone and sometimes with thick beds of clay, the interposing layers being often dark from the dissemination of bituminous matter. \"The coal when recently extracted from the bed,\" says Sir John Richardson, \"is massive, and most generally shows the woody structure distinctly; the beds appearing to be composed of pretty large trunks of trees, lying horizontally and having their woody fibres and layers much twisted and contorted, similar to the white spruce now growing in exposed situations in the same latitude. Specimens of this coal, examined by Mr. Bowerbank, were pronounced by him to be decidedly of coniferous origin, and the structure of the wood to be more like that of Pinus than Araucaria; but on this latter point he was not certain. It is probable that the examination of a greater variety of specimens would detect several kinds of wood in the coal, as a bed of fossil leaves, connected with the formation, reveals the existence at the time of various dicotyledonous trees, probably Acerinae, and one of which appears to belong to the yew tribe.\" * * * \"Different beds, and even different parts of the same bed, when traced to the distance of a few hundred yards, present examples of 'fibrous brown coal,' 'earth coal,' 'conchoidal brown coal,' and 'trapezoidal brown coal.' Some beds have the external characters of a compact bitumen, but they generally exhibit on the cross fracture concentric layers, although from their jet-like composition the nature of the woody fibres cannot be detected by the microscope. Some pieces have a strong resemblance to charcoal in structure, colour, and lustre. Very frequently the coal may be named a 'bituminous slate,' of which it has many of the lithological characters, but on examination with a lens it is seen to be composed of comminuted woody matter mixed with clay and small imbedded fragments resembling charred wood. From the readiness with which the coal takes fire spontaneously, the beds are destroyed as they become exposed to the atmosphere, and the bank is constantly crumbling down, so that it is only when the debris have been washed away by the river that good sections are exposed.\"\n\nFormations similar to that found on Mackenzie river extend southward along the eastern base of the Rocky mountains, as far as the Saskatchewan river.\nSir John Richardson gives a detailed account of the various localities between these two points in which beds of coal have been exposed, all pointing to the existence of a vast coal field, skirting the base of the Rocky mountains for a very great extent, and continued probably far into the Arctic sea, where, as is well known, lignite apparently of a similar character has recently been discovered by Captain McClure in the same general line with the localities above mentioned. In the coal of Jameson Land, lying in north latitude 71\u00b0 (on the east side of Greenland,) and in that of Melville island, in latitude 75\u00b0 north, Professor Jameson found plants resembling those of the coal measures of Britain, and similar remains have been more recently discovered by Mr. Dana in the coal fields of Oregon and Vancouver's island. These facts are sufficient of themselves, as is remarked by Sir John Richardson, to raise a world of conjecture respecting the condition of the earth when these ancient fossils were living plants. If the great coal measures, containing similar vegetable forms, were deposited at the same epoch in distant localities, there must have existed when that deposition took place a similarity of condition of the North American continent from latitude 75\u00b0 down to 45\u00b0.\n\nThe importance of this coal field in connexion with the construction and working of a Pacific railway can hardly be over-estimated. Beyond the Rocky mountains the geology of the territory is not so well known. There are ranges of mountains, (Laurentian,) but they are interspersed with great valleys, very favorable for agriculture and heavily timbered.\n\nWhile the geologist has found in his researches many proofs of the wealth of the northwest territory, the mineralogist has not been far behind him. Almost from the landing upon the shores of Hudson bay of the first fur traders, the country has been represented as rich in minerals. Shortly after the Hudson Bay Company formed establishments there, two of their officers, Carruthers and Norton, in a journey along the western shores of the bay, were informed by the Indians that rich mines of copper existed in that direction; and Dobbs, in his \"Account of the countries adjoining to Hudson bay,\" published in London, in 1744, says that he learned from Mr. Frost, who had been stationed for a long period at several of the factories upon the Hudson bay, that \"upon the east main,\" (the eastern side of the bay,) \"which had lately been discovered, there is an exceedingly rich lead mine, from which the natives brought very good ore.\" Dobbs also speaks of the rich copper mines north of Churchill, situated upon the other side of the bay. By the evidence of Robert Griffin, a silversmith, for five years resident at Hudson bay, taken in 1749 before the committee of inquiry of the House of Commons into the condition of the territory, alluded to by Mr. Robson, it appears that the former tested the ore brought from the east main, which he declared to contain lead; that he remembered several quantities of this ore being brought thence, from one to fifteen pounds weight, and that he learned from the Indians that it existed in abundance in the interior of the east main.\n\nSir Alexander MacKenzie, in the course of his journeys to the Arctic sea and the Pacific ocean, in 1789 and 1793, respectively, saw \"beautiful pieces of variegated marble, found on the surface of the earth by the Chepewyan Indians, which is easily worked, bears a fine polish, hardens with time, and bears heat.\" This marble he saw in the country between the sixtieth and sixty-fifth parallels. \"Among the stony flake-like slate,\" on the banks of the Mackenzie, he discovered \"pieces of petroleum, which bears a resemblance to yellow wax,\" and the Indians informed him that \"rocks of a similar kind were scattered about the country at the back of Slave lake, where the Chepewyans collect copper.\" All the Indians whom he met had either copper or iron tops to their spears, and near the river of Bear lake he met with lumps of iron ore and springs of mineral water. Along the course of the Mackenzie, as far as 66\u00b0 north latitude, and also in the Rocky mountains in 56\u00b0 north latitude and 120\u00b0\nwest longitude he discovered coal and bitumen, and on the Peace river, a southwestern branch of the Mackenzie, he discovered several salt springs.\n\nDuring the first and second expedition which he commanded along the Arctic shores of the continent and among its islands, Parry found, at Melville island, flint, conl, ironstone, madrepore, and sand of a greenish color; at Southampton island, a quantity of magnetic ironstone; near Lyon inlet, epidote; at Red Point, lapis ollaris and a piece of asbestos; at Rendezvous island, rose quartz, ledum palustre, ironstone, and graphite; along most of the beaches, rocks absolutely studded with garnets of a clear and brilliant color; at Winter island, several fine specimens of madrepore, some curious pieces of steatite, (soapstone,) fine specimens of asbestos and octynolite; on the mainland, opposite to Bouvier island, some verdigris substance among reddish sandstone, variegated with serpentine; and at Lidlon island a species of ironstone, which, from its weight, appeared to be a rich ore, a good deal of asbestos, black slate, and indications of coal.\n\nDuring his second voyage for the discovery of the northwest passage, Sir John Ross observed copper ore and agate at Agnew river, and gypsum, red marl, a rock studded with garnets, and white, pink, and yellow quartz, at Elizabeth harbor.\n\nFranklin and Richardson, in their joint expeditions through the heart of the territory and along its Arctic shores, discovered, on the banks of Hill river, beds of quartz rocks containing precious garnets, also mica slate; at Knee lake, primitive greenstone with disseminated iron pyrites; at Trout river, magnetic iron ore and well crystalized precious garnets; at Lake Winnipeg, a beautiful china-like chert, and \"arenaceous deposits and rocks having a close resemblance to those of Pigeon bay, of Lake Superior, where argentiferous veins occur;\" at Cumberland House, on the Saskatchewan, salt and sulphur springs and coal; at Elk river, bitumen in such quantity as to flow in streams from fissures in the rock; upon the shores of Lake Athabasca, the finest plumbago and chlorite slate.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Sir R. Murchison, Sir John Richardson says that \"towards the mouth of the Coppermine river there are magnificent ranges of trap, with ores of lead and copper, including much malachite.\" He also states that a rolled piece of chromate of iron was picked up there, \"which is a mineral very valuable on account of the beautiful pigments which are manufactured from it.\" From the Rocky mountains Sir John Richardson obtained a specimen of a pearl-grey semi-opal, resembling obsidian; also some plumbago and specular iron. Referring to the country about Slave river, he says: \"The great quantity of gypsum in immediate connexion with extremely copious and rich salt springs, and the great abundance of petroleum in this formation, together with the arenaceous, soft, marly, and brecciated beds of dolomite, and, above all, the circumstance of the latter being by far the most common and extensive rock in the deposit led me to think that the limestone of the Elk and Slave rivers was equivalent to the sechstein of the continental geologists.\" The salt springs, situated further to the south, from which large quantities of pure common salt are deposited, Sir John Richardson classes as belonging to the celebrated Onondago salt group of the New York Helderberg series. By Sir William Logan's report it appears that from the latter springs \"no less than 3,134,317 bushels of salt were profitably manufactured in 1851.\" From the many valuable salt springs which exist throughout the Hudson bay territory the finest salt could be obtained, which article would of itself become a considerable source of wealth were the country occupied by settlers in any number, and were the valuable and varied fisheries of its coast and rivers prosecuted to any extent.\n\nThe following are some of the specimens which were collected by Captain Back in his journey from Great Slave lake, down the Great Fish river, to the Arctic sea, in 1834: Loose worn pebbles of blueish-gray chalcedony, brown\njasper, and fragments of a conglomerate, consisting of portions of reddish jasper, flinty slate, and quartz of various hues of gray and brown, a variegated marl of a greenish-gray color.\n\nOf the mineral wealth of a large portion of the territory Sir John Richardson thus speaks in general terms, in a communication published in the Journal of the Geographical Society for 1845: \"The countries, by the expeditions of Sir John Franklin and Captain Back, are rich in minerals; inexhaustible coal fields skirt the Rocky mountains through twelve degrees of latitude; beds of coal crop out to the surface on various parts of the Arctic coast; veins of lead ore traverse the rocks of Coronation Gulf, and the Mackenzie river flows through a well-wooded tract, skirted by metalliferous ranges of mountains, and offers no obstruction to steam navigation for upwards of twelve hundred miles.\"\n\nThe gold discoveries in the ranges of the Rocky mountains are so remarkable as to require a separate consideration at a later stage of this report.\n\nPART II.\n\nTHE HISTORY AND ORGANIZATION OF THE HUDSON BAY COMPANY.\n\nIt has already been shown that the Hudson Bay Company no longer holds a license of exclusive trade with the Indians in Northwest British America. This expired in June, 1859, and Sir E. B. Lytton, then colonial secretary, interposed to prevent its renewal. Upon the Pacific coast and in the valley of the Mackenzie the company has no privileges over individuals, either in respect to trade or territorial dominion. A proprietary right to the scattered trading posts, as inclosures of land, will doubtless be recognized as surveys are extended.\n\nOver the shores of the Hudson bay and the districts drained by all its tributaries the company claims exclusive proprietary right\u2014to be absolute lord of the soil. I annex an abstract of the royal charter, which is the foundation of this claim to the country, known as Rupert's Land or Hudson Bay Territory.\n\nThe company's charter of incorporation is dated May 2, 1670, in the 22d year of King Charles the Second. It is given at length in the Parliamentary paper No. 547, sess. 1842. The preamble states that certain persons, seventeen in number, to wit, Prince Rupert, Christopher, (Duke of Albermarle,) William, (Earl of Craven,) Henry Lord Arlington, Antony Lord Ashley, Sir John Robinson, Sir Robert Vyner, Sir Peter Colleton, Sir Edward Hungerford, Sir Paul Kneele, Sir John Griffith, Sir Philip Carteret, James Hayes, John Kiske, Francis Millington, William Prettyman, and John Fenn, esquires, and John Portman, citizen and goldsmith, \"have, at their own cost and charges, undertaken an expedition to Hudson bay, in the northwest part of America, for the discovery of a new passage into the South sea, and for the finding of some trade for furs, minerals, and other considerable commodities; and by such their undertaking have already made such discoveries as to encourage them to proceed further in pursuance of their said design, by means whereof there may probably arise a very great advantage to us and our kingdom;\" and had therefore petitioned for a charter of incorporation. On these considerations, his Majesty \"being desirous\" to promote all endeavors tending to \"the public good,\" proceeds to incorporate the persons aforesaid under the title of \"The governor and company of adventurers of England trading into Hudson bay,\" with \"perpetual succession\" and all customary corporate privileges, appointing Prince Rupert the first governor thereof, and seven of the other petitioners the first committee.\n\nThe charter confers the \"sole trade and commerce of all those seas, straits, bays, rivers, lakes, creeks, and sounds, in whatsoever latitude they shall be, that lie within the entrance of the straits commonly called Hudson's straits, together with all the lands and territories, coasts and confines of the seas, bays,\nlakes, rivers, creeks, and sounds aforesaid, that are not already actually possessed by or granted to any of our subjects, or possessed by the subjects of any other Christian prince or State.\"\n\nIn a subsequent part of the charter the grant is extended to \"all havens, bays, creeks, rivers, lakes, and seas, into which they (the company) shall find entrance or passage by water or land, out of the territories, limits, or places aforesaid,\" which, taken literally, may mean not only the whole continent of America, but the whole world, or at least such portions of both as were not \"possessed by the subjects of any other Christian prince or state.\" All the earth was clearly accessible by land or water from Hudson bay. Coupled with the grant there was the reservation that the territories should \"be from henceforth reckoned and reputed as one of our plantations or colonies in America, called Rupert's Land,\" but the governor and company for the time being, and in all time, were declared to be \"true and absolute lords and proprietors of the same territory,\" holding it as the \"manor of East Greenwich,\" and paying for it yearly \"two elks and two black beavers, whosoever and as often as we, our heirs and successors, shall happen to enter\" into the said countries, territories, and regions hereby granted.\n\nThe authority of the company rests upon this charter, but in 1690 the company sought for and obtained an act of Parliament to confirm it. In the body of this act the confirmation is \"forever;\" but whilst the bill was passing through Parliament the Commons limited it to \"ten years,\" the Lords to \"seven;\" and the bill ultimately passed with the following rider: \"Provided always, That this act shall continue in force for the term of seven years, and from thence to the end of the next session of Parliament, and no longer.\"\n\nAt the end of the seven years the company introduced a new bill, but, apprehending a defeat, withdrew it; and from that day to this it has relied solely for all its assumed territorial and trading rights over Rupert's Land to its original charter.\n\nThe claim of England to Hudson bay was founded upon a presumed discovery of Henry Hudson, who, in 1610, was the first navigator that sailed into the strait that leads into the bay. It does not appear that he sailed into the bay, for his crew, having mutinied, cast him adrift somewhere in the entrance of the strait, and he was never again heard of. The French, however, according to Charlevoix, vol. 1, page 476, had discovered Hudson bay at an earlier period, having arrived at its shores through means of the river flowing into James's bay from the countries lying to the eastward and northward of Quebec. And the French had likewise penetrated, by means of the St. Lawrence and the great lakes, to those vast countries lying to the westward of Hudson bay, and even as far as the Pacific. At all events, the French, at a very early day, exercised a control and had acquired possession of the entire Winnipeg basin.\n\nIn 1626 Louis XIII granted a charter to a company called the Company of New France, conferring upon them exclusive rights and privileges, and giving them an absolute control over all the country of New France, called Canada, (dite Canada,) and the boundaries decided in that act or charter are definite, certain, and explicit, and are almost precisely those by which the Hudson Bay Company describe what they call their territories in more recent times. In 1670, forty-three years subsequent to the grant of the French monarch, and whilst France continued in the possession of Hudson bay and all the country west of it, Charles the Second of England made the great charter already mentioned.\n\nThe geographical knowledge of Charles, though very limited and imperfect as regards those straits, was evidently not so circumscribed but that some idea existed that they might lead to the possession of some other power, for a proviso exists in the charter excluding from the operations of the grant \"all lands, &c., possessed by the subjects of any other Christian prince or state.\" The\ncompany, however, acting under the charter, built forts on the shores of Hudson bay, in opposition to those erected by the French company, and the trade of the two was conducted amid a continual strife, and flourished until, by the treaty of Ryswick, in 1697, the English forts in Hudson bay were ceded to France. Bancroft, in his history of the United States, thus records the result of that treaty:\n\n\"In America, France retained all Hudson bay and all the places of which she was in possession at the beginning of the war; in other words, with the exception of the eastern moiety of Newfoundland, France retained the whole coast and adjacent islands from Maine to beyond Labrador and Hudson bay, besides Canada and the valley of the Mississippi.\"\u2014(Vol. 2, page 192.)\n\nAs the treaty alluded to makes no allusion or reservation regarding the supposed rights of the Hudson Bay Company, it is urged by Canadians that the charter really had no existence legally, and was not recognized, or it was abrogated by the treaty. France held Hudson bay until 1714, when, by the treaty of Utrecht, Hudson's straits and Hudson bay were made over to England, and that was the first time that she acquired an undisputed right to that region of country, nearly half a century after the date of the charter by Charles II.\n\nIt was, however, provided by the articles of this last mentioned treaty, \"That it shall be entirely free to the company of Quebec, and all the other subjects of the most Christian king, to go by land or by sea whithersoever they please out of the lands of the said bay, together with all their goods, merchandise, arms, and effects.\"\n\nThe French traders, after having left Hudson bay, confined themselves to that channel of trade which the great lakes opened out to them, and passing up through Lake Superior they spread themselves over the country westward, by establishing posts at Rainy lake, the upper Mississippi, the Red river, and on the Assiniboin and Saskatchewan rivers. The Hudson Bay Company then occupied the few forts along the shores of Hudson bay, and for the succeeding one hundred years contented themselves with trading around Hudson bay, and claiming no greater territory than those shores afforded them. In 1763 Canada was ceded to England.\n\nAbout three years subsequent to the conquest, namely, in 1766, many British subjects, mostly of Scotch origin, engaged in the fur trade, and following the route pursued by the French traders carried their enterprises as far westward as the French had penetrated, and occupied many of the posts of these their predecessors in the valley of the Saskatchewan. And they even stretched away northward, and single-handed entered into direct competition with the Hudson Bay Company, which at that period confined their traffic to the coasts of Hudson bay only.\n\nThese circumstances were instrumental in originating a powerful organization in Montreal, under the style of the Northwest Company, in the winter of 1783, and from that date down to 1821 that company successfully competed against the Hudson Bay Company, treating the charter of Charles the Second as a nullity, in accordance with the written legal opinions of the then leading lawyers of England, Brougham, Gibbs, Sparkie, Piggot, &c., &c.\n\nThe Northwest Company was not a chartered one, but as the successors to the old French traders they pursued a very lucrative trade throughout the whole western country, via the lakes, trading to the shores of the Pacific, and penetrating to regions which the French had not reached. Their fleets of canoes, laden with goods for the Indians, or furs for Montreal, traversed the continent in every direction through the connected chain of rivers and lakes from Montreal to Puget's sound. A perusal of Sir Alexander Mackenzie's voyages will afford some idea of the scale upon which the commercial enterprises of the Canadian company were carried on over the western part of the continent for nearly half a century, before the Hudson Bay Company entered there. This latter\ncompany, up to 1811, had confined their claim to the shores of the Hudson Bay, and then, as now, they received all their supplies from England, via Hudson Bay, whilst the Northwest Company took theirs from Montreal.\n\nIn 1821 the Northwest Company united with the Hudson Bay Company, and under this latter name became the assertors of claims which, during the period of half a century, they had always denounced and successfully defied.\n\nThe people of Minnesota, while sharing fully the Canadian opinion that the charter of the Hudson Bay Company presents no valid obstacle to the assumption by parliament to territorial dominion in the valleys of the Red River and Saskatchewan\u2014vesting it in a provincial government\u2014by no means assent to the denunciations of that remarkable organization. Its numerous posts exercise a wholesome police over the Indian tribes; under the protection of its officers scientific investigation has been prosecuted in all directions; travellers are always assured of humane and hospitable treatment; and missionary enterprises receive efficient encouragement. There is reason to believe that the leading men of the company, both in England and northwest America, only need to be satisfied that an energetic colonization will succeed their present occupation, when they will cheerfully accept a parliamentary adjustment of their possessory rights, and co-operate in the establishment of representative institutions and in whatever measures will contribute to the material development of agricultural and mineral resources. The members of the company who reside in America can readily perceive how they may receive an hundred fold more advantage as proprietors of future cities and towns than as incorporated fur-traders. Fort William on Thunder-bay, Lake Superior, north shore; Fort Francis on Rainy river; Fort Garry on Red River; Carlton, Pitt, and Edmonton on the north Saskatchewan; Chesterfield on its south branch; and other points on the Pacific slope will be the scenes of operations far more remunerative and exciting than these trading posts have ever before witnessed.\n\nMany particulars of the policy of the Hudson Bay Company can be more properly presented in connexion with the narrative of the Selkirk settlement.\n\nPART III.\n\nSELKIRK SETTLEMENT\u2014ITS FOUNDATION, INSTITUTIONS, AND AGRICULTURE.\n\nThis interesting community, which for nearly half a century has occupied the interior of British America, isolated until lately from all the activities and excitements of the world, is so closely related in its early annals to the French and English colonization of the continent, and the struggles for the fur trade of the north, that some repetition of historical statements already made will be unavoidable in the present connexion.*\n\nEARLY SETTLEMENT OF SELKIRK.\n\nOver one hundred years ago French adventurers, eager to extend the area of their fur trade and the limits of the French dominions, pushed their explorations through the rivers which debouch on the northern shore of Lake Superior beyond Winnipeg. In an old map reproduced in Mr. Neill's history of Minnesota, and dated as early as 1762, Fort La Reine is designated at the confluence of the Assiniboine and Red rivers, where the *courreurs des bois* from the French establishment at Mackinac used to trade with the Omahas and Assinniboons. A\n\n---\n\n* I am greatly indebted to the successive publications of Hon. J. A. Wheelock, commissioner of statistics of the State of Minnesota, for the materials of this chapter. Mr. Wheelock's annual publications for 1860-'61 exhibit an intelligent appreciation of the new epoch of development which has become imminent in northwest British America, and the magnitude of commercial and social results to the adjacent American States.\nsimilar trading station at the same period existed on the east side of Lake Winnipeg, and another on the Lake of the Woods.\n\nThomas Ourry, a Canadian trader, who ascended the Saskatchewan in 1776, was the first who advanced beyond Lake Winnipeg with a view to traffic. The profits of his voyage encouraged others to follow his example. Their success aroused the jealousy of their English competitors, who had established a traffic on the shores of Hudson bay, and gave rise to a long series of disorders and excesses. Joseph Frobisher and his brother, who went beyond the fifty-ninth degree of latitude to Churchill and l'\u00cele la Crosse, and Peter Pond, who in 1778 entered English river and the river L'Original, where he passed the winter, are the principal names associated with the earlier explorations of this country. In 1781 four canoes filled with traders ascended the Saskatchewan to the highlands which divide its sources from the valley of the Mackenzie. In 1783 the Northwest Company, principally composed of the persons already mentioned, was organized, and waged a bitter competition with numerous rivals. In 1787 the several fur companies, who had been contending for the exclusive trade of the Indians of the northwest, consolidated under the name of the Northwest Company, which then had only one remaining rival in the Hudson Bay Company.\n\nThe latter corporation, whose charter dated back to the reign of Charles II, in 1670, had not yet extended their establishments into this region, and the Northwest Company enjoyed an undisturbed monopoly of the lucrative trade which the French had resigned into their hands. Their dream of exclusive dominion was, however, soon ended.\n\nIn 1805 Lord Selkirk, a benevolent but impracticable Scotchman, and a member of the Hudson Bay Company, who had penetrated into this region, was so struck with its beauty and fertility and the mildness of its climate, that he conceived the project of planting colonies here whose growth should compensate the British crown for the recent loss of the united colonies, and he wrote several tracts urging the superiority of this region for the British emigrant over any portion of the United States. In 1811 he succeeded in obtaining for colonization a grant of land on the Red River from the Hudson Bay Company, which was at the same time aroused by his representations to the necessity of extending their jurisdiction over a country so rich in furs and of securing its trade to themselves.\n\nIn the autumn of the following year a small detachment of emigrants, whom Lord Selkirk had collected from the highlands of Scotland, after a long and toilsome journey, which must have been terrible in the vast solitudes through which it led them and to which it led, arrived on the banks of the Red River, near its confluence with the Assiniboine. There they commenced building houses, when their work was stopped by a party of men in the service of the Northwest Company, who, disguised in Indian costume, ordered them to desist. Frightened by their menaces, they were induced to take refuge at Pembina. Their guides, as savage in disposition as in their assumed dress, tyrannized without mercy over the affrighted colonists, robbing them of whatever they most prized, and found a cruel sport in the alarm they caused the mothers by pretending to run off with their children. Several of the more delicate died under the shock of this inhuman treatment. The winter having been passed in tents at Pembina, they were permitted to return to their settlements in the spring. Their labors were about to be rewarded with an abundant harvest, when it was destroyed by birds. The next winter was again passed at Pembina, and when they returned to their settlements in the spring they were in a condition of abject poverty.\n\n\"By the month of September, 1815,\" says the Reverend E. D. Neill, the historian of Minnesota, \"the number of settlers was about two hundred, and the colony was called Kildonan, after the old parish in Scotland in which many were born. With increased numbers all seemed auspicious. Houses were built,\na mill erected, and imported cattle and sheep began to graze on the undulating plains.\"\n\nBut avarice and jealousy followed them even to these solitudes. The Northwest Company never looked with favor on the growth of the settlement, which was regarded as a scheme of their rivals of the Hudson Bay Company to dispossess them of the lucrative posts which they occupied in the neighborhood; and in the summer of 1814 Duncan Cameron and Alexander McDonnel were appointed at a meeting of the partners of the company to concert measures to stop the progress of the colony. In pursuance of this design, Cameron, who spoke the Gaelic with fluency, artfully insinuated himself into the confidence of the Highlanders, and without evincing direct hostility to the plans of Selkirk, gradually sowed the seeds of disaffection in the settlement, which, in the spring of 1815, culminated in the desertion of a number of the colonists to the quarters of the Northwestern Company, whose employ\u00e9s in the meanwhile had broken open the storehouse of the colony and carried away their field pieces. Endeavors were also made, with partial success, to excite the minds of the Indians against the settlers.\n\nA murderous attack was made by the Northwest party on the governor's house, who was seized and carried off to Montreal by Cameron. McDonnel followed up this outrage with a series of aggressions on the settlers. Persecuted to extremity, they were again forced to abandon their homes. About this time, says Mr. Neill, toward the latter part of the pleasant month of June, two Ojibwa chiefs arrived with forty braves and offered to escort the persecuted settlers, with their property, to Lake Winnipeg.\n\nGuarded by the grim children of the forest from the assaults of their foes, they, like the Acadian peasants in \"Evangeline,\" were \"friendless, homeless, hopeless.\" The mournful picture of the Acadian expatriation was mournfully fulfilled, even in the sad sight of their dwellings wrapped in the flames which the incendiary's torch had lighted.\n\nIn the following spring the fugitives returned to their colony under the protection of an officer of the Hudson Bay Company, who arrested Cameron and sent him to England for trial.\n\nIn the meantime the Earl of Selkirk, learning of the distresses of the colonists, sailed for America. He arrived at New York in the fall of 1815, where rumors of their defection reached him, and in the following spring he set out for the colony with a military escort, which he had organized from some disbanded military companies. At Sault St. Marie tidings of new disasters reached him. Semple, the governor of the territory of the Hudson Bay Company, who had but just taken possession of his new quarters on Red River, was attacked by a party of the employ\u00e9s of the Northwestern Company and killed, with a number of his men, in the affray.\n\nThe settlers were again expelled from their homes by the victorious marauders, and were already on their way to the sea-coast, when they were recalled by the welcome news of Selkirk's approach. A reinforcement of emigrants, sent to the colony under his direction, had preceded him. Incensed at the atrocities which had been perpetrated by the agents of the Northwestern Company, he had proceeded with his force to the headquarters of that company, at Fort William, on Lake Superior, and, having apprehended the principal parties, sent them to Montreal for trial.\n\nHis arrival at Red River soon retrieved the affairs of the colony, and he left it the following year in a flourishing condition.\n\nOwing, however, to the scarcity of seed, which was the natural consequence of the difficulties already stated, the harvest of 1817, though the yield was prolific, was insufficient to supply the wants of the increasing population, and hunting was again resorted to for subsistence. They set out in December across the plains to join a distant camp of Pembina half-breed hunters and Indians.\nThey reached it, after a journey of terrible suffering, to find the Buffalo scarce, and the camp subsisting upon scanty fare. Spring renewed their hopes. The summer was propitious. The harvest was already ripe for the sickle, when a new and terrible calamity befell them.\n\nIt was at this epoch, in the summer of 1818, that the grasshoppers, which, for the past and present years, have again devastated those settlements, and extended their depredations over a considerable part of Minnesota, made their first recorded appearance in that region. The vast armies of these insects darkened the air, and passed over the land like a consuming fire, licking up every green thing. The next year (1819) the havoc was even worse. \"They were produced,\" says Ross, \"in masses two, three, or four inches in depth. The water was infected with them. Along the river they were to be found in heaps like sea-weed, and might be shovelled with a spade. Every vegetable substance was either eaten up or stripped to the bare stalk. The bark of trees shared the same fate. Even fires, if kindled out of doors, were immediately extinguished by them.\"\n\nThe hunter's life alone seemed left to the despairing colonists, but one more effort was made to retrieve their condition. During the winter of 1819-'20 a deputation of settlers travelled a thousand miles on snow shoes across Minnesota to Prairie du Chien for seed. The details of the return trip in the spring of 1820 are highly interesting. Three Mackinac boats laden with wheat, oats, and peas started, on the 15th of April, from Prairie du Chien for the Selkirk settlements on Red River. \"On the third day of May the boats passed through Lake Pepin; the voyage was continued on Minnesota river to Big Stone lake, from which a portage was made into Lac Traverse, a mile and a half distant, the boats being moved across on rollers.\" On the third day of June the party arrived at Pembina, where, on opposite sides of the stream of that name, the Hudson Bay and Northwest Companies had rival trading posts. This eventful voyage is one of the most striking incidents in the chronicles of the settlement, and, as remarked by Governor Sibley in an address delivered by him, \"is worthy of note, as it is the only instance of heavy articles being transported the entire distance from Prairie du Chien to the Red River by water, with the exception of the narrow portage between Big Stone lake and Lake Traverse.\"\n\nThe next two years of continued prosperity repaired the disasters which had heretofore assailed the colony. In 1821 the two great rival trading companies, tired of useless bloodshed and expensive strife, consolidated, under the name of the Hudson Bay Company, and their union seemed to secure the future peace and safety of the settlement.\n\nIn the same year a number of Swiss arrived in the colony. Clockmakers in profession, the new pursuits to which they were called were not congenial to them. Like the Swiss soldiers of Napoleon, they grew homesick, and pined for their native mountain homes.\n\nThe settlement was not done with calamity. Misfortune, which had pursued it in every form, in each successive visit took shapes more appalling than the last. The winter and spring of 1825-'26 brought a fresh train of disasters. In the month of December a furious storm overtook a large party of buffalo hunters in the northern plains of Minnesota, and drove the buffalo out of their reach. Relying solely on the flesh of this animal for subsistence, cut off by the wide waste of deep snows from the nearest settlement at Pembina, nearly 200 miles distant, they had no resource in this emergency. Starvation stared them in the face. Fuel was as inaccessible as food. Imprisoned in the deep snows, overwhelmed with cold and hunger, numbers perished in the camp, or in a vain attempt to reach Pembina, before rumors of their situation reached the colony.\n\nThe calamities of the settlers reached their climax in the ensuing spring, when the melting snows poured their torrents into the streams. The year 1826 is\nmemorable in their calendar as the year of the flood. On the 2d of May the Red River rose nine feet in twenty-four hours, and by the 5th the level plains were submerged. The waters continued to rise till the 21st, when houses and barns were swept off in the deluge. The settlers fled to the distant hills, whence the waters swept over the wide plains as far as the eye could see. The flood abated in June, \"and such,\" says Mr. Neill, \"is the surprising quickness with which vegetation matures five degrees of latitude north of St. Paul, that wheat planted on the 22d of June came to maturity.\"\n\nThe discontented Swiss, driven from their homes by the flood, did not return to the settlement, but departed for the United States and settled at different points on the banks of the Mississippi. It is a curious historical fact, that the first emigrants to Minnesota were the Swiss refugees from Red River, in 1826, who opened farms on the present site of St. Paul and near Fort Snelling; and according to our historian, should be recognized as the first actual settlers of the State.\n\nSince this destructive inundation no event has occurred in the history of the settlement to interrupt the calm course of its prosperity, until the year 1852 brought another recurrence of the deluge which had swept over the plains twenty-six years before. The waters in that year rose a foot higher than in 1826. In consequence of the exposure of the settlement at Pembina to these ruinous casualties, a new site was selected for the Catholic missions at that place, near Mount Pembina, forty miles distant, at a place called St. Joseph.\n\nA visit of Colonel Sumner, of the United States army, to Pembina, in 1844, to stop the encroachments of the British half-breeds on the buffalo ranges of Minnesota, and Governor Ramsey, in 1851, to make a treaty with the Upper Chippewas; an occasional battle with the Yancon Sioux; the arrival of a new missionary, or the visit of an explorer; the success or failure of a season's hunt, and the yearly expeditions from the settlement to the new cities which have arisen during the last ten years on the headwaters of the Mississippi; the excitement of their return, freighted with curious wares to gratify the fancy of the delighted women and children, are all the incidents of their lives, until the prospect of emancipation from the control of the Hudson Bay Company gave a new impetus and an intelligent direction to the discontents which have been long brewing in the colony.\n\nIn 1859 the introduction of steamboat navigation added to the prevalent expectation and excitement, while, in 1862, the discovery of gold on the sources of the Saskatchewan is a further signal of a new epoch in the history of the community.\n\nINSTITUTIONS OF SELKIRK SETTLEMENT.\n\nGovernment.\u2014The settlements upon the Red River of the North, from the international boundary at Pembina to the mouth of the river in Lake Winnipeg, and upon the Assiniboine river, for a distance of sixty miles west of its junction with the Red River at Fort Garry, have acquired a civil organization, under appointments of the Hudson Bay Company, which is officially designated as the \"Colony of Assiniboia.\" Legislative and judicial authority is vested in a council representing the clergy and leading citizens. The officer in charge at Fort Garry presides in council and over the courts, and acts as governor of the colony. Imports of goods, whether brought from Europe or the United States, are charged with a duty of four per centum, constituting a revenue for the support of government. Land can be purchased at seven shillings sterling per acre, with liberal credits and low interest\u2014the Hudson Bay Company holding the relation of grantor.\n\nReligion.\u2014Of the population of 10,000 souls, fully one-half are under the spiritual jurisdiction of the Catholic bishop of Saint Boniface; the remainder, except about one thousand Presbyterians, attend upon the services of the church.\nof England. The diocese of Rupert's Land is only bounded on the west by the Rocky mountains, on the north by the Arctic ocean, and on the east by the limits of Canada; its bishop is Right Reverend David Anderson, D.D. Between the Catholic and Protestant missions, which reach the most remote districts, and exert a salutary influence upon the native population, there are established the most fraternal relations.\n\nAt Red River, almost within sight of each other, are numerous parish churches and schools, to whose influence a remarkable degree of intelligence and morality may be attributed.\n\nEducation.\u2014A newspaper, a public library; numerous and well-conducted schools, and the influence of cultivated and even scientific men, who are often found in this company's service, and who usually retire at the age of fifty years with liberal incomes, founding families at Selkirk, concur with the ecclesiastical organization to produce a favorable condition of society.\n\nThe general appearance of the farms and tenements of the people is identical with the settlements of the Lower St. Lawrence river.\n\nCLIMATIC ADAPTATION TO AGRICULTURE.\n\nThe climate of the Red River valley is characterized by extremes of temperature probably greater than any other part of the continent; while the annual mean is higher than that of the same parallels of western Europe, including some of the best agricultural regions of that continent. The difference between its hottest and coldest months, as compared with other climates of great annual range, will be shown in the following table, as also the difference between the mean winter and summer temperatures:\n\n| Place                  | Annual mean | Difference between hottest and coldest months | Difference between summer and winter | Latitude | Longitude |\n|------------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------|-----------|\n| Red River settlement   | 34.38       | 82.15                                       | 74.61                               | 50\u00b0 15'  |           |\n| Fort Snelling, Minnesota| 44.6        | 59.7                                        | 54.5                                | 44\u00b0 53'  | 93\u00b0 10'   |\n| Green Bay, Wisconsin   | 44.8        | 52.6                                        | 48.1                                | 43\u00b0 31'  | 89\u00b0 28'   |\n| Detroit, Michigan      | 47.2        | 42.8                                        | 40.8                                | 42\u00b0 20'  | 82\u00b0 58'   |\n| Montreal, Canada       | 42.3        | 55.7                                        | 51.0                                | 45\u00b0 31'  | 73\u00b0 34'   |\n| Ozenburg, Russia       | 35.6        | 66.38                                       | 59.66                               | 50\u00b0 46'  | 55\u00b0 6E    |\n\nIt is the excessive cold of the long winter season, embracing five months of the year in this latitude, which reduces the annual mean.\n\nThe mean for the three winter months of December, January, and February, at the Red River settlement, is 6\u00b0 85'. At Fort Snelling it is 16\u00b0; at Green Bay, 19\u00b0 9'; at Detroit, 26\u00b0 8'; at Montreal, 16\u00b0 3'.\n\nBut it must be remembered that the Red River settlement lies upon the very edge of this climatic belt, in close proximity to the arctic declivity of Hudson Bay, and is by far the coldest part of the whole basin of the Winnipeg. The climate grows rapidly warmer on the same parallels westward, even when there is an increase of elevation.\n\nIt is warmer at Fort Benton, on the Missouri, than at Saint Paul, Fort Benton being 7\u00bd degrees of longitude west of Saint Paul, while it is 2\u00bd degrees of latitude further north, and 1,843 feet higher in relative elevation.\n\"The mean winter temperature at Fort Benton,\" says Blodgett, \"is twenty-five degrees, the same as that of Chicago, Toronto, Albany, and Portland, Maine. At Saint Paul it is but fifteen degrees, being ten degrees less. It is not so cold as this on the south branch of the Saskatchewan.\"\n\nThe Red River winter.\u2014Mr. Blodgett claims that the whole Saskatchewan valley has a climate very nearly as mild in its annual average as that of Saint Paul, which would give it a winter mean of fifteen degrees, and an annual mean of forty-four degrees, which represents the climate of Wisconsin, Northern Iowa, Michigan, Western Canada, Northern New York, and Southern New England.\n\nBut, though the winter of this region is a period of intense cold, during which the mercury often remains frozen for days together, its effect upon the physical comfort is mitigated by a clear, dry atmosphere, such as makes the winters of Minnesota the season of animal and social enjoyment. The buffalo winter in myriads on the nutritious grasses of its prairies up to as high a latitude as Lake Athabasca. The half-breeds and Indians camp out in the open plain during the whole winter with no shelter but a buffalo skin tent and abundance of buffalo robes, and the horses of the settlers run at large all winter and grow fat on the grasses which they pick up in the woods and bottoms. As compared with Fort Snelling, the winter of the Red River settlement will be shown as follows, including the months of November and March in the natural winter group:\n\n| Localities       | November | December | January | February | March |\n|------------------|----------|----------|---------|----------|-------|\n| Red River        | 21.19    | 8.31     | 10.55   | 1.71     | 9.9   |\n| Fort Snelling    | 31.7     | 16.9     | 13.7    | 17.6     | 31.4  |\n\nRed River spring.\u2014Spring opens at nearly the same time from Saint Paul to Lake Athabasca; April and May are the natural spring months of this whole climatic belt. The abruptness of the transition from winter to spring in these northern latitudes is a wonderful feature of the climate. In the Red River settlement the mean of March is $9^\\circ 9'$. In April it rises to $39^\\circ 83'$, and in May to $58^\\circ 46'$. Compare this with the springs of Minnesota and Western Canada:\n\n| Localities       | March    | April   | May    |\n|------------------|----------|---------|--------|\n| Red River        |          |         |        |\n| Fort Snelling    |          |         |        |\n| Toronto          |          |         |        |\n\nAgricultural capacity of the summer months.\u2014This rich upward swell of the spring temperature is prolonged through the summer months of June, July, and August, to include the amplest measures of heat for all agricultural purposes. Corn thrives well at a mean temperature of sixty-five degrees for the summer months, requiring, however, a July mean of sixty-seven degrees. Wheat requires a mean temperature of from sixty-two to sixty-five degrees for the two months of July and August. These two great representative staples of American agriculture carry with them the whole procession of useful flora that characterize the northern belt of the temperate zone. Now the mean temperature of Red River, for the three summer months, is $67^\\circ 76'$, nearly three degrees of heat more than is necessary for corn, while July has four degrees of heat\nmore than is required for its best development. The mean of the two months of July and August is sixty-seven degrees, five degrees above the requirement of wheat.\n\nThe following figures will show at a glance the excess of summer heat in the Red River valley above the measures required for the best agricultural development:\n\n| Mean summer temperature of Red River | 67.76 |\n|--------------------------------------|-------|\n| Required for corn                    | 65    |\n| Excess                               | 2.76  |\n| Mean temperature of July              | 71.16 |\n| Required for corn                    | 67    |\n| Excess                               | 4.16  |\n| Mean temperature of two months of July and August | 67 |\n| Required for wheat                   | 62    |\n| Excess                               | 5     |\n\nThe following table will serve for comparison between the summer temperatures of the Red River with the rich agricultural climates of the south:\n\n| Localities          | June   | July   | August | Summer mean |\n|---------------------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Red River           | 69.10  | 71.16  | 63.3   | 67.76       |\n| Fort Snelling       | 68.4   | 73.4   | 70.1   | 70.6        |\n| Chicago             | 62.7   | 70.8   | 68.5   | 67.3        |\n| Muscatine, Iowa     | 66.4   | 70.5   | 68.9   | 68.6        |\n| Kenosha, Wisconsin  | 61.7   | 68.6   | 65.7   | 65.3        |\n| Utica, New York     | 64.2   | 68.5   | 66.7   | 66.5        |\n| Toronto             | 59.93  | 67.95  | 64.6   | 63.98       |\n\nIt will thus be seen that the summer climate of Red River is warmer than that of any of the localities indicated in the above table, except Fort Snelling and Muscatine, Iowa; warmer than that of Northern Illinois, Western Wisconsin, Northern New York, or Western Canada. Its June is warmer than in any of the points given, its June and July warmer than any except Fort Snelling, while its Augusts are cooler than any of the rest. The last-named locality, in the same latitude as the Red River settlement, with a corresponding geographical position, is its equivalent in annual mean temperature; but the difference between the extremes of summer and winter temperature is much less in the interior European than in the American plain. No part of the United States has so low an annual mean. Fort Kent, Maine, with a mean of 37\u00b0, is its nearest approach.\n\n**Autumn.**\u2014The mean temperature for the autumnal months are as follows, compared with Minnesota:\n\n| Localities          | September | October | November | Mean |\n|---------------------|-----------|---------|----------|------|\n| Red River           | 59.26     | 42.20   | 21.19    | 40.88|\n| Fort Snelling       | 58.9      | 47.1    | 31.7     | 45.9 |\nNovember, which in Minnesota belongs partly to autumn and partly to winter, belongs entirely to the winter season in the more northern latitude of Red River. The reader will see that the fall plunges into winter almost as rapidly as the spring emerges from it.\n\nClimate of the Red River settlement compared with Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan.\u2014The following table will illustrate the climate of the Red River valley as compared with other and better known latitudes:\n\n| Months          | Red River | Fort Snelling | Green Bay | Detroit |\n|-----------------|-----------|---------------|-----------|---------|\n| December        | 8.31      | 16.9          | 20.8      | 26.9    |\n| January         | 10.55     | 13.7          | 18.9      | 27      |\n| February        | 1.71      | 17.16         | 20        | 26.6    |\n| March           | 9.09      | 31.4          | 31.3      | 35.4    |\n| April           | 39.83     | 46.3          | 43.4      | 46.3    |\n| May             | 58.46     | 59            | 55.8      | 56      |\n| June            | 69.10     | 68.4          | 62.2      | 65.6    |\n| July            | 71.16     | 73.4          | 71.5      | 69.7    |\n| August          | 63.3      | 70.1          | 67.9      | 67.5    |\n| September       | 59.26     | 58.9          | 57.2      | 60      |\n| October         | 42.20     | 47.1          | 46.5      | 47.7    |\n| November        | 21.19     | 31.7          | 34.3      | 38.2    |\n\nTable showing the means of the seasons for the above localities.\n\n| Localities     | Winter | Spring | Summer | Autumn | Annual mean |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------------|\n| Red River      | 6.85   | 35.79  | 67.76  | 40.88  | 34.38       |\n| Fort Snelling  | 16.1   | 45.6   | 70.6   | 45.9   | 44.6        |\n| Green Bay      | 19.9   | 43.5   | 68.5   | 46     | 44.5        |\n| Detroit        | 26.8   | 45.9   | 67.6   | 48.7   | 47.2        |\n\nThus it will be seen that while the winter curve in the region immediately south and west of the great lakes exhibits an extraordinary depression, its rich summer measures place it in the best agricultural belt of the temperate zone.\n\nBountiful summer rains.\u2014The Saskatchewan valley is a singular exception to the almost universal sterility which characterizes the continent west of the 98th meridian. The great American desert derives its barrenness from the lack of rain.\n\nThe Winnipeg basin, on the other hand, is abundantly supplied with moisture during the summer months, although the dryness of the winter months reduces the mean annual precipitation below that of points lying nearer the ocean.\n\nNo rain-tables have ever been constructed for any portion of this district, except for the single year 1855, at the Red River settlement. The following table exhibits the results compared with Minnesota and Western Canada:\n### Rain in inches.\n\n| Months       | Red River | St. Paul | Toronto |\n|--------------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| March        | .65       | 1.30     | 1.62    |\n| April        | 6.80      | 2.14     | 2.79    |\n| May          | 4         | 3.17     | 4.78    |\n| June         | 6         | 3.63     | 4.07    |\n| July         | 12        | 4.11     | 3.24    |\n| August       | 12.5      | 3.18     | 1.45    |\n| September    | 5         | 3.32     | 5.9     |\n| October      | .20       | 1.35     | 2.48    |\n| November     | 3.12      | 1.31     | 4.89    |\n| December     | .80       | .67      | 3.80    |\n| January      | .50       | .73      | 1.36    |\n| February     | .60       | .52      | .97     |\n| **Total**    | **52.17** | **25.43**| **36.35**|\n\n### Means for the seasons.\n\n| Seasons     | Red River | St. Paul | Toronto |\n|-------------|-----------|----------|---------|\n| Spring      | 11.45     | 6.61     | 9.19    |\n| Summer      | 30.5      | 10.92    | 8.76    |\n| Autumn      | 8.32      | 5.98     | 13.27   |\n| Winter      | 1.90      | 1.92     | 5.13    |\n\nBy multiplying the figures for November, December, January, February, and March by 10, the result will show the fall of snow, probably the actual form of the precipitation in those months.\n\nThe column for Red River exhibiting the moisture of a single year, cannot be adopted as the uniform measure of precipitation in that country; but if, as Bodgelet informs us, a difference of one-eighth will cover the range of any non-periodic variations of the rain-fall in the basin east of the Rocky mountains, (a rule that is confirmed by a comparison of the Toronto column for the same year with the means for several years given in his work,) it may serve as an approximate index to the rain standard of the country. The excessive rains of that summer, which has no equivalent on the continent, except the winter rain of the Pacific, is probably much beyond the uniform mean, or if, regarded as an approximation to a constant term, may be accounted for by its contiguity to Hudson bay and Lake Superior.\n\nA region liable to such occasional rains cannot certainly be deficient in moisture. The reader will observe the great preponderance of moisture in the spring and summer months, with the extreme dryness of winter. Converted into snow, the whole winter fall will be 22 inches, the same as at Saint Paul, while that of Canada is 61 inches, and most of the eastern States 120 inches. This extreme lightness of the winter precipitation characterizes the whole of the plains east of the Rocky mountains, without reference to latitude, including the Saskatchewan valley, and is a fact of great importance in determining the adaptability of those regions for railroads.\nWe have no measurements of the local precipitation of the Saskatchewan valley, but the general fact of a comparatively humid summer, with an autumn and winter of extreme dryness, is well ascertained.\n\nThe rain measures in the elevated belt of country, including the western slope of the Missouri plateau, adjacent to the Saskatchewan valley on the south, will afford an approximate standard for the latter. The following table, compiled from Blodgett, will exhibit the rainfall in the whole belt across the continent, between the parallels of 47\u00b0 and 50\u00b0:\n\n**Rain table, showing the mean annual precipitation between the 47th and 50th parallel.**\n\n| Location                                      | Rainfall (inches) |\n|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| In Vancouver's island                         | 65                |\n| Western slope of the Rocky mountains         | 30                |\n| Eastern slope of the Rocky mountains         | 25                |\n| Missouri plateau to 100th meridian            | 20                |\n| Between Red river and 100th meridian          | 25                |\n| East of Red river to Lake Erie               | 30 to 34          |\n| West of Lake Erie to the Atlantic             | 36                |\n\n**Mean fall by seasons.**\n\n| Season       | Winter fall | Spring fall | Summer fall | Autumn fall |\n|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|\n|              | 30          | 15          | 8           | 20          |\n|              | 5           | 6           | 6           | 6           |\n|              | 4           | 6           | 6           | 4           |\n|              | 2           | 5           | 6           | 4           |\n|              | 2           | 5           | 6           | 4           |\n|              | 3 to 5      | 6 to 8      | 10          | 6 to 10     |\n|              | 5 to 10     | 6 to 8      | 10          | 10          |\n\nA fall of six inches is given by Blodgett, as the mean for the summer in this belt, between the Rocky mountains and Red river. This is amply sufficient for all the purposes of luxuriant vegetation, as is shown in southern England, Prussia, the Crimea, and interior Russia.\n\nBut according to all analogies, the higher summer temperature of the Saskatchewan valley would be accompanied by a corresponding increase of humidity, and this fact is further shown by the permanent volume of its streams in the summer months.\n\n**Results of Agriculture at Red River Settlement.**\n\nFor all the great northern staples\u2014wheat, corn, oats, barley, potatoes, sheep, and cattle\u2014the range and duration of the summer heats form the decisive condition. The data we have furnished prove conclusively the climatic adaptation of the Red River and Saskatchewan valleys to successful agriculture.\n\n**Indian corn.**\u2014The measures of heat, as we have before shown, are ample for the development of corn in this district, and, in fact, some varieties thrive well at the Red River settlement, but it is not claimed as a profitable staple. It is cultivated chiefly in small garden patches for the green ears, but the cool nights of August frequently prevent its ripening, except in the driest soils. Some varieties of Canadian corn, requiring a growing period of not more than seventy days, would, however, form a sure crop in Red River.\n\nIndian corn, indeed, according to Blodgett, is restricted as a profitable staple to the middle region of the west, between parallels of 42\u00b0 and 43\u00b0.\n\n**Wheat.**\u2014Wheat is the leading staple of the upper belt of the temperate zone. The range of wheat extends from the borders to the tropics northward of the parallel of 60\u00b0 north, and requires a minimum mean temperature of 62\u00b0 or 65\u00b0 for the two months of July and August. The whole region between the Red\nriver and the Rocky mountains is embraced between the mean summer temperatures of 65\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, which include also the most fertile districts of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.\n\nBetween these isothermal lines, extended through these northwestern valleys to the Pacific, is embraced the wheat zone of the continent. \"A line,\" says Blodgett, \"drawn from Thunder bay, in Lake Superior, northward, to the Mackenzie, at the 60th parallel, and from that point southwest to the Pacific coast, at the 55th, would include an immense region adapted to wheat, with only the local exception of mountains and worthless soils.\"\n\nRichardson states that wheat is raised with profit at Fort Liard, latitude 60\u00b0 5' north, and longitude 122\u00b0 31' west, and 400 and 500 feet above the sea.\n\nThe remarkable law has been observed to govern the development of the cultivated plants, that they yield the greatest product near the northernmost limits of their possible growth.\n\nThis principle, announced by Forrey, is noticed by Blodgett, as especially applicable to wheat. Central Russia, the Baltic districts, the British islands, the Canadas, and the northern parts of New York and Pennsylvania, and the upper belt of the northwestern States lying upon the cold borders of the wheat range, are the seats of its maximum production.\n\n\"Probably,\" says Blodgett, \"the plains of the Saskatchewan and the Pacific coast near Puget's sound will furnish similar districts. This a priori inference is fully borne out by facts, which prove, moreover, that the basin of the Winnipeg is the seat of the greatest average wheat product on this continent, and probably in the world.\"\n\nThe limestone substratum of this region, with its rich, deep, calcareous loam and retentive clay subsoil, is always associated with a rich wheat development, while its hot and humid summers fulfill all the climatological conditions of a first rate wheat country.\n\nInstances of the wheat product of Red River.\u2014\"Our soil,\" says Donald Gunn, an intelligent settler, \"is extremely fertile, and when well cultivated yields large crops of the finest wheat, weighing from 64 to 74 pounds per imperial bushel. The yield per acre is often as high as sixty bushels, and has been occasionally known to exceed that; and when the average returns fall below forty bushels to the acre, we are ready to complain of small returns. Some patches have been known to produce twenty successive crops of wheat without fallow or manure.\"\n\nProfessor Hind, in his official report to the Canadian legislature, sets the average product at forty bushels to the acre. He notices a product of fifty-six bushels to the acre in the only instance when a measurement was made. Wheat ripens in from ninety to one hundred and five days. It is entirely free from insects or disease of any kind.\n\nA comparison of the yield of wheat in Red River with the best wheat districts of the United States will show its superiority over all others.\n\nRed River produces 40 bushels per acre.\nMinnesota produces 20 bushels per acre.\nWisconsin produces 14 bushels per acre.\nPennsylvania produces 15 bushels per acre.\nMassachusetts produces 16 bushels per acre.\n\nOats, barley, rye, potatoes.\u2014The whole group of subordinate cereals follow wheat, but are less restricted in their range, going five degrees beyond wheat in the Mackenzie valley to the Arctic circle. Barley is a favorable alternate of wheat at Red River and yields enormous returns, with a weight per bushel of from forty-eight to fifty-five pounds. Oats thrive well. Potatoes are particularly distinguished for their excellent quality and large yield.\n\nHay.\u2014\"The grasses,\" says Forrey, \"are proverbially in perfection only in\nnorthern and cool regions. It is in the north alone that we raise animals from meadows, and are enabled to keep them fat and in good condition with grain.\"\n\nIn none of the prairie districts of North America are the native grasses so abundant and nutritious as in these northern valleys. This is sufficiently proved by the countless herds of Buffalo that pasture throughout the year upon its plains, even up to the latitude of Peace river\u2014a fact which suggests an equivalent capacity for the herding of domestic cattle.\n\nThe Red River colony in 1856 contained 9,253 horned cattle and 2,799 horses, which, in a settlement of 6,523 souls, exhibits a remarkable proportion of stock. Horses roam during the summer and winter through the woods, and keep fat without housing or hay. The unlimited pastoral ranges afforded by the grassy savannas of Red River, with its dry winter climate, seem to supply favorable conditions for successful sheep husbandry. This is confirmed by Donald Gunn \"Our climate and soil,\" he says, \"are peculiarly adapted to sheep. There are twenty-eight years since their introduction into the settlement, and I have never seen nor heard of any sickness attacking them. Well-fed ewes produce fleeces varying from two to three and a half pounds. Wethers produce fleeces much heavier. The wool is of good quality, though not very fine.\" An inferior breed of sheep would not be likely to produce fine wool.\n\nPART IV.\n\nTHE GOLD DISCOVERIES OF NORTHWEST BRITISH AMERICA AND THEIR INFLUENCES.\n\nI had proposed under this head to collate the evidences of extraordinary auriferous wealth in British Columbia, but as the summer of 1862 may greatly enlarge the public knowledge on this subject, I only annex a general statement of present developments.\n\nThe discoveries of 1858, in the lower channel of Frazer river, have been pushed to the headwaters of the stream, becoming more remarkable in the remote interior, close up to the central range of the Rocky mountains. This district, which now attracts so much attention, is known as the \"Cariboo Diggings,\" and is being identified upon the eastern flank of the mountains, from which issue the sources of the Saskatchewan; upon the Peace river, before it passes through the main chain from the Pacific slope, and even as far north as latitude 57\u00b0, in the rear of the Russian possessions of the coast, gold fields are known to exist nearer the international boundary, particularly on the upper Columbia and its tributaries; but the bulk of testimony is, that the most extraordinary discoveries are north of latitude 53\u00b0 and in the average longitude of 120\u00b0 west of Greenwich.\n\nMaking every allowance for interested and exaggerated statements, there remain grounds for the belief that the individual adventurer, with no other capital than his labor, has a greater chance of success in Northwest America than in any other auriferous district of the world. Hence, the exodus of population to the mines of British Columbia from all parts of the Pacific coast. The gorges of the Rocky mountains far north of the parallel of 49\u00b0 will be speedily occupied, and commercial relations established eastwardly along the water-lines of the Saskatchewan and the Red River of the North with the navigation of the Mississippi river and Lake Superior.\n\nWith such an extension of population to the interior of Northwest British America, the coast and archipelago of islands in the same latitude and quite to the north of Vancouver's island will also be colonized. Already explorations of Queen Charlotte's islands are in progress, and the Sacramento of the Cariboo mines\u2014the point of most ready supply from the Pacific coast\u2014is likely to be\nestablished at the head of Bute's inlet, from which a trail pursues the old route of discovery by Sir Alexander Mackenzie.\n\nNor will the influence of these northern gold discoveries be limited to the foregoing results, over the area described at length in the foregoing pages, as constituting the arable areas of Northwest British America. The centre of mining activity, as now ascertained, verges upon the valley of the Mackenzie river, a stream sequestered from the world by its arctic situation, but navigable from the Pacific ocean through Behring's straits and the adjacent open Polar sea for an equal period, as European navigators are accustomed to frequent Spitsbergen. Even in Russian America, the Yoncan, which falls into Behring's sea south of the straits of that name, is a river of magnificent proportions. So far as the fur trade and mineral wealth of the arctic district of Northwest America need avenues to the markets of the world, they are thus supplied.\n\nMy conclusion is, that, under the potential influence of gold, great social and industrial changes are soon to occur in Northwest British America, influencing most materially the interests of the United States in that direction.\n\nPART V.\n\nRELATIONS OF NORTHWEST BRITISH AMERICA TO THE UNITED STATES.\n\nFor the present the relations in question are almost exclusively geographical, and such is the tenor of the present exposition. But, from physical soon results commercial and political geography, and the nature of the latter may be anticipated.\n\nCentral British America, with its immense capacity for the production of grain and cattle, has hitherto been approached by three routes\u2014through Hudson's bay, by Lake Superior, and over the plains northwest of Saint Paul, Minnesota. The last named, with the aid of steamboat navigation on the Red River of the North, is now admitted to be the most convenient route. The Hudson Bay Company have mostly relinquished the two former in favor of the American communication.\n\nThe communication through Hudson bay is of dangerous navigation, is limited to a brief season of the year, and is obstructed by the necessity of numerous and difficult portages. The same remark applies, although not so fully, to the route through Lake Superior and thence to Fort Garry.\n\nBy the Minnesota route, soon to consist of railway to the Red river, and steamers by Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan to the Rocky mountains, a great natural highway exists, so advantageous in all respects as to suggest an apprehension among English writers that the destiny of the Selkirk and Saskatchewan district is indissoluble from the Mississippi States.\n\nIn 1862 the railway system of the United States terminates at La Crosse, in the State of Wisconsin. Thence steam navigation to Saint Paul, land transportation for 250 miles to Georgetown, on the Red river, and steam navigation to Fort Garry, are the present improved methods of transit. Beyond the Selkirk settlements the oared bateau and the wooden cart of the fur-trader are the rude resources of the inhabitants. But with the gold movement to the sources of the Saskatchewan, a new state of things is at hand. Steamers once placed on Lake Winnipeg and the Saskatchewan, an emigrant can make the journey from Toronto, in Canada, to the Cariboo mines of British Columbia in thirty days, and at less expense than is now required for the journey inland from the mouth of Frazer river to the Cariboo country.\n\nA London company is already organized to establish this overland route, but the overland emigration from Canada and the northwestern States to the district in question is sufficient in volume to warrant the construction of the requisite steamers for the season of 1863.\nIt would be an instance of well-directed legislation for the Congress of the United States and the Parliament of England to unite in a liberal subsidy, say of $200,000 by each government, for the transmission of a weekly mail from the limits of navigation on the Mississippi river and the British coast of Lake Superior by an international route to the centres of the gold districts of British Columbia and Washington Territory.\n\nSimilar reciprocity of action has led to unity of interests and sentiments on the opposite coasts of the St. Lawrence and the great lakes, itself an effective bond of peace. Why not disarm the whole frontier of the north by constant multiplication of such ties and guarantees of international concord? The preceding exhibit of what nature has proposed in Northwest America is submitted with the hope and confidence that man will dispose of the future relations of adjacent and homogeneous communities upon a firm and lasting basis of natural interest and good will.\n\nJAMES W.
