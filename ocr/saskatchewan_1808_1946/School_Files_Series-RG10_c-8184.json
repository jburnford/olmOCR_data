I have called the principal of the school to know if there was room in the school for such an additional number of pupils. The answer is no. Last fall we have installed a domestic science class in one of the class-rooms; this leaves only two rooms for the pupils. This is sufficient for the actual number of children. In the present circumstances the principal and I do not believe we could accommodate more than seven or eight more children.\n\nIt would be perfectly just and fair to assess a tuition fee for each child if permission is granted. This would certainly be accepted, for every one who came here seeking favour to send their children to the Indian school, were willing to pay.\n\nAttached is a list of the whites living on the Reserve with their ages, names and children's ages.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDr. Michel Tetreault\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 10, 1947.\n\nDr. M.

The upper story of the house, which is divided into two and well finished, is 16 3-4 feet wide by 25 feet long, and 7 feet high, making 2931 1-4 cubic feet.\n\nThe number of pupils at this school being 40 allows each pupil about 100 cubic feet of air in the lower story only, and the upper story, although not used as a schoolroom, serving as a bedroom for the teachers, airs the schoolroom below, so that the upper rooms and the lower one together give each pupil about 170 cubic feet of air.\n\nThe said schoolhouse is in very good condition, having been put in a perfect state of repair only a few years ago.\n\nUnder the circumstances, I am of opinion that it would not be a good time to enlarge the said school, which might suffice as it is without inconvenience for several\nseveral years, but perhaps in a few years, he said schoolhouse will require repairs advantage may be taken of the occasion if it is thought necessary to enlarge the school, as then it would be a small matter to enlarge it, while today to do so would be a much more considerable matter.\n\nI have, &c.,\n\nW.

Our school regulations and the Board of Health require 150 cubic feet of air for each pupil, and the dimensions of the said school do not meet this requirement.\n\nI have mentioned this state of affairs in my last report to the Department of Indian Affairs, and as nothing has been done, I have concluded that any reform or improvement whatever ought to be recommended also by the Agent. Therefore, in your next report, if you think it necessary, will you recommend the enlargement of the schoolhouse and of the grounds, which, in my opinion, is necessary.\n\nI have, &c.,\nJ. E.

In the house there is a small room, 8 X 6 feet. The number of children of school age is 55, and of this number 52 at present attend regularly.\n\nI have consulted the school teacher and some of the principal inhabitants of the village, and they think that an addition of 10 feet will be sufficient. I have had an approximate estimate of the cost made by a carpenter. The making of this addition and finishing it in the same style as that of the building would cost about $175.\n\nI enclose a letter from the School Inspector for this district, also asking for the enlarging of the school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Le nombre a atteint cinquante et un cette ann\u00e9e. D'apr\u00e8s la liste actuelle de l'\u00e9ducation, Mme Jeanne Marie-Josephine, nous avons donc une reproduction respectueuse des grands besoins qui en r\u00e9sultent selon nous adapter les choses au besoin de la jeunesse catholique qui prend part d'une mani\u00e8re bien manifeste \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation.\n\nEn effet, puisque, depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, les parents catholiques, se sont impos\u00e9s le devoir d'\u00e9lever leurs enfants de nos cours, au S\u00e9minaire de Nicolet, les autres, leurs filles, ont laiss\u00e9 de Saint-Honor\u00e9-du-Lac et de Perronville, ainsi que la meilleure preuve de cette assertion digne de remarque. Si Nicole ici avait fait un bon travail, avant l'augmentation de l'assistance, il y a tout lieu de croire que plus d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves empruntent bien plus souvent les institutions sup\u00e9rieures comme elles subsistent encore.\n\nC'est de m\u00eame s'adapter l'augmentation des \u00e9l\u00e8ves qui\nQui dirigeant l'\u00e9cole Catholique de cette tribu depuis quelques ann\u00e9es, \u00e9crivait aux Rapports du D\u00e9partement d'ann\u00e9e pour faire le d\u00e9part d'ann\u00e9e 1846, \u00e0 la page 235 du Rapport, mentionne le nombre total de vingt-huit \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\n\nEn 1846, sous la m\u00eame administration, Mme Doucet Ste. Anne, \u00e0 la page 405 du Rapport, le nombre \u00e9tait de 47 \u00e9l\u00e8ves.\n\nEn 1849, le nombre devra \u00eatre celui de 50. \u2014 Page 483 du Rapport.\n\nCette ann\u00e9e, apr\u00e8s de nouveaux travaux, une augmentation d'\u00e9l\u00e8ve est plus que manifeste, nous avons demand\u00e9, en plus des deux et deux, le d\u00e9part de l'institution actuelle, Mme Doucet Marie Josephine, le nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e8ve \u00e0 atteindre devrait \u00eatre sept.\n\nMais bien que cette augmentation soit de nature \u00e0 encourager tout ce qui tend \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation de la jeunesse, il y a cependant bien des barri\u00e8res \u00e0 surmonter, de plusieurs choses : 1\u00b0 Une institution, une \u00e9cole pour 67 \u00e9l\u00e8ves; 2\u00b0 Une petite maison d'\u00e9cole maintenant 25 pieds carr\u00e9s, dans l'int\u00e9rieur, o\u00f9 se fait la classe \u00e0 une mani\u00e8re de nombre d'\u00e9l\u00e8ves.\n\nEn face de ces choses, trois \u00e9l\u00e8ves pour une institution seule, et un local trop petit pour le nombre et les affaires de l'\u00e9glise, nous avons demand\u00e9 de supprimer ces choses au d\u00e9partement par notre agent qui conna\u00eet les choses afin que le gouvernement puisse y voir le plus t\u00f4t possible et qu'il convienne des \u00e9coles l'automne prochain une nouvelle seconde institution des Pauvres.

O. Carri\u00e8re\nAgent\nAbenakis reserve of St. Francis,\nPierreville, 28th May, 1901.\n\nJ.B. McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nObserving for some years a rapid increase in\nthe number of pupils who attend very regularly our Roman\nCatholic school, whose number has reached sixty-seven this\nyear according to the present list of the school mistress,\nRev. Sister Marie Josephine, we consider it our duty to re-\npresent to you respectfully the great needs resulting there-\nfrom if we desire to adapt matters to the requirements of\nthe Abenakis youth, who take great interest in education.\n\nIn fact for some years some of the parents\nalthough poor have undertaken the burden of sending their\nchildren -- some of their sons to the Nicolet College,\nothers their daughters to convents of St. Fran\u00e7ois du Lac\nand to Pierreville-- this is a good proof that this asser-\ntion is worthy of consideration and if the school here were\nequal to all the requirements of an increased attendance it\ncan quite be believed that still more pupils would be sent\nand also to higher institutions such as those already men-\ntioned.\n\nIn order better to prove the increase in the\nnumber of pupils that have been attending the Roman\nCatholic school of this tribe for some years, on referring\nto the reports of the Department starting with the year\n1891 at page 230 of the report, we find the total number of\npupils to be twenty-eight.\n\nIn 1896 under the same teacher, the Rev. Sister St. Lawrence, at page 405 of the report the number was forty-seven.\n\nIn 1899 the number of pupils was fifty, page 435 of the report.\n\nThis year having seen ourselves an increase of pupils more and more manifest, we have inquired as to the fact, and according to the report of the present teacher, the Rev. Sister Marie Josephine, the number of pupils has reached sixty-seven.\n\nBut while this increase is of a nature to encourage all those who take an interest in the education of youth, there are, however, many parents who complain and rightly so of the two things (1) a single teacher for sixty-seven pupils (2) a small school-house for such a large number of pupils.\n\nIn view of these facts, too many pupils for a single teacher and a school-room too small for the number and for the requirements of health, we consider it our duty to report these facts to the Department through our Agent, who is aware of these facts, in order that the Government may see to them as soon as possible and that on the opening of school next fall we may have a second teacher from the Grey Nuns of Ottawa, and also see the erection of a new school-house large enough for the present number of pupils and even for eighty who would attend school if they were not all crowded together as they are today.\n\nAnd as the present school-house is three feet from the main road and there is no land for a playground for the pupils, it will be necessary also to change the site of the school-house by selling the present one to help in the building of a new one with as little delay as possible; otherwise some of the parents threaten to take\ntheir children away on account of these two facts above mentioned, which naturally interfere with the march of progress and are a danger to the health of the children.\n\nAwaiting a prompt consideration of these affairs by the Department, we have the honour to be, sir,\n\nYour obedient servants,\nJos. Laurent, Chief.\nJos. deGonzague, Priest,\nMissionary.\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\nAbenakis Mission,\n7th June, 1901.\n\nTo Mr. J.D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nSir,-\n\nI humbly beg you to be kind enough to give\nthe most serious consideration to the annexed request made\nby Chief Laurent in the matter of the Abenakis school. I\nassure you all the statements made in this letter are perfectly\ncorrect and deserve prompt consideration on the part of the\nDepartment.\n\nIn fact, sir, it is unheard of to see sixty-\nseven children obliged to be shut up in a school-room of\nabout 20 feet square, 9 feet high, during long sessions of\nthree hours when you know that the Board of Health requires\nten feet of cubic air for each scholar; moreover this house\nis built on the king's highway, and there is not a foot of\nland surrounding it for a play-ground for the children, so\nthat between the school hours this troop of children is out\non the main road, exposed to all dangers, and the parents\nsuffer more than the children. The Agent, who has filled\nand still fills municipal and scholastic offices here, tells\nme that this condition of affairs is intolerable and that it\nis absolutely necessary that this school should be en-\nlarged. A serious embarrassment that was before the Agent\nhas now disappeared in the offer that I have just made him\nand which he will communicate to you himself.\n\nI am confident that my proposition will set\nmatters right and that the Department will order the\nerection of a new building for the use of the Roman Catholic school of the Abenakis of St. Francis.\n\nWith much respect,\n\nSir,\n\nJoseph deGonzague,\nMissionary.\nAbenakis Agency,\nSt. Francois du Lac, 8th June, 1901.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nI have already on several occasions remarked to the Department in my reports on the schools of the Abenakis village, that the Roman Catholic school is too small for the number of children that attend and also that there are no grounds for the children to play in, and before school and after school they play on the public roads, exposed to all kinds of dangers.\n\nThe school site has only a width of 38 feet by 50 feet in depth, and on this piece of land there is the school building and a wood-shed. You can imagine for yourself what remains.\n\nI have already tried to hold negotiations with the owner of the neighbouring land in order to find out whether it would not be possible to make an arrangement to obtain a piece of land for the school children, but I have not succeeded. Sometimes my neighbour tells me that he does not want to sell; at other times he asks an exorbitant price. The present time is an occasion which it would be wise, I think, not to allow escape.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph Degonzaque, Roman Catholic Missionary, makes a generous offer of a piece of land about 75 x 200 feet on the south of the Roman Catholic church property.\nplease consult on this subject the special plan of the reserve and the book of reference in connection therewith made by Mr. C.C. Duberger in 1897.\n\nNo. 4 of the said plan shows the actual site of the school, No.5 indicates the Roman Catholic church property, and No.7 is the missionary's land. The church is built on No.5 and the presbytery under construction is on No.7. The missionary is also in possession of a piece of land of considerable size as far as the village goes, and this enables him to make the offer that I mentioned above. On this land it would be possible to build a school (including outbuildings) sufficient for present and future needs, and there would still remain sufficient land for a play-ground, where the children would be out of danger.\n\nIt is a magnificent site, far from the public road, and very suitable for a school.\n\nI think that it would not be difficult to sell at a reasonable price the present school building, and its site, as a deduction on the price of a new school-house, and if we deduct from it the probable price that will have to be paid to purchase a piece of land to make a play-ground for the present school, it will reduce the cost of a new school-house to a relatively moderate price.\n\nTherefore I think it would be wise, as I said before, not to let slip the present occasion of obtaining for nothing a suitable property for a moderate price, a school-house able to hold the ever-increasing number of children that attend.\n\nPlease take the matter into consideration and give me the views of the Department in this matter as soon as possible in order that a new building may be ready for the opening of school in the month of September next.\nif the Department decides to accept the offer made to it by the Rev. DeGonzague.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Comins,\nAgent.\nOTTAWA, 27th June, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th instant on the subject of the obtaining of a site for the St Francis Roman Catholic school and the erection of a new school building; and in reply I beg to inform you that to properly consider the question of the erection of a new building on more commodious premises the Department should be informed as to the size of building required to accommodate the pupils, the most suitable material for construction and the probable cost; and also how much could be obtained for the old school building.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nS.

Therefore, I think that a house 30 x 40 feet will not be too large if it is desired to conform to the laws of the Board of Health in regard to schools.\n\nIt might be built of two stories; this would not make a great difference in the cost of the building for the present, because only one story need be finished and the second one not until later when the necessity for it shall be felt.\n\nI have consulted some builders here and I am told that the cost of a building of the dimensions described above with one story finished and the roof in galvanized iron would be about $1000.00 in wood-work not including painting; it would cost about $200.00 if built of brick.\n\nI think that the old school-building might be sold for about $300.00, and if it is necessary to buy a piece of land to make a play-ground beside the old building, it would cost from $100.00 to $150.00 without considering the fact that the building would always be too small.\nThe cost quoted is only approximate, but in any case if the Department should decide to accept the offer of the Rev Mr de Gonzague, with the sum of $1,000 it is almost certain that a building could be erected which, without being finished, would completely meet the present requirements; it could be finished later or gradually as the need made itself felt.\n\nWill you please take the matter into serious consideration and obtain a decision at once as possible in order that the building may be ready for the children by the opening of school, if the Department decides to erect one.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Comrie,\nAgent.\nOTTAWA, 2nd July, 1901.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant in further reference to the proposal to erect a new school building for the Roman Catholic Indians of St Francis on a more suitable site, I beg to say that it will be impossible to do anything in this direction at present unless the Indians are willing to contribute the amount necessary for the erection of the building from their capital fund.\n\nThe Department has no money available for such purposes as all such expenditure has to be specially voted by Parliament.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.B.

It is ceiled at about 7'6\", curtailing air space which is far too restricted; has insufficient seating capacity; no ground about it, and the room is badly lighted. My attention was directed to the matter by the Agent and Council and I was informed that the priest offers a site about 100 yards in rear of where the school now is which is suitable and embraces ground for play. It might be possible by taking out the ceiling and moving the present building to provide suitable premises for the school, but I think it would be more profitable to dispose of the old building as soon as a decision to move in the matter is reached and to arrange for a decent building in keeping with the improvements found in the village.\n\nJ.A.

These Indians have $3513.00 to their credit and a suitable building would cost between $1000.00 and $1200.00 and the old building might be sold for about $300.00, which would reduce the expenditure by about that amount.\n\nThere is no provision in next year's estimates for a new building and the money would have to be voted in the Supplementary estimates or taken from the Band funds.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This year, 1902, it is already 68, and in the fall it will certainly be 75, as the absentees are continually coming back.\n\nFor such a number we require also two teachers in place of one; otherwise some of the pupils must be neglected, and it will end by the parents becoming discouraged about sending their children where they will sometimes be without teaching owing to the number of pupils, and there will be danger for health on account of the schoolhouse being too small, having a dimension of only 24 X 30 feet.\n\nThe school-house ought to be 30 X 40 feet, two stories, with grounds 75 X 100 feet for a play-ground for the children, of which they are at the present time deprived, the land around the school being only 38 X 50 feet.\nwhich is reduced by the 24 X 30 feet, the size of the school house erected thereon. The land can be bought\u201475 X 100 feet\u2014for about $60.00.\n\nThe present small school-house, which already requires repairs, might be sold for about $200.00 or $250.00.\n\nThe new school-house of the dimensions above described would cost, owing to the high price of lumber and other materials, painting, etc., $2000.00, including benches, etc.\n\nAs the Department in its letter of last month referring to the subject of building suggests that the band pass a resolution of the council \"if it is possible\", to the effect that it should itself provide the necessary funds to erect this large school-house, we regret to be obliged to say that it is impossible to pass this resolution for two reasons, (1) because, our funds being very limited, this school-house would take \"more than half\" of our capital, (2) because the Protestants of the tribe would be opposed to it.\n\nWherefore your humble wards respectfully pray Your Excellency to permit them to say that they regret very much to find themselves thus always refused in their appeals for assistance, in their great necessities, even in their misfortunes such as the burning of their church, the rebuilding of their old presbytery, and new their school-house.\n\nThat the Roman Catholic school-house, although so well attended, must remain in need and suffering, if a parliamentary grant ($1500.00) is not allowed.\n\nThat in their humble opinion your wards claim that the Abenakis furnish to the \"public treasury\" a good deal of money \"having to buy everything\" like all the other subjects of the Empire, since \"the good presents\" of former times have been discontinued to them, and all their\nhunting grounds sold.\n\nThat not having been able to get any assistance to build their presbytery\u2014a favour that the Iroquois \"who scalped the whites\" were able to obtain ($1000.00) to rebuild the old presbytery of Father Charlevoix\u2014the Abenakis, left to their own resources for five years, have not yet been able to make the same habitable.\n\nThat even their church burnt in 1900 is not yet finished, and debts having been contracted, the interest is accumulating. Nevertheless the Amalecite Indians have been able to get assistance, like the Iroquois.\n\nThe schools of Upper Canada and of Manitoba are also abundantly provided with annual assistance at the expense of the government, which also maintains ours, but that a parliamentary grant, or out of some other public fund, $1500.00 is still imperatively necessary this year for the Roman Catholic school for the Abenakis of St. Francis, which they respectfully solicit from the government of Your Excellency.\n\nThe whole humbly submitted.\n\nAbenakis Reserve of Pierreville\n29th March, 1903.\n\nJos. deGonzague, Priest, Missionary\nJos. Laurent, Chief,\nNicolas Panadis, Councillor.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 24th April, 1902\n\nThe Secretary:\n\nWith reference to the petition hereunder from the priest, chief and councillors of the Abenakis Band of St Francis, addressed to His Excellency, the Governor General, asking for a grant of $1500.00 for the erection of a new schoolhouse on their reserve, I beg to say that there is no doubt that the present school building is much too small for the number of school children on the reserve. The enrolment has reached 65 with an average attendance of from 50 to 55, while the seating accommodation of the present building is not sufficient for anything like that number, to say nothing of the lack of air space.\n\nI may also remark that it is utterly impossible for one teacher to give anything like proper attention to so many pupils, who are graded all the way up to the 5th standard. In Ontario 45 is the maximum allowed any one teacher, even when they are all in the one standard.\n\nBoth Mr Inspector Macrae, the Public School Inspector and the Agent have called the Department's attention to the necessity for enlarged school premises. No addition could be made to the present building as the lot on which it stands is not large enough. There is no doubt as to the need of a new school, - the only question is that of funds. It is\ntoo late for any appropriation to be made this year if the Department were willing to do so. These Indians have nearly $4000.00 to their credit and I do not see that they could do better than use a portion of their capital in putting up a proper schoolhouse, when the Department might undertake to pay a second teacher.\n\nThe Law Clerk informs me that it will be necessary to obtain the consent of the Band before any portion of their capital could be used for this purpose and in February last Agent Comire was requested to submit the question of using a portion of their funds for this purpose, to the Band and obtain their consent if possible by resolution in council for the expenditure of the necessary funds.\n\nIn the petition hereunder, above referred to, on page 2 you will see that the petitioners regret to say that it is impossible to pass this resolution for two reasons:- First because their funds being very limited, the schoolhouse would take more than half their capital; Second, because the Protestants of the tribe would be opposed to it.\n\nI am still of the opinion that it would better for these Indians to spend their money in the manner indicated than as they are now doing, in legal and travelling expenses and as they are well to do, it would entail no hardship on them. They would however, apparently prefer to receive the money as a gift, as wards of the Department, basing their claim\nclaim upon what it has done for other Bands.\n\nThis is how the case stands and if the Indians will not consent to the necessary expenditure they must, by so doing, expect to force the Department to put up a new building, as otherwise the children will suffer.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In reply I am directed to inform you that the Department considers that the Indians of this Band could not spend a portion of their capital to better advantage than in the erection of a suitable school building on the Reserve and it trusts therefore, that the Band will consent to allow the Department to use the sum necessary for this purpose,\u2014say $1500.00.

Comire presiding.\n\nThe Agent read to the meeting a letter from the Department of Indian Affairs, dated the 26th April, 1902, bearing the No. 152859/5, which letter related to the rebuilding of the Roman Catholic school of the Abenakis.\n\nMoved by Joseph Laurent, chief, seconded by Thomas Madoquis, councillor.\n\nThat the Department of Indian Affairs having by its letter of the 26th April last, No. 152859/5, sanctioned the request of the missionary, agent and councillors addressed to His Excellency the Governor General in Council to take means to build a Roman Catholic school-house on the Abenakis reserve of St. Francis, the said Department approving that necessary money be taken out of the capital of the band to the extent of $1,500, the band considering in fact that it is urgently necessary that this new school-house be built as soon as possible; resolved by the present resolution that the sum of $1,000 be taken from the said capital for the purpose above mentioned.\n\nMr. H.L. Watae then remarked to the meeting that the Protestant school-house was also in need of repairs, that it is cold and that it is not situated in a central position, being quite at one end of the village, for which reason he moved an amendment that in place of voting $1,000 only, the band vote $1,250 from the capital funds of the band, $1,000 of which to be applied to the Roman Catholic school and $250 for the Protestant school, in order to\nplace the latter in a more central position, and to make\nthe necessary repairs to it.

Although the sum set apart for the Roman Catholic schoolhouse is not enough for a building of the dimensions required, I would suggest that an Order in Council should be obtained for the expenditure of the amount agreed to by the Band in the meantime.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Je vous f\u00e9licite hautement de votre derni\u00e8re lettre concernant la Bande de Frederic et 1500.00 sur le fonds.

Obomsawin, Abenakis carpenter, and the band, it is very important that we should receive the money mentioned in the contract as soon as possible.\n\nThe contractor is to hand over the school on the 1st or 15th September, and if he is delayed, even a little, we shall not have our school by that time. It is necessary that he should be given a portion of the money to buy materials. That is why I consider that it is very important that our Agent should be in possession of the money very soon.\n\nI congratulate you heartily on your last letter authorizing the band to take $1500 out of its funds. All the Abenakis understood your desire, and I have never before seen such good feeling in the tribe.\n\nAs I have been appointed overseer of the work, I can assure you that I have succeeded in getting the finest piece of land possible for this building on the bank of the river, and that the contractor, Frederick Obomsawin, is believed to be the best workman in the township. I had him to build the presbytery and the church, and I certify that he gave thorough satisfaction. His only fault is that he is poor; he needs money in proportion as he works. That is why I ask you to let us have the money very soon.\nPlease depend upon it that I shall take care that the plan is followed, and believe me with sincerity.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nJos. deGonzague, Priest,\nMissionary.\nOTTAWA 7th June, 1902\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the proposed erection of a new schoolhouse for the Roman Catholic Indians of St Francis, I beg to say that when plans and specifications of the proposed building are received, the Department will, if they are approved by its Agent, instruct its Agent to call for tenders.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary\n\nRev.

[Nom]\nAbenakis Agency,\nSt. Francois du Lac, 16th June, 1902.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter, No. 152859/5, of the 13th June inst., I beg to say that I already sent you lately a copy of the minutes of the meeting of the council of the band held on the 2nd June inst. in which you will find the specification for the new Roman Catholic school-house in the Abenakis village, as well as all details relating thereto; and in another letter some days later I sent you a copy of the plans prepared by Frederick Obomsawin, the contractor, who is only waiting for the approval of the Department to begin the work.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\nNipawin, July 10th, 1902\n\nMr. Lane, Secretary,\nU.S. Department of Interior,\nWashington.\n\nSir,\n\nI received here a letter from Mr. Field, Missionary to the Cree Indians, in the Edmonton Road. He states that he will have his school house ready this fall, so he supposes opening school for September. The Department has not thought much matter its way\u2014no plan made in the meantime. It seems to require a great amount of planning, sketches, and studies, etc., to make things work properly. The people who remain in their lodges and able to act at any time of the year, and do not hesitate, hurry.\nhaving only three months in the year to earn our living in this sparse country far from our homes.\n\nKnowing all that and the vast necessity to have the school more fitted for the next September school term, and as the new house should be large enough, we are now so worried that when it is raining they have to use pails & tins to receive the rain water coming through the roof. The upper floor, where some of the pupils have to sleep away their coats owing to rain seeping through the roof.\n\nFor the construction of this new school house we have been by resolution of the Council appointed to oversee the Rev. Mr. Symonds so that every thing may be completed & made right. The Rev. Missionary having conducted so well the members of the church was the presiding\nThe committee meeting.\n\nThe church & rectory have been built by the same builder, Mr. Smith, and the first job taken by him he took it for $1800, while a French man asked $2500. The work he made in both buildings was very satisfactory, so when he made our bridge.\n\nWe have, so well understood all the particulars of the construction of said schoolhouse, directed by the heads sisters & Mr. Thomas who has charge of said school, that we, the chiefs, missionary and the agent have found that said Rev. Thomas can be paid to finish all that building\u2014a two-story house 30 x 40, with stairs and every thing will painted, after $1500, was surely not too high.\nrather cheap, but as he lives in our village, 1/4 mile from the place where the house is to be built, he can better afford to build it at that price than anyone else, having the right to take some lumber on the Reserve without buying it, I mean some big lumber, one time that will take to pay for tenders, after the plans have been examined and all submitted & the Department wait for the final correspondences, would take a minute time to build the house itself. We have the experience in the construction of the bridge, for which I have had to write from here to Ottawa & Penetanguishene because in summer we are all the Chiefs in the U.S.A. Of course we admire the standing they've taken by the Department who very likely take so much care so that she may\nMay not be cheated, but\u2014in the other hand, when the situation is as Mrs. Lands now, it can treat in its local officials here, the Missionary, the Agent and the Chiefs, that every thing will be managed so as to be satisfactory, the Mission being well able more to oversee & the construction of building, and residing a few rods from the future location of the School house and highly interested that it be well made. And the Department need not fear that any activity be made by the contractor, Mr. Brown, when it is his own money that has to face all the expenses.\n\nI may add here that for the land to build the house on,\nI and the Rev. Missionary have already bought a piece of land at the price of $130.00. We took hold of a chance we met to buy said piece of land whereon there is a house and wood-shed built upon, all bought for $130. We have an offer already to be refunded of our $130 merely for the house; and the wood-shed and the land will remain for the schoolhouse. The fact that this was a good bargain, as $1300. is a good one to build us such a school house.\n\nThe Bishop of Nicolet has visited himself, of late, our little school house, and reported us not to delay the construction of a new large one, having seen the number of children attending. It is now hoped that the Department will not cause any\nAny delay which would deprive us of the time to have that wheel house made, be a great inconvenience, said Frederic W. Borden, for the 15th September meeting, of course if not delayed too much.\n\nPlease drop me a line here or what you think about the matter.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nFrederic Borden\n\nSupt.

The roof is covered with galvanized iron, and finished with a neat cupola. The details of the construction of the building as shewn in the Specifications, are for a frame house of first class construction.\n\nThe Indian Council, the Agent and the Missionary, who it appears, has been appointed by the Council to oversee the work, are very anxious that it should be given to the said Obansawin.\n\nObansawin offers to do the work for $1300.00. I can confidently state that this is a very low price and that nothing would be gained by asking for Tenders from other parties.\n\nThere is no objection, I believe, to the Missionary acting as Superintendent of the work, for, and responsible to, the Indian Council only. The Agent, however, I think, should superintend the work in the interest of the Dept.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Si vous avez une place qui peut \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e, je serais heureux de partager mon lit avec elle. Je serais heureux de partager ma division du appartement.\n\nMerci, je serais heureux de mettre les choses des enfants aussi grandes que possible, ce qui est n\u00e9cessairement limit\u00e9 par un peu la pr\u00e9sence des autres appartements.\n\nJe serais heureux d'\u00eatre de l'entreprenant Frederick Henry, car je ne veux pas de cette mani\u00e8re il pourrait en tenir, ou qu'il est sauvage et guerri\u00e8re blancs ne causent-ils pas\ncautionne \u00e0 parler mais je ne crois pas que cela soit n\u00e9cessaire parce que toutefois nous avons des int\u00e9r\u00eats communs et d\u00e9j\u00e0 faites pour la bande, elle que la reconstruction de l'agriculture est n\u00e9cessaire. Le Colonel L\u00e9vesque, le Chef, le Chef, pourra faire une d\u00e9monstration de satisfaction et les chefs ont une enti\u00e8re confiance en lui.\n\nD'ailleurs en ce qui me concerne il y a un premier point alors que les travaux demandent une tr\u00e8s avanc\u00e9e, et le reste de la situation de l'entreprise (voir devis ci-contre dans le projet verbal de l'assembl\u00e9e du 2 juin dernier).\n\nLe montant de l'entreprise est de $1300.00, mais en avant prendre des fonds de la bande, quelle somme de $1000.00, et un compte de caisse de balance avec la vente de la vieille maison.\n\nVeuillez r\u00e9pondre de suite si vous pouvez le faire, ainsi que l'entretien de l'entreprise \u00e0 Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Emmanuel, sans doute que nous devons faire sur place le march\u00e9 \u00e0 l'avenir, le plus t\u00f4t possible.\n\nP.S.

In the division of the apartments we have tried to give the children as much space as possible, which has necessarily diminished a little the space for the other apartments.\n\nWith reference to the security required from the contractor Frederick Chamsawin, I do not know in what way he will be able to give it, as he is an Indian and no white man will go security for him; but I do not believe that this is necessary, because in several important contracts that he has already undertaken for the band, such as the re-building of the church after the fire of last year, etc., he always gave thorough satisfaction, and the chiefs have full confidence in him.\n\nBesides, we need not give him money until the first of August, when the work will be well advanced, and the rest of the money after the contract is completed (see specification contained in the minutes of the meeting of the 2nd June inst.) The amount of the contract is $1200.00, but we do not want to take out of the funds of the band more than the sum of $1000.00, and we depend on paying the balance out of the sale of the old school-house.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Comire,\nAgent.\nOfficier des Al\u00e9nautes, le 23 juin 1902\n\nMonsieur,\n\nL'Agent Canadien m'a fait parvenir cette lettre. Vous vous ferez remarquer que les chambres de 5 pieds sont trop \u00e9troites. Il faut savoir que ces chambres servent \u00e0 l'\u00e9ducation des \u00e9coliers seulement et que c'est la sup\u00e9rieure g\u00e9n\u00e9rale elle-m\u00eame aid\u00e9e de la sup\u00e9rieure inf\u00e9rieure et de deux professeurs qui ont fait le plan.

Mais je peux engager \u00e0 surveiller la classe et \u00e0 veiller sur elle. Monsieur l'Agent Canadien et Monsieur le Directeur de cette \u00c9cole, j'ai examin\u00e9 le devis de cette \u00c9cole \u00e0 la demande de M. Nicolas et M.

You remarked to us that the rooms of 8 feet are too narrow. It ought to be understood that these rooms are for the use of the Sisters only, and that it was the Superior General herself, assisted by the Superior here and Sister Josephine, that made the plan. These rooms will be quite comfortable for the Sisters, and the class-rooms will be large enough.\n\nNow as for the security, Frederick Obomsawin is a poor Abenakis offering no other than his irreproachable honesty and thorough ability, making him one of our first workmen. Moreover, there is nothing to fear: the Agent will only pay for the work in proportion as it progresses. Then I promise to superintend the work and not to run any risks. Agent Comire and I will, therefore, be the best guarantee that the work of this school-house will be brought to a good termination.\n\nI submitted the specification of this school-house to His Lordship the Bishop of Nicolets, and His Lordship begs you, with me, to be kind enough to send us the $1000 that is due us as soon as possible, in order that we may go on with and hand over the school-house for our children next September. It is of the greatest importance that this school-house should be built at once. I hope, therefore, that you will not delay any more, and that this good understanding with the Abenakis in regard to this important question will be crowned with success by the promptitude with which you will hand over to us what you have voted, namely, the $1000, which we beg you to send us as soon as possible.\nMonsieur,\n\nLauret est d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9e le 15 juin 1897 \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge de 20 ans, laissant derri\u00e8re elle une famille pauvre et sans ressources.

Jos. de Gonzaque, Catholic Missionary\nA. O. Comire, Agent.\n\nand a great number of other members of the band.\n\nThe Chief Joseph Laurent reported to the meeting that the new Catholic School-house of the Abenakis Village is almost entirely finished, according to the plans and estimate adopted last spring, but that there are still certain things which have been forgotten and which were not provided for in the plans and estimate, and which are absolutely necessary to do to complete the said school-house, such as, for example, the installation of a system of hot air heating, the construction of cupboards in the walls to store the linen, closets, etc., and to arrive at this end it will be necessary to vote the sum of $250.00, the balance not yet used of the sum of $1600.00 offered by the Department in its letter No. 152,859-5, dated the 26th April last.\n\nThe Rev. Joseph de Gonzaque also made an eloquent speech in support of the proposition of Chief Joseph Laurent.\n\nIt was then proposed by Louis Watso, seconded by Thomas Msadoquis:\n\nThat the meeting adjourn until two o'clock P.M.\n\nUnanimously adopted.\n\nThe meeting was reopened at two o'clock in the afternoon.\n\nIt was then proposed by Chief Joseph Laurent, seconded by Councillor Thomas Msadoquis:\n\nThat, considering the representations and facts heretofore mentioned, it is proposed to finish and complete the said school-house so as to be able to install the Rev. Sisters to teach there and to reside there as teachers.\nThat it should be asked, as it is by the present asked that the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars be taken from the Capital Funds of the band in accordance with the offer made by the Department in its letter No. 152,859--5 dated the 26th April last, or from the Interest Funds, if they are enough, and that the Governor General be respectfully asked to give his consent to this end.\n\nProposed in amendment by Councillor Louis Watson, seconded by H. L. Masta:\n\nThat in view of the capital and interest belonging equally to the Protestants and the Catholics, the proportion of these moneys belonging to the Protestants be reserved to defray the expenses of their school-house, that is, the sum of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) if the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) is granted to the Catholics, as above asked.\n\nThe Protestants require three hundred and twenty-five dollars ($325.00), or less, to purchase land to transplant their school-house to a more central place, for the repair of the said school-house and in time and when the occasion arrives the Department of Indian Affairs will submit the plans and specifications and estimates of these works.\n\nIn all cases they ask for their fourth part of these moneys and for the purpose above mentioned.\n\nProposed in further amendment by Chief Joseph Laurent, seconded by Councillor Nicolas Panadis:\n\nThat the Catholic officers having already consented at the meeting of the 15th May last to the request of the Protestants, namely, to take the sum of two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) from the Capital Funds before presenting them with any estimation of the supposed needs of their school-house, we consider that the present request for another sum of seventy-five dollars ($75.00) is too premature inasmuch as the two hundred and fifty dollars are not yet expended for the purposes which were set forth to the Council in May last, that not a single cent's worth of construction having yet been made by the Protestants it is\nis altogether illogical to ask an additional seventy-five dollars ($75.00) simply on account of presumptive needs.\n\nThat in support of the principal motion Section 76, sub-Section G of the Indian Act should be considered by the Department.\n\nObjection made by Louis Watso, Councillor, that this amendment be not accepted, as it does not bear on the amendment.\n\nThe Agent allowed the amendment as everyone who wishes can make an amendment.\n\nProposed in amendment to the amendment, by H. L. Masta, seconded by Samuel Watso:\n\nThat, as the Catholics in May last consented to the expenditure of two hundred and fifty dollars for the Protestant School inasmuch as the Protestants on their part consented to the expenditure of one thousand dollars for the Catholic School;\n\nAs the Catholics now ask another grant of two hundred and fifty dollars for their school, the Protestants give their consent under the condition that they also be granted the sum of seventy-five dollars for their school;\n\nWhereas in the absence of the principals they have not had the time to give the plans, specifications and estimates for the work which they want to have done to their school-house, but that they are at present in a position to furnish them approximately.\n\nWhereas the Protestants only ask for their fourth part of these moneys and for commendable ends this Council is of opinion that to do them justice it is well to grant them this that they wish, the same as to the Catholics.\n\nThose who voted for:\n1.

D. McLean,\nSecretary.\n\nSir:\n\nThe Indian Department last spring sanctioned the resolution of the Council of the band appointing me together with the Agent to oversee the works in connection with the new Abenakis School. It is my duty to certify to you now that the building is finished, that the works have been done according to the plans and estimates which were submitted for your approbation, that these works have been scrupulously surveyed by Mr. Agent Comire and by me, that the house is ready to be given over by the contractor, that the latter is not willing to hand over this building before having received the sum which was given him for the contract, namely, $1300.0\n\nthat a Council meeting was held this week by the Chief and Councillors of the tribe before the assembled band, that the resolution asking a surplus of $250.00 from the Government to complete the extra works absolutely necessary to the new school was signed by the Chiefs and Councillors with the exception of one. I also certify that these extras cannot be delayed without great inconvenience inasmuch as we will not be able to install our Sisters and their pupils without this being done; that the band in general desire that these moneys be granted as soon as possible and the $250.00 be taken from the band funds. Councillor Watzo proposed to the Council of the band to pass a resolution asking the Government for an additional sum of $75.00 to the $250.00 granted last spring for the Protestant School. It was objected to by the Chief and by me that a single cent of the $250.00 had not yet been expended and consequently they might do with the first grant, it appears premature to ask for a second without knowing what they\nthey are going to do with these moneys. We are in urgent need, said the Chief, we must finish our school and we have no more money; you others, you still have your money and you have no further need before beginning your works. Begin your works and if you have not enough to finish it I promise to give you all my assistance in time and place to complete your works. I made the same remarks to the band; this appears to me to very logical. Your authority will allow us to do what we want but the main thing is that you allow our Agent to have the $1250.00 as soon as possible in order that the house may be given over to us and that our children may enter therein.\n\nI have also to say that in asking for the extra $80.00 we have forgotten to mention the transport of a shed which blocks the pupils' passage; this shed should be removed. The Chief has asked me to inform you that this will cost another twenty dollars, which will make $100.00 of an extra. I can promise, in short, that when we have executed these extra works we will have one of the most spacious schools in the county of Yamaska. The Member for the County publicly said the day before yesterday at a banquet presided over by the Bishop of Nicolet: \"The Government at Ottawa gives in the Abenakis an example of devotion and interest which we should have for the education of our children,\" after which the speaker finished his speech by congratulating the Government, the Bishop of Nicolet and the Abenakis.\n\nThe Government has given the true impulse towards good and the work which it has authorized does it honour. I hope that it will immediately give us the means to finish it sooner by sending us the moneys which we have asked it for.\n\nWith consideration,\n\nYour, etc.,\n\nJos. de Gonzalez, Miss.Priest.\n\nP.S.- As to the question of the widow Glaude, who took possession of her house after we had bought it by contract, we are waiting for the Hon. Superintendent to designate someone authorized to make her vacate it so that we can sell it immediately and realize some money, which will assist us in paying the $1300.00. Your, etc., Jos. de G., Miss. Priest.\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, 26th November, 1902\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General:\n\nMr. Agent Comire forwards under cover of letter of the 17th instant a copy of the Minutes of the Abenakis Council held on the 14th, by which the Band agrees to take a further sum of $325.00 from their capital funds, $250.00 of which is to be expended in completing the new schoolhouse for the Roman Catholic Indians and $75.00 in removing and renovating the Protestant school building. This grant is required and is made to supplement an appropriation already taken from their funds by authority of His Excellency, the Governor-General-in-Council and will require a further Order-in-Council before the money can be used.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Obumsawin, it follows that the total for things indispensable, or at any rate in the highest degree necessary, as we decided in Council in the presence of the Agent Mr. Comire and the Rev. Jos. DeGonzague, will mount up to $270.00, which, added to the $300.00 to complete the $1300.00, will make $570.00. The Council of chiefs by virtue of Section 76 of the Indian Act, 1856, sub-Section (c) therefore decided by resolution of the Council, Councillor Louis Watso being the only one opposed, to draw from our capital funds or interest if there is enough, to complete the payment of all that is necessary for this school-house. This makes in all $1250.00 instead of $1500.00, which was asked for at first and which the Department was satisfied to give from our funds.\n\nOn examining all these figures the Department will find that $220.00 will be realized by the sale of the school-house which will be made when the Sisters leave it. Again, the $1300.00 contract,- the $130.00 for land,- the hot air furnace for $60.00, and the slight additions in the interior and the others to the exterior, as well as the water\nwater-closets at a cost of $80.00--- will all be paid for by\nthe result of the sale of the house and the $1250.00 taken\nfrom our funds.\n\nHoping that the Department, which was so good as\nto encourage the building under the Rev. Missionary and A-\ngent's oversight, will be satisfied with all that our Council\nhas done in this regard so that the Rev. lady teachers and\nthe numerous pupils which they have may be placed there soon,\nthese $250.00 should be sent to the Agent with the least\npossible delay.\n\nIn awaiting this favour,\n\nWe have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour humble servants,\n\nJos.

The cheque has not been drawn, as requested, in favour of Messrs Laperriere & Freres, for the reason that the Department has not been furnished with a written order from Obomawin to make payment to that firm.

McLean, Esq.,\nSecretary, Dept. of I.A.,\nOttawa.\n\nSir,\n\nAs the Dept. gave me the charge of superintending the erection of the new school-house for the Abenakis last Summer, and as the council of the band also selected me for the same purpose, I have discharged this duty in such a manner as to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and it was I who looked after matters along with the contractor, Frederick R. Obumsawin, through the whole contract. It was I also, with Chief Laurent, who purchased the land from the Widow Claude; in fact it was I that saw to and managed everything until the entrance of the pupils into the new school-house. All that being known to the Agent and to the Dept., there still remains $280 due the contractor, $150 having been taken out of the $1250 voted by the band and paid by the Government.\n\nNow we have the old Roman Catholic school-house which if sold might bring in, I suppose, between $150 and $200. There is also the little cottage of the Widow Claude which we purchased with the land in accordance with the agreement. This little house would be worth about $50.\n\nNow as the contractor is beginning, and properly, to turn to me with his requests for payment of the balance of $280 that is coming to him, will the Dept. have sufficient confidence in me again, to allow me, myself, to look at these two old houses? If I had nothing to do with this charge, and it were agreed to sell these houses...\non credit, payment not to be made till the Fall, I beg\nto say that I should not be in favor of such a thing; it\nwould place me in a bad position, the contractor would\npress me harder; I require ready money to pay the con-\ntractor, who is a poor man. Besides, I regret to say that\ncredit in the band is always difficult to collect, es-\npecially mine, for the debtors count on the fact that I\nwill not take them before the courts.\n\nI ask you therefore authority to sell these\nhouses, and I hope to be able to find the money due Fred-\nerick Obumsawin.

The contractor has already received on several occasions sums on account of his contract amounting to $125, voted by the Abenakis band and authorized by His Excellency the Governor General, the said sum being taken out of the capital funds of the band. Now there still remains due the contractor the sum of $280, and there remains to pay this amount the lot and the old school building and the old house on the lot of Widow Ambrose Glaude, which lot has been purchased for the site of the new school-house. It will be necessary to sell these two old buildings and the site of the old school-house in order to pay the balance due the contractor. We believe that the proceeds of this sale will be sufficient to cover the amount needed; in any event there are several people who are ready to pay the balance due the contractor, provided they be given the lot and the two old buildings above mentioned. Are we authorized, the missionary and myself, by the instructions contained in your\nletter above quoted to sell the said buildings and site\nand to give a deed to the purchaser, or have you new\ninstructions to give us in this matter? In any case it\nis necessary that the matter should be settled as soon\nas possible, because the contractor is a poor man who is\nin great need of his money, and who is paying interest\nwhile waiting. The R.C. missionary, Rev. Jos. de Gon-\nzaque, already wrote you some time ago on this subject.\n\nAn immediate reply will oblige\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O. Comire,\nAgent.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nFor the Deputy Supt. General of I.A.\n\nIt was understood when the contract for the new school building at Pierreville was let, that the cost of the building, over and above the amount set apart by the Abenakis Indians of St. Francis, should be met by the sale of the property referred to in Mr. Agent's Comire's letter of the 2nd. instant.\n\nAs Mr. Inspector Macrae will visit that point in the course of a few days, and has knowledge of the circumstances, I would recommend that he be requested to confer with Mr. Comire and the Rev.

Mr. de L\u00e9visague and the chief of the band, we decided to sell at auction, to the highest bidder, the old school house and its pits, and the old house purchased from the Widow Gaudet.\n\nAccordingly, after the sale had been announced for some days in advance, I met myself on Tuesday the 14th inst. at noon at the door of the R.C. church in the Athabasca village, with the sale at auction of the properties above mentioned, and I awarded the old school house and its pits to Mr. Joe Lauck, the highest bidder, for the sum of $225, which he paid in cash.\n\nI send you herewith a\ncertificate of award signed by\nthe chiefs and myself; we\nmade in triplicate; we gave\none to Mr. Laurent, I said so too,\nand kept the third in the office\nof the Agency.\n\nIf the Dept. thinks proper\nto do so, it might give the purchase\nto Laurent, a title of possession, was\nin accordance with law.\n\nAt a meeting of the council of\nthe band, held on the same\nday at 8 o'clock, the said sale\nwas unanimously approved.\n\nAs for the old house of\nthe Widow Claude, as the bidding\ndid not rise to a reasonable\nsum, it was decided to\nwait until the fall to put\nit up for sale; it is believed\nthat then it will sell for\na reasonable amount because\non their return from the\nU.S., the Indians have money\nand are in a better position\nto purchase.\nHowever, as it is necessary at any cost to obtain $500 to pay the contractor, the H.C. Missionary, Rev. Mr. de Lonzague, has succeeded in giving his personal note, or borrowing from the branch of the Provincial Bank of Canada, at Mirville, for four months, the said sum of $500, and as the bank is not willing to lend for a longer time, I have myself agreed to endorse the note of the Rev. Mr. de Lonzague, in order to renew it at the expiration of the four months so as to wait until the sale of the old house in the fall.\n\nYou will find enclosed herewith the sum of $380, the balance due the contractor, J. Obenauer, as follows:\n\nPaid by Mr. Lauret $220;\nBorrowed by Mr. de Lonzague $55;\nTotal $275.\n\nOut of this amount the contractor still owes Miss Lapierre & Co.\nhis suppliers, the sum of $150.14. I send you herewith the authorization of the contractor, permitting you to make a cheque for $150.14 to the order of James Simpson & Sons, in reduction of the balance of $280, still due him.\n\nI also enclose herewith a similar authorization for the sum of $15, which the contractor owes the Rev. Mr. de Gonzague. Please make out a cheque for this amount of $15, to the order of the Rev. Mr. de Gonzague, in reduction of the sum of $280, due the contractor, and a cheque for the balance to the order of the contractor himself.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAgent.\nMeeting of the council of the Abenakis Band of St. Francois de Sales.

It was only after sacrifices of all kinds that we succeeded in re-building it, and there is still a debt of $1500 on the church.\n\nWe do not wish to expose the school, which cost about $3,000, to a similar disaster through the same negligence that caused the loss of the church, for the small expense of $21 for a lightning-rod system.\n\nIt is true that this expense was not authorized by the Dept., but the matter was urgent, and we counted upon the Department's approving of this expense, and the chiefs did not hesitate to authorize the same out of their interest funds, inasmuch as it was a case of absolute necessity.\n\nWe are very much astonished to hear you say that the benefit of a lightning rod on the building is doubtful, when this is something acknowledged by all scientific men. After these explanations we are confident that the Dept. will no longer hesitate to pay this account.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.O. Comire,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa 30th July, 1903.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to direct your attention to the last paragraph of Letter of the 7th instant, in which you were told that there should be an insurance placed upon the Roman Catholic School at the Abenaki Village, and in which you were requested to report the names of the Insurance Agents in the district, and the names of the Corporations which they represent, in order that the matter might be dealt with. I have to request that you will furnish this information without further delay.

With the same object of making the house warmer, there will also be another small repair necessary to be made in the cellar, where about two rows of brick will have to be placed above the foundation to prevent the air from coming through the wainscoting, which helps very much to make the house cold. Last winter fuel was very dear, it was necessary to use a great deal of wood, and the house was very cold all winter.\n\nThe cost of the repairs mentioned will be about $12, and will be more than compensated by the saving of fuel.\n\nPlease tell me whether you authorize me to have these repairs made.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA.O.

The amount is returned herewith as it should be made out in favor of the person from whom the furniture was purchased and the original account should be retained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

Mr. de Gagnon for the purchase of desks for the R.C. school in the Omenakia Village. I beg to say that you will kindly read my letter again of the 17th inst., you will see that I have already told you that the Rev. Mr. de Gagnon made that purchase without waiting for the approval of the Dept. because it was the beginning of the school year and as the need was pressing. When he presented the account to me, I made exactly the same remark to him that you will make to me, and he replied that time was pressing, that the desks were absolutely necessary, that he was sure the Dept. would not hesitate to pay for them, and\nthat it was for that reason that he was not afraid to purchase them to pay for them out of his own money; and that is why the cheque ought to be made in his name and not in that of her. Octave Laverin of Brockville, who sold them.\n\nI therefore return on the account, hoping that these explanations will be satisfactory.

The old stove is broken, the masonry is falling apart and so no longer gives satisfaction and is dangerous for fire.\n\nThe Reverend Sisters, who occupy the school-house, ask, and properly so, to have the heating apparatus renewed. I got a mechanic to go and look at it, and he states that it is absolutely necessary to have another next winter.\n\nThe following are the lowest rates that I could obtain:\n\nFor the McClary Sunshine furnace, with a capacity sufficient to heat the school, all placed ready to heat, $150; for a Kelsey furnace, James Smart, maker, which is said to be superior, already to heat, $190; these prices include everything, the pipes, work, etc.\n\nNow it is probable that the band will not consent that this amount be taken out of its funds which are already too small. Nevertheless these repairs are very necessary. Please tell me whether the Dept. authorizes me to have the work done.\n\nPlease tell me also what the Dept. has decided in regard to desks for the school, in regard to which I wrote you some time ago.\n\nYour, &c.,\n\nA.O.

The Kelsey is said to be the best. Both these offers include everything, radiators, work, etc., and as the school vote will not stand this outlay, I would suggest that it be charged against the funds of the band under authority given by the Order in Council of Sept. 1, 1901, on file 109950, which provides that such articles as new desks, seats, stoves, stovepipes and blackboards may be charged against the capital of the band on whose reserve the school is situated, instead of, in every case when such expenditure is necessary, reporting the matter to His Excellency in Council and obtaining special authority.\n\nThe best would be the cheapest, and I would suggest that the Agent be authorized to close with the offer of the Smart Manufacturing Co., as a furnace should be installed at once.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The reason for this is that it was rather difficult to estimate exactly the cost of these repairs and as there turned out to be a little more work than was expected. The clapboarding had become loose in a great many places and the paint was in such a bad condition that it was peeling off the wood and it had all to be scraped off, which made it necessary to give two coats of paint instead of only one as we expected to do.\n\nPlease send payment for these accounts.\n\nYours, &c.,\nA.

If it is possible to have both, so much the better; but if on account of the small amount of funds of the band choice has to be made between the two, what is most pressing at the moment is the enlargement of the convent, which is now too small for present requirements.\n\nIf the Department could come to our assistance for a certain amount, as it has already done for the industrial schools in the West, that would be of great help to us; but if we have to count only on the funds of the band for this work, it will be impossible to do all this work at the present time, and it will be necessary to put it aside for a little time and to do only what is the most pressing now what is the most pressing, as I said above, is the enlargement of the convent. Perhaps later on, if the reserve at Lake St. John is valuable and the band can sell it to advantage, it will be possible to do what cannot be done today unless the Department finds the means to assist us in some manner.\nMonsieur,\n\nPermettez-moi d'attirer de nouveau votre attention sur la question de l'agrandissement du couvent des Ab\u00e9naquis de Pierreville.\n\nIl y a actuellement deux choses dont la bande a grandement besoin, savoir : une bonne maison publique et l'agrandissement du couvent.\n\nS'il est possible d'avoir les deux, c'est tant mieux ; mais si, \u00e0 cause du montant peu \u00e9lev\u00e9 des fonds de la bande, il faille choisir entre les deux, ce qui presse le plus dans le moment c'est l'agrandissement du couvent, qui est actuellement trop petit pour r\u00e9pondre aux besoins qui font sentir.\n\nSi le D\u00e9partement pouvait nous venir en aide, pour un certain montant, comme il l'a d\u00e9j\u00e0 fait pour les \u00e9coles trielles de l'Ouest, cela nous serait d'un grand secours, mais s'il nous faut compter seulement sur les fonds de la bande pour ces travaux, il est impossible de pouvoir \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent tous ces travaux l\u00e0, et il va falloir n\u00e9cessairement en laisser un peu de c\u00f4t\u00e9, et ne faire que ce qui est le plus pressant ; or ce qui presse le plus, dit plus haut, c'est l'agrandissement du...\nThat is how the matter stands at present, and I submit it for your consideration.\n\nYour, &c.,\n\nA.

Chene to proceed to Pierreville and make the necessary arrangements for commencing the work and carrying it to completion.\n\nThe Department would, therefore, like you to let Mr. Chene have the two copies of the plans and specifications which were sent you on the 11th inst. and afford him any assistance he may require.

Boucher\n\nI hereby certify that the services have been performed, and that the prices are fair and just.\n\nD. Ch\u00e9nier, Agent\nOttawa, September 32, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department having decided to make provision for a water supply for the St. Joseph's Convent, Pierreville, I should be pleased if you would prepare a plan and specifications for the roughing work required for plumbing.\n\nBlueprints showing the location of the taps, etc., are being sent you under separate cover.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.E. Neffke, Esq.,\nArchitect,\nRoom 26 Central Chambers,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, September 23, 1908.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th inst., reporting that you are unable to procure stone sills of the quality mentioned in the specifications for the addition to the St. Joseph's Convent and asking that you be allowed to substitute wooden sills.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department would like you to make enquiries as to whether suitable stone sills could not be purchased in some of the neighboring towns. If not, they could be had at Sorel or Montreal at from 50 to 55 cents per foot. If they can be obtained at this price, they may be bought and shipped to Pierreville.\n\nDetails of the stairway for the building are inclosed.\n\nThe Department has decided to instal water pipes in the building and the Architect has been instructed to prepare plans and specifications of the Roughing work required for plumbing, which will be sent you in a few days.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nD. Chene, Esq., C.E.,\nPierreville, Que.\nSecretary.\nPierreville, Sept. 21st, 1908.\n\nJ. D. McLean, Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nSir,\n\nAs I have not yet received a reply to my proposal for lighting and for the changes in material which I am anxious to hear about. I would like to add that the Sisters here have no servant and tell me that the only help in the school cannot be trusted for taking care of an acetylene generator, consequently accidents might result. The Missionary here tells me that he would be willing to have the apparatus with a meter in his residence, which is but a few feet from the school and would take care of it himself and pay his share of lighting as indicated by the meter. He would also pay the expense for pipes from his place to the school.\n\nI think this a very advantageous proposal and worthy of being considered by the Department the only cost for the Department being the purchase of the machine and pipes; the placing of pipes in the school. No additional cost would be necessitated for the care of it.\n\nI am, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6103, file 328-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, September 25, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 21st inst., and in reply I beg to say that no communication with reference to the lighting of the St. Joseph's convent was received by the Department from you, and it never contemplated the installation of a lighting plant of any description.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nJ.O. McLean\n\nSecretary.\n\nD. Chene, Esq., C.E.,\nPierreville,\nQue.\nPIERREVILLE Sept. 24, 1909.\n\n351947\n\nJ.D. McLean,\nSecretary, Indian Affairs Department.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated Sept. 22 file 152857/5 and details for stairs &c.\n\nAs to the sills which you ask me to make inquiries about, I beg to say that after doing so in the country and in SOREL, where no such thing could be had, I thought that the expense would be too high in ordering the sills in MONTREAL and it would have taken a very long time before they could be had here on the work, which would have had to be interrupted by doing so. I have put in the wooden sills thinking it would be more advantageous and more economical.\n\nIf the Department wishes more explanations about my doing so I could mention other reasons &c.\n\nI will send in a few days details of cornice asked for.\n\nI am, Sir,\nYour obedient Servant.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6103, file 328-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa 2nd October, 1909.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to draw your attention to the fact that policy No. 501,752 issued by the Caledonia Insurance Company, covering a risk for $1000.00 on the Roman Catholic School building in the Abenakis Village, expired on the 1st instant. Kindly immediately notify the Agent of the Company.

Blondin & Co., of St. Hyacinthe, Que., who are known as reliable contractors, and, therefore, strongly recommended by Mr. Mondou and the Sisters in charge of the school.\n\nMr. Blondin offers to furnish the tools and necessary labour to install the heating system as per plans and specifications which I have prepared, for the sum of $275.00, being much less than my estimate and prices given to me by other contractors in Montreal and Ottawa which varied from $500.00 to $700.00.\n\nI presume that it would be rather difficult for a contractor who pays Union wages, to perform the proposed work for an amount less than $550.00. It is for this reason that\nthere is such a large difference in the prices which were given me.\n\nIf it is your wish that this portion of the work be done by contract, I would recommend that Mr. Blondin's offer be accepted now that all the materials are delivered and the building ready for the work to be started.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Handwritten note]\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr. Scott,-\n\nI beg to ask the Department to grant me a first advance of $400.00 to pay for material and labour in connection with the new heating system now being installed in the Abenakis School Convent at Pierreville, Que.\n\nOttawa, June 7th, 1915.\nMr. J.

Mr. Chivie has done everything in his power to succeed in the work he was authorized to oversee in St. Joseph Academy, and I think it took every cent the Government entrusted to him.\n\nIn the plan of the apparatus, the wash-house built two years ago had not been mentioned; as I knew it was your intention to have a complete work I had a radiator put in that room also and Mr. Chivie approved me for doing so, and accepted the charge of it.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I hope that the Department will grant us this request and also the Electric Light as it was promised us some years ago, telling that as soon as it was introduced in Barrieville you would let us have it.\n\nWe thank you dear Sir, for authorizing the ameliorations and improvements of this season and we hope and expect you will come and visit our reserve next Fall. Nothing could be more agreeable to us than a visit from you here.\n\nI have the pleasure to subscribe myself Honorable Gentlemen,\n\nYour most humble servant,\nH. H.

The work has been carefully and neatly done as you may observe by reading the Principal's letter of August 22, hereunder.\n\nThe whole of the interior of the building has been repaired and painted excepting the Sisters' dormitory. The building has now a new and very attractive appearance, especially the class room and the assembly hall. The reason that I did not allow the painting of the Sisters' dormitory is that the amount for this work was totally expended.\n\nThe old furnaces and piping have been stored in the basement of the old building and are of no value to the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Josephine Sub\u00e9\nMarch 8, 1923.\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nThere is at the Pierreville School Convent a cast iron sectional horizontal boiler, which was purchased in 1916 at a price of \u00a3200.00. This boiler has since been replaced by two vertical round boilers in order to save money in fuel. Three years ago various dealers in boilers were requested to make an offer for the old boiler, but none was made. The sections of this boiler are now in the fuel room in the basement and are a nuisance to the caretaker.\n\nMr. Hamilton, lumber and steamfitter, who had charge of the installation of the new boilers and knew about the old ones being for sale, called at this office the other day with one of his clients and made an offer of \u00a375.00 against my estimate of \u00a3100.00 for the boiler. We finally came to an agreement of a price of \u00a390.00, the understanding being that they are to take the boiler in its actual condition whether damaged or not at the building, and without further expense to the Department. As it is not probable that a better offer will be made, I beg to recommend that their price be accepted and that the agent be requested to have it loaded on the freight as soon as he is supplied with the necessary amount to pay for this work. I shall also arrange to have the price of the boiler paid to this Department before it leaves Pierreville.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The sections would not have to be crated, but the fittings and piping should be packed in boxes and shipped addressed to the Secretary, Department of Indian Affairs, at Ottawa.\n\nYou should obtain, if possible, competitive prices from local carters either in Pierreville or on the reserve for this work.

An electric refrigerator which is a thing of great necessity from the hygienic point of view. We have great difficulty in getting ice and when we get it, it is dirty and insalubrious. You will understand that an electric refrigerator is absolutely necessary to us.\n2. The electric washing machine and wringer is also absolutely necessary. The difficulty that we have to get washer women, makes us to ask for one of these machines which can do the work almost alone.\nHoping that you will take our letter into consideration.\n\nYours, Sir,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

In view of the cost of this improvement, the Department is not prepared to authorize it. You may, however, expend the sum of $50.00 in filling the holes and having the ground sodded. This estimate was prepared by Sister Mary Josephine and forwarded under cover of your letter of April 16th. I am repeating the authority to expend $90.00 for drainage, as indicated in paragraph marked number 1 of my letter of April 30th. You may, also, repair the floors throughout the school building and the teachers' residence at an estimated cost of $50.00. I am, also, repeating the authority to the Sister Superior for school prizes to the extent of $20.00.\n\nI have also your letter of the 3rd instant with reference to the brick work. You may make whatever repairs are really necessary to the brick work and replace the chimney. The cost should be kept as low as possible. I regret that I cannot authorize any painting of the brick at the present time. You should, also, see that the pillars of the verandah are repaired.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst.

I have ascertained myself that their request is justified. The process of cooling by electricity is hygienic and cannot be compared with the present system of refrigerator which offers many disadvantages with regard to sanitation.\n\nMoreover, the Sisters have a great deal of washing to do and it is a painful sight to see them doing this work without using the improved methods and get the benefit of electric machines.\n\nI would appreciate as a high favour whatever you can do to meet with the wishes of those good Sisters.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Thus cold is produced in the refrigerator by removing heat.\n\nThe entire unit which does the pumping is known as a condensing unit. It is operated by an electrically driven motor, thermostatically controlled. When the temperature in the refrigerator rises to between 45\u00b0 and 50\u00b0, the pump is automatically started and continues work until temperature has been reduced to a predetermined level, when it automatically stops.\n\nThis is the \"heart\" of any refrigeration system. An enviable reputation has been established by the superior performance of Copeland Condensing units. Scientific design, high grade materials, skilled workmanship, exceptionally fine manufacturing limits and rigid inspection standards have combined to produce a unit of superior efficiency, quietness, long life and economy.

The insulation consists of 2\" pressed cork board, hydrolyzed dipped and sealed, air space as well as other insulating materials. The lining consists of stainless, white enameled, galvanized steel... The hardware is made of stamped brass completely nickel plated and the latches are the automatic roller type. Each door is equipped with cushion sealed gaskets, which makes every door and joint perfectly air tight. Shelving is made of heavy galvanized wire and absolutely guaranteed not to rust. The above cabinet could be supplied for the total sum of:\n\n$140.00\n\nREFRIGERATION UNIT:\n\nThe above Paris Box has a total of 12.6 cubic feet and would therefore require the use of our standard 1520 Kelvinator Unit.\n\nThe Cooling Unit which is thermostatically controlled, would be installed in the upper left-hand compartment of this refrigerator. This Unit is designed for the use of two twenty-one cube trays and one large deep tray, which is used for making frozen desserts, salads and ice and has a capacity of 24 lbs. of ice per freezing. The sleeve however in which the large tray is placed is so designed to permit the use of three, twenty-one cube trays, in the event of wanting to make large quantities of ice cubes at once, by providing rubber lips which are inserted inside the twenty-one cube copper tank, that will increase the capacity of each tray to 27 cubic. This arrangement would enable you to make altogether 81 cubic of ice, by using all the small trays in the sleeve provided for making ice.\nCOPY\n\nWe would undertake to supply and install the complete Kelvinator Unit for the above No. 40 Paris Refrigerator along with the additional three copper trays and five rubber trays for a total sum of:\n\n$51.50\n\nWe are enclosing herewith literature illustrating and giving a complete description of the Paris Bag as well as the Kelvinator Cooling Unit and the rubber trays above referred to.\n\nWe might point out that the Sorel Light & Power at Sorel are Kelvinator distributors and have every facility for making this installation and also rendering prompt and dependable service, as their department includes well trained, qualified Kelvinator installation and service men.\n\nWe wish to take this opportunity of thanking you for your inquiry and we trust that we shall have the pleasure of receiving your valued order.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nKELVINATOR SALES AND SERVICE,\n\nJ.J.

LIMITED, Fergus, Ontario, Canada\nLa laveuse \u00e9lectrique Beatty avec cuve en bois est une laveuse solide et pratique. Elle est destin\u00e9e pour se vendre \u00e0 un bas prix et \u00e0 des termes faciles; pourtant elle lavera mieux et plus vite que n'importe quelle autre laveuse sur le march\u00e9 aujourd'hui. La qualit\u00e9 et la force du m\u00e9canisme est une garantie qu'elle durera toute une vie. Elle est aussi \u00e9quip\u00e9e avec toutes les am\u00e9liorations possibles pour rendre un lavage simple et facile.\n\n**UNE LAVEUSE QUI LAVE VITE**\n\nLa Laveuse Beatty enl\u00e8vera la salet\u00e9 des manchettes et bandes de collet sans frotter. Elle nettoiera les cache-poussi\u00e8re graisseux des hommes ainsi que les salopettes en 15 minutes. Le majorit\u00e9 du linge se nettoiera en 7 ou 8 minutes. Nous ferons un lavage de famille ordinaire dans une heure. Si les laveuses \u00e9lectriques \u00e9taient vendues suivant la qualit\u00e9 de leur ouvrage, nous serions oblig\u00e9s de demander $100.00 de plus pour cette laveuse.\n\n**MOUVEMENT ROTATIF**\n\nL'action du lavage est la plus nouvelle et la plus vive, invent\u00e9es jusqu'\u00e0 ce jour. Cette laveuse lave de deux mani\u00e8res: premierement, par l'action de l'eau, le linge est continuellement tourn\u00e9 et retourn\u00e9 dans l'eau. Cette action est convenable pour une grande partie du linge fin et d\u00e9licat. La deuxi\u00e8me action est plus puissante et compl\u00e8te. Une grand plaque d'aluminium, plac\u00e9e dans le fond de la cuve porte le linge \u00e0 travers l'eau d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 et de l'autre. Cette action permet de laver de grosses brass\u00e9es de linge bien sale, et ce processus est extr\u00eamement rapide. Remarquez dans l'illustration \u00e0 droite le tronc grand-mains solide en aluminium qui retient le linge pendant qu'elle font aller le linge d'un c\u00f4t\u00e9 \u00e0 l'autre de la laveuse et le nettoient.\n\nLa grosse cuve pesante en bois garde l'eau chaude jusqu'\u00e0 ce que le lavage soit termin\u00e9. Le cercle central est filet et muni de noix qui peuvent \u00eatre resserr\u00e9es \u00e0 n'importe quel temps.\nLaveuse Beatty avec Engin.\n\nSi vous demeurez o\u00f9 il n'y a pas de pouvoir \u00e9lectrique, vous ne devez pas vous passer de l'aide indispensable de la laveuse Beatty la journ\u00e9e du lavage.\n\nIllustr\u00e9e plus haut est la laveuse Beatty compl\u00e8te avec engin, qui fera tout ce qu'une laveuse \u00e9lectrique Beatty avec cuve en bois pourra faire. Elle poss\u00e8de la m\u00eame action de lavage; dure pour la salet\u00e9, mais non pour le linge. Elle poss\u00e8de la m\u00eame ex\u00e9cution, avec toutes les qualit\u00e9s extr\u00eamement bien r\u00e9parties dans les avantages de cette machine.

Aucun changement ne sera requis \u00e0 la laveuse. N'importe qui peut se servir de l'engin de cette laveuse qui est tr\u00e8s simple. Il est facile \u00e0 partir, facile \u00e0 arr\u00eater et d\u00e9pense une si petite quantit\u00e9 de gazoline et d'huile que le co\u00fbt est insignifiant.\n\n**Engin recommandable**\n\nEngin est du mod\u00e8le le plus recommand\u00e9 pour ce genre d'enginage. C'est un mod\u00e8le Cyclone qui rend le d\u00e9marrage plus facile, assure le plein rendement du pouvoir, poss\u00e8de un flambage de s\u00e9curit\u00e9, une protection contre les chocs de la vapeur et de la poussi\u00e8re. \u00c9quip\u00e9 avec d\u00e9marrer \u00e0 p\u00e9dale ainsi que 8-pieds de tube \u00e0 condensat la teneur de la gazoline brut\u00e9e.

Elle a la m\u00eame construction forte et rigide avec rame d'engrenages coup\u00e9es \u00e0 la machine, coussinets S.K.F., elle est d'un dessin simple et poss\u00e8de moins de parties expos\u00e9es \u00e0 l'usure.\n\nSi, \u00e0 l'avenir vous \u00eates en position de vous servir du pouvoir \u00e9lectrique, l'engin peut \u00eatre chang\u00e9 \u00e0 n'importe quelles de nos succursales pour un montant \u00e9gal. Aucun changement ne sera requis \u00e0 la laveuse. N'importe qui peut se servir de l'engin de cette laveuse qui est tr\u00e8s simple. Il est facile \u00e0 partir, facile \u00e0 arr\u00eater et d\u00e9pense une si petite quantit\u00e9 de gazoline et d'huile que le co\u00fbt est insignifiant.\n\nENGIN RECOMMANDABLE\n\nL'engin est du mod\u00e8le le plus recommand\u00e9 pour ce genre d'ouvrage. C'est un mod\u00e8le de 4 Cycl\u00e9s qui rend le d\u00e9marrage plus facile, assure le plein rendement du pouvoir, \u00e9conomise le temps et la peine de changer de gazoline ou de huile. \u00c9quip\u00e9 avec d\u00e9marreur \u00e0 p\u00e9dale ainsi que 8 pts de tube flexible contenant la tresse de la gazoline br\u00fbl\u00e9e. L'engin fait partie de la con-\n\nATTACHMENT POUR BRAS\n\nSi vous ou l'op\u00e9rateur ne d\u00e9sirez pas partir l'engin, chaque machine peut \u00eatre munie d'un attache pour bras avec un bras, afin qu'on puisse faire l'actionner la laveuse \u00e0 bras si d\u00e9sir\u00e9.\nL'essoreuse de la laveuse Beatty est tr\u00e8s simple et facile \u00e0 faire fonctionner. Le linge suit toujours la m\u00eame direction que la poign\u00e9e est tourn\u00e9e et lorsque la poign\u00e9e est tourn\u00e9e, la direction de l'eau s'ajuste automatiquement de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce que l'eau retourne dans la cuve du bon c\u00f4t\u00e9. Il n'y a pas de table \u00e0 eau \u00e0 ajuster ou \u00e0 man\u0153uvrer.\n\nDECLANCIEMENT DE SURETE INSTANTANE\n\nLe d\u00e9clenchement enl\u00e8ve la pression des rouleaux instantan\u00e9ment; il fait m\u00eame plus que cela, les deux rouleaux sont arr\u00eat\u00e9s au m\u00eame temps. Les rouleaux ne font pas seulement que se s\u00e9parer, ils s'\u00e9loignent compl\u00e8tement. Les deux rouleaux peuvent \u00eatre enlev\u00e9s et remis en place en quelques secondes. Une vis ajuste la pression et l'applique \u00e9galement aux deux bouts des rouleaux. L'essoreuse poss\u00e8de les rouleaux demi-mois, lesquels ne brisent pas les bouteilles.\n\nL'essoreuse peut \u00eatre tourn\u00e9e des deux bouts, \u00e9pargnant ainsi \u00e0 l'op\u00e9ratrice le trouble de marcher autour de la laveuse pour ajuster l'essoreuse.\n\nLa t\u00eate de l'essoreuse poss\u00e8de notre dernier et plus nouveau genre de roues d'engrenages.\n\nIl n'y a pas de syst\u00e8me d'embrayage expos\u00e9 \u00e0 s'obstruer ou expos\u00e9 \u00e0 plier sous la force de la pression.\n\nCette essoreuse se mettra en revers aussi facilement avec du linge ou sans linge.\nLe m\u00e9canisme de la laveuse Beatty est simple et fort. Il contient moins de parties mobiles que n'importe quelle autre laveuse. Le m\u00e9canisme conducteur est si simple qu'il peut difficilement se d\u00e9placer; pas de pouvoir gaspill\u00e9.\n\nToutes les pi\u00e8ces mobiles sont support\u00e9es par une plaque solide qui les maintient en bon alignement afin qu'elles puissent travailler sans friction.\n\nChaque pi\u00e8ce est fabriqu\u00e9e pour supporter l'usure de plusieurs ann\u00e9es d'usage. Des sections de roues d'engrenages sont illustr\u00e9es \u00e0 leur grosseur originale au verso de cette circulaire. Les dents d'engrenages sont coup\u00e9es \u00e0 la machine et marchent silencieusement.\n\nLa laveuse \u00e9lectrique Beatty avec cuve en bois, durera plus longtemps que n'importe quelle laveuse de fantaisie, se vendant de $59.00 \u00e0 $100.00 de plus.\n\nLes endroits qui n\u00e9cessitent de l'huile sont peu nombreux, la plupart des roues d'engrenage \u00e9tant empaquet\u00e9es dans la graisse. Un tube d'huile conduit l'huile au pignon conducteur, ce qui emp\u00eache l'op\u00e9ratrice de se baisser.\n\nLa laveuse et l'essoreuse peuvent \u00eatre mises en op\u00e9ration, ind\u00e9pendante l'une de l'autre.\n\nLE PROBLEME DE LA FERME\n\nCette laveuse est fabriqu\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 \u00eatre utilis\u00e9e avec un engin \u00e0 gazoline. La base est perc\u00e9e pour accommoder un petit engin qui peut \u00eatre boulonn\u00e9 \u00e0 la place du moteur. N'importe lequel de nos clients qui d\u00e9m\u00e9nage \u00e0 la campagne peut par cons\u00e9quent emporter sa laveuse avec lui. Nous avons des engins en stock dans toutes les r\u00e9gions canadiennes. S'il est impossible d'avoir un engin \u00e0 gazoline ou le pouvoir \u00e9lectrique, la laveuse est \u00e9quip\u00e9e de mani\u00e8re \u00e0 ce qu'on puisse s'en servir \u00e0 bras et jusqu'\u00e0 ce qu'un pouvoir quelconque puisse \u00eatre obtenu.\nFABRIQUEE PAR BEATTY BROS.

Frigidaire engineers adapted the cast-iron dome seal originally, basing their design upon early discoveries. Progress from that type is the result of more than 16 years of research and experience in hundreds of thousands of homes.\n\nWhen the AB Compressor was designed, engineers moved the float valve to the cooling unit, where it became more easily accessible and operated under a low pressure. Flare nuts were added to the lines, making the connections simpler.\n\nMore complete accessibility was the feature when the A Compressor was designed. By dividing the compressor, condenser and receiver, any of these parts may be adjusted without disassembling the others. The drive was also made easy to reach by supplanting the inaccessible direct-gear drive with the belt drive.\n\nValves were added to both the cooling coil and the B Compressor, permitting basement installations. Other valves were installed in the lines, and filter screens were placed in the copper tubing where they could be reached for cleaning. Piston valves were installed to reduce the running time.\n\nThe early Model A Compressor had the float valve in the compressor unit where it was under a high pressure. All the compressor parts, with the exception of the motor, were encased under one dome. Even the copper tubing was sealed by soldering.\nEvolution of the Frigidaire Cooling Unit\n\nThe evolution of the Frigidaire cooling coil unit from the brine tank to copper-finned coil is an interesting study in engineering advancement. The brine tank was first used in cold-storage plants and it was natural that the first automatic refrigerating mechanisms should reflect this practice by the use of the brine tank in the cooling compartment of the refrigerator.\n\nThe early Model A cooling unit consisted of a brine tank, holding a large quantity of brine, in which only a few coils were placed.\n\nWhen the Model B cooling unit was designed, the number of coils was increased, with a corresponding decrease in the quantity of brine.\n\nThe brine tank was then eliminated, leaving only the coils. This cooling unit assures simpler, more sensitive temperature control than the brine tank.\n\nThe present copper-finned cooling unit is the result of more than 16 years' experience in automatic refrigeration. This type has greater surface area, which increases its operating efficiency. It can be operated at a higher average coil temperature and at the same time maintains the low box temperature required. It is the most economical coil for installations using this type of coil.\nNicolet 6 Aout 1929.\n\nEcole Abenakis\nOdanak,\nMr Benjamin Maureault,\n\nCher Monsieur,\n\nNous sommes en position de vous fournir une bo\u00eete No 40 telle que vignette inclue.\n\nUn Coil Unit 12, et un compresseur No A.

The plaster walls of the Superior's bedroom are cracked in several places and these could be repaired by covering them with linen finished with three coats of paint at a cost of $35.00.\n\n2. The erection of a wooden partition in the dormitory to divide the room into three separate cells which partition could be built to a height of 7 ft. divided in panels, painted, etc., at a cost of $150.\n\n3. Covering of the metal roof on the top of the addition used as an office with a thick coat of asphalt mastic at a cost of $15.00.\n\n4. Repairing of the cement floor in the furnace room - $10.00.\n\n5. The toilet for the boys at present consists of an outside building although there is a toilet room all furnished in the basement of the school, the use of which has been discontinued some years ago on account of lack of sufficient lighting. Now with the electric lighting installed all over the building, it would be advisable that the toilet room be provided with a tile floor and that the plumbing fixtures which consist of two water closets and one urinal, be put in a state of repair. This could be done at an approximate cost of $150.00.\nMr. Descoteau who is working on the construction of the retaining wall, would be willing to undertake the above mentioned work either by day labour or by contract. Should there be funds available this year, I would recommend that the contractor be authorized to proceed with these repairs while attending to the other work.\n\n[Signature]\n\nDEPARTMENTAL ENGINEER.\nOct. 20, 1930.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to inform you that you may arrange with Mr. Desrochers, contractor of Pierreville, to carry out the following repairs which are required at the Abenaki School Convent, in accordance with report submitted by the Departmental Engineer, after making an inspection of the building.\n\n1. Covering of the plastered wall of the Superior's room with linen finished with three coats of oil paint.\n\n2. Covering of the galvanized iron roof on the top of the addition used as office with thick coat of asphalt mastic in the manner already explained to Mr. Desrochers.\n\n3. Repairing of the cement floor in the furnace room in the basement.\n\n4. Construction of new floor in the boys' toilet in the basement using 6\" red quarry tile, laid with half inch asphalt or cement joint.\n\n5. Replacing closet tanks by new ones made of enamel iron also installing of new seats of the sanitary open front type.\n\n6. Complete overhauling of the urinal and sewer pipe from the boys' toilet room.\n\n7. Cleaning and painting of the inside of this toilet room as described to the contractor by the Engineer of the Department. Before this item is started, however, I would like to be furnished with an approximate estimate of the cost.\n\nIt is understood that the work is to be carried out by day labour as economically as possible, and you should arrange with the Superior to verify and certify to all accounts for materials and wages in connection with the work, which accounts should be forwarded in duplicate so that payment may be made direct by the Department.\n\nThe question of erecting a wooden partition in the\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may, however, arrange to have one column built under the verandah, and a coat of asbestos put on the office roof. The expenditure for this purpose should not exceed the estimate which you submitted, viz., $15 for the column under the verandah and $25 for the coat of asbestos for the office roof. You should arrange to have this work carried out at an early date, and, when completed, you should forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost. You should see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nThe other repairs mentioned will have to stand over until next spring, when our appropriation for the next fiscal year is available. You may, therefore, again draw the attention of the Department to these repairs next spring.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nB. Lamrault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, P.Q.\n\nA. F.

They are actually repairing the floor in the parlor now and staining the closet doors. The quarry tiles for the floor in the boys' toilet room have been ordered; but that probably only be cancelled.\n\nThe rest of the work could hardly be started as everything has been torn down and they are now\u5fd9\u7740 doing it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is a new item on the accounts for electric service, and no authority appears to have been given for the installation of this water heater and, as this adds very much to the monthly account, I should be pleased to be advised upon whose authority the heater was installed and whether it is intended that this Department be responsible for payment of the electricity used in operating the heater. The Department desires that, before any additional charges are made for electric current used by the school, authority be obtained. The above account will not be paid until we have a full report from you as to the installation of the water heater and whether you consider this service should be paid by the Department or the Reverend Sisters themselves.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It may be as well to place a summary of his remarks on file.\n\nMr. Watson then launched into a long discourse on what he called patronage and said that the Indian was being discriminated against. He mentioned such work as the aforementioned wall, the bridge, and cited an instance in connection with the local Indian school. He stated that he had ascertained, at Ottawa, that the mere hanging of the blinds on the school windows had cost $83.00. I asked if this did not include also the price of the blinds but he said not.

The expenditure should be kept within the above mentioned amounts.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. McKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nBenj. Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville,\nP. Q.\nReferring to your letter June 13th, No. 28-25. I beg to say it is possible and very easy to buy now already cut the furries and the dealers would rather sell that kind of meat; but if it is really cheaper to buy a cut of hard and 3 feet long and buy $2.50 a cut, and add another foot for cutting it in two than buy a cut of 12 inches and from $4.00 to $5.00 a cut, according to the quality, price, and this is just your work. You will pay twenty-five cents per pound, course with dry meat, you could substitute to handle it so other.\n\nWith your work you have to cut it cold, to dry up then a month or two after you have to take it again and cut it in the cellar. This is what has been done with the 12 inches I had and bought the year and every year since I became the agent. This case, if it is the will of the Dept., to change this I am open to receive any way the Department wishes.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and the charges are fair and just; also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.\n\nFORM No. 199\n\nIndian Affairs.

That account was sent on the 24th of October, 1932 and we are without news since. I would be very happy to receive the account due of $15.00 which is due since the 24th of October, 1932. Furthermore, I would be glad to know the reason why I was cut off $1.50 on the sum of $15.00, seeing that it is written in the Indian Act that the Indians are not to be taxed, yet they make me pay a tax of 10%. I wish you would give me an explanation as soon as possible and at the same time the sum of $15.00 for the heating during one month from the 24th of September to the 24 of October. This was sent by Agent Maurecourt but we have not received any reply since.\n\nI would then be glad to receive that money before next month, as soon as possible.\n\nYour devoted servant,\n\nJoseph Robert,\nOdanak.\nOttawa, February 4th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a letter from Joseph Robert, requesting cheque for his services as janitor at the St. Frances R.

You forwarded this voucher on October 26th and, in reply to our letter of November 4th you stated in yours of November 14th that the voucher which you had submitted covered the janitor services for the month of October.\n\nOwing to the requirements of the Salary Deduction Act, the Department was obliged to deduct 10% and a cheque (#5543) for $13.50 was forwarded to Joseph Robert, Odanak, Que.

Maurault,\nAgent,\nPierreville.\n\nSir:\n\nA request about the windows has already been made to the Indian Department. I am renewing it today, in the hope of a favourable reply.\n\nWinter is coming, and the double windows are certainly not in good shape. With some, the wood is rotten, with others it is impossible to fasten them. When the snow is blown by the wind, it gets inside, through these windows. It is absolutely necessary that some repair be done. The same applies to the screens, which are, for the larger part, out of use.\n\nRelying on your kind help, I remain,\n\nYours very humbly,\n\n(Sgd.) Sr. Marie Josephine,\nSuperior.\nNovember 13, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReferring to the request made by Sister Mary Josephine of the Abenakis School Convent at Odanak, that some repairs be made to the double windows and the screens, which are reported to be in poor condition, would it not be possible for this year to have the double windows made air tight by caulking them with a cheap felt weather stripping, or some similar material, as I understand that some of these windows will have to be entirely renewed next year.\n\nI was advised also that the screens are in need of being replaced owing to their dilapidated condition, and these repairs could be attended to early next spring when funds are made available for work of this kind.\n\nI would ask that you communicate with the Superior of the Convent as early as possible, and advise if such arrangements are possible and will be satisfactory to her.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nA.

Maurault, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPierreville, Que.\nOttawa, February 13th, 1934.\n\nSirs,\n\nMr. Agent Maurault has forwarded to the Department your account of February 10th. This requests payment of $1.87 - balance due for water heater for the period October 12th to 27th, 1933.\n\nThis Department received an account from you for service for the period ending November 9th, 1933. This account amounted to $8.01 and did not request any payment for water heater.\n\nOn the account for the service period ending December 13th, 1933, you included an item of $1.87 and it was marked \"arrears\". As the Department's records showed that all accounts previous to that date had been paid, this item was struck out of the account.\n\nIt will be necessary to submit a special account showing the service for which you claim the $1.87. In this account, the word \"balance\" should not appear. You should, also, state why this item was not included in the account for the service period ending November 9th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I do not say that there is in fact no authority for this expenditure, but in view of the fact that the children could not possibly go to school without matching their way in almost two feet of snow and mud then obliged to take off their shoes to dry them out, or not catch cold, I found it proper to have this sum removed.\n\nAs to the possibility of having this expense incurred by the children themselves, I cannot see how these small children could have done it even if they had had the necessary implements and the warm clothes to face this very extraordinary cold weather we are facing through since the middle of Dec., there was too much risk.\n\nHoping this explanation will be found satisfactory, I remain, your truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I should be thankful to the Department if I was allowed to make this expense of about $25.00.\n\nOur typewriter is in a very bad condition, it has been in use for 25 years ever, and was never repaired.

Indian Day School repaired. It is noted that the cost of this will be $14.50. A certified account, in triplicate, should be forwarded for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nRev. Sister M. Josephine,\nPrincipal,\nSt. Francis R.C. Indian Day School,\nOdanak, Que.\nTo the Deputy Minister\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on the 20th of June I left Ottawa according to your instructions, to inspect the following reserves: Beaucecourt, Pierreville, Lorette, Seven-Islands, Bersimis, Restigouche, Maria, Gacoune, Les Acounains, and Pointe Bleue which were visited in the order above mentioned.\n\nPierreville\n\nI found that the ice from the roof had fallen on the front verandah and damaged it. There is a large hole on the left side of the roof and I would recommend that some repairs be done to it. The cost would amount to about $8.00. There are also two cellar windows needing repairs. The sills are completely gone on one and half rotten on the other, the frames are also in very bad condition. Cost of repairs $4.00\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nTo the Deputy Minister\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on the 25th of June I left Ottawa according to your instructions, to inspect the following reserves: Beaucevoir, Pierreville, Lorette, Seven-Islands, Berthierville, Restigouche, Maria, Cascoune, Les Assomains, and Pointe Bleue which were visited in the order above mentioned.\n\nThe roof of the small office at the rear, between the two wings of the building would need to be done over; the snow in winter accumulates on this small roof and as this roof is not double the heat from under melts the ice above and the water runs through the roof and along the walls. Dr. Maurault asked Mr. Descoteaux to make an estimate of the cost of a new roof and his reply is on file.\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nTo the Deputy Minister\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to report that on the 30th of June I left Ottawa according to your instructions, to inspect the following reserves: Beauceur, Pierreville, Lorette, Seven-Islands, Bersimis, Restigouche, Maria, Cacouna, Les Escoumins, and Pointe Bleue which were visited in the order above mentioned.\n\nPierreville\n\nI visited the school of the Sisters on the reserve and I was informed, in accordance with Mr. P. Phelan's request, that there are 50 lights (60) and a washing machine in the laundry on the same meter, while the heater, the stove, the electric iron and electric refrigerator were operated on a special contract.\n\nThe laundry requires new electric wiring.\n\n(sgd) Henri Fabien\nOttawa, August 30, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 15th ultimo, enclosing a quotation which you received for the reshingling of the roof of the small office at the rear of the St. Joseph's Academy, the repairs required to the roof of the front verandah and the two cellar windows, I would say that the Department will have no funds this year to provide for the cost of reshingling the roof of the small office.\n\nMr. Fabien, who recently visited the school, states that the cost of repairing the roof of the verandah would be approximately $8.00 and the repairs to the cellar windows should not exceed $8.00. The Department understands that there is a competent carpenter, Jules O'Bomsawin, who could satisfactorily carry out the repairs to the roof of the verandah and the cellar windows. If you consider that the work can be completed for the amount mentioned above\u2014which should include the cost of any material and labour required\u2014you may arrange for Indian labour to carry out these repairs. Please obtain itemized accounts, in triplicate, covering the cost of the material, and prepare a voucher, in triplicate, for the labour. These, you should certify and forward for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nB.

The children pulled through this very severe winter very well.\n\nUp to this time, this winter the children did not have much trouble getting the winter in rather warm, if not comfort to last; but there is actually a few children who are having to feel the strain and would need help, food, good food, well prepared well served.\n\nThis the Sisters are prepared to do, if the Department will allow, as last winter, the sum of $5.00 a week to buy this food from now to say the 15th April.

As payment for this work was only authorized until the middle of May, a cheque for one-half month's salary only is being sent, to the amount of $7.50.\n\nRegarding the cleaning of the cellar, for which, it is noted, Joseph Robert charges the sum of $3.00, I would say it is considered that this is part of the regular janitor's duties, and the Sister Superior should arrange for payment for this service.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT.

The work, as you know, was not authorized at that time on account of lack of funds from School Appropriation.\n\nAs I understand that the renewal of the windows is very necessary, I would request that you ask Mr. Descoteaux to submit again, through your office, a new offer, which should give a more detailed description of the work to be performed for the above mentioned price, namely, $228.00,\u2014the dimensions of the windows and frames, as well as the kind of wood to be used,\u2014glazing, painting, hardware,\u2014also the time he would require for the carrying out of the work.\n\nPlease arrange with Mr. Descoteaux to give all particulars possible so as to enable the department to verify his offers in connection with the above mentioned work.

I beg now to advise that Mr. Desrochers has sent in another offer giving a more detailed description of the work to be completed for the amount of his offer, which is the same as that previously made in 1932, namely, $225.00.\n\nThe work involved in this offer consists in the renewal of twenty windows with double sashes, located in the old section of the building, by new ones made of dry pine, glazed complete, and provided with wire screens, all to be well-adjusted and fitted with necessary hardware, such as handles, hooks, fasteners and so forth, well painted with three coats of oil paint. It is understood that all materials and workmanship are to be of good quality and that the old windows are to remain the property of Mr. Desrochers. The work if authorized at the present would be complete by the beginning of October.\n\nAs mentioned in my previous memorandum as there are funds available from School Appropriation and as Mr. Desrochers's offer appears reasonable, I would recommend that it be accepted, and that his work be subject to the approval of an officer of the department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Philip Puslan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to your twelfth instant, 25-8-4, we wish to inform you that we now have on hand the Requisition including the three articles mentioned in same.\n\nWe find it very peculiar that you can not find any request for arithmetic, catechisms, etc. We have made inquiries concerning same, and Agent Maurault says he sent it in with the others. The Requisition List included three sheets. It seems a whole sheet is missing. We had mentioned on it that a number of the books were especially for Manual Training. We are now including a list of some of the books not received and the most needed.\n\nWith regard to the accounts for cleaning, after inquiries, we were told they have been sent in also. There is a misunderstanding concerning the Cheque mentioned in your letter. This account for $15.75 in favour of A. Lapierre was not for cleaning and scrubbing, but, for supplies such as brooms, paint, toilet paper, etc., and a few articles for manual training. Here again, we include a duplicate of the accounts. We have already sent the accounts with the receipts to the Agent. On your request we will send them in duplicate.\n\nYou will find enclosed a detailed list of the children who badly need clothes same as we have already sent one to the\n\n(Agent)\nAgent. Out of the number, a few are still coming to school, but very poorly dressed. Luckily the weather has not been too severe yet.\n\nThe delay in answering to your favour is due to the fact of getting inquiries from Agent Maurault who has been away to his sister's funeral.\n\nWe trust this will be satisfactory to you,\n\nWe remain,\n\nTruly yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal,\nSt. Frances R.C. Day School,\nOdanak, Quebec.\nOttawa, December 1, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 29, I find that a number of accounts have been submitted by Indian Agent Maurault since you were written on the 12th instant. These accounts have gone forward for payment and I trust cheques have already reached you. If not, they will be sent in the very near future.\n\nYou may purchase the clothing that you consider absolutely necessary for the following children:\n\nAime M'Sadoques'\nAime Gill's\nEdward Hannis'\nMrs. Henri O'Bomsawin's\nArthur M'Sadoques'\nFrederic Robert's\nOliver O'Bomsawin's\nLevy Benedict's\nJos. O'Bomsawin's\n\nIt is understood, of course, that the clothing will be secured as reasonably as possible. Purchase should be made from firms on the approved list. Information in this regard can be secured from Indian Agent Maurault. When the clothing has been purchased, accounts in triplicate should be handed to the Indian Agent, to whom copy of this letter is being sent.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Murray, Superior of St. Joseph's Academy, estimates that she will need at least $400 to have the floors and the interior of the classes and of the building in general repaired and set in good order this year.\n\nThere would be also the painting of the outside wooden part of the building which was asked for last year, and was not allowed, which should be done this summer. I believe an estimate was presented last year for this work.\n\nYours truly,\nRev. Bernard Hunt\nOttawa, July 7, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the first instant, you may expend an amount not exceeding $40.00 in repairs and cleaning at the St. Frances R. C. Indian Day School.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, we do not appear to have the estimate which you state you forwarded, in connection with the cost of painting the exterior of the building. We have some funds available, which might be used for painting the building, but we are unable to make a final decision in regard to this until we know the cost. Would you advise using Indian labour? If so, what would be the cost of the labour? You should let me know, also, the quantity of paint that would be necessary.\n\nIf Indian labour is not available, you should let me know for what price you could have the exterior of the building painted. In this event you should state the name and address of any person who gives you a quotation on the painting.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nB.

Aujourd'hui, les r\u00e9sultats obtenus par les ing\u00e9nieurs Westinghouse montrent que l'appareil est extr\u00eamement efficace et \u00e9conomise de l'\u00e9nergie en service.\n\nAu cours des cinq derni\u00e8res ann\u00e9es, les ing\u00e9nieurs Westinghouse ont examin\u00e9 chaque jour leur superposition, leur commodit\u00e9 et leur s\u00fbret\u00e9 de fonctionnement dans des conditions de milieux vari\u00e9s de partout aux \u00c9tats-Unis. Aujourd'hui, on leur fait saluer l'EPREUVE EN CUISINE. Lors de ces essais, des tests importants dans la demeure de personnes qui en poss\u00e8dent un. Des tableaux de rendement pr\u00e9cis ont \u00e9t\u00e9 \u00e9tablis et ceux-ci ont \u00e9t\u00e9 expos\u00e9s \u00e0 la construction moderne. L'\u00e9nergie de r\u00e9serve et l'\u00e9conomie du Westinghouse.\n\nVoici plus de r\u00e9sultats :\n\nProtection alimentaire : Des essais minutieux avec le lait, la viande, les fruits, recueillent une protection doublement automatique. Le r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur des besoins domestiques sous n'importe quel climat.\n\nCommodit\u00e9 augment\u00e9e : Les cases d'\u00e9gout et d'eau min\u00e9rale en quantit\u00e9s suffisantes de boisson communes de temps, de travail et d'argent gr\u00e2ce aux commodit\u00e9s du r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur Westinghouse.\n\nReserve d'\u00e9nergie et efficacit\u00e9 : En cuisine normale, la porte du r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur ouvrant jusqu'\u00e0 30 fois par jour, le m\u00e9canisme Westinghouse ne fonctionne pas une minute plus longtemps que n\u00e9cessaire, encore une grosse \u00e9conomie d'\u00e9nergie.\n\nGrande \u00e9conomie : L'utilisation pr\u00e9cise de la d\u00e9pense du contact prouve que le r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur doublement automatique Westinghouse est \u00e0 la fois \u00e9conomique et fiable.\n\nWESTINGHOUSE doublement-automatique E-43\n\nCapacit\u00e9 du garde-manger 42 pi. cu.\u20148.4 pi. ca. de tablettes. 44 cubes de glace (4\u00bd lbs.) congel\u00e9s \u00e0 la fois.

Ce r\u00e9servoir d'\u00e9nergie est un facteur toujours tr\u00e8s important non seulement pour votre propre commodit\u00e9 mais aussi pour \u00e9viter \u00e0 la machine m\u00eame des efforts et une usure inutiles.\n\nIl en est de m\u00eame pour un r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur. Les vagues de grande chaleur... le besoin de cong\u00e9lation extra-rapide... et les nombreuses occasions o\u00f9 vous demandez au r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur de faire des merveilles... pour tout cela, il faut n\u00e9cessairement une r\u00e9serve d'\u00e9nergie suffisante. Et cette r\u00e9serve vous la trouverez dans le r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur Westinghouse. Elle assure votre tranquillit\u00e9, vous savez que votre Westinghouse vous fournira une cong\u00e9lation rapide et une \u00e9nergie suffisante pour vos besoins, par tous les temps les plus chauds. Elle assure aussi plus longue dur\u00e9e \u00e0 l'appareil qui fonctionne sans effort et sans \u00e9puisements.\n\nLe m\u00e9canisme n'est jamais soumis \u00e0 un effort et ne travaille pas au-del\u00e0 de sa capacit\u00e9. Il ne co\u00fbte rien quand il est inactif, mais il est toujours pr\u00eat \u00e0 la t\u00e2che pour assurer une r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration efficace et s\u00fbre, si haut que monte le march\u00e9 ou quel que soit le travail que vous en exigez.\n\nL'\u00e9nergie de r\u00e9serve du m\u00e9canisme herm\u00e9tiquement scell\u00e9 conserve \u00e0 votre r\u00e9frig\u00e9rateur toute son utilit\u00e9, lui assurant une longue dur\u00e9e et une r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration tr\u00e8s \u00e9conomique.\n\nVous comment cette r\u00e9serve de capacit\u00e9 du Westinghouse intervient. \u00c0 la temp\u00e9rature d'\u00e9t\u00e9, 80 degr\u00e9s, le m\u00e9canisme Westinghouse fonctionne encore 20 minutes par heure. Il reste donc 40 minutes ou une r\u00e9serve maximale de r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration. On peut ainsi pr\u00e9parer les mets sal\u00e9s du mercure en \u00e9t\u00e9, ou pour congeler plus de glace ou encore pour pr\u00e9parer rapidement de ces d\u00e9licieux desserts froids ou encore pour refroidir rapidement les boissons ou autres aliments ou encore pour certaines occasions sp\u00e9ciales.\n\nM\u00eame en plein milieu de la chaleur du sud tropical, \"Westinghouse\" assure une r\u00e9frig\u00e9ration compl\u00e8te et continue sans consommer toute sa r\u00e9serve d'\u00e9nergie.\nConfirming our conversation last Tuesday regarding refrigerator at the Convent, Odanak.\n\nThe cost of replacing present brine tank with a new coil, fitting new control, expansion valve, including labour would be approximately $55.00 with guarantee of one year on entire machine. However, as we pointed out, the refrigerator is too large for your requirements with resulting unnecessarily high operating costs. In view of this, we think it would be to your advantage, instead of making an outlay of $55.00 upon the old machine to purchase a smaller domestic type refrigerator. We could furnish from stock a new Westinghouse Model E-55 with one year complete guarantee and a further four years guarantee on the sealed refrigerator mechanism only as per our standard contract below.\n\nThis refrigerator would operate on about 45 K.W.Hrs per month or on your rate about $1.12 for this period. Price would be $220.00 with an allowance of $65.00 for the old equipment complete including Fabian Box making a cash amount due for the new machine $155.00.\n\nThis is a special price as we have only two of these machines left from last year. They are absolutely new and shown in attached booklet.\n\nThe offer is subject to your acceptance before October 31st, 1938.\n\nThanking you for your courtesy and trusting this letter gives required information.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE SHAWINIGAN WATER & POWER COMPANY\nCommercial and Distribution Department.\n\nH.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the request made to Doctor Maurault, Agent, concerning the authorization for clearing the snow.......\n\nWe were informed, yesterday, that the Department objects against such expense, owing to lack of funds.\n\nWe wish to call your attention on this. We are just about to be buried under snow. Banks attain from ten to twelve feet and some of the windows are thus completely blocked. Moreover, the weight of the snow will cause damage to the building. We have also experienced, in the past years, that after heavy snowfalls as we have had, the sudden melting has caused the water to run into the basement to considerable extent.\n\nWe therefore think it urgent to clear away the snow immediately in order to avoid all ill consequence; and...this cannot be done by children.\n\nWe take this opportunity to inform you also, that, the pupils are too frequently missing school. Reasons are the following: SICKNESS....some due to the wearing of \"rubbers\"; Others, living some distance away, cannot come through the banks which are blocking the road; they have had but a few days of school since January. Others are kept at home to work at baskets or canoes and yet, the poor people cannot get money enough to buy clothes for the children. It is really pitiful at some places. Never we've had such a poor attendance.\n\nWe thought it better to advise you of the situation ourselves and we sincerely trust you will take it under serious consideration at once.\n\nWe remain, truly yours,\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSaint-Francois R.C. Indian Day School.\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of another letter from the Principal of the St. Francis R.C. school with reference to clearing the snow from the school yard.\n\nIt is considered that you should be able to arrange to have the necessary work done by some of those who are receiving relief. In this way there will be no extra cost to the Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nB. Maurault, Esq., M.
