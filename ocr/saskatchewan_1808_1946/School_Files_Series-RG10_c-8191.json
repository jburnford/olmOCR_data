I was at the Reserve yesterday and with John Loucks, the school teacher, we examined each desk carefully for a manufacturer's name, without success. The more recent desks are adjustable, the only marks are \"A350.\"\n\nMr. Loucks is of the impression that the later desks were secured from E. N. Moyer Co. Limited of Toronto. Other than this, I regret, I am unable to supply any further information. I might add that some of the old desks are marked \"Ideal\" worked in iron-work on the sides of each.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nVME:P\nOttawa, November 18, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department accepts your offer to supply school desks for the Alnwick Indian Day School.

Houghton, Harwood, Ont., for cleaning, repairing and oiling the floor of the Alnwick Indian Day School.\n\nOn authority granted in your letter 2-1-5 of August 19th, 1939, I had Mr. Houghton paint and redecorate the class room of the Alnwick Indian Day School for $100.00. I inspected the work on its completion and found some extra work necessary to complete the job, which was not included in the original contract and while Mr. Houghton had his tools and materials on the job, I had him do the work at an additional cost of $5.00, which I trust is in order, and herewith submit for payment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nVME:P\nMNUS.\nOttawa,\nDecember 27, 1939.\n\nEXD.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting on his inspection of the Alnwick Indian Day School on December 7 Public School Inspector A.A. Martin writes in part as follows:\n\n\"The furnace needs much repairing. The new decorations are lovely but are being destroyed by smoke.\"\n\nThere does not appear to be any reason why a matter of this kind should be left to the School Inspector to report to the Department. Has the teacher advised you that the furnace is smoking and thus destroying the appearance of the interior of the class room? Please let me have a report from you immediately on this matter stating the estimated cost of repairing the furnace so that there will not be a smoke nuisance in future.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. V. M. Eastwood,\nIndian Agent,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ont.\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nOn receipt of your letter 3-1-5 of Dec. 27th, I requested Mr. McMillan of Rosenseth, who is apparently the only heating contractor in the village, to inspect the furnace at the Alnwick Indian Day School. He reports the flues are practically burnt out as well as part of the fire pot. Apparently a piece has dropped out recently and allows smoke to come up in the class room. There has not been a great deal of damage as yet but if allowed to be used in this way it will smoke up the fresh paint and there is danger of a spark coming up the register. I have instructed the caretaker to close off all registers and place a piece of sheet metal over the registers when leaving the building at night. Mr. McMillan thinks this should eliminate the fire hazard temporarily.\n\nChief Ernest Crowe and myself examined this furnace in September and at that time it was from all outward appearances in satisfactory condition. About five or six years ago Mr. Grieve had the furnace repaired at a cost of about $60.00. A new outside casing was put on and a cement base. This makes the furnace appear a lot better than it actually is. When examining the furnace Mr. McMillan found that a piece of casting from the flue had completely dropped out and it is impossible to repair it.\nThe Secretary,\n\nI have been in the building every week and the furnace was apparently operating satisfactorily up to the time when this section dropped out. This must have occurred during the time of Mr. Martin's inspection. The school teacher had not brought it to my attention but apparently was waiting until my trip to the Reserve.\n\nI am satisfied that the furnace cannot be repaired from Mr. McMillan's and my own observation. Mr. McMillan has given me a figure on the cost of replacement of a new wood burning furnace adequate for heating this building. I enclose Circular given me by him of the Beach Foundry Company. This is a wood burning furnace of 50,000 cu.ft heating capacity, which can take a 4'x4\" stack with 82,000 B.T.U. rating at register. He would include in his price all extras, such as new collars to fit the heating pipes and cold air pipes to make a satisfactory job for $165.00 covering complete installation and taking away the furnace.\n\nI am sorry I am unable to get other quotations from Roseneath merchants as McMillan is the only one in this business. He has previously done satisfactory work. His price is standard for the type of furnace shown and on account of the furnace being immediately required I suggest that I may be instructed to have the furnace installed immediately.\n\nOn account of the urgency may I request that you wire me your instructions.

It is rather difficult to get deliveries from McMillan at Rosenseth, who is the only person carrying the required material and on a visit yesterday to the Reserve I was unable to locate him.\n\nHowever, my estimate would be $12.00 to put down pipes, suitably placed on the building to take care of this condition.\n\nI will have this done on your authorization.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\nRICE AND MUD LAKES AGENCY\n\nIndian Affairs.

The dowels are broken out, and it is split in a number of places on the top. It is a very old piece of furniture and it is, in my opinion, beyond repair.\n\nVincent McCarter Eastwood\nIndian Agent\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nIn reply to your letter 2-1-5 of 8th of January, 1946, requesting an estimate of the cost of repairing the woodshed attached to the Alnwick Indian Day School, the situation is as follows.\n\nThe cement foundation under the east wall of this shed has crumbled from under the shed sills and will require a new cement trench wall; the building raised up and straightened back where it should be; then braced. It has pulled away from the brick wall it is placed against but not attached, about five inches. Other than being considerably out of line and somewhat of an eye sore its usefulness has not been affected. Part of next year's supply of wood has now been placed in the shed, which would have to be removed to carry out this work.\n\nI have had estimates submitted from $140.00 to $180.00 to repair the shed. I think it can be done for possibly a price between these two figures. I do not think the building would require to be torn down, and rebuilt.\n\nAs a trench cement wall is required to put a good foundation under it, it is doubtful whether this work could be carried out until the frost is out of the ground. There also might be at that time more favourable labour conditions for doing the work.\n\nVincent McCarter Eastwood\nIndian Agent\nOttawa, 15th January, 1946.\n\nMr. Vincent M. Eastwood, Indian Agent,\n385 Water St., Peterborough, Ontario.\n\nI have your letter of the 11th instant with reference to the woodshed attached to the Alnwick Indian Day School. In view of your report I consider it undesirable to make any repairs at the present time but you might bring the matter to our attention in May or June when authority can be given for the work.\n\nWith reference to your second letter of January 11th, you may purchase a drinking fountain for the school at a cost of approximately $5.00.

It is hoped to resume classes on the 28th of January, in the Mission House and if this material is rushed through, no material loss in the work of the school will result. Until the supplies arrive John Loukes, the Day School Teacher, is considerably handicapped in his teaching.\n\nVincent McCarter Eastwood\nIndian Agent\n\nUrgent\nEXTRACT from letter from Indian Agent V.M. Eastwood dated 23rd January, 1946.\n\nReference Alnwick Indian Reserve School and Council Hall\n\nFurther to informing you by telephone yesterday of the fire on January 21st which completely destroyed the above building housing the Alnwick Indian Day School on the ground floor.\n\nMy first concern was to re-establish the school and I believe a satisfactory arrangement is now under way and should be completed in order to open the school on Monday the 28th. On my own responsibility I have taken over the Mission House immediately east of the ruins of the former school and through the co-operation of Mrs. Maria Bigwin and Mrs. Charlotte Crowe, residing in the Mission House, I moved Mrs. Crowe to her daughter's and Mrs. Bigwin took over the upstairs portion of the Mission House, leaving free a double room downstairs. By the removal of a temporary partition which will be of no great cost, a room is available, approximately 35 ft by 18 ft.\n\nAt present there are 30 pupils attending school. By improvising some desks or forms for desks, I believe that the school can carry on until supplies requested by emergency requisition are forthcoming. There are, incidentally some old desks although not ordinarily satisfactory, which can be braced to do temporarily. Further reference to the school is made in my letter covering this requisition.\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF\n\nAlnwick Indian Day School\n\nVOTE 76 ALLOTMENT ALLOCATION SYMBOLS\n\nSHIP TO Mr. John Loukes, Teacher,\nAlnwick Indian Day School, Cobourg, Ontario.\n\nPurpose for which required:\n\n| QUANTITY | UNIT PRICE | TOTAL |\n|----------|------------|-------|\n| 10 each  | Chair Desks Small |       |\n| 15 each  | Chair Desks Medium |       |\n| 5 each   | Chair Desks Large |       |\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

I ordered the work done at the time but was unable to get the material and nails and Mr. McMillan put it off until some considerable length of time elapsed.

A certain amount of repair was necessary to put this house in usable condition for the school. A new school was authorized to be built during 1947 but due to difficulty in securing tenders from contractors to complete the school it was deferred until 1948.\n\nIn the meanwhile a number of repairs were not carried out on the mission house to put it in condition for the winter months. The following repairs are now required:\n\n1. Double Windows. There are a number of these in the basement but some of the glass is broken. There would be enough windows to put storm windows on the portion of the building used as a class room.\n\n2. Doors. There is one door facing the west which should be boarded up or supplied with a storm door as it is not used regularly. I would prefer to have a storm door where it could be opened in case of fire or emergency.\n\n3. Blackboards. There will be required two sections of Masonite to fill present needs. The manual training instructor has also requested a small blackboard in another room where they carry out manual training in this school.\n\n4. Furnace. The furnace hot air and cold air pipes need repairing for the more efficient operation of the furnace.\n\nThe janitor, Thomas Marsden, could fit the windows and make the storm door and put up the blackboards. I would estimate the cost of materials at $10.00 and the labour in the neighbourhood of $15.00 for his work and possibly $12.00 to $14.00 for repairing the furnace. May I have authority to proceed with this work which is both necessary and urgent for the comfort of the children in the school.\n\nV. M.

M. Eastwood,\nSupt., Rice and Mud Lake Indian Agency,\n385 Water Street, Peterboro, Ontario.\n\nConstruction of One-room Day School and attached Teacherage - Alnwick Reserve.\n\nWe have now a stock of blue-prints, specifications and bills of materials for our standard one-room day school and attached teacher's residence.\n\nThe Auditor General has insisted that in future, the clauses of the Public Works Act with regard to advertising for tenders be adhered to. During the emergency war years, some variations from these regulations were permitted, but we are now required to advertise for tenders on construction of public buildings in excess of $5,000.00. Attached hereto please find a sample advertisement. It is our intention to advertise for tenders for the construction of the Alnwick Day School in the near future. Therefore, we would request you to advise us:\n\n(a) The name of the newspapers in or near your agency in which you would recommend that we advertise;\n\n(b) Post office and other government buildings in which we should display drawings, specifications, etc.\n\nNaturally, your own office will be one in which we will display drawings, etc. If no tenders are received after advertising, you will be advised so that other means can be considered whereby the construction of this school can be carried out during the fiscal year 1948-49. These other means involve:\n\n(a) ..... direct\n1. Direct approach to contractors when advertising has failed to produce tenders.\n\n2. Construction on a day labour basis.\n\n3. The erection of a prefabricated school.\n\nWith regard to (2) above, the Department, as previously stated, now has a complete bill of materials for the construction of this standard school. Other agents have successfully had this school constructed this year by employing a foreman-carpenter and Indian helpers. The drawings and specifications are very clear and the Department buys all the necessary materials. I give you this information so that you can consider such a mode of construction if advertising fails.\n\nWe would appreciate receiving from you the information required in para 3. We should also be advised as to the availability of Hydro and water facilities and their distance from the school building.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Heary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nRe: Construction of One Room Day School and Attached Teacherage\u2014Alnwick Reserve.\n\nIn reply to file 2-1-5(WT) dated 21st of January 1948 I would recommend that the following list of newspapers in order of their importance receive instructions to advertise for tenders for the above school:\n\nThe Peterborough Examiner\u2014Peterborough\nThe Watchman Warder\u2014Lindsay\nThe Sentinel Star\u2014Cobourg\nThe Herald\u2014Campbellford\nHastings Press\u2014Hastings\nThe Guide\u2014Port Hope\nThe Standard\u2014Navelock\nThe Journal\u2014Warkworth\nThe News\u2014Lakefield\nThe Register\u2014Norwood\n\nI would suggest that the following list of post offices be supplied drawings and specifications to be displayed: Peterborough R.O.\u2014Koseneath R.O.\u2014Hastings R.O.\u2014Cobourg R.O.\u2014Campbellford R.O.\u2014Lindsay R.O.\n\nHydro facilities are available at the proposed site for the construction of the new school on the Alnwick Indian Reserve. The water facilities would depend upon a dug well which serves the public buildings located about 300 feet from the proposed site of the new school. I believe the supply would be adequate for ordinary requirements but may not be adequate for hot water heating or flush toilets. If a new well should be required, I believe there would be little difficulty in securing an ample supply of water at about thirty feet.\n\nConsideration will be given to the construction of a school on a day labour basis as outlined in your letter, should advertising fail to secure tenders.\n\n[Signature]\n\nV.M. Eastwood\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nFebruary 12, 1948.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to our recent telephone conversation, it is intended to advertise in newspapers in the Peterboro area for the submission of tenders for a one-room school on the Rama Indian Reserve.\n\nIt is requested that authority be given for the exhibition of drawings, specifications and other documents at the following post offices:\n\n1. Peterboro, Ontario,\n2. Rosenearth, Ontario,\n3. Hastings, Ontario,\n4. Cobourg, Ontario,\n5. Campbellford, Ontario,\n6.

Electricity is available for the installation of an electric motor and small pressure tank. It would be of advantage to have the well dug in the basement of the school and the pump installed at the well head. The proposed site lends itself well to drainage.\n\nThe installation of flush toilets would require septic tank disposal. The problem of contamination of the well from the disposal bed no doubt could be overcome as the proposed site of the school is on a side hill with a more abrupt slope south of the site.\n\nI believe it possible to have this well dug as soon as authorized to do so. One is being dug at the present time for a dwelling on the reserve by Indian labour and I believe I could get the same crew to carry out this work. For the amount of water that will be required, I hesitate to suggest whether a dug or drilled well is preferable. There is a dug well on the property some two or three hundred feet away from the proposed site and I understand that it is about thirty feet deep. I do not anticipate any difficulty in securing water at the same level.\n\nAF.\n\nV.M. Eastwood\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nFebruary 13, 1948\n\nMr. R. A.

The local rate has been $4.00 a foot through rock and $5.00 a foot through soil. I understand the reason for the difference is that through rock no casing is required although it takes longer to drill. I understand the advantage of a drilled well is that if a boulder is encountered, it is no obstacle, whereas in digging it often occasions the abandoning of that particular location on account of the difficulty of removing the rock or going around it. There is also a question whether an adequate water supply could be secured from a drilled well.\n\nJudging from the depth of wells in this neighbourhood, I am of the opinion that the well would have to be dug to a depth of 60 ft. I can only estimate the labour roughly, two men should complete as the very outside, five feet in depth a day or better. As they go deeper the work is slowed up by the handling of the earth by bucket and is harder work. My estimate for labour would be $120.00.\n\nSixty feet in depth would take 24 cement tiles. There are two sizes: 30\" inside measurement, 36\" outside measurement, cost $5.40 inclusive of 8% sales tax. It would be preferred that the 36\" tile be used. Cost of tile $171.60. My estimate would be $350.00 to $400.00 for labour and material with no difficulty encountered and sufficient water located at depth of 60'.\nIndian Affairs Branch\n\nMarch 11, 1948.\n\nI can secure the tile at the price quoted in Peterborough. There are none in Peterborough in stock but they can be secured from J. Howard Hall, concrete contractors, George Street, Peterborough. He will require two weeks to make them and should have two weeks seasoning. If ordered now it will take one month for delivery. In regard to digging, I am confident that I can secure two men, experienced in well digging, both Indians, immediately after the muskrat trapping season which should be, if the season opens early, somewhere around the 10th of April.\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nRe: Equipment and Electricity,\nSupplement for Standard One Room\nIndian Day School Plan,\nIn connection with Rice and Mud Lakes Agency,\nOntario.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Hoey's memorandum of the 5th instant, bearing your notation of the 8th thereon, in connection with the above, you are advised as follows:\n\nOur electrical and heating engineers are presently engaged on design and specifications in connection with several four class room day schools, typical agency residences, and other buildings requiring the same services as are now requested for the above. It is expected therefore, that it will be at least a month before attention can be given to the Alnwick School.\n\nThis specific project however, will receive any earlier action our Architectural Section is able to take.\n\nR.A. Gibson, Esq.,\nDirector,\nLands and Development Services Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nMr. Hoey\nOur Architectural Staff is doing everything possible to expedite the preparation of plans you require.

I have purchased the tile and it is on the ground. I have made several trips to well diggers in the vicinity of Roseneath and the gentleman I counted on to do the work states he has enough to do to take him two years to complete. An Indian by the name of Frank Gray is willing to proceed with the work provided he can get somebody to assist him and he is to advise me later.\n\nThere is a well some 300 feet away from the proposed site of the school which I believe could be used for pouring cement for the new school so I suggest that there would be no lack of water to hold up construction of the school foundations.\n\nMay I please be advised as to whether tenders have been asked for the erection of this school. If a new school is not available for the fall term, I will have to request funds for extensive repairs for the temporary school house that is now in use. The building will require roofing, plastering inside, new flooring, and alterations to the heating plant. The building is not worth any expense but this work will be necessary to make it useable for another winter. Last winter in order to keep the children comfortable a succession of expedients to keep the building useable had to be resorted to.\n\naf.\n\nJ. M. EASTWOOD\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nJune 8, 1948.\n\nMr. V. M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nAlnwick Indian Day School.\n\nReference your 2-1 (25) of June 2, 1948.\n\nUpon receipt of your letter, we again reminded\nthe Lands and Development Services Branch of their promise to\nsupply the plumbing and electricity supplement to the plans for\na standard one-room Indian day school as intended for the\nAlnwick Indian Day School.\n\nTenders have not been asked for the erection\nof this school as we wished to be assured of a source of water\nbefore any steps are taken. Therefore, if Frank Gray is willing\nto proceed with this work, you are hereby authorized to engage\nhim to do so. The expenditure on the well should not exceed\nthe sum of $300.00. If it is necessary to exceed this sum, I\nwould ask that you immediately advise the Department, for\nfurther instructions.\n\nWe have found that contractors are reticent to for-\nward firm tenders for the erection of these schools. Within the\nlast two months we have been able to engage a number of foremen-\ncarpenters across the country who are willing to supervise the\nerection of this building, using local and Indian labour. The\nusual rate for their services is $1.50 per hour. Under such a\nday labour plan, the Department buys all the necessary materials\nfrom a standard bill which we have prepared. It is usually necessary to arrange for sub-contracts for the electricity, plumbing, etc. Such a plan also provides for the employment of a certain amount of Indian labour and we have been quite satisfied with the type of school thus erected. As you know, the drawings and specifications are very clear and concise and have presented no difficulties for other carpenters who have erected this building.\n\nDo you know of any such carpenter who would be willing to undertake the erection of this building under such terms. If so, I would ask that you advise the Department. I attach a copy of the standard bill of materials which we supply in such cases.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nWith reference to file 25-3-5 (El) dated March 16th 1948 in regard to digging a well at the proposed new day school on the Alnwick Indian Reserve, I am now pleased to advise that I have secured two Indians to do this work, Willis Smoke and Vernon Marsden, both members of the Band.\n\nSmoke has had considerable experience and has just completed a fifty foot well for another member of the Band. It is proposed to commence work on the 7th of June.\n\nFor the purpose of paying for labour may I have an advance accountable cheque for $250.00 to pay wages.\n\nM.

M.

He states that he would guarantee a good job with this particular type of construction and is sure that the wall would stand as long as the building itself.

B. F. Neary\n\nAuthority is sought for delivery by truck of the lumber, insulation etc. to be ordered from the Peterborough Lumber Company at Peterborough at an additional cost of $200.\n\nThe tender submitted was for delivery at Hastings, Ontario, the nearest rail-point to the site of the construction, a distance of twelve miles.\n\nIn delivering these materials the minimum requirement would be eighteen truck loads as there is 40,000 feet of lumber plus sash, asbestos insulation, window frames, doors etc. All these materials will not possibly be available when required necessitating possibly additional loads and shipments. If shipped by rail to Hastings, it will have to be transshipped to the site of the school necessitating additional handling and the additional cost of this transportation. I do not think it can be done for less than $6.00 or $7.00 a load and the trucks available at Roseneath are much smaller than the delivery trucks of the Peterborough Lumber Company. I would estimate that possibly there would be 25 loads costing approximately $150.\n\nIn every way the delivery by truck from Peterborough would be more satisfactory and with less handling of the materials.\n\nA.M.

M. Eastwood,\n385 Water Street,\nCity.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe-Alnwick Indian School and Teachers' Residence.\n\nIn arriving at the cost of transportation of the material covered by your list, we use the following basis for arriving at our cost for delivery to Hastings:\n\n2 carloads at approximately $20.00 per carload equals $40.00\n3 truckloads to consist principally of millwork and builders' supplies...........$54.00\n\nTotal of...............$94.00\n\nShould this material all be hauled from Peterborough direct to the job at Alnwick, we estimate it will require a total of 17 truckloads @ $18.00 per truckload, making a total of..........................$306.00\n\nBy subtracting from this amount, the figure named above of........................................$94.00\n\nThere is a difference of........................................$212.00\n\nand we suggested to you that we would undertake delivery at the round figure named of $200.00 rather than the $212.00 shown above.\n\nAs you are doubtless aware, in making shipments of lumber we use the milling in transit basis, which gives us the benefit of the through rate from the point of origin of the lumber direct to the destination (Hastings) which means in turn we have to pay a stop-off charge only of not more than 2c per hundred, and this in turns enables us to transport by rail on a much lower basis than were to pay the local rate from Peterborough to Hastings. You will\nnotice we have figured on 2 carloads and 3 truck loads of stock other than the lumber to arrive at our original delivered price.\n\nThe price of $18.00 per truck load is arrived at by using our out-of-pocket cost for the operating of our large trucks, of 25c per mile, and you will appreciate that this amount does not pay for the actual running of these large vehicles, but it is not our thought at any time to make a profit out of trucking. Hence the basis above used which we can assure you is a loss item with us at the end of the year.\n\nIt actually would be to our advantage to suggest that you permit us to make delivery by car to Hastings, but on the other hand realize it would not be nearly as convenient for you, and the material itself would be re-handled several times, which in the case of millwork and builders' supplies we believe would be to the disadvantage of your Department. For this reason we feel we have an obligation to you to suggest that the trucking basis is much more advantageous to you in the long run.\n\nWe trust the above explanation clarifies the situation as it applies to the most advantageous way for all concerned in arranging to get the material for this job delivered.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nTHE PETERBOROUGH LUMBER COMPANY LIMITED\n\nSec'y-Treas.\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario\n\nAlnwick Indian Day School\n\nIn reply to File No. 25-3-5 (E.I) of 1st October 1948 I inclose an explanatory letter from Mr. Overend of the Peterborough Lumber Company Limited setting out his costs of delivery by truck to the site of the new school, as opposed to costs to the nearest rail-point at Hastings, Ontario which is ten mile distant.\n\nAs he points out in his letter he is asking for the sum of $200.00 for trucking to the site of the school.\n\nIf the materials are shipped by rail to Hastings the best arrangement I can make is to hire trucks to draw the material from Hastings to the Reserve, a distance of ten miles, at the rate of $2.50 an hour for the use of the truck and driver with at least two helpers to unload cars, load and unload trucks. This would be $3.50 an hour. The trucks would not be as large as the Peterborough Lumber Company trucks which are specially equipped with rollers etc. for handling lumber.\n\nThe 17 truckloads as carried by the P.L. Company might make up about 25 loads with the size of load limit of the trucks I would be able to hire at Roseneath. In addition to this there will most likely be extra trips for materials not available which may be shipped later.\n\nTo load at the box car, travel ten miles, unload and return I estimate the time required would be an hour and a half, to two hours. Cost per trip $7.00 to $8.00 At $8.00 for 24 trips - $192.00.\n\nThe latter method would insure the material being delivered on the site with less handling and as required.

Hastings, Ontario, delivery commencing in seven days and completed as required;\n\nTHAT it is essential that these materials be purchased at the earliest possible date in order to allow the erection of the school to be completed before the Christmas term;\n\nTHAT the Purchasing Agent considers the price quoted to be fair and reasonable.\n\nThe Committee, therefore, on the recommendation of the Minister of Mines and Resources, advise that authority be granted for the acceptance of the tender of the Peterborough Lumber Company Limited to supply the materials on which they have quoted at a price of $7,463.90 f.o.b.

This school was to be built on reserves where hydro facilities were available. The Almisk Reserve does have electricity and therefore we were anxious to have this new design, (No. 865) built there. The new plans arrived just as the foundations were being poured and we were able to change from plan 837 to plan 865. The main change in this plan insofar as you are concerned is that it calls for a forced hot air system instead of a gravity hot air system. I was able to inform Mr. Indian Superintendent Eastwood that he should approach the tenderers and advise them of the change involved and that their tenders should be for plan 865 and NOT for plan 837.\n\nPlease find attached tenders received here for the work involved in the plumbing and heating at this school. You will note that we do not intend to install an oil burner. I have discussed this matter with Mr. Simard and this will confirm our conversation.

B. F. Neary\n\nAuthority is sought for substituting Johns-Mansville asbestos cedar grain shingles, oyster white, in place of insul brick siding. I am advised by Mr. Overend of the Peterborough Lumber Co. who were successful tenderers on the supply of this building material, that he can supply these shingles in place of the insul brick at a net saving of $65.50 to the Department.\n\nIt was my original understanding from the specifications that I received that the bill of materials called for the asbestos shingles but apparently a change has been made substituting insul brick and this was on the bill of materials sent to the suppliers tendering. In my opinion the asbestos grain shingles would make a better appearing school with a longer lasting exterior finish. There would be a saving of $65.50 and I am assured that there is no substantial increase in the labour cost. The school is on a prominent site on the Alnwick Indian Reserve and the church in the immediate vicinity is sheeted with wooden siding painted white. The appearance of the public buildings would be much improved by retaining the same colour.\n\nThe cement foundation walls of the new school will extend approximately five feet above the grade and this would minimize the possibility of damage caused by children at play.\n\nI would strongly recommend that the cedar grain shingles be used in the completion of this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nW.M. Eastwood, Superintendent,\nPine and Mud Lakes Agency.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nCOL. B. F. NEARY.\n\nRE: Construction of new Alnwick School.\n\nDuring my inspection of the Rice and Mud Lakes Agency on November 4th, I examined the work being done in the construction of the above-mentioned school. I found that the cement foundation had been completed. On the upper structure, the framework had been completed with siding, and the roof was shingled. In my opinion the materials are of the very best, and the workmanship is up to standard.\n\nThere were about 140 bags of cement available, and, as frost might develop at any time, I asked Mr. Eastwood to instruct his foreman to excavate immediately and run the cement for the septic tank. This, of course, made it necessary to purchase the fittings for the inside of the tank. Mr. Eastwood was able to secure them from the local hardware merchant. I also requested that the disposal bed be excavated and the necessary tile laid. It is imperative that all of this work be done before the ground freezes up, and this is the reason why these instructions were issued.\n\nRegarding the outside finish of the building, I would recommend that Johns-Manville grain shingles be used rather than insul brick siding. It is my understanding that there will be little difference in the cost of these two materials. If the Johns-Manville shingles, in grey or white, were used, it would make a more attractive building than insul brick siding, for the reason that the roof is covered with red asphalt shingles,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6115, file 377-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nand the building, being located on a prominent knoll, can be seen for many miles.\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that there is a difference of opinion regarding the durability of the Johns-Manville shingles as compared with insul siding. I have examined the schools at Eskasoni and Shubenacadie very carefully, where the Johns-Manville shingles have been used on the side walls. Both these schools, as you know, have been in operation for over two years, and there has been no deterioration of the shingles at either of these schools. The attached pictures, which were taken by me in September, would bear out this fact.\n\nJ.E. [Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

B. F. Neary\n\nIt is my understanding that of the firms requested to submit tenders for the above contracts only two have been received namely, Fred. V. Goodfellow and W. R. Turner, both of Peterborough.\n\nAt your request I contacted the following firms:\n\nAdamson & Dobbin,\nArchibald & Richmond - both of Peterborough,\nMilton McMillan - of Rosenotheath\nK. S. Cooper - of Cobourg.\n\nThe first three firms stated they were not interested due to the pressure of work on hand, shortages of materials and the Peterborough firms stated that their workmen were not keen on boarding out which they would have to do as the job is thirty-five miles from Peterborough. In regard to K. S. Cooper, I have already advised that he could not undertake the work for three months at the earliest, that he would only consider it on a cost plus basis and on his own terms.\n\nThe school will be completely closed in by the end of this week and all the exterior work completed except for painting the windows and trim. The primer coat has been put on by Indian labour in order to protect new wood and prevent shrinkage in windows and window frames.\n\nAs to the interior, the basement drainage system has been installed and the cement floor poured. All insulation has been installed and walls and ceilings closed except where heating air ducts and leaders and plumbing installations will be installed.\nWhile this work was in progress the electric conduit wire was installed back of the wells, with outlets.\n\nThe septic tank has been completed and connected up with the disposal bed and the grounds have been levelled and graded.\n\nAs I know it is the intention to complete this school as soon as possible and at the very latest within the fiscal year, the heating and plumbing will be the only work that will cause delay. The local contractors do not appear to be interested as is plainly shown. My suggestion would be to have Mr. S. J. R. McMillan, the foreman carpenter on the present work, go ahead and install the plumbing and heating under the same arrangement as he is presently employed. The tinsmithing could be let out on order and if any materials are not readily obtainable, I could contact the Department for assistance. In this way the work could be proceeded with to completion without interruption. I also believe that costs could be kept down below the lowest tender. Mr. McMillan is an experienced contractor and has had considerable experience in contracting and we are fortunate to have obtained his services. During the past summer he has completed the remodelling of a two room school house for the Township of Ainwick. The work included the installation of a new heating plant and inside flush toilets. I have full confidence in his ability to complete this work satisfactorily.\n\nIf my suggestion is favourably received, may I have two copies of \"Bill of Materials for forced warm air heating system\" and two copies of \"Bill of Materials for plumbing\" for plan 865.\n\nIt would be preferable if in installing the heating system that an oil firing furnace be used as I have found considerable difficulty with keeping school at even temperatures, keeping grates in and ashes removed due to the dislike for routine of most of the janitors whose services we have been able to obtain. With the installation of oil heating equipment it is my belief that the services of a janitor could be disposed of and the children under the supervision of the teacher could carry out all of the remaining services without a great deal of difficulty in a school of this type.\n\nV. M. EASTWOOD,\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\nDecember 20, 1948.\n\nMr. V. M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nALNWICK INDIAN DAY SCHOOL.\n\nHEATING: By now, you will have received copy of purchase order No. 35781 of November 15, 1948, authorizing Messrs. Goodfellow and Dougherty, 379 Water Street, Peterborough, to supply and install the forced air heating system at the above school, in accordance with specifications and plan 865.\n\nAs discussed with you by Long Distance several days ago, we will have to delay the installation of an oil burning unit in this furnace for the present.\n\nPLUMBING: We will anticipate receiving from you a requisition for the bath, toilets, etc., required and will arrange with the Departmental Purchasing Agent for delivery of these. We concur in your recommendation that Mr. McMillan install the plumbing and that arrangements be made for local purchase of the pipe required. It is understood that vouchers covering these accounts will not exceed $100.00.\n\nPAINTING: We will expect to hear from you further after you have had an opportunity of having Mr. Suterus of Roseneath tender on the painting.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nDecember 20, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nPurchase Order 35731.\n\nAlnwick Indian Day School Heating System.\n\nYou will recall our previous conversation with regard to the heating contract for this school. On December 6, 1948, I advised you concerning our local Indian Superintendent's attempts to contact Mr. Ken Cooper, of Cobourg, Ontario.\n\nIn confirmation of my memorandum of December 6, please find attached letter from Mr. Cooper, advising that he could not undertake this contract within three months.\n\nEncl.\n\nBernard F.

As I was anxious to have someone lined up to commence painting on completion of the carpentry work and installation on the heating plant, I wrote to Mr. Surerus on December 30, and finally received a reply on the 16th of January stating that he would like to contract for it by the hour supplying his own painting equipment and at the hourly rate of $1.25 for himself and $1.10 for his help. I again wrote him on the 19th of January stating that I would require a firm tender for the work in accordance with the specifications, giving him until the first of February for a reply. He does not appear to be interested as no reply has been received.\n\nA Mr. Walter Houghton of Harwood has submitted his tender for $550.00 and I attach his letter to this effect. This is for labour only less materials which were purchased from Scarfe & Company.\n\nFurther, I have received a tender, which I attach, from Mr. Walter Down of Roseneath. I would recommend Mr. Down for the work as he is a veteran whereas the others are not. He is qualified to do the work and has had considerable experience. He resides at Roseneath and is presently working as a carpenter on the work. I believe him to be acceptable by all concerned. An additional consideration is that all the interior painting could be completed before the final laying of the hardwood floors and they could be then stained and finished on completion. If he is successful in the tender, he will employ Clifford Smoke, another veteran and a member of the Alnwick Band.\n\nI consider that $550.00 is a reasonable amount for painting the interior and exterior three coats of paint in accordance with the specifications.\n\nV.

H. Lander, minister of the Alnwick Church and showed him through the school. Mr. Surerus failed to arrive.\nMr. V.M. Eastwood  \nPeterborough\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn answer to your letter of Dec. 30 regarding Alderville Indian school. I have been away working out of Hamilton driving from Hamilton to Florida and just returned home last Jan. 15 and found your letter waiting for me. I called Mr. M. Miller to arrange to see specifications and was to see him at school this afternoon. I was up there waiting around for two hours or so but he didn't show up. I plan to leave for Hamilton this evening to go to Florida tomorrow on another trip. Will be unable to see Mr. M. Miller about specifications for at least two weeks. This will mean a lot to me to be home for a while in winter paint jobs are not too plentiful around country so I go to city to work, it means I have to leave my family to find work in winter.\n\nI can't help but feel that I am getting the run around by Mr. M. Miller on the job because he told me a month or so ago that I wouldn't get a chance to paint the school as long as he was the contractor.\n\nCall DICK  \n\u2014 OUR SPECIALTY \u2014  \nSPRAY PAINTING COTTAGES  \nBODY & FENDER REPAIRS MARINE BOAT REPAIRS\nI handled the painting contract for a Toronto firm on the new Canadian General Electric Plastic Plant in Cobourg last winter and we contracted the job for a sum and before it was half finished the contract was changed so much that it was finished on cost plus basis. Contracting painting on new buildings is not satisfactory because there is so much changing or altering to do, that it is difficult to work to a contract.\n\nAs I don't have what specifications are involved I would like to contract it by the hour, the same as I understand the building contract is.\n\nAs I would be supplying my own painting equipment I would like to tender for $1.25 per hour myself and $1.10 for my help.\n\nIf this meets your approval please let me know at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRichard S.

Murray,\nSuperintendent of Education.\"\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nAlnwick Indian Day School - file 377-5(E)\n\nThe construction of the above school is now nearing completion. There remains to be completed the installation of railings for the stairway, some strapping on the ceilings, the installation of the balance of the spiral balances on the windows which were short shipped and the laying of the hardwood floor, all of which should be completed within the next week to ten days. This will complete the carpentry work.\n\nHeating\n\nThe heating plant has been installed complete less one thermostat which has been ordered, less hooking up the fan to the electric power and the installation of the registers on the heat outlets which will be installed on the completion of the painting. The furnace is now in operation and the building is fully heated.\n\nPlumbing\n\nAll pipes have been connected and the plumbing fixtures are on the premises for installation on the completion of the laying of floors and linoleum.\n\nThe bill of materials for the school does not call for the supplying of a pump and compression tank with the well to supply the water system. This would appear to be a separate item. The well is forty-five feet deep and is located about twenty feet north of the school. I have had it bailed out and it requires cleaning out for about another two feet which will make the maximum lift from the bottom of the well forty-seven feet.\n\nThe specifications and bill of material under the plumbing contract calls for a thirty gallon hot water boiler. This will require a heating element or source. I would recommend that a Hydro Electric Power Commission electric heater be installed at a cost of approximately thirty dollars to include heater, asbestos jacket, thermostat control, cable, labour and inspection. The cost of operating this heater is\nforty-nine cents per hundred watt per month which would be $1.96 less\nthe usual ten per cent off for prompt payment, $1.77 per month. Total\ncost per annum $21.24. I would recommend this type of hot water heater\nas I do not think a jacket heater would heat it for this amount and\nwould certainly not be as dependable. The teacher's residence does not\nrequire a coal heater and would best be served by an electric stove\nwhich by arrangement would be the responsibility of the teacher tenant\nor by arrangement otherwise. I would like to be advised in this\nparticular matter as Mr. John Loukes, the present teacher, would like\nto know whether he would be required to buy a stove or not.\n\nPainting\nI wrote on February 4th and 18th, this agency file 6-3(25) requesting\ninstructions in regard to painting and as this can be started immediately\nI am anxiously awaiting instructions.\n\nIn purchase order 83552 which was placed prior to settling the matter\nof the exterior finishing of the school, twelve gallons of white exterior\nlead and oil paint, first grade, was supplied at a cost of $59.40 which\nis not now needed as insulating brick was used as the exterior covering. There\nmay be some additional supplies required and I would request authority\nto exchange a portion of this for other materials should this occur, if\nnot, for a credit in this amount. I would only know after painting had\ncommenced. It will take approximately three weeks to complete the paint-\ning allowing sufficient time between coats. If I had the instructions\nin regard to painting, the school should be completed within approximately\nthree weeks from the date of notice.\n\nElectric wiring\nThis has been completed and has passed the hydro inspector's inspection.\nDue to the short shipment of one control, the furnace is operating without\nthe fan but this can be hooked up as soon as the control is received.\n\nIn changing from plan 837 on which most of the materials were purchased\nto plan 865 and providing a larger building there has been very little\nsurplus material but there will be some surplus, for instance some insul-\nbric siding (jasper black), possibly some insulation, but there will be\nvery little lumber, no cement. On the other hand the extras have been\nkept to a minimum. A list of this surplus will be made and forwarded\nwith a request for directions as to disposal.\n\nV. N.

Would you please requisition for the type of pump and tank that you wish and I would suggest that you advise the names of local suppliers.\n\nYou are authorized to have installed a hydro electric power commission electric heater at a cost of $30. with the asbestos jacket thermostat control cable etc.\n\nI note that you can negotiate with regard to the surplus paint and if there is still any left over or any other materials that you advise us so that we can arrange to transfer them to a building project next year.\n\nBernard F.

Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water St.,\nPeterborough, Ont.\n\nFurniture - Alnwick Indian Day School\n\nPlease find attached the standard scale of issue for teacherages provided by the Department. Where an electric stove is provided, we furnish only a range costing in the neighbourhood of $60.00 or $90.00. We do not provide refrigerators. This and other items are to be provided by the teacher concerned and will naturally be their property.\n\nIn other words, we provide only minimum essentials and even these are not provided where a teacher already has sufficient furniture of his or her own.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education.\nGoodfellow & Dougherty,\n379 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nGentlemen:\n\nRe: Flat Sheet Steel for Alnwick Indian Bay School\n\nWe have your letter of the 8th ultimo regarding the 260 sheets of 25 gauge galvanized iron, ordered by us on your behalf from Westeel Products Limited, Montreal.\n\nWe are informed by this company that they are willing to substitute heavier gauge material if the 260 sheets already supplied are returned to them at 4107 Richelieu Street, Montreal, Quebec. However, they feel that, inasmuch as the material was supplied in accordance with specifications furnished, freight covering this shipment to Peterborough and return should be paid by the purchaser.\n\nWesteel Products Limited now offer to supply, subject to prior sale, 130 sheets of 2\u00bd gauge galvanized 36\" x 120\" and 130 sheets of 26 gauge galvanized 36\" x 120\", for a total price of $15.05 f.o.b. Peterborough, sales tax included. Increase in price is due to the considerable extra amount of steel being provided on account of heavier gauges and larger sheets. However fewer sheets may be required for this job. Our Engineering and Construction Division inform us that specifications for the heating system insofar as gauge is concerned should be definitely adhered to due to fire hazard; these specifications and plan 865 you already have.\n\nWill you please therefore let us know as soon as possible the number of galvanized sheets you will require, indicating their gauge and size, so that we may order them from Westeel Products Limited.

The well, which is completed with the exception of the placing of the tile, is fifty-six feet deep. It will require a deep-well centrifugal pump for inside installation. I suggest a sixty gallon tank as this would give a reserve and not cause the pump to come into operation so frequently.\n\nThe names of the suppliers submitted were taken from the telephone directory. There does not appear to be any plumber at Hastings, Ontario. I have, therefore, submitted the names of plumbing concerns in the larger centres nearest to the school, as listed.\n\nV. M.

The reason for the considerable amount of adjustment is due to the original bill of materials being made out for plan 827 which was changed at a later date to plan 865 for a larger building. Further difference occurred in that blackboards originally tendered for by the Peterborough Lumber Company were not obtainable at the time and they were apparently ordered by the Purchasing Agent from Noir School Supply Limited, 106-108 York Street, Toronto and shipped to the teacher. This account has not been presented to this office for payment although the blackboards have been received and installed. This made a difference of some $200.00 in the Peterborough Lumber Company account.\n\nThere is a small quantity of surplus material chiefly consisting of four squares of insul brick siding and also three 8 x 8 x 10 posts costing $26.00. Against this there is a small purchase of trim and finishing material which will largely offset the credit. However, there will be another account submitted covering these transactions before the end of the month.\n\nY. M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent,\nRice and Mud Lakes Agency.\n19th March, 1949.\n\nMr. V.M. Eastwood,\nSuperintendent, Indian Agency,\n385 Water Street,\nPeterborough, Ontario.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant enclosing requisition for a centrifugal pump and compression tank for installation at the well which is to supply the water system at the Alnwick Indian Day School.\n\nOur information is that considerable difficulty frequently occurs in the operation of a centrifugal pump.

MACKAY\n\nRe: Alnwick Indian Day School\n\nWith reference to your letter of March 17th, 1949, I am returning the correspondence which has been received from Mr. Richard Surerus.\n\nWith reference to your request for information, I submit the following:\n\n(1) Size of school, accommodation and type of construction.\n\nOne-room school with a teacher's residence, accommodation for approximately forty children. A new plan (No. 865) was followed providing electricity in the teacherage and school; full plumbing and toilets for both pupils and teacher.\n\n(2) Were tenders called? If not, why not?\n\nTenders were not called. It was originally intended to erect this school in the summer of 1947, and Indian Superintendent Eastwood made extensive enquiries in the vicinity of the Alnwick Reserve, and wrote us as follows in a letter dated August 23rd, 1947:\n\n\"Although it is generally known in the vicinity of the Alnwick Reserve that a school is to be built on this reserve, I have had no other requests for plans and specifications by builders in order to...\"\nsubmit tenders. Mr. McMillan is the only builder to my knowledge living near this locality, and is well recommended. I have spoken to several small contractors, but they are so taken up with work they are not interested in seeing the plans.\"\n\nThe tender that Mr. McMillan submitted at that time on the old plan 837 was considered too high, and in a letter dated September 26th, 1947, Superintendent Eastwood was informed that we were not prepared to consider Mr. McMillan's tender.\n\n(3) If tenders were not called, how was construction undertaken?\n\n(4) Who recommended Mr. McMillan, and was the usual Ministerial approval secured for his employment?\n\n(5) What rate of pay has Mr. McMillan received and was he given a free hand with respect to the employment of labour?\n\nIt was necessary to revote funds in 1948-49, and on June 8th, 1948, Superintendent Eastwood was written in part as follows:\n\n\"We have found that contractors are reticent to forward firm tenders for the erection of these schools. Within the last two months we have been able to engage a number of foremen-carpenters across the country who are willing to supervise the erection of this building using local and Indian labour. The usual rate for their services is $1.50 per hour. Under such a day labour plan, the Department buys all the necessary materials from a standard bill which we have prepared. It is usually necessary to arrange for sub-contracts for the electricity, plumbing, etc. Such a plan also provides for the employment of a certain amount of Indian labour and we have been quite satisfied with the type of school thus erected. As you know, the drawings and specifications are very clear and concise and have presented no difficulties...\"\nfor other carpenters who have erected this building. Do you know of any such carpenter who would be willing to undertake the erection of this building under such terms. If so, I would ask that you advise the Department. I attach a copy of the standard bill of materials which we supply in such cases.\"\n\nIn reply to that communication, Superintendent Eastwood forwarded a letter from Mr. McMillan offering to supervise the erection of the Alnwick School as foreman-carpenter at the rate of $1.50 per hour. His name was submitted to the Minister's Office in a memorandum dated August 6th, 1948, and the employment of Mr. McMillan was approved. It will be noted from our letter of June 8th, 1948 (quoted above) that Superintendent Eastwood was advised that local and Indian labour could be employed.\n\n(6) Were the materials required for the construction purchased through the departmental purchasing agent?\n\nWith the exception of gravel, stone and sand, and a few other items, materials required were purchased through the departmental purchasing agent. P.C. 4510 dated October 5th, 1948, authorized the acceptance of the tender of the Peterborough Lumber Company, for supplying lumber and millwork.\n\n(7) Approximate cost of the school.\n\nThe approximate cost of the school is slightly over $19,000.00. Plan 837 (with no plumbing or electricity) is costing now between $18,000.00 and $19,000.00 to build. We, therefore, feel that the cost of this building, complete with the extra services mentioned above, is fair and reasonable. This has a full basement, convertible for use as a second classroom when the pupilage warrants it. This is the first and only school built according to this particular plan.\nI may add that in connection with the painting of the school, in which Mr. Surerus was particularly interested, I attach copy of a memorandum forwarded to the Minister's Office on February 14th, 1949, and also a copy of the reply we received dated February 22nd, 1949.\n\nBernard F.

Conditions are now favourable to resumption of the work.\n\nThe well is approximately seventy feet deep and large enough to take a 36\" cement tile. At present it is filled with water to about 15' from the top. This has filled in a three weeks period since the well was last bailed out. Part may be surface water but not all. When the last ten feet was dug out there was evidence of a flow of water which I believe should be adequate for the purpose. Over one week-end with frost in the ground, no melting, there was an accumulation of approximately 1200 gallons.\n\nAt the site is sufficient 36' tile for 45' of well, which has been paid for. This size of tile is difficult to obtain. I do not know of any local supply available under a 2 month or longer delivery. The tile are 2\u00bd' deep. For the 25' and one extra for top, eleven would be required. As these tile cost about $7.50 a piece there would be considerable saving in using 8\" tile for the 27\u00bd' required. The top of the 36\" tile could be covered with a reinforced tile cover with the 8\" tile cemented in. The 8\" tile would carry the intake and discharge pipes for the pump. The 8\" tile is 30\" long and cost $1.40 each. This would permit installation and withdrawal of the pipe for repair also ventilation for the well.\n\n...........\nTo complete the school, less landscaping of the grounds, the following expenditures have been authorized.\n\nWell\nPurchase required amount of pipe $105.00\nLabour digging trench 75.00\nWiring motor 15.00\nNecessary expenditure installing pump -\n\nIf the above suggestion is approved I will require an accountable advance cheque to pay labour as follows:\nPaylist week of April 9 - carpentry $54.61\nPaylist week of April 16th completion of carpentry work 30.80\nPaylist week of April 9.

No. 1,\nOttawa Hastings.\n\nOctober 2, 1922\n\n575607\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nMemorandum\n\nMr. [signature]\n\nThe cost of alterations and repairs to the old Mission house, viz., $1500.00 will have to be charged to Capital account as the Interest account will not bear the charge and at the same time permit of the usual annual cash distribution.\n\nAn Order-in-Council will be necessary.\n\nAn accountable cheque for $500.00 is being sent the Agent at his request.\n\n[signature]\nAccountant.\n\nOttawa, 6th October, 1923.\nOttawa, October 10, 1922.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned begs to report the necessity for providing residential accommodation for the teacher of the day school on the reserve of the Mississaugas Indians of Alnwick, in the county of Northumberland in the province of Ontario.\n\nIn order to provide the necessary accommodation, it has been found upon investigation by the architect of the Department that by an expenditure of $1500 for repairs a disused building on the reserve can be utilized as a suitable residence for the school teacher, and the Indians of the band have expressed their willingness to have the expenditure made from their funds.\n\nThe undersigned would recommend that under Section 89 of the Indian Act authority be given for the above mentioned expenditure being made from the capital at the credit of the Mississaugas of Alnwick, which amounts to $91,930.21.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nThe recommendation herewith is for approval of an expenditure of $1500 from Alnwick band capital on repairs to a disused building in order to provide a residence for the teacher of the Indian day school on the reserve.\n\nSome years ago the school teacher lived in the building which it is now proposed to utilize and which has been in disuse for some years. The practice of leaving it to the teacher to find quarters in Indian houses or elsewhere\u2014which has obtained for some time\u2014is not satisfactory. To build a new residence would be too costly; and upon the architect of the Department being sent to the reserve recently he found that the \"old mission house\" on the reserve could be made into a suitable residence for the teacher at a cost of $1500 for alterations and repairs. The Indians themselves, who object to a sufficient expenditure to provide a new residence, are willing that $1500 be taken from their funds (though they have not specified that it be taken from their capital) to repair the old mission building.\n\nSection 89 provides for expenditures of band capital on the construction and repair of school buildings, etc., without the consent of the Indians.\n\nThese Indians have $91,930.21 at the credit of their capital accounts.\n\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, October 10, 1922.\nThe Board had under consideration a memorandum from the Honourable the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs reporting the necessity for providing residential accommodation for the teacher of the day school on the reserve of the Mississagwa Indians of Alnwick, in the county of Northumberland in the province of Ontario; that in order to provide the necessary accommodation, it has been found upon investigation by the architect of the Department of Indian Affairs that by an expenditure of $1500 for repairs a disused building on the reserve can be utilized as a suitable residence for the school teacher, and the Indians of the band have expressed their willingness to have the expenditure made from their funds.\n\nThe Superintendent General recommends that under Section 89 of the Indian Act authority be given for the above mentioned expenditure being made from the capital at the credit of the Mississagwas of Alnwick, which amounts to $91,930.21.\n\nThe Board concur in the above recommendation and submit the same for favourable consideration.\n\nClerk of the Privy Council.\n\nThe Honourable\n\nThe Superintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMEMORANDUM.\n\nMR.

This will make the salary allowed Miss Howe from that date at the rate of $95 per teaching month.

All the teachers of the agency, with the exception of Miss Sproul and Miss Hammond, of the River Settlement and Oneida No. 2 schools respectively, have signified their desire to return to their duties after the summer holidays and Miss Sproul is willing to return if she was to get a substantial increase in her salary, and no doubt she has taken this matter up with Mr. Ferrier, with whom she is acquainted.\n\nMiss Sproul is a very good teacher and her services, if possible, should be retained and I would recommend an increase of $50.00 per annum in her case if it is at all possible to retain her. Miss Hammond, teacher of Oneida No. 3 Indian Day School left the reserve and did not signify her intention as to whether she was returning or not and I have heard that she is not returning, and I am getting in touch with her immediately to find out if this is true. I am also enclosing requisition for school material forms for the six schools of this agency.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nD. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind.

Cheques in payment of the teachers' salaries, with the exception of the teachers of Bear Creek and River Settlement, have been sent to you. Cheques for the two schools mentioned were sent direct to the teachers' addresses.\n\nRegarding the request for an increase in salary to Miss Helen Howe, teacher of the Back Settlement Indian Day School, I regret that we have no funds this year to provide the increase asked for. You should ascertain definitely from Miss Howe at the earliest possible date whether she will return and resume duties when the school reopens after the present summer holidays, and advise the Department accordingly.\n\nThe Department understands that Miss Sproul, teacher of the River Settlement School, is forwarding you her resignation.

Kindly authorize the temporary engagement of a teacher and inform this office what salary will be paid and how it will be paid.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind.

The illness of Miss Howe is regretted.\n\nIn this connection I have to say, in order that the school will not remain closed, the temporary appointment of Mr. Glen Marshman is approved until such time as Miss Howe is able to resume work. Mr. Marshman will be allowed salary for the period he teaches, at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. You should arrange with him to begin duties at the earliest possible date - it being understood that his services will terminate when Miss Howe is ready to return.\n\nThe Department will continue payment of Miss Howe's salary until November 15th, by which time it is hoped she will have regained her health. When the return of attendance for the current quarter is being prepared, it should show clearly the dates between which Miss Howe was absent. When she resumes duties, you might forward a statement showing the dates between which Mr. Marshman taught and the number of teaching days, when a cheque in payment of the salary due him for his services could be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

J. Out\nOttawa, February 22, 1933.\n\nSir:\n\nA communication has been received from Benjamin French regarding his grandchildren, whom he states you have refused permission to attend the Back Settlement Indian Day School. He states that the mother, who was a member of the band, married a white man, now deceased, and that the children are residing with him.\n\nWhile the children are half-breeds, it is thought, unless you have reasonable grounds for objection, that they might be permitted to attend the day school, especially as they are residing on the reserve with their grandfather. I would request that you enquire into this matter and inform the Department if there is any reason why they should not be permitted to attend the Indian day school. If you offer no objection, you might advise Benjamin French to have the children attend, on the understanding that he will see that they attend regularly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir:\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-2-1 of February 23rd, with reference to the grand-children of Ben French of the Chippewa Band and will explain in detail the conditions regarding these children being on the Reserve.\n\nClara French, daughter of Ben, married a white man named William Peterson of London, Ont., about 12 years ago and left the reserve and resided in London. From this union were born three children: William, now aged 12 yrs.; Clara, aged 10 yrs.; and Gilbert, aged 8 yrs. Mrs. Peterson died on January 15th, 1932, and Peterson continued to keep house in London with the help of a housekeeper until May. Conditions at the home became bad and the Children's Aid Society of London offered to take the children to which step the grandparents objected and the father continued to keep the children until the summer holidays of 1932, and in July of that year the two older children were taken to the grandparents' home on the Chippewa Reserve, where they have remained ever since. In November of 1932 the father of the children did take to the French home the younger child and left him there, as he was out of employment and was unable to keep the child. Since then the children have been at the home of Ben French; the father has only contributed the sum of $3.00 towards their keep, and they have not seen him since November last. Peterson has always resided in London but owns no property there and has always rented; he has household furniture only.\n\nIn September last the grandparents sent the two older children to a white school at Christina, which is only a mile distant and the trustees of the school complained about them and they were removed from the school, although French advises me that he paid for their books and was agreeable to pay school tax to allow them to continue and still is agreeable to pay any tax necessary.\n\nWhile recently visiting Back Settlement school the teacher informed me that two of these children came to the school which is over two miles from the French home and the teacher asked...\nme my opinion as to allowing them to attend and I informed her that as her school was crowded for seats at the present time and as these children were of white parentage I considered that they could not be stopped from attending the Christina school under the circumstances and that as her school had not the accommodation they should be advised to attend the white school, where I knew there was plenty of room. I might add that a couple of Indians also complained to me that these children being white should not be allowed on the reserve. I also seen one of the trustees of the Christina school and talked the matter over with him and informed him of the parentage of these children and that in my opinion they could not be stopped from attending their school, which is so close at hand.\n\nWhile Ben French is a very good Indian and entirely self-supporting, he did not ask the consent of the Indian Council of the Band or the permission of the Department to allow these children to reside on the reserve in the first place as he should have done and in view of the fact the Department has approved of the removal of other children such as these (Julia Fisher's grand-children, your file 39007 of March 20th 1932 and Lucy Fisher's adopted grand-child, your file 102-7 of Jan 27-33) and in view of the fact that paragraph 3 of your circular 102-1 of July 2nd, 1931 criticized Agents for allowing these outsiders to remain on the Indian Reserves and also in view of the fact that the Children's Aid Society offered help for these children, I would consider that they should be removed from the reserve in the Spring and their father made responsible for their support and keep, for while Ben French can and will support them properly providing he has his health, by allowing them to remain will mean they will to some extent be charges of the Department for schooling and medical attention.\n\nThe number of Indian children attending Back Settlement school taxes the seating at this school and there is no other Indian school close that these children can attend and if they remain with their grandparents I consider that they should attend the nearest white school, as many other Indian children do who live off the reserve or on the boundaries of a Reserve.\n\nSecretary,\nDept of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. Moore, Indian Agent.\nMarch 3, 1933.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 28th ultimo in respect to the grandchildren of Ben French who are unlawfully residing on the Caradoc Indian reserve, and to say that your observance of Departmental instructions regarding such cases is much appreciated.\n\nIn view of the fact that the Department has already approved of the removal of children, not members of the band, under similar circumstances, the same procedure will have to be followed in the present case.\n\nWhile the sympathies of the Department are with these motherless children, the fact remains that they have the status of whites and cannot legally be allowed to take up residence on the reserve.\n\nIt is felt that they should be permitted to remain with their grandparents until the winter is over when you should put the matter in the hands of the Children's Aid Society of London which is responsible for such children.\n\nYou might inform the grandparents of the Department's decision.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. D. Moore, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nNuncey,\nOnt.\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nSecretary.\nSir;\n\nI would wish to refer you to my letter of February 28th, 1933 and your reply of March 3rd, 1933, file No. 7-2-1 and dealing with the grand-children of Ben French, who were unlawfully residing on the Chippewa Reserve of this Agency and whom the Department gave instructions that I should have them removed when the Winter was over.\n\nFrom information I have now received these children did remove and go to London for a short visit and then returned to the reserve to the home of Ben French where they have been over a year and where they have been attending a local white school. I am also informed that the white father of these children has taken another woman as wife and is resident in London, Ont. Ben French is a man that minds his own business and lives on the reserve boundary and I only by accident learned that he had these children in his home again.\n\nI am this day advising him that they must be removed to the home of their father in London and have given him two weeks to carry out this order and advised him that if he failed to do so in that time it would be necessary that the police remove them. I considered this order necessary in view of the fact that French will resist this action of removing these children as he has shown by his actions in keeping them at his home contrary to the instructions I gave him in the Spring of 1933. If this action meets with your approval I would wished to be so advised and if not, what further action you would desire me to take.\n\nsecretary.\nDept of Ind.

Moore, Indian Agent.\nDecember 24, 1934.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter of the 12th instant with reference to the grandchildren of Ben French I have to advise you that these white children should be removed from the reserve permanently. The department approves of your report in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant\n\nA.F. MacKenzie\nSecretary.\n\nA.D.

SAUNDERS\nSecretary\n11 Glebeholme Blvd.\nToronto\n\nTORONTO, ONT. Nov. 9th, 1936.\n\nHon. T.A. Crerar,\nSuperintendent-General of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am directed by this Committee to bring to your attention a matter concerning a school on the Indian Reserve at Muncey in Middlesex, known as the Back Settlement school.\n\nThis reserve, as you know, has more than 1400 persons living on it, all of whom are Protestants. In the school in question there is employed a teacher\u2014Miss Howe\u2014who is a Roman Catholic. I understand that she has been employed for some time and received her appointment on the recommendation of the Indian Agent Mr. Moore.\n\nFrom the wording of the Indian Act, this is entirely irregular, as it specifically states that the teacher will be of the religion of the band.\n\nI am requested to respectfully urge that this condition be remedied, and a Protestant teacher placed in this school.\n\nMight we add too, that this is the second complaint of this nature within a few years, a teacher being replaced about two years ago in the Oneida section of the reserve. We do not know the religion of the Indian Agent, but surely some care should be exercised in appointing agents and teachers whose religion is different from every one residing on this reserve. We are informed that the newly appointed R.C.M.P. officer is a Roman Catholic. If that is so, we feel that it is only fair and just to submit that on a reserve where not one soul in 1482 is other than a Protestant, no one but a Protestant should be employed in these official positions.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nL.H. Saunders,\nSecretary.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nOttawa, November 19th, 1936.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDeputy Supt. General of Indian Affairs.\n\nAt the request of the Minister, I am enclosing herewith a copy of a letter he has received from Mr. L.H. Saunders. I would particularly refer you to the third paragraph in the letter.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\n\nEnclosure (1).\nMEMORANDUM\n\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General,\n\nI am in receipt of Mr. Jackson's memorandum of the 19th instant, enclosing copy of a letter received from Mr. L. H. Saunders, Secretary, Grand Orange Lodge Ontario West.\n\nIn August, 1929, Indian Agent Moore submitted three applications that he had received for appointment as teacher at the Back Settlement Indian Day School in the Caradoc Agency (Electoral District of Middlesex West). One of these applicants was Miss Helen M. Howe and the Department chose her as being the best qualified for the position. Mr. Saunders is under a wrong impression when he considers her appointment was recommended by Indian Agent Moore. Miss Howe's application for appointment did not state her religion and it was not until some years afterwards that the Department was informed that she is a Roman Catholic.\n\nMiss Howe began duties at the Back Settlement Indian Day School on September 1st, 1929, and has taught continuously since that time. Reports received from the Public School Inspector, who visits the Back Settlement School twice a year, have always been\nThe Honourable the Superintendent General\n\nvery favourable. Under these circumstances, the Department has not considered it necessary to dispense with her services.\n\nReferring to the third paragraph of Mr. Saunders' letter, it is presumed that he refers to Section 10 (2) of the Indian Act. I would point out that this section does not apply in the case of the appointment of teachers to Indian schools.\n\nIt has always been the practice to appoint a Protestant teacher when the Indians of the Band are Protestant and a Catholic teacher when the Indians are Catholic.\n\nIn view of Miss Howe's long and satisfactory service, it is felt that she is entitled to some consideration, and I would therefore recommend that her services be retained until the end of the present academic year, viz., June 30, 1937, when she could be given due notice that her services would not be required after that date. If she was dismissed immediately, the pupils would, no doubt, be handicapped by a change of teacher in the middle of the term.\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nReferring to your memorandum of the 21st ultimo, (file 7-2-1) regarding the position held by Miss Helen M. Howe, as teacher in the Indian Day School at Caradoc Agency, the Minister has no objection to your continuing her services until the end of the present academic year. At this time the question of her re-engagement can then be given further consideration.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nPrivate Secretary.\nReturn to School.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nDr. McGill,\n\nReferring to your enquiry regarding Miss Helen M. Howe, teacher of the Back Settlement Indian Day School, I would point out that in August, 1929, Indian Agent Moore submitted three applications that he had received for appointment as teacher of this school. One of these applicants was Miss Howe, and the Department chose her as being the best qualified for the position. Agent Moore had not made a definite recommendation regarding which of the three applicants should be chosen.\n\nMiss Howe's application for appointment did not state her religion and it was not until some years afterwards that the Department was informed that she is a Roman Catholic.\n\nWhile the Indian children attending this school are Protestants, none of the Protestant churches takes any special interest in the school.\n\nRegarding religious instruction, our Programme of Studies for Indian Day Schools prescribes \"Scriptural Reading\", \"The Ten Commandments\", \"The Lord's Prayer\" and the \"Life of Christ\". As far as we are aware, Miss Howe has strictly followed our instructions in this regard.\n\nPublic School Inspector Sexton visits the Back Settlement School twice each year. The last inspection was on September 23rd, 1936, at which time he reported regarding the teacher as follows: \"A successful teacher of Indian children. Miss Howe is doing good work here. The general management and discipline of this school are of the highest order. The pupils are obedient, but very shy. The teacher has done much to improve their manner and habits\".\n\nThe Back Settlement School is in the Caradoc Agency (Electoral District of Middlesex West). The Indian Agent is Mr. A. D. Moore, Muncey, Ont. In addition to this school, there are five other day schools in this Agency, at each of which a Protestant teacher is employed.\n\nChief, Training Division.\nJanuary 9th, 1937.\n\nMEMORANDUM\n\nDeputy Minister -\n\nWith reference to the matter discussed in my telephone communication with Mr. Jackson of yesterday, I am enclosing herewith a memorandum submitted by Mr. Phelan of the Welfare and Training Division. This report would seem to indicate that circumstances are not such as would justify the termination of Miss Howe's services. The fact that a person holds certain opinions does not warrant us in assuming that she would attempt to impose those opinions on others, and to treat her as though she had already done so would, in my opinion, be a case of outright persecution, and entirely unwarranted by existing circumstances.\n\nDirector of Indian Affairs.\nMinister's Office\n\nOttawa, February 4th, 1937.\n\nDr. H.W. McGill,\nDirector of Indian Affairs Branch.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 9th instant, regarding Miss Howe, teacher of the Bank Settlement Indian Day School, Caradoo Agency, I have discussed the matter with the Minister. He is not desirous that any action should be taken to terminate Miss Howe's services.\n\nC.W. Jackson,\nSecretary.\nMelbourne, Ont.\nMay 6, 1940.\n\nTo the Secretary,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to advise you that I did not receive the report form for Indian Day Schools for the Fiscal Year ending March 31, 1940. As the other teachers on this Reserve have received one some time ago I thought mine must have been lost in the mail. Please forward me one if you haven't already done so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nHelen M. Harvey,\nBack Settlement Indian Day School,\nCaradoc Reserve.\n\n[Stamp: Department of Mines & Resources]\n[Stamp: Indian Affairs Branch]\n[Stamp: May 8, 1940]\n[Stamp: Registered]\nMuncy, Ontario,\nJanuary, 7th 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reporting matters of interest at the Caradoc Agency during December I would advise as follows:\n\nIndian day schools were in operation during the month but were closed on December 10th for the Christmas vacation. The teachers have been provided with vocational training materials as well as supplies to enable them to prepare hot noon day lunches for the pupils during the winter months. A filtered well was recently dug on the grounds at the Oneida No. 2 School. The water in this new well is proving satisfactory both in quantity and purity.\n\nM.W. McCracken, In Charge,\nCaradoc Agency.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nFebruary 6th, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn the past, the Day Schools of Caradoc Agency have been operating on Eastern Standard Time. In view of recent Government regulations whereby Eastern Daylight Saving Time is compulsory throughout Ontario, I would wish to be advised if the Caradoc Agency Indian Day Schools should change to Daylight Saving Time or still continue on Standard Time.\n\nThe Department is no doubt aware that time means nothing to an Indian, and in spite of all the ingenuity of the various teachers, the Indian children are habitually late in arriving at school even when Standard time is in force.\n\nIf Daylight Saving Time is to be made compulsory at the Indian Day Schools, the routine of the school will be upset by children who come late.\n\nIn my opinion it would be wise to leave the matter as to whether the schools operate on Daylight Saving or Standard Time to the discretion of the teacher, who would be in a better position to decide which time would work most satisfactorily in each section of the Reserve. Kindly advise if the Department approves of granting the teachers permission to operate on whichever time he or she finds most suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. W. McCracken\n\nM. W. McCracken, In Charge,\nCaradoc Agency.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 10, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 6th instant with reference to recent Government regulations whereby Daylight Saving Time is compulsory throughout Canada. In view of the definite instructions issued by the Government in this regard I believe that all schools on the Caradoc Reserve should operate on Eastern Daylight Saving Time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. M.W. McCracken,\nIn Charge Indian Agency,\nMuncey, Ont.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn your letter to Mr. G. W. Down, Indian Agent at Timoney Ontario, you stated that you would appreciate hearing from me before taking another school. I regret not having written before but I was not aware of the fact that you asked me to get in contact with you as Mr. Down did not tell me.\n\nYou likely have been informed that to fill in my teaching year, Mr. MacNeil asked me to assist Mr. Down with the clerical work in the Indian Office at Timoney Ont.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6116, file 378-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nI consented to do this only when he assured me that my duties as teacher would not be required for the remainder of the present term.\n\nAs June is drawing to a close, I wish to state that I have no position in view for the coming year. If there is not going to be any school at Back Settlement for the academic year and you know of any position I could fill, I appreciate hearing from you. I ought say I would like to work near my home, as I have an aged father and it is necessary that I return home each evening.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nHelen M. Harvey.\nOttawa, June 22nd, 1942.\n\nDear Madam:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant in connection with your appointment as teacher of an Indian day school for the academic year 1942-43.\n\nIndian Agent Down was recently written to with reference to securing accommodation for the coming academic year. If he is successful in that regard, we will be able to authorize you to take charge of this school. However, if accommodation cannot be secured, we will offer you another school later on.\n\nIn the meantime, I understand that the Administrative Branch would like to retain your services in Mr. Down's office for the summer months, at least, and I will arrange to have a letter written to you in this regard.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMiss Helen M. Howe,\nMelbourne,\nOnt.\nOttawa,\nSeptember 22, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY\n\nRe: Back Settlement Indian Day School, No. 378.\n\nThe above-mentioned school will re-open on October 1, 1942, and the former teacher, Miss Helen M. Hose, will be in charge. She will be allowed salary at the same rate as previously; namely, $95.00 a teaching month, plus bonus.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nOctober 9, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFrom reports received it is evident that the Department is not justified in continuing the Muncey Indian Day School in view of the very small enrolment and the still smaller average attendance. I also understand that it has not yet been found possible to re-open the Back Settlement School in the basement of the church.\n\nHowever, the question of Miss Howe's appointment in your office has not been definitely decided, although application has been made for a further extension of her services which will, no doubt, be granted. In the meantime I am advised that a competition has been advertised for the position. She will no doubt apply.\n\nIf Miss Howe is successful in the competition and is permanently appointed to your office, it is our intention to close the Muncey School and re-open the Back Settlement School with Miss Comfort as teacher. If, however, Miss Howe does not secure the position in your office, it is our intention to have her take charge of the Back Settlement School.\n\nMy purpose in writing you this letter is simply to outline our intentions in the matter and consequently no attempt should be made to re-open the Back Settlement School or to close the Muncey School at the present time.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. G.W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nOctober 15, 1942.\n\nAttention - R.A. Hoey, Esq.\n\nYour File 7-7-8 & 7-4-1-\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThere is also the question of the Back Settlement and Lower Muncey Schools. You will have learned by this time that Miss Helen Howe has definitely decided against applying for the position of Clerk at this Office and will be available for the Back Settlement School when ready. The new desks for this school arrived a few days ago but no other equipment so far. However it is noted in the last paragraph of your letter, that at present the Back Settlement School is not to be opened and the Lower Muncey is not to be closed. I presume you will advise as to future intentions. In the meantime I must take advantage of the Church's offer, if only for the storage for desks and other equipment that, I presume, will be arriving shortly.\n\nI might also say, I agree with your decision to close one school. There is no justification for continuing the Lower Muncey School, but whatever you have in mind, thought should be given to centralization. If that is done, I think the situation could be overcome with a minimum of trouble and to the satisfaction of all concerned. It would certainly blend in with other outlined propositions.\n\nYou will please advise whether or not I am interpreting the last paragraph of your letter correctly in delaying any action in opening school for the Back Settlement in the basement of the Church until further orders.\n\nYour obedient servant\nG.W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 6, 1942.\n\nMemorandum for file:\n\nWhen Mr. Hoey visited the Caradoc Reserve recently the following arrangements were made with reference to the Back Settlement and Muncey Schools:\n\n1. Arrangements have been made to conduct the Back Settlement School in the basement of the Anglican Church and the Agent was instructed to have the necessary supplies placed there as soon as possible. If Miss Howe does not wish to continue in the Indian office at Muncey, she will re-open the school immediately after the Christmas holidays. In that event, the Back Settlement School will continue in operation until June 30, 1943, at which time the situation should be reviewed with a view to determining if the number of children available justifies the continuance of the school for the academic year 1943-44.\n\n2. However, if Miss Howe wishes to remain in the Indian office at Muncey, the Agent was instructed to close the Muncey Indian Day School before the Christmas holidays and place the present teacher of that school, Miss Comfort, in charge of the Back Settlement School after the holidays.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMrs Helen M.

Down,\nIndian Agent.\nMunsey, Ontario,\nJuly 25th, 1944.\n\nI am in receipt of your letter under date of July 25th, and note your comments regarding salaries with increases to teachers with more than a year's satisfactory service.\n\nI think, as you do, in fact I have pointed out to our teachers, that the salaries paid and being offered by school trustees of the white sections are unusual and that it is only the abnormal times which prompt them to offer such increases. I have also pointed out that the salaries offered are basic and do not carry a cost of living bonus. I think you have been generous enough and I am sure our teachers with more than a year's service will appreciate your consideration.\n\nWith the authority given, as mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter, I do not anticipate any difficulty in filling all schools. I will follow your instructions and hire teachers only with teaching qualifications, and submit full particulars immediately following engagement.\n\nI would draw your attention to \"Munsey Indian Day School\" as mentioned in Column 3 of your letter. This school was closed over a year ago.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nINDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nGWD/BG\nMuncey, Ontario,\nNovember 18th, 1944.\n\nI have received your letter of Nov; 7th, with Mrs. Daisy Thompson's attached. It would appear that she discussed her problem of transportation with Mr Phelan, during his recent visit to the Agency and I do not think he was favourably impressed.\n\nYou ask for my comments. To be fair, I cannot recommend her request unless you would consider extending the same consideration to all concerned. As a matter of fact the actual distance from her residence to the Back Settlement School is less than any other teacher with travel distance. 3\u00bd miles to be exact. Her husband is a farmer and apparently needs the family car, he therefore drives Mrs Thompson to school and returns for her after school. In other words she bases her mileage on two unnecessary trips as far as school work is concerned.\n\nChecking other teachers mileages,\n\nI quote.\n\nMrs Campbell, one way, 14 miles.\nMr. Reid, \" 9 \"\nMrs. Gould, \" 4 \"\n\nI think Mrs. Thompson's real grouch is against two teachers, Oneida No.1 and Oneida No. 3 who were granted an increase of salary on equal basis with her.\n\nMrs. Thompson is a good teacher but I feel we cannot make a transportation adjustment unless we are prepared to give general consideration which would include Miss Comfort, Mr. Ryckman, and all teachers with travel distance.\n\nGeo W. Down,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nIndian Agent.\nDear Sir:\n\nI would appreciate it very much if you could give me a statement of the amount of salary I earned, and the tax deducted, for the year 1942, as I was employed as teacher of Back Settlement, Indian Day School, Caradoc Reserve. I need the above information so that my 1943 tax can be refunded to me.\n\nThanking you in advance,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nP.S.

McCutcheon\nChief Treasury Officer.\nGeneral Report of Conditions and Activities at the Caradoc Agency, for the Six Month Period ending June 20, 1945.\n\nSchools and Education\n\nDuring visits to the various Indian Day Schools one is again impressed with the closeness of the tie-up between schools and general road conditions. One could condemn all schools as inaccessible for at least four months of every year. Attendance, as reported, at the end of each month might appear, and is sometimes disappointing but one Spring and one Fall is sufficient to make one sympathize with pupils and teachers.\n\nIt has been said, and reported many times, that our schools are well-managed and progress in academic studies reaches a good standard of educational requirement. There is, however, and I have mentioned it in previous reports, plenty of scope and pupil material for advancement in Vocational and Manual Training. Many of our teachers today are apt to place this type of training as a \"fillein,\" or a nuisance, which tends to clutter up the class-room. In our rural schools it does perhaps present a problem; this is because the teacher in her, or his, endeavour to supervise seven or eight grades in one room is annoyed and distracted to suddenly hear the screech of a saw, or the pounding of a hammer, or \"Teacher, Johnny has cut his finger!\" or \"Johnny has his thumb with a hammer!\" This type of education should not find its place in the general class-room; neither should a teacher, trained in academics and teaching all grades, be expected to supervise Manual Training.\n\nSome of our most prominent educationists of the day have taken time out to stress the necessity of Manual Training in the changing curriculums of basic education. However, to introduce and set up a workable plan under our present teacher system, and present day buildings, would create a major problem. In the near future it is hoped that a new school will be built, centrally located, for the Chippewa and the Muncey Bands. It should be a model school with academic class-rooms, Manual Training class-room, Vocational and Home Economics class-rooms and recreational basement; each fully equipped (over)\nand under the supervision of qualified teachers. There should be a teachers' residence separate from the school, and spacious grounds for school sports and inter-school competitions; and, above all, good roads to get to it. It should not be a question of cost, it should be a question of education.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\nMuncey, Ontario,\nJune 27, 1946.\n\nIt is recalled that Dr. Moore on his return to Ottawa from this Agency, about three months ago, contacted officials of the Ontario Department of Health and arranged for an X-Ray Survey of the Indians of the Caradoc Agency.\n\nThe writer feels that the arrangement is worthwhile in that it will determine chest conditions, and provide valuable information to the Agency's medical personnel. The program demands of organizing competent assistance has given this understaffed, hectic Office many a headache and much work. In fact I am wondering, if the Medical Service of Indian Welfare as to remain separated from the parent, and under dual administration, whether it would not be advisable to arrange with some eminent psychiatrist for a survey in an endeavour to determine the I.Q.'s and stages of mentality likely to evolve from such confusion. Our Indian Day School teachers have again rallied to our side; this time during their holidays. We are therefore hoping that the Indians will avail themselves of the opportunity of the free service provided. There is however, one point which I would like to stress. We are apt to use the willing horse too often and our teachers feel, and rightly so, that their services should be recognized in some small financial way. They are canvassing the Reserves for the purpose of tabulating families, and also giving two days of their holidays to help with the clerical work during the days of the clinic. I would suggest that they be allowed mileage for their cars, also two days' pay at the regular teachers' salary prevailing.\n\nGeo. W.

We have been glad to accommodate the Department with the use for school purposes of one of our Churches for the last six years. The time has now come, however, particularly in view of the appointment of a new Missionary, when we need the school for the purposes of our work.\n\nI am aware, of course, of the difficulties in the way of building in these days, but our work on the Muncey Reserve in this particular Church is very much hampered in not possessing sole occupancy of the building.\n\nI earnestly trust that steps will be taken at an early date to provide an appropriate school building.\n\nI am\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nArchbishop of Huron.\n\nCAS/SA.\nCOMMENTS: Could I have your written report in Canada White School. I will have to advise Mr. Pratt & also answer Bishop.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6116, file 378-1, part 1)\nColonel Neary\n\nBack Settlement Schools.\n\nThis was one of the few schools on the Muncey Reserve which was being conducted on March 25th 1948 because of adverse road conditions. I am in complete agreement with the excellent report submitted by the Provincial Inspector on May 15th 1947. He is to inspect the schools again within a few weeks.\n\nAs more black-board space is required, I removed from the old Muncey school the 7' section of black-board and requested the Supervising Principal to have it delivered to the Back Settlement Schools.\n\nReplacement of the burned down school is urgent as the present quarters are a church basement and as the basement is in use by other organizations, it is not possible for the teacher to display the work of children or leave school property, books, etc. in the open. Cupboard space is so scanty that she is compelled to keep the usual perishable supplies in her home two miles away.\n\nThe teacher thinks that the allowance for janitor service ($7.00 a month) is not adequate. In a new building this allowance might have to be re-considered.\n\nIt is possible that the old school building available in Caradoc might suffice for a few years or as long as Mrs. Bateman is available as teacher because she does not require a teacherage.\nThe available building is about 40' x 32' and the usable foundation 32' x 24' and is still standing on the old site. It is suggested that Mr. Russell Morrison of Wardsville, Ontario, be asked to submit an estimate of the cost of moving the building in question.\n\nC.A.F.C.\n\nG. A. F.

It is approximately 3 miles from the Back Settlement, Caradoc Reserve, where we require the school.\n\nConsideration had to be given, not only to the price of the building and the cost of moving, but also the cost of re-establishing the school at the new site. Therefore, we consulted the Lands and Development Services Branch and were advised that a building of this age would not likely stand being moved such a distance unless we were prepared to practically rebuild it on the new site. The vertical members are almost certain to be warped in moving and we are almost certain to have to expend a considerable sum in order to have the building made fit for use as a school.\n\nIn addition to these factors, we would not end up with a particularly good school. If you will refer to the attached photographs, you will note that the windows are few and therefore that fenestration would be much lower than\nminimum requirements. This, of course, would necessitate putting in extra windows and would create new problems and expense.\n\nIn view of the above, my Superintendent of Education does not recommend the purchase of this building.\n\nWe are now investigating the possibility of moving one of the former RCAF buildings from Fingal, Ontario. We have used similar buildings on the Six Nations Reserve and have found them satisfactory. They are light, well constructed and easy to adapt for school purposes. If the Crown Assets Allocation Committee does not declare these RCAF buildings surplus, then I would recommend that we proceed with our original plan of building a new school. The Archbishop of Huron has just written in, requesting that we vacate the basement of the Anglican Church which we are presently using as a temporary school.\n\nDirector,\n\n[Signature]\n\nEWE/EM\nOttawa, April 17, 1948.\n\nDear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have for answer your letter of March 31st, with regard to the Back Settlement day school.

However, I feel certain that we will be able to move out of your church basement this summer. As soon as our plans are definitely formulated I will write you and let you know the date when the school desks, supplies, etc., will be moved out.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMost Rev.

However, before leaving my office point I have teachers requested assistance in connection with the completing of their Teacher Questionnaire and Application Form.\n\nMiss Johnston, owing to the fact that she does not possess a \"Teacher Certificate\" found the forms somewhat difficult. She has however, not on the basis of a certified qualified teacher, taught in our Indian schools for many years on the basis of her reputation and ability. She has also taught in white schools, very successfully, on the same basis.\n\nI suggested that she complete the questionnaire in every applicable detail and I thought that her past service and experience, plus Inspector's reports should at least balance what she does not possess on paper.\n\nMay I say that Miss Johnston has taught pedagogical methods and education at Edwards and without hesitation I say she is the most capable, most efficient primary school teacher I have met in the\n\nIndian Affairs.

In connection with this application it is noted that it is signed \"Helen M. Dingman\".\n\nIn reply I beg to say that the Department will approve of the appointment of Miss Dingman for the next school year, to begin duties when the school re-opens after the summer holidays, on or about September 1st, next. The salary allowed her will be at the rate of $90 per month for the ten teaching months in the school year. This salary includes a special amount of $50 towards the cost of her transportation to and from the school to her boarding house. She should arrange for the payment of the transportation cost from the salary allowed.\n\nWe hope that Miss Dingman will meet with every success in her work at this school, and I shall be pleased if you will give her every assistance you can. Please inform her of her appointment and the date upon which it is expected she will begin duties.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThos.

Mr. Marshman will be allowed salary for the period he teaches, at the rate of $95 per teaching month, less 10% during the present fiscal year. You should arrange with him to begin duties at the earliest possible date - it being understood that his services will terminate when Miss Howe is ready to return.\n\nThe Department will continue payment of Miss Howe's salary until November 15th, by which time it is hoped she will have regained her health. When the return of attendance for the current quarter is being prepared, it should show clearly the dates between which Miss Howe was absent. When she resumes duties, you might forward a statement showing the dates between which Mr. Marshman taught and the number of teaching days, when a cheque in payment of the salary due him for his services could be forwarded.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The fence is in need of some repairs which the janitor will attend to if the Dept. authorize the purchase 2 lbs. nails.\n\n8. A mortice door lock is also needed for the rear door.\nOttawa, May 17, 1928.\n\nSir,\n\nIn reference to your report on the Back Settlement School for the month of April, last, I have to ask you to be good enough to state whether the woodwork in this school can be cleaned, or whether you think it should be painted, and, if so, kindly give an estimate of the cost of having this done.\n\nYou may purchase the casting and bolts required for the desk, which you state needs repairs.\n\nYou may also purchase two pounds of nails for repairing the fence and a mortice lock for the rear door.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nJ.

It is only recently that I learned that the change (which must have been made in Jan.) was made by Burch and not by the dept. As the boy has been doing the work, he is entitled to the pay.

Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to submit the following survey of repairs and improvements to the six day schools on the Caradoc Reserve, which are required to put these schools in first-class condition.\n\nLower Muncey school requires painting on the outside, including closets and woodshed, also a small entrance gate is needed.\n\nBack Settlement school also requires painting outside, and a lower step at entrance, the first step is about 15 inches from the ground, which is too high for the small children. Fence around playground requires stretching.\n\nBear Creek school, which was painted last year for the first time, should have one more coat of paint. Four coats were put on but the lumber was so spongey and dry that the first two coats were scarcely visible. One coat would make a good job of it and add to the life of the building. Closets require foundations jacked up and a small window in each closet. The roof on this school is very old and looks dilapidated; it is beginning to leak in several places, a new shingle roof is needed.\n\nRiver Settlement school requires 24 new single seats, the present ones are very poor and have been wired together, in many cases to keep them from falling apart. This has been done to take as much service out of them as possible; new ones are really very much needed.\n\nOneida No.3 school requires painting both inside and out, parts of the outside lumber is showing signs of decay, especially the porch supports and window sills.\nSome repairs to the plaster inside have been made from time to time and in painting these parts the walls have been made streaky.\n\nPainted sign boards, with name of school, placed on each building, would add to the appearance and would cost only a nominal sum.\n\nThe cost of above repairs and improvements would be approximately one thousand dollars, which would be money well spent, adding to the life and appearance of the schools and to the progress of the Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, January 16th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, stating the repairs and improvements that will be required to each of the 6 day schools on the Caradoc Reserve.\n\nWith reference to the Back Settlement School, we note that this building requires to be painted on the outside, also that the lower step at the entrance to the school requires to be changed, and that the fence around the playground requires repairs.\n\nIt is considered that the work of the painting of the exterior of the building should remain over until next spring. In the meantime, you should furnish an estimate of the cost and how you would recommend that the labour be performed.\n\nYou may arrange to have the alteration made in the lower step at the entrance, and also, if the weather permits, have any repairs required made to the fence around the playground. You should furnish properly certified vouchers covering any expenditure incurred in the above authorized work.\n\nIn future, when reporting on the requirements of the various schools in your Agency, you should not include all your recommendations in one letter, but should forward a separate letter regarding each school. A separate file for each school is kept at headquarters and when you write regarding a number of schools in one letter it is necessary to have extracts made for each school file, which causes us considerable inconvenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nTheo. McGookin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that following sundries are required for use at the Back Settlement Day School:\n\nOne broom, corn mat for front door,\nfour window lights, one latch for back entrance door,\nsoap and lye for scrubbing classroom floor.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 3rd, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 30th ultimo, giving a list of sundry supplies required for use at the Back Settlement Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that you may arrange for the purchase and delivery of the following, viz: -\n\n1 Broom,\nCorn Mat for Front Door,\n4 Window Lights,\n1 Latch for Back Entrance Door,\nSmall Quantity of Soap and Lye for Scrubbing Classroom Floor.\n\nAfter these supplies have been delivered, you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

He says, also, that the woodshed should be repaired; that the two closets should be moved to a more suitable location and the water supply should be improved.\n\nIn connection with the painting of this building, I would refer you to official letter of January 16th, last, requesting you to furnish an estimate of the cost of any painting required.\n\nI shall be pleased if you will now give the above matters your early attention. Please give an estimate of the cost of any work suggested by the Inspector, which you would recommend be performed at this school. Please look after these matters at an early date in order that, if it is decided to have any work done, it can be carried out during the present summer holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThos. McGowin, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncy, Ont.\nFiddler's June 28th 1926\n\nTo Mr. J. McVickar\nIndian Agent\nFiddler's\nOnt.\n\nSir,\n\nI agree to put three coats of paint on the outside of the Boishe settlement school house on the Indian Reserve and two coats on the inside, wainscoting and ceiling also wash and clean the walls, repair the plaster and put two coats of masonry on, and furnish all of the material for the sum of one hundred and thirty-five dollars $135.00\n\nYours Truly\n\nNeil M. Arthur\nFiddler's\nOnt.\nIn reply to your letter No.7-2-5 of the 14th instant, with regard to painting Back Settlement Day School, also repairs to wood shed, moving the two closets and improving the water supply.\n\nI beg to say that a tender for painting the school, inside and out, has been received from Neil McArthur, a local workman, who will do the job for $135.00 and supply all material. McArthur is a good workman and will make a satisfactory job of the painting.\n\nWith regard to closets, I do not think the location of these can be improved upon, the only change would be to bring them closer to the school, which in my opinion would not improve the appearance of the grounds, the children suffer no inconvenience from the short walk between closets and school.\n\nThe well from which the school water is obtained is not situated on the school property, but is just over the fence on the land located to Rufus Henry, who has given permission to use it. There is no pump the water being drawn up in a bucket, there is a good cement top and a pump can be purchased and installed at a cost of $30.00, if this were done the school would have a good supply of clean water at all times.\n\nThe above work can be commenced right away upon receiving the necessary authorization.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs, (RC 10, Volume 6116, file 378-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nOttawa, July 26th, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, relative to the painting of the Back Settlement Indian Day School building, and enclosing a tender for the work.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that as there will be considerable repairs and painting required to the schools in your Agency, the cost of which, as stated in your letter of January 14th, last, will amount to approximately $1,000, the Department regrets that all this work will have to stand over. We have, however, noted this work and will endeavour to provide the funds required in our Estimates for the next fiscal year. Only repairs of a minor nature can be carried out this year.\n\nNo action need be taken with regard to the change in the location of the closets at this school.\n\nRelative to the well from which the school water is obtained, I beg to say that you may purchase and have installed a pump. It is noted that you estimate the cost of having this work done to be approximately $30. Please arrange to have the pump installed before the school reopens, and you should forward properly certified vouchers, in duplicate, covering the cost.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D.

Since that time, however, all expenses of this nature have been paid from School Vote. Will the funds at the credit of the Band (Account No. 8) be sufficient to provide for the payment of these accounts in future, as, if so, I shall be pleased if you will instruct that this be done? I may say that at the present time an amount of $200 per annum is taken from the Band Funds towards the payment of the teacher's salary.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Ferrier, Esq.,\n\nSir,\n\nIn reply to your letter No. 7-2-5 of the 27th ultimo in connection with the Public School Inspector's report on the Back Settlement Day School.\n\nI beg to say that this school requires to be painted both inside and outside and $300.00 was included in the 1927-8 estimates for this purpose. This school has never been painted, the frame is in good condition and if painted would last much longer, the inside has been painted but should be done again. The work of painting the outside and inside would be approximately $300.00 and would be well spent money.\n\nThere is no water supply on the grounds but there is an excellent well just over the fence from which the school has been supplied for years; a new pump was installed recently and a good supply of excellent drinking water is available at all times. I would not recommend digging a well on the grounds so long as the water can be obtained from the present source.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir.\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nI.A.\nOttawa, August 4, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, regarding the painting required to the interior and exterior of the Back Settlement Indian Day School building and giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nIn reply I beg to say, in view of your recommendation that this painting is necessary, the Department will approve of you arranging to have the work carried out by day labour, under the charge of a competent foreman. You should arrange for the purchase of all paints, oils, etc., required, obtaining competitive prices if possible and making the purchase from the firm quoting the lowest price. You should see that a good grade of paint, etc., is supplied. While a satisfactory job should be completed, it is expected you will see that all expense is kept as low as possible and that the estimate mentioned in your letter, viz., $200, will not be exceeded, if possible. The colours purchased will be left with you to decide. Proper time sheets, in duplicate, should be kept by you for all labour employed. If an advance to pay for the labour is required, you should make application for same in due time, stating the amount you require. Time sheets enclosed.\n\nYou should arrange to have this work begun as soon as possible, in order that it can be completed before the school re-opens after the summer holidays. When it has been finished, you should forward an account, in duplicate, covering the cost of the paint and other material, and the time sheets, in duplicate, signed by the men employed and certified by yourself, covering the amount due for the labour.\n\nIt is noted that an excellent supply of water can be obtained from a well near the school. The Department agrees with you that as long as water can be obtained from the present source it is not necessary to dig a well on the school grounds.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F.

I enclose a tender by Mr. Mitchell McArthur, who is a competent painter and who will do the job for $140.00, giving the outside 3 coats of paint and the inside one coat of Merisco. This estimate is considered very reasonable and a better job will be done than by day labour. The materials will be purchased at the lowest price after competitive prices have been obtained. The work will be completed before school opening.

I note that you were unable to have this done by day labour; that you are prepared to purchase the materials, after securing competitive prices, and to engage Mr. Mitchell McArthur, a competent painter, for the activity.\n\nIn reply I beg to confirm my telegram of today's date, as follows:\n\n\"You may engage Mitchell McArthur to paint three day schools.\"\n\nIt is understood that Mr. McArthur will give three coats of paint to the outside, one coat of muresco to the inside and two coats of paint to the ceiling and woodwork of the Bear Settlement Indian Day School for $140; that he will give two coats of paint to the Bear Creek School for the sum of $45; and that he will give two coats of paint to the Lower Munsey School for the sum of $70.

Escott and Co., 146 York Street, London, Ont. for a total of $41.25, being for noon lunch materials supplied to the six Indian Day Schools of Caradoc reserve, which purchase was authorized by department letter 7-2-5 of November 4th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nEXTRACT FROM LETTER OF MR. A. D. MOORE, INDIAN AGENT, MUNCEY, ONT., DATED DECEMBER 6TH, 1929.\n\nOriginal on File 7-7-7.\n\nMiss Baird, Miss Comfort and Miss Howe, teachers on the Chippewa section of Caradoc Reserve, have requested that I take up with Dept. the building of car garages at each of their schools. In all three cases, their homes or boarding houses are miles from their school and it is necessary for them to use cars to get there and all day in all kinds of weather their cars must remain outside as there is no building to put them in. I understand a portable garage can be put up for around $100.00 and would ask your consideration of the erection of such a garage at each of the schools of the above-mentioned teachers.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nDecember 12th, 1929.\n\nMemorandum.\n\nMr. Perrier,\n\nI am of the opinion that garages should be provided at the Back Settlement and Muncey Day Schools. The use of a car, in both these cases, is a necessity and will continue to be so even in the event of a change of teachers.\n\nIn the case of Miss Baird at the Bear Creek School, I do not think a garage is necessary at all; her school is only a mile distant from the village of Middlemiss where she boards, and a car is not a necessity in getting to or from her school, in any condition of weather. I do not know of any garages being provided for teachers of the white schools in the municipality.\n\nInspector.\nOttawa, December 14, 1929.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to your monthly report of inspection of the Bear Creek, Muncey and Back Settlement Indian Day Schools in which you recommend that garages for the teachers' use be erected at each of these schools, I have to say that the Department will approve of the providing of garage accommodation at the Back Settlement and Muncey Day Schools. If weather conditions permit, you may arrange for the erection of a garage of the portable type at each of these schools. You should see that the site selected in each case does not interfere with the playground accommodation or the general appearance of the school building. We note you estimate the cost of the erection of a portable garage to be approximately $100, but, if possible, to do so, they should be furnished at each school at less cost. The Department will rely on you to see that no unnecessary expense is incurred in the providing of suitable garage facilities for the teachers at both these schools. After the work has been completed to your satisfaction, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred for each school separately.\n\nRelative to the erection of a garage at the Bear Creek School, the Department does not consider that this is necessary at the present time. We understand that the teacher resides in the village of Middlemiss, which is only a mile distant from the school, and that a car is not necessary to get to and from her school in any condition of weather.\n\nThe Department will expect to hear from you as soon as the two garages authorized above have been completed, with full particulars as to the type, cost, etc.\n\nA.

These Desks will be the same as those which we formerly supplied you with and we will go to work immediately on this order, making shipment at the earliest possible moment.\n\nThanking you, we are,\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSALES & SERVICE.\n\nADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THE COMPANY\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6116, file 378-5, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir:\n\nI would beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter 7-2-5 of December 14th, with reference to the erection of portable garages at the Lower Muncey and Rock settlement Indian Day Schools, and would advise that after securing prices, I find that the lowest price obtainable for a garage 8'x 16' is $50.00 and that is without the cost of foundation (which should be posts) or the setting up of the garage and this will make the cost in excess of $100.00 each but should not exceed $110.00 in all for each garage. I have not ordered these garages as yet owing to the frozen state of the ground and not being able to put in the posts to set the garages on, but shall do so as soon as the weather permits.\n\nRelative to the request of the teacher of Bear Creek School, I informed her that the Dept was not favorable inclined to erect a garage there and the teacher now informs me that she is boarding at Melbourne, Ont a distance of nearly three miles from the school and that she is unable to secure accommodation any closer and must use a car to get to the school, and requests you reconsider the erection of a garage at her school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 21, 1930.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 17th instant, relative to the erection of portable garages at the Lower Muncey and Baak Settlement Indian Day Schools. It is noted that, after securing prices, you find the cost, including foundation and setting up of garage, will be approximately $110 each. You should proceed with the work of having these garages erected on suitable sites near the school, as soon as weather conditions permit.\n\nWith reference to the request of the teacher of the Bear Creek School to have a garage erected, I have to say that our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are entirely assigned. It is therefore regretted that we will be unable to provide the expenditure required for the erection of a garage at the Bear Creek School.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

The school roof also leaks a little and although it was repaired during the past summer holidays it has not eliminated all the leaks.\n\nThe chimney is also crumbling and some bricks are dislodged and consideration should be given to a new roof being put on this school, and a new chimney built, and I believe that they will do this winter without much damage to the interior, and could be renewed next spring, when the weather will be more suitable.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D.

You may also arrange to have any minor repairs required to the roof carried out, and the broken bricks in the chimney replaced and any pointing required made to the brick work. Our funds for the balance of the present fiscal year are extremely limited, and only the repairs absolutely necessary to make the building comfortable for the coming winter should be carried out at the present time. When this work has been completed, you should forward an account, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the expenditure incurred.\n\nThe question of installing a new roof and chimney on this building should be brought to the attention of the Department next spring, at which time you should give full particulars in detail of the work you would recommend be done and the approximate cost of same.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

The eavetroughing of this school also needs repairing and in some places, conductor pipes need re-placing.\n\nI would also recommend that a partition be erected in the wood shed at this school, so that the coal and wood, necessary for heating the school could be kept separate, as at the present time the coal is dumped on the ground in the wood shed and wood is thrown on top of it, and a partition in one end, separate for the coal, would eliminate any waste and also improve the appearance of this shed.\n\nThe whole cost of the repairs at the school should not exceed in the vicinity of $125.00 and this sum was placed in the estimates for this year, the roof being absolutely necessary, as it leaks and is causing damage to the plaster and interior of the classroom.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.D. Moore, Indian Agent.\n\nSecretary,\nDept. of Ind. Affs.,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, July 8, 1931.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 3rd instant, relative to reshingling the roof of the Back Settlement Indian Day School and giving an estimate of the cost, also stating that some repairs are required to the eaves troughing and conductor pipes.\n\nIn reply I have to say that the Department will approve of you arranging to have the roof of this school reshingled during the present summer holidays, and the repairs required to the eaves troughing and conductor pipes carried out. You may also arrange to have a partition erected in the woodshed, in order to keep the coal and wood separate. You should arrange for the purchase of the shingles and other materials required, and in making the purchase you should be guided by instructions which you have received. Indian labour should be employed as far as possible, proper time sheets, in duplicate, being kept. The total cost of the material and labour should not exceed your estimate of approximately $125.\n\nAfter the work has been completed, please forward itemized accounts, in duplicate, properly certified, covering the cost of the material and time sheets, in duplicate, signed by the individual men employed and certified by yourself.\n\nYou should see that a satisfactory job is completed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

If the painting is authorized, it would cost in the vicinity of $60.00, being $25.00 for materials and $35.00 for labour.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D.

One pint of slate grey paint and one pane of glass 7\\(\\frac{1}{2}\\)\" x 16\" are required in addition to the above.\n\nTotal cost of materials should not exceed $30.00 and could be secured locally and the cost of labour will be approximately $25.00.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

It consisted of a single room without teacher's living quarters. Its dimensions were 34' x 36'. There was an enrolment of 20 pupils with an average of 14.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6116, file 378-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMuncey, Ontario,\nMay 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nFurther to my telegram of May 1, 1942, I have to report the complete destruction of the Rock Settlement School, situated on Lot No. 8, concession 2, No. 3 Side Road, with Miss. Howe, teacher.\n\nAfter making inquiries as to causes of the fire I am convinced that the origin had some assistance but it is difficult to locate that origin. Miss. Howe, the teacher, assures me that there had been no fire in the stove since Monday, four days previous and then only a few pieces of paper were burned. She did not leave the School House until 4:30 p.m. that evening, and the Caretaker was there until 5 p.m. They both report there was no fire when they left, nor was there anything around that could cause fire without some assistance. It was five and a half hours after the Caretaker left that the fire was first noticed. However, the question now is one of accommodation.\n\nThe only building that I have seen or could recommend is the Anglican Church Basement. Of course, to use this, permission would have to be obtained from the Mission Board of the Anglican diocese.\n\nWe could perhaps gather up equipment from the other schools to start, however before taking any move I await your instructions.\n\nYours obedient servant,\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent.\n\nT.R.L. McInnes, Esq.,\nSecretary\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\nOttawa,\nMay 8, 1942.\n\nEX'D A\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, with reference to the destruction by fire of the Back Settlement School.\n\nIn view of the suspicious circumstances surrounding this fire I presume that you have already requested the R.C.M.P. detachment to make a thorough investigation. If you have not done so, you should make these arrangements with them at once and any information they can obtain should be forwarded for our consideration.\n\nIt is so close to the end of the current academic year that there does not appear to be any use in endeavouring to secure another building. We will allow the teacher, Miss Howe, her salary to June 30. If arrangements cannot be made to secure quarters for the school for the coming academic year there is no doubt that we will be able to offer Miss Howe some other school. Consequently it would be appreciated if she would communicate with us before accepting any other school.\n\nYou might make inquiries with a view to ascertaining if we could secure the basement of the Anglican Church for school purposes for the academic year 1942-43. If so, you should let me know what rent the Anglican Church authorities require and give an estimate of the other expenses that would have to be incurred in order to prepare it as a classroom.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThe Commissioner:\n\nFORWARDED, 7-5-48. Owing to the isolated situation of the school and to the headway the fire had made before it was discovered, nothing could be learned of its possible origin.\n\nHANDED TO DEPT CONCERNED.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\n(V.A.M. Kemp) Supt.,\nComdg. \"O\" Div.\n\nTORONTO\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6116, file 378-5, part 4)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nRe: Fire of undetermined origin.\nBack Settlement Indian Day School.\nChippewa Indian Reserve.\n(MUNCEY DETACHMENT INVESTIGATION)\n\n1-5-42.\n\n1. On this date it was learned that the above school had been completely destroyed by fire during the late P.M. of the 30-4-42. Accompanied by Indian Agent G.W. Down, the writer patrolled to the above school, in an effort if possible to determine the cause of the fire.\n\n2. Miss Helen Howe, teacher at the above school for the past 13 years was interviewed and informed the writer that everything appeared to be in good order with no sign of any fire when she left the school at approximately 4:30 p.m. of the 30-4-42, and further that she had had no fire in the stove since Monday April 25th, when she had burned some waste paper. Miss Howe could throw no light on the cause of this fire.\n\n3. Mr. James Henry, caretaker was next interviewed, and stated that he had swept the school out after the teacher had left on the 30-4-42, and had left the school at approximately 5:00 p.m. when everything appeared to be in good order. All doors in the school were locked by Mr. Henry when he left, as well as the windows, and he could not throw any light on the cause of this fire.\n\n4. It was learned that Mrs Fred Kocheigo, daughter of the caretaker, was the first person to arrive at the scene of the fire at approximately 10:00 p.m., with the hopes to the front door which she opened and noticed that the choir interior of the school was a mass of flames, which shot out the door when it was opened. Mrs Kocheigo informed the writer that the fire appeared to be burning the most in the vicinity of the teachers desk, and at that time the fire had gained such headway that it was impossible to save the frame constructed building.\n\n5. Mrs Kocheigo further informed the writer that the doors and windows appeared to be in good order on her arrival, and immediately that she opened the front door the glass in the windows started to break from the draft caused by the opening of the door and the intense heat. No one was seen in the vicinity of the school which is situated in a very isolated part of the Reserve, which no doubt accounts for the fact that the fire was not noticed until it had gained such headway.\n\n6. The building destroyed in this fire was approximately 35 years old, of frame construction with a cement base, one floor, no basement and measured approximately 35 feet by 27 feet. There is no fire fighting equipment of any kind at or near the school, with the exception of a few water pails. Owing to the fact that the school was totally destroyed, it is impossible to determine the origin or cause of the fire. There is no electric lights in the school, thus eliminating any possibility of a short circuit. The fact that the fire appeared to be burning the most near the teachers desk indicates that it may have started at that point.\n\nN.S.I.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Dr. Dorey, the Associate Secretary of the Board of Home Missions of the United Church of Canada, was in the office today and stated that there were two United Church buildings, one of which was in use and the other was not. He was not exactly certain if these were in the vicinity of the former Back Settlement School. If they are, I believe that the United Church would be willing to rent either one. The Minister's office is anxious to know what arrangements we are making for school accommodation for the academic year 1942-43 and consequently we would like to have your reply at the earliest possible date, stating what arrangements you have made or can make for securing one of the buildings mentioned above.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down,\nIndian Agent,\nMuncey, Ont.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nAttention Mr. Hoey,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nReplying to your letter of June 19th, re a suitable building that would serve as a temporary classroom to accommodate the children of the Back Settlement district, I have to advise, the only building within reasonable distance, that might be available, is the Anglican Church. The two Churches referred to by Mr. Dorey, are not within seven miles of the Back Settlement area. Distance alone would rule them out.\n\nI propose, as suggested in the last paragraph of your letter dated May 5th, to contact the Mission Board of the Anglican Church Diocese, with a view to leasing the basement of their property. If favourable, I will endeavour to estimate all other expenses necessary to equip and prepare as a classroom.\n\nThis information will be submitted in the near future.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nT.R.D.

It will be necessary for me first to communicate with those directly in charge of the congregation. At present we have no permanent missionary on the Reserve but I will take the matter up with the Student-in-charge and ask him to ascertain the mind of the Churchwardens in the matter next Sunday. I will write to you when I have complete details.\n\nThe only terms that occur to us in connection with such an arrangement are that, of course, the school authorities will supply the equipment, see that the place is kept in good order, and only the basement of the Church used or entered. There may be some small charge for caretaking. I think there is no reason why we should charge any rental.\n\nI am,\nYours faithfully.\n\nCharles Huron.\n\nCH/O\nMuncey, Ontario,\nAugust 5, 1942.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nFurther to our correspondence with reference to securing the basement of the Anglican Church, situated on No.8 Road of the Chippewa Reserve for temporary Indian Day School purposes.\n\nIn this connection, I submit herewith a copy of a letter received from the Bishop. I have also taken the matter up with the student-in-charge and he assures me that the basement may be used for school purposes.\n\nShould this meet with your approval you will please advise.

Hoey, Esq., Supt. of Welfare & Training, Ottawa.\n\nRe Back Settlement School.\n\nIn connection with the above mentioned school, there are a few necessary expenditures involved in which I would prefer to have your authority.\n\n(1) It will be necessary to purchase fuel. In this, I have no way of estimating the required tonnage, as the Church authorities usually burn wood. However, wood fuel is out of the question. It cannot be purchased. I think five tons of anthracite coal should be sufficient, as the fires will not be started until after Christmas. The price per ton of anthracite delivered would be $16.50.\n\n(2) The question of out-houses. In this connection, we have two comparatively new buildings standing on the old school site which could be moved and I propose moving them to the Church grounds. The cost of moving would be approximately $15.00.\n\n(3) It is requested that we cover the back stairway, which is the one to be used, with some type of matting. For this purpose, I suggest Coco Matting. This, I think can be purchased through the T.Eaton Co., of Toronto and I would suggest it be ordered direct from Ottawa. Amount required, 8 yards, 2 or 3 feet wide. Cost not known.\n\n(4) A complaint has been received from Wilfred Riley, whose farm adjoins the Church property and he is anxious that his barns and stacks should be protected by erecting a fence about sixteen feet parallel to his own fence. This of course is only a request and cannot be enforced. However, his barns and stacks are very close and as a precautionary measure, I am prepared to recommend his request.\n\nApproximate cost:\n40 Rods of wire fence at 65\u00a2 per rod. 30 cedar posts at 50\u00a2 each. Labour 25\u00a2 per rod.\n\nFinally, I have to report, no teachers chair arrived with the recent shipment of desks.\n\nYou will please advise as to my authority to go ahead with these purchases.\n\nG.W. Smith\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nDecember 7, 1943.\n\nMr. Geo. W. Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ont.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 3rd instant, the following expenditures in connection with the Back Settlement School are authorized:\n\n1. $15.00 for removal of two toilets;\n2. $51.00 for material and labour to erect a fence between the church property and the property of Wilfred Riley;\n3. You may arrange for local purchase of the coco matting.\n\nWith reference to the coal required, please let me know the size and the Purchasing Branch will be requested to order 5 tons.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa,\nDecember 15, 1942.\n\nBY D.\n\nMr. G.W.

Teaching, as you are aware, has been conducted, since the destruction, by fire, of the regular school building in May, 1942, in the basement of the Anglican Church.\n\nI think you will agree that, while the basement of a Church has its place for social gatherings and perhaps Church meetings, it is hardly the place for little children to spend hours in pursuit of an education. Such has been the case for the children of this section during the last 2\u00bd years. Cement floors, dampness, and most inadequate lighting, to say nothing of teacher inconveniences, are all factors against a continuance of the use of this type of educational classroom. Then again, school closes every Friday P.M. until Monday A.M. during which time school equipment, children's text books, etc., are not only an annoyance to Church organizations but are sometimes piled in untidy heaps in an endeavour to get them out of the way and any damage, of course, is always attributed to school children and the responsibility of the Department of Indian Affairs.\n\nWhen the Department acquired the right, through the good graces of the Most Reverend, the Archbishop of the Diocese of Huron, to use their building, it was not considered a permanent concession; and I think you will agree that we have overstepped the concession and perhaps imposed upon the co-operative spirit of the Anglican Church officials, although to-date they have made no direct overture as to moving out. But the congregation have, on several occasions, intimated that the concession was only a temporary one and granted on the promise of a new school being erected in the very near future. They also point out that their social gatherings are curtailed and hampered on account of desks and school equipment stored in the church in the latter cannot be questioned, and I have repeatedly advised that a new school is contemplated which usually provokes some caustic remarks about promises emanating from the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa. However, in all fairness to Church officials, congregation, teacher and pupils, to say nothing of the Department's responsibility, the matter of providing and building a modern school should be given serious consideration.\nWhile I am on the question of schools which are, of course, institutions of education; and our method along this particular line has, in recent press articles and letters, been severely criticized, may I also point out that two years ago the Muncey School was closed, the reason being insufficient number of pupils enrolled. This was perhaps justified but, owing to the location of other schools at lesser distance and places on children belonging to the particular area. There was also a condition in connection with this building in that it did not belong to the Department, and, I am informed the Muncey Band granted the use of this, their Council Hall, until other arrangements were made. These concessions are still remembered with bitterness and as unbroken promises. However, I am not interested in past administration, conditions or concessions, but I am, particularly, interested in the education of our Indian people, and the present lay-out and type of makeshift, ill-lighted, unventilated classrooms, that exist on the Chipewyan and Muncey Reserves, is not conducive to this end. There is, in fact, an urgent need for the erection of two centrally located modern schools on the Chipewyan and Muncey Reserves. Personally I am in favour of consolidated schools, with continuation classrooms, where our Indian children may be classified and their education guided into channels according to I.Q. However, the type of school with its attendant educational values is a matter for Departmental policy. But I would emphasize the urgent need of immediate consideration in connection with the Anglican Church basement.\n\nGeo. W.

Down, Indian Agent, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nRe: Back Settlement Day School.\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 18th instant, in which you intimate that conditions at the temporary classroom conducted in the basement of the Anglican Church are far from satisfactory.\n\nYou are no doubt aware that the Government has not built Indian day or residential schools anywhere in the Dominion during the war period, despite the fact that a number of schools have been destroyed by fire during this period. We have, for example, the classroom building at Alberni, destroyed by fire three years ago, and where instruction is now provided in the wash-rooms. A similar condition exists at File Hills, Saskatchewan. Then, again, the large day school at the Caughnawaga Reserve, near Montreal, a 12-room building, was destroyed and has not been rebuilt. I am not arguing at the moment that two wrongs constitute a right, but I do feel, although it may be difficult to convince the Indians that such is the case, that the people at your agency have been particularly fortunate so far as school accommodation is concerned.\n\nIt is just possible that the policy pursued by the Government has been wrong, but whether it is wrong or right, it is based on the fact that taxation, for the time being, is as heavy as the Canadian people can bear and that the material and manpower that would be ordinarily used in the construction of schools was necessary in our war effort. Indeed, there were a great many who believed that unless we could survive nothing else mattered.\n\nIt so happens that I have before me a letter from the Principal of the Mount Elgin Institute,\nin which he intimates that despite his best efforts to provide worthwhile vocational courses at the school, his enrolment at this date is less than 50% of the enrolment authorized by the Department. If conditions are unsatisfactory in the basement of the Anglican Church, would it be possible to have the pupils in attendance transferred to the Institute? It does not seem fair to me that the taxpayers should be called upon to pay the cost of a building program on a reserve while less than half of the available accommodation at the residential school is unoccupied.\n\nI am anxious that you should discuss conditions at the Anglican Church with the Indian parents concerned, with the Principal of the Residential School and with the teacher of the day school. In fact, it might be possible to enter into an agreement whereby transportation for these children to the residential school might be provided, if the parents are opposed to the regular enrolment of their children at the school.\n\nR.

To overcome the difficulty, and make the classroom comfortable, I am suggesting that a stove heater of some type be installed.

Perhaps your Department is planning to do something at an early date.\n\nI am,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nCH/CJ\nArchbishop of Huron.\nOttawa, February 16, 1946.\n\nDear Archbishop Seager:\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant with reference to our use of the basement of the Anglican Church on the Caradoc Reserve for school purposes.\n\nI realize that our use of this building is inconveniencing the congregation. However, I trust that you will find it possible to allow us to continue using this basement at least another year. Owing to conditions beyond our control, I cannot see any possibility of providing a new building at this particular point this year.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMost Rev. C. A.

I am of course aware of the extreme difficulties in the way of building a School on the Caradoc Reserve or doing any other building. In view of the shortage in essential housing I hesitated to write you on the subject but did so at the request of the people of our Church there. The need of accommodation from the point of view of the work of the Church is very real.\n\nWe must, however, exercise great patience under present conditions and I shall advise our Missionary on the Reserve to this effect.

Accessibility, teacher accommodation, over crowding, insecurity and low salaries are contributing factors in what might be termed \"The March of Education.\" If consolidated schools is not the answer, serious thought must be given to a building program of adequate class-room accommodation and opportunities for higher education.\n\nThe march of time is away from the one class-room little red school house and the time is here for our Indians to demand the same rights and facilities as their white brothers. If we are to help our Indian people and prepare them for the years that lie ahead, serious thought must be given to education and proper school facilities.\n\nThe Back Settlement Indian School, as you are aware, has, for the past three and one-half years been conducted in the basement of the Anglican Church. This was never a popular arrangement, especially with the church's congregation and I understand that the local management recently petitioned Church Officials to have the government assume its own responsibility.\n\nFrom my regular school visits I found school management, under varying circumstances, favourable. Academically, I think our Indian children compare favourably with other sections. The percentage of passes at summer Entrance examinations was very satisfactory and several pupils are continuing their education in Continuation Schools and Collegiates under white supervision.\n\nGeo.

They are all minor repairs and it is impossible to list them all. Supplies of materials, and labour, are in short supply and must be taken advantage of when available. I am therefore suggesting approximately $50.00 for each school.

This, to my mind, is a very unsatisfactory condition and I am suggesting that an effort be made to correct the condition by purchasing filters. I think there is a type of filter being used in many of our white rural schools which is very satisfactory; and the price is somewhere about $7.00 or $8.00 each. We would need at least seven\u2014a total cost of approximately $60.00 or $65.00.\n\nIf you approve, and will advise, I will make enquiries as to where purchases may be made.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo.

Down, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th ultimo, file 130-1, we regret that owing to lack of funds, it is not possible to authorize the expenditure that would be required to place water filters in the schools in your agency.\n\nThere is a cheaper type of water cooler that should prove suitable and you might make further inquiries with a view to ascertaining if you can obtain water coolers at a more reasonable cost. You can then communicate with us after the first of April when funds from the new appropriation will be available.\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, March 15, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMAJOR G.A.F. CLARK\n\nMount Elgin Indian Day School\n\nThis will confirm our conversation with regard to the above Day School. It would seem that relationships between the Principal and his staff are not what we would require and that it will be necessary for you to report upon conditions there in some detail. Apparently Mr. Johnston is not a good disciplinarian and, as a result, there is much freedom between the pupils and this particular teacher. Complaints have been made with regard to his association with the older girls. There is also evidence of too much freedom between the older boys and Mr. Johnston during recess and lunch hours. You can investigate these \"stories\" during your visit there and I wish to be advised as to whether we should contemplate the future employment of this teacher.\n\nI would also like to know just how much teaching Mr. Joblin is doing. We are now paying four teachers at this school and I would like to know exactly what the teaching load of each teacher is. You might also check as to the number of visits which Mr. Joblin has made to the day schools of the agency.\n\nBack Settlement\n\nThe third point which I wish reported on is with respect to the contemplated construction of a one-room school at Back Settlement. I would like a specific report from you as to where this new school can best be located. You can also investigate the question of land required for such a building. It will be our standard one-room school plan and I would suggest that you mail ahead a set of the plans, specifications and bill of materials for this project. I would like to have this school\nconstructed on a day labour basis, using the present foreman at the Mount Elgin Day School as the foreman for the one-room school. However, you can check into this matter with Colonel Randle when you are at Caradoc. It would be necessary to allow at least two months for requisitions to pass through the Departmental Purchasing Agent's hands and to arrive on the spot at Back Settlement. We would endeavour to rush the cement so that the excavation could be proceeded with.\n\nBernard E.

Does this mean that you have ordered the coolers or that they may be obtained through the George M. Henry Company? If so, I see very little difference in the price I quoted and the price they quote. However, perhaps you have catalogues dealing fully with school equipment and could choose a type of cooler suitable for our purposes.

This should not have been, but unfortunately I was taken ill. However, I find that Mr. E.P. Randle, Acting Superintendent during my absence, did write in the matter but no answer appears to have been received. It is rather late now but to be in time and to make sure of the 1948-49 allotment I would request that I be advised of the amounts available. Allotments in 1946-47 were as follows:\n\n| Location          | Amount |\n|-------------------|--------|\n| Bear Creek        | $16.00 |\n| River Settlement  | $14.00 |\n| Back Settlement   | $20.00 |\n| Oneida No. 1      | $25.00 |\n| Oneida No. 2      | $24.00 |\n| Oneida No. 3      | $25.00 |\n\nI would recommend the same be provided, with an additional amount for the new class room under Mrs. Holdsworth at Oneida No. 2, and the new school under the principalship of E.E.M. Joblin.\n\nAlso please advise as to the amounts available for Manual Training.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDep't of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nGeo. W. Down,\nSUPERINTENDENT.\nApril 24, 1943.\n\nMr. George W. Down, Superintendent,\nIndian Agency, Muncey, Ontario.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 19th instant, it is regretted that no allowance was made for mid day meal purposes at the schools in your Agency during the past winter.\n\nWe will be prepared to allow an amount for this purpose for the academic year 1943-49 and I suggest that you write again about the first of September. At that time you should recommend the amount you think should be allowed for the new class room at Oneida No. 2 and also the new school under Mr. Joblin. When this letter is received, we will also make a decision regarding the amount to be allowed for manual training during the 1948-49 academic year.\n\nBernard F.

We also have a standard bill of materials detailing exactly the quantities of the various materials needed for the erection of this building. These materials would be purchased through our Departmental Purchasing Agent if it is decided to build the school under the arrangements previously discussed with you. As I intimated over the telephone, we would be prepared to pay Mr. F. E.

I am enclosing a copy of the bill of materials mentioned above. All that is necessary is to attach a standard requisition form to this bill of materials and then state on the requisition form as follows:\n\n\"To standard bill of materials for one-room Indian day school and attached teacherage as per attached bill.\"\n\nYou can then denote on the requisition form the names of local\n\nIndian Affairs.

With the first two named it should be on the understanding that the lumber be supplied when call is made.\n(3) Clayton Trott of Mt. Brydges.\n(4) There are three firms in the town of Strathroy, all of whom have turned us down on previous occasions. In\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs.

At the present time, we are using the basement of an Anglican Church for school purposes. We have had a letter from the Anglican Bishop intimating that they will be requiring this basement for other purposes during the next year.\n\nIt is our intention, therefore, to erect a standard one room school with attached teacherage during the forthcoming summer. Mr. F.E. Mahler of Mount Brydges, Ontario, is building a four room school for us at Mount Elgin on the same Reserve. This school is now nearing completion and we feel that Mr. Mahler has done a satisfactory job. He is willing to undertake the supervision of the construction of the one room school required at Back Settlement at the rate of $1.50 per hour. If this offer is accepted, the Department would provide the materials and we will use Indian labour almost entirely.\n\nIt is recommended that approval be given to the hiring of Mr. Mahler at the rate of $1.50 per hour to supervise the construction of this one room school.\n\nBFN/RM.\n\nDirector.\nExtract from requisition dated April 30th, 1948, from the Teacher of the Back Settlement Indian Day School.\n\nThe teacher requests:\n\n6 Granite cups.\nOttawa, May 21, 1948.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER,\n\nBack Settlement Indian Day School.\n\nA sum for the construction of an Indian Day School at Back Settlement, Caradoc Indian Reserve, Muncey, Ontario is included in our Main Estimates for 1948-49.

Marie on October 1st. There has never been an Indian school here and it is proposed to furnish a building for this purpose. There is a good boarding place with a white family near the school and it is thought that you might find the work here satisfactory. The initial salary allowed will be $350.00 per annum. Please advise the Department by return mail whether you will accept this position.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\n\nAsst.

There are four families living there outside of the Indians he said he was going to build you today on the Pleasant Line. I have written to the Party who owns the House I mentioned to you in my previous letter and explained to him on what conditions we would rent his House.\n\nMr. E.

Have building got ready for occupation at once. Get a lease for two years on best terms possible. Purchase hyloplate blackboard and necessary desks at Sault Ste. Marie. Be guided by list in making purchases.\"\n\nThe Department trusts that you will be able to make arrangements to have the necessary repairs made to the building that it is proposed to use for a school-house at Batchewana! You have already been informed that the Department would like to have the money that will be expended on the repairs go towards paying the first year's rent and you should try to arrange these terms.\n\nThe lady engaged as teacher is Miss Eva Pilon of Sudbury, Ont., and she is being written to today and asked to call and see you on her way to Batchewana about the end of this month. You will be good enough to give her as full instructions as possible.\n\nI am sending you, under separate cover, a copy of the day school regulations, some quarterly return forms, requisition blanks and a register.

You may purchase two dozen slates for the use of the school.\n\nIt is to be hoped that the Indians will take full advantage of this school and you should inform them that they will be expected to send their children to school regularly. If they do not the teacher should report to the Department through you.\n\nIn connection with repairs to this building it will be necessary to provide a cupboard in which to store the school material. This should be made by some of the Indians and should be fitted with a lock. You should also purchase some wash basins, pails, cups, combs, towelling, etc.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

You should call on the Indian Agent at Sault Ste. Marie, Mr. A. D. McNabb, who will give you what information you desire.\n\nThe Department trusts that you will find the work congenial and will be glad to hear from you from time to time, reporting on the school work.\n\nA great many of our teachers now are taking up some branch of domestic science and the Department would be pleased to have you teach sewing to the Indian girls in this village. If you will agree to do this the Agent will be asked to furnish you with some material for this purpose.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMiss Eva Pilon,\nSudbury, Ont.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe School at Batchewana.\n\nSome of the people living at Batchewana are very anxious for a school; and as I have learned from Mr. McNabb the Indian Agent here, the Department of Indian Affairs is about to establish a school at that point. I thought it well to write you to see if some concerted action could be taken whereby all the settlers and Indians could be served by the one school.\n\nIn order for the Ontario Department of Education to establish a school under the Public School Act a section would be formed, trustees elected and they would then have power to rent or build a house.\n\nI understand the Indians are all Catholics; there are four or five Protestant families and these are very anxious that the school be a public school if possible. Will the school that the Indian Department will establish be a Catholic or Protestant one?\n\nI trust that we shall be able to agree upon some basis that will serve the whole community without duplicating the expense or equipment.\n\nLet us hear what the Department will do in the case.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nThe Superintendent of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

There are about seventy children of school age there and the Department cannot be responsible for the education of any but these. Furthermore there will not be accommodation in the building the Department is renting even for the number of Indian children that should attend.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nAsst.

She says the pupils are intelligent and she feels certain that they will make good progress, but she is disappointed with the conditions. The only available boarding house within any reasonable distance is with a half-breed family, one mile from the school. She says that she has been put to considerable expense, both in her clothes and railway fares, and she finds that $350.00, the salary allowed her, will not be sufficient to meet her expenses and she trusts that the Department will give her an increase.\n\nWhen Miss Pilon was appointed the Department informed her that she would be able to get board with a white family. This statement was based on Mr. Shore's\nmemorandum, in which the opening of a school at Batchewana Bay was recommended. There is no doubt about Batchewana Bay being an isolated place in the winter and I can easily understand that a young girl would be disheartened at the prospect of having to spend a winter there at a salary of $350.00 a year.\n\nAs there is no doubt that she will leave by Christmas unless she gets a higher salary, I think the Department would be quite justified, in the interests of the Indian children there, in offering her a substantial increase in order to retain her services, as there is no prospect of getting another teacher in there till next September if she resigns.\n\nI think the salary should be increased to $450.00 per year in a reasonable salary for Mi'kmaq teachers.\n\nFunds available\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A new teacher will\ntherefore be required Mr. Pilon is leaving today to bring our daughter home.\n\nShe is now very lonesome, and she informs us that she has received no mail from her old bury acquaintance although several letters have been sent to her.\n\nOur chief objection to her staying at Batchewana is that she is fifty miles\nfrom Sault Ste Marie. The letter which she received from the Department of Education stated that the settlement was \"a few miles west of Sault Ste Marie. Should our daughter fall ill during the winter, it is probable that she would not be reached by us, as she would be snow-bound in her Indian...\nsettlement. She has a mile to walk through the woods to reach her school, and the family with whom she boards are half-breeds.\n\nSo please accept this as her notice of leave, and kindly see to it that her salary is paid up to date.\n\nThis greatly obliging,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMrs. X. Pilon.\nOttawa, October 31, 1912.\n\nMadam,\n\nReplying to your letter of the 20th instant I beg to say that, although the Department considers that it was entitled to notice from your daughter of her intention to resign her position as teacher of the Batchewana Bay School, it will, under the circumstances, pay her on receipt of a return showing the time she actually taught at this school. A blank return form is enclosed herewith and your daughter should fill this out and return it to the Department.\n\nA letter was received from your daughter on the 19th instant asking for an increase in her salary, which the Department had under consideration and was prepared to give her, but, as she has seen fit to leave, no further action will be necessary in regard to this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAssistant Secretary.\n\nMrs. H. Pilon,\nSudbury, Ont.\nOttawa, November 6, 1912.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant enclosing two applications for the positions of teacher at the Batchewana Bay and the Goulais Bay schools.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that Rev. Father Richard was written to in connection with the appointment of a teacher for the Goulais Bay School and informed that his nominee, Miss Kehoe, would be accepted, but up to the present time the Department has had no notice of her decision to take up the work there. It will, however, have to wait a reasonable time for a reply from Father Richard.\n\nIn the meantime the Batchewana Bay School is vacant and Miss Mallon may be appointed to this school at $400.00 a year. If she will devote her leisure time to field matron work on the reserve an additional $50.00 a year will be allowed her.

The school should not have been closed according to the regulations till December 20th and the Department would like to know why it was closed on the 12th instead of on the date provided for. Assuming that the school was opened by Miss Mallon on November 15th she could only have taught eighteen days to December 12th and the salary due for that period would have been $36.00 instead of $50.00.

I am writing to complain of the treatment I have received whilst up there, at the hands of a woman named Mellar.\nThis person made my life unbearable by her interference with my work and the children. All the Indians there seem to be under her sway and because I did not associate with her she told lies about me and tried to injure my character in every possible way.\n\nUnder the circumstances it would be almost impossible for me to reconcile my duties at school.\n\nAm sorry to have to make this complaint but I was compelled to claim protection against such a...\nwoman.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYours respectfully,\n\nMargaret Maclean.\nOttawa, July 25, 1913.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 18th instant in reference to the site for a school building at Batchewana.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the fact that Miss Mallen has been forced to resign owing to conditions on the reserve over which she has no control and the possibility there is of not being able to obtain the services of a teacher, the Department is not prepared to proceed with the erection of a building this year.\n\nI should be glad to have a report from you as to the cause of the trouble between Mrs. Miller and Miss Mallen, if you have been made aware of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Mrs Millar is a busy lady, and cannot mind her own business, I warned Miss Mallon when she went there first to have nothing to do with her and told her to report to me at once if she did interfere with her work and to pay no attention to what she said.\n\nI am of the opinion that Miss Mallon only wanted an excuse to leave there as I understand she is going to teach in the Separate School here in the Sault.\n\nI would very much like to give the School another trial, I am of the opinion that we could make it go all right, it is a pity to close the School now when the children were doing so well.

Mercier, teacher of the Batchewana School, for an increase of $50.00 in her salary. She is now paid at the rate of $400.00 per annum.\n\nWhen I was at Batchewana last November with Mr. Agent McNabb I saw Miss Mercier and the school. There were 15 children present out of an enrolment of 31, all the children of school age there. I had not time to see the children in their classes, as we got there about noon and left about two o'clock immediately after the payments were made. I was favourably impressed with Miss Mercier, who is a strong active young woman, and she seemed quite contented with her surroundings, as she lives with her uncle, who has a trading post. There are only three white families there and the last teacher was forced to resign owing to the fact that she could not get a suitable boarding place and was unable to agree with Mrs. Miller. Miss Mercier is quite able to hold her own and it would be\na difficult matter to replace her, as Batchewana is a most isolated situation and few white teachers would care to stay there for any time. She is popular with the Indians and it would be a pity to lose her.\n\nThe Department purchased a lot at Batchewana and proposed to put up a new school building with teacher's quarters attached. As long as Miss Mercier remains there would be no need to go to this expense, as the old schoolhouse is quite good enough for the purpose and quite comfortable and, as she is living with her relatives, she would not make use of the teacher's quarters.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This increase is granted on the understanding that Miss Mercier will remain at this school for at least another year and will date from the first of January, last.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nAsst.

If I can obtain a school in Ontario not too far from you, I shall be glad as Mr. Farr wishes me to return in April to try again my first group of exams. He says I shouldn't have any trouble to find a school to teach in the mean time.\n\nIt seems that I cannot find a school in Ontario as easily as in the West, but on account of having failed I do not care to go West until I am fully qualified. If you know any schools where I could receive at least $65 or $70 please let me know.\nIf I return to Ottawa to write these exams, you understand I'll have to save up some money to be able to do so and make some return to the Dept. as well.\n\nHoping to hear from you as soon as you find time to answer.\n\nRemain,\n\nYours truly,\nL. Penrose\n281 North St.,\nSoo, Canada.\nAugust 27th, 1920.\n\nDear Miss Teniscoe,\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant. The fact that you have failed in some of your exams does not put you in wrong as you think, and I have no doubt you will be able to finish up next year.\n\nWe have a vacancy just now at Batchewana, a few miles from Sault Ste. Marie. It is a pretty lonely place but I think you could stand it for six or seven months, and I am sure you would save more money there than in many other places where our schools are situated. We would allow you $550.00 and a bonus of $150.00 which would make $700.00.\n\nOn receipt of this letter you should go at once to our Agent, Mr. McNabb, who can give you full particulars. I am writing him today myself. If you decide to go you can open school next week.\n\nMr. McNabb's office is in the Post Office building at the Soo.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMiss Lucy Teniscoe,\n281 North Street,\nSault Ste.

Marie. She failed in some of her examinations and wishes to teach temporarily. We have told her of the vacancy at Batchewana and asked her to call and see you and get particulars. If she is satisfied with the conditions she can proceed at once to the school. We will pay her a salary of $550.00 and bonus.\n\nThe Department will appreciate it if you will give this girl every assistance you can to get placed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. T. Lee\n\nFor Assistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

Marie, and I should be pleased if you would inquire at that address as to whether she has obtained a school, or if she intends to accept the school at Batchewana.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie\nFor Asst. Deputy and Secretary.\nMr. Agent McNabb visited the Department this morning and urged the reopening of the above day school.

A.,\nINSPECTOR OF SEPARATE SCHOOLS, 47 BROWNING AVE.,\nTORONTO, ONT., Dated April 29, 1922.\n\nOriginal on File #13-3-6.\n\nWhile in Sault Ste. Marie, a certain matter was called to my attention and I promised to mention the matter to you. I do so only in the way of a report to call the matter to your attention so that you may give it your earnest consideration.\n\nThe school at Batchewana Bay is also closed, there being about 25 children without schooling.\n\nNo doubt, one of the chief causes is lack of teachers. It is too bad to have children growing up illiterate. Would it help in the procuring of teachers if the local Clergy were allowed to recommend teachers for these schools?\n\nKindly give the matter your earnest consideration. I remain,\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nJ. M. Bennett,\nInspector of Schools,\nNorthern Ontario.\nOTTAWA, May 4th, 1922.\n\nSir,\n\nThe Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Indian schools in his district, states that there is need for the re-opening of the school at Matahawana Bay which has been closed for about three years. The Inspector states that there are about 25 children at this point without any schooling, and he strongly urges that a school be started after the summer holidays.\n\nAt the time of your visit to the Department last December you stated that we could use the Roman Catholic church at this point upon paying a small annual rental, also that there is the necessary equipment on the ground.\n\nKindly take this matter up with the Roman Catholic Missionary and endeavour to obtain the services of a qualified teacher to begin duties on or about September 1st next. We will be prepared to pay a fair salary, depending upon the qualifications which the teacher appointed possesses.\n\nI may say that we will have no funds from which to erect a school building at this point this year. You will be good enough to bear this matter in mind and if a teacher is secured it will be necessary to make arrangements with the church authorities for the use of the church building, and for the providing of the necessary equipment.\n\nI will be pleased to hear from you later regarding the re-opening of this school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I am going to Batchewana in a day or two and will look up a boarding house for the Teacher.\n\nNeither the Priest nor myself have any teacher in view and if Miss Mc Guire has had 2 years experience she should be all right.

Deputy & Secretary.\nThe Secretary,\nDept. Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI made the trip to Batchewana & Goulais Bay. I understand there were new inspectors before. Distance and isolated situation of these places was no doubt the reason.\n\nGoulais Bay attendance is excellent, some 28 were present at day I called. A certain amount of decorating in schoolroom and teachers' rooms would make a great change in appearance. Two rooms could make a great change in appearance. Please note that all my report is supplementary. Please note that all my report is supplementary. Please note that all my report is supplementary. Please note that all my report is supplementary.\n\nConcerning Batchewana, I was surprised at the situation. There is neither school nor teacher's residence. The class is held in the church building which is easily a mile from the village itself. The teacher is living with an Indian family in a small log house. His room contains a camp cot & a few old quilts for a bed; not a pleasant situation. There were only 3 children on the roll. At least nine should have been there, at the\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6117, file 379-1, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n\nPOOR COPY\nMost only 15 could attend. However it is a question just what to do. The teacher is isolated as it is. It would be better for her to be in the village. There are only two families near the church. I feel that the proper place for the school is in the village near the wharf. I understand the department owns property here but I judge that it must be at least a far to the north east of the wharf village or the church is too south west.\n\nThere is an empty house in the village owned by Chris Thompson (he bought it some years ago for $50.00) I think it could be made habitable for the teacher + partitioned off for a classroom. I did not see him personally so I could not say whether he would sell or not.\n\nThe situation of the present school is certainly unsatisfactory for teachers + I think also pupils. Yet I feel that if it was in the village it would be more attractive to attend being close to the majority of the Indians. I counted at least 10 children running around who were about 7 years or more of age.\nIt is a question for investigation. I could not get all sides of the question in the short space of time at my disposal.\n\nIf I ever make a trip there again I shall so order my time that I will be able to see everyone around the small village to see what attendance could be effected.\n\nThe present teacher is efficient, I think, although she never pictured such a situation possible for any teacher.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ.M. Bennett\nOTTAWA, October 3rd, 1922.\n\nSir -\n\nMr. J. M. Bennett, Separate School Inspector, in a report on his recent inspection of the Batchawana Indian Day School states that he was surprised at the situation at this point. The class is held in the church building, which is easily a mile from the village, and the teacher is living with an Indian family in a small log house.\n\nThe Inspector also states that the proper place for the school is in the village, near the wharf, and that there is an empty house in the village, owned by Chris Thompson, who bought it some years ago for $70.00, which could be made habitable for the teacher, and partitioned off for a classroom. He, however, did not know whether this building could be obtained from the owner for school purposes.\n\nHe also states that there were only 3 children on the roll, while, at least, 9 should have been present.\n\nYou should investigate the situation at Batchawana, and ascertain whether the house referred to above is more central than the church building at present used for school purposes. It might be possible to rent this house from the owner, and have it fitted up as a classroom and teacher's living quarters. It seems a waste of money to continue the school situated as it is - too far away for the Indian children to attend. The Inspector strongly recommends that arrangements be made to have the school located near Batchawana Village in order that all the children of school age can attend.\n\nI would be pleased if you would enquire into the matter and inform the Department as to whether arrangements could be made to obtain the house referred to by the Inspector, and, if so, the rental that would be charged.\n\nThe Inspector states that the following articles are required for the school: new stove pipes, an axe, soap, towelling and a looking glass. You may, therefore, purchase the stove pipes required, 1 axe, 6 bars soap, 5 yards towelling and 1 cheap looking glass.\n\nAs we have a good teacher at this point, we desire that she be made as comfortable as possible and that the school be carried on in a building central to the majority of the Indian children.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie,\nOnt.\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\nOctober 6th, 1922\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant No. 13-1-1 and in reply have to say that Mr. Bennett is right when he says the School is 4 mile from the centre of the Village. At the time the School was first started there was no other house fit to make into a School Room and there is not today another place, as for the Chris Thompson House I had several talks with him about his House and I never could get him to lease it. It may be different now as he is not fishing at Batchewana any more, I do not know where he is now but will endeavor to get in communication with him about the house. It will take considerable expenditure to make it fit.\n\nThe Department some years ago bought 2 acres of Land from William Reid for building this land is in the Village and my idea was to try and get along with the present outfit for this year and perhaps the Department would take pity on me and build us a snug place for School and Teachers quarters. If I remember right Mr. Ferrier and Mr. Sutherland and myself had some conversation along these lines last December. I remember they had the usual excuse NO MONEY. The no money cry now should be a thing of the past with a bountiful harvest and all appearance of good times coming. I am in hopes that you will remember that you have 2 acres at Batchewana that would look better if they had little red School house built on them.\n\nI fully agree with you about the Teacher in my opinion she is the most sensible teacher in my Agency, and you may rest assured that I will do all in my power to make her comfortable. I am writing her today about the number of Stove pipes required, and will the other articles at once.\n\nI expect to go to Batchewana within the next 2 weeks to pay Interest money and will make arrangements for Wood and every thing required for the winter and will report to you as soon as I return.\n\nIn reference to the Pupils, there are a number of them away up the Lake with their parents. Fishing they move back about the first of November and she will have more pupils after that date.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ. D.

They have ample funds at their credit in the capital account of the Band. If they desire their children to receive an education, they would, no doubt, agree to authorize that the necessary funds be taken from their capital account to erect the building.\n\nWhen you visit the Reserve to pay the interest money you should place this matter before them at a full meeting of the band, and endeavour to obtain a resolution authorising the Department to take the funds necessary from the capital at their credit for the purpose of putting up a suitable building to be used as a school and teacher's residence. If this resolution is obtained, arrangements could then be made to have the building erected early next spring. You should point out to the Indians that, under the present arrangements, the success achieved hardly warrants the Department in keeping the school open, as, owing to the distance which the church building is situated from the majority of the Indians, it is impossible for the children to attend.

Indian Day School, and also the drawing of the children to the Batchewana Bay Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say it is noted that you are calling for tenders for the drawing of the children to the Garden River R.C. Indian Day School. You should submit the tenders received by you for this work, together with your recommendation, to the Department. It is hoped that the services of a reliable man can be secured in time to start operations when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays.\n\nRegarding the drawing of the children to the school at Batchewana Bay, it is noted that you can arrange to have this work done for the sum of $10 per week. If you can obtain the services of a competent man to do this work\u2014one who has the necessary horses and rig\u2014you may engage his services, and the Department will pay the sum of $10 per week for this service. It should be necessary to haul the children to this school during the months of January, February and March, only, or, at the latest, to the middle of April, and we would not be prepared to allow this service to be continued after that time. You should furnish the name of the man secured by you to draw the children at Batchewana Bay. You should take prompt steps to make the necessary arrangements in order that the man secured will be ready to begin the work when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

C. Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that, in view of the reports of the Separate School Inspector, the Traveling Nurse and yourself concerning the work in the classroom, the condition of the school room and the poor attendance, it has been deemed that it would be in the interests of the work to make a change of senior teacher for the next school year. You may therefore inform Miss Mildred Toner that her services will not be required after the end of the present school year viz.: June 30th, next. You will be good enough to see that before she leaves she prepares and hands to you her quarterly return of attendance, etc.\n\nWe will approve of the transfer of Miss Rose Chaput from Batchawana to take charge of the senior room to succeed Miss Toner - the salary allowed her will be the same as was paid Miss Toner. You should ascertain definitely whether she will be agreeable to the transfer from Batchawana to take charge of the senior room at the Garden River R. C. School and inform the Department accordingly.\n\nMiss Ada Bush, the present junior teacher, may remain for the next school year. You should also ascertain from her whether she will be prepared to return after the summer holidays and inform the Department accordingly.\n\nRegarding the appointment of a teacher at Batchawana to succeed Miss Chaput, I beg to say that we will approve of the appointment of Miss Bella Pelletier who formerly taught this school. The salary allowed her will be the same as is now paid Miss Chaput. All the above salaries will be supplemented by any bonus provided by law.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAest.

We can revert to the old saying in this instance \"Familiarity Breeds Contempt\". I would like your Dept to state frankly your reasons if any, why these people here should not have a change of Teacher in their school after having endured the present teacher for the past 10 years. Several of the residents here have kept their children at home, rather than send them to school to the present Teacher, while others have moved to Sault St Marie during part of the school season, so that their children could get schooling there.\n\nIf necessary the Indian Residents here will forward a petition to your Department asking for a change of Teacher, to start September Term. I would therefore appreciate if you will take this matter up with your Inspector of Indian Schools, and have this change put into effect prior to the September Term commencing.\n\nYours Very Truly,\n\nBatchawana Bay P.O.\nOntario\n\nL.M.

These reports appear to be uniformly satisfactory and creditable to the teacher. I note that the reports are signed by three Inspectors, working under the direction of the Department of Education of the province of Ontario.\n\nInspector Greening, in a report dated June 15th, 1937, states:-\n\n\"Cleanliness of pupils - Good.\nObedience - Excellent.\nConduct of pupils in school - Excellent.\"\n\nIn his report on examination of the classes, the Inspector states:-\n\n\"The classes were examined in Reading and Oral Language, in Spelling and Arithmetic. The older pupils were also asked to do some work in Written English. The results were quite good, distinct progress being evident\n\nA. L. M. Allan, Esq.,\nBatchewana Bay,\nOnt.\nevident in the written work.\"\n\nIt would appear that the Inspector, when he last visited this school, was accompanied by a missionary. In the last paragraph of his report he states:\n\n\"I believe that it is a good thing to bring to the attention of the public the work being done by the Indian Department in these schools, and so, at our visit to this school, we were accompanied by a Baptist missionary (Rev. Mr. Readhouse) of Toronto, who had travelled around the world a good deal and who at the present time is resting at the Sault. I feel sure that Mr. Readhouse realized the good work that was being done at this particular school and I was more than pleased when I was able to show him written work done by the four pupils of Grades 7 and 8, which was of a very high order for such a school.\"\n\nIn addition to these reports received from the Inspectors, the Indian Agent for the district has, on more than one occasion, referred to this school and to the satisfactory progress of the pupils in attendance.\n\nIn view of these reports, you can readily understand the reluctance of the Department to consider a change of teacher at this school. It would be exceedingly difficult for this Department to obtain the services of fully qualified teachers, unless such teachers were given a reasonable assurance of security of tenure and that they would not be dismissed from their positions as long as their work was conscientiously performed and satisfactory to the Department. I am convinced, after a careful study of the Inspectors' reports, that there are few public school teachers in the Dominion with a more creditable record than the record established by Miss Robicheau at the Batchewana School.\n\nIt is just possible that, in the interests of this teacher, herself, we may have to consider the advisability of changing her to a school where her work will be more fully appreciated. Such changes, however, are not easily\neasily effected and should not be considered unless there is a school available to which this teacher could be transferred at a salary equal to, or greater than, the salary she is now receiving. The officials inform me that they know of no such school to which she could be transferred at the present time.\n\nMay I thank you for bringing this matter to my personal attention and express the hope that the information I am submitting for your consideration will prove satisfactory to you and to the residents who may be interested in the progress of the Indian pupils at Batchewana Bay.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDirector.\nSainte Marie\nOct 29/37\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nMrs. Miss E.M.

C. School.\n\nMr. W. J. Greening, Inspector, has advised me that Miss Robicheau is one of the best teachers in this Agency. The attendance at this school is always good.\n\nThe main complaint the Indians have against Miss Robicheau is, that she has been teaching at the Batchewana school too long. She has been there, I understand, about 20 years.\n\nThere is no reserve where the Batchewana school is located. The school building consists of an old log building, which is now falling apart and cannot last much longer. The teacher's quarters are very poor. If a new teacher is appointed to this school, doubtless the Indian Department will be asked to make considerable improvements, and I am unable to see how that can be done on this building.\n\nAt least 50% of the children attending this school are children of non-treaty or enfranchised Indians. Consideration will have to be given, shortly, to the building of a new school by the Indian Department or district organization for a Public school, with the Department paying tuition fees for the Treaty Indians.\n\nI am returning, herewith, the petition.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nExtract from Inspector Greening's report on the Rabbit Island Indian Day School visited on May 17, 1944.\n\nWhile I was at Sagamook the other day I was distressed to learn from Mr. Agent Lawrence, (with whom my relations are also most cordial), that the Indians at Batchawana were petitioning for a change of teacher.\n\nThis matter is a hardy perennial, and keeps coming to the surface. A deputation once waited upon me in the time of Mr. Agent Sims, with a similar request. I consulted the agent and said that I would be glad to listen to anybody concerned at the school that afternoon. The Indians admitted quite frankly that they had nothing whatever against Miss Robicheau, except that she had been at Batchawana too long and that they would like a new teacher. When I explained to them that it would be difficult, perhaps, to find her another school they replied that they regretted that very much as she was a fine woman but they would like a new teacher.\n\nA reference to my reports upon the Batchawana School will show my own opinion of Miss Robicheau. Any young lady who could live in a place like Batchawana for almost twenty years without having given anyone any chance for a little \"choice gossip\" must certainly be a genuinely sterling character.\n\nIf the Indian Affairs Branch feels that a change might be desirable at Batchawana, (and, considering the length of time Miss Robicheau has been there, the Indians are perhaps not too unreasonable), I hope that something good can be found for her. Perhaps she would like the Rabbit Island School.\nBatchawana Bay\nMay 28, 1944\n\nThe Indian Agent,\nSault St. Marie,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI cannot find anything wrong with the teacher we have here at Batchawana.\n\nAll the children like her and they like to go to school. She minds her own business and does not make any trouble out here.\n\nThe one that is complaining is only trying to make trouble. It isn't necessary for you to come up if you don't want to.\n\nChief J.J. Taylor\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYou will please find enclosed for your information letter received from Chief Jos. T. Sayers of the Batchewana Band regarding Miss Robicheau of the Batchewana R.C. School.\n\nChief Sayers signed the petition mentioned in your letter 13-1-1 dated April 12, 1944, and, like most of the others, did so without giving the matter serious thought.\n\nRPGI/MY\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nJune 7, 1944.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of May 25, with reference to the request of the Indians at Batchawana for a change in teachers.\n\nWe have also received a report from Inspector Greening and, as you state in your letter, he is well satisfied with the work that Miss Robicheau has been doing at the school mentioned. For the academic year 1944-45 we have a vacancy at the Rabbit Island School near Wikwemikong. This is a new school erected three or four years ago and has teacher's living quarters attached. It has occurred to me that possibly Miss Robicheau would like to take this school where she would be much more comfortable and would be able to continue the good work that she has done at Batchawana. Please consult her immediately and let me know if she is willing to accept this appointment.\n\nR.A. Hosey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, June 26, 1944.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI desire to refer to our letter of the 7th instant, suggesting the transfer of Miss Robicheau to the Rabbit Island School. Please let me know at once if Miss Robicheau is willing to accept the transfer for the coming academic year.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 13-1-1 of June 7th with reference to a change of school for Miss Robicheau.\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I advised Miss Robicheau of the vacancy at the Rabbit Island School and pointed out to her that it is a new school with teacher's living quarters attached.\n\nAfter thinking the matter over, Miss Robicheau has advised me that of the two schools she much prefers the Batchewana School. Her reason being that Rabbit Island is very isolated and 17 miles from a telephone. Her mother is alone and over seventy years of age and she prefers to be where she can receive a telephone call and get out if necessary.\n\nThe Batchewana School is within half a mile of telephone and the road is kept open by the Highway Department all winter. Miss Robicheau also has a car which she states she would be unable to use at Rabbit Island from November to May.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence.\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, June 27, 1944.\n\nMr. R.P. G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario,\n\nI have your letter of the 23rd instant, in which you state that Miss Robicheau does not wish to transfer to the Rabbit Island Indian Day School.\n\nIt is hoped that the attendance at the Batchewana School will increase during the coming year.\n\nDuring your next visit to the reserve you should interview the Indians, if you have a meeting and explain that the Inspector reports very favourably of the work that Miss Robicheau is doing. You should ask them to support her in every possible way instead of criticizing her.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, September 8, 1944.\n\nMr. R.F.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI am sending forward herewith a letter received by this Branch from Mrs. Angeline Kakapshe. The subject matter of this letter, you will note, is self-explanatory.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would discuss the contents of this letter with the Indians concerned and let us have your recommendations in respect to the work of the teacher and the condition of the school buildings, in due course. You might return this letter with your reply.\n\nEncl.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nSir,\n\nWe the petitioners of a small community mostly natives of Batchawana treaty and more treaty whose children are suffering here because of a school teacher who does not understand the feeling of those children and the children doesn't understand her... and because of that they all hate to go to school to her, which in my opinion is entirely too long for any teacher to stay in one school especially in a small place as this. What complaint I have that Miss M. Richards has been here too long, for in all the years she's been teaching. Can you find in your registers if anyone those children passed the examination for them to enter high school in Sainte Marie which is our nearest high school like they have been doing in Hartley River where rules are fair to their Indian children by there teachers. The children are not to blame as they are just learning why can't she be transferred to some other place so we could have a different teacher so to give those children a chance to learn something in school now while they are at the age to attend school.\n\nAnd another thing I would like to tell you is about our school house. I doubt if you know what kind of a building we have for a school house. Perhaps you think it's a good clean school house with plenty of windows like other Indian schools are. No, if you were in our place you would never think of sending your child or children in a log house which in the first place was a barn. Would you? even the windows are small and they are in wrong places which makes very poor light the children haven't enough light for to study and now nearly every one of them are complaining of sore eyes. Why can't something be done. Some time ago two acres of land was bought here for to build a new school, an new instead of new school a tourist cottage was built on those two acres. What about that? I only wish this would be looked into, for instead of getting better its getting worse. I'm hoping there'll be a change in the near future.\n\nYours truly,\nMrs Angelina Nakapahle.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI wish to acknowledge your letter 13-1-1 dated Sept. 8th, 1944 enclosing letter forwarded to the Department by Mrs. Angeline Kakapshe regarding the teacher at the Batchewana Indian Day School.\n\nMrs. Kakapshe was responsible for the petition forwarded to the Department last April regarding Miss Robicheau, which I answered on May 25th in reply to your letter 13-1-1 dated April 12, 1944. I wish to refer you to my letter dated May 25th regarding this matter.\n\nI understand the trouble between Mrs. Kakapshe and Miss Robicheau started about Church work and ever since then Mrs. Kakapshe has been agitating among the Indians to have Miss Robicheau removed.\n\nAs pointed out in my letter of May 25th last, the School at Batchewana consists of an old log building which I understand was originally built for a barn. The logs are now rotten and it would be a waste of money to make any extensive repairs to this building.\n\nInspector W.S. Arneil looked over this building on his visit to this Agency last summer and was of the same opinion.\n\nI am returning herewith Mrs. Kakapshe's letter.\n\nR.P.G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, September 16, 1944.\n\nMr. R.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nRe: Conditions - Batchewana Day School\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant and to thank you for the information contained therein.\n\nIn view of the fact that our immediate post-war building program is now under consideration, it would be greatly appreciated if we could have a definite recommendation from you with respect to the rebuilding of the Batchewana School or a school at some other point that might meet the needs of these pupils. This is a matter you might discuss with the Public School Inspector. It might be possible to come to an arrangement whereby a public school might be established, on the understanding that tuition grants would be paid by this Department for the Indian children in attendance.\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nIn reply to your letter 13-1-1 dated September 16th, 1944, I would recommend that a Separate Public School be established at Batchewanna, at the end of the present academic year, and that tuition grants be paid by the Indian Department for the treaty Indian children in attendance.\n\nLast season there were only five treaty Indian children attending this school, the eleven other pupils were children of half-breeds or enfranchised Indians. This term there are twenty-four pupils attending this school and only six of them are treaty Indians.\n\nThis district is now being organized into a school district.\n\nThere is no reserve in this section and, I understand, that even the land the present Indian school is located on, does not belong to the Department.\n\nAs long as the Indian Department is willing to keep a school open at Batchewanna and allow other than treaty Indians to attend it, no attempt will be made to open a public school.\n\nI have discussed the above matter with Mr. Greening, Separate School Inspector, and I think it likely that since all the children concerned are Catholic, those concerned will proceed to organize a Separate School if the Indian Affairs Branch close their school.\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa,\nNovember 9, 1944.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent, Sault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 4th instant, with reference to the Batchawana Day School. In view of the information contained in your letter, you should notify those interested that it is the intention of this Branch to close the Batchawana School on June 30, 1945. If a white school section is organized and a school provided, the few Treaty Indian children living at Batchawana can attend the white school and this Department will allow a tuition grant for them.\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nThere is another matter I wish to take up with you, that is about the Indian School at Batchawana. The Indian Agent here, Mr. Laurence told me a short time ago that the Indian school at Batchawana most likely would be closed by the Department next year on account of the run-down condition of the school itself and the few treaty Indians attending.\n\nOn my last trip to Batchawana Mission I got the teacher there, Miss Bobichaud to make out a list of all the Treaty Indian children there. There are 9 Treaty Indian children in school now and with another 10 children who are too young to attend school yet, and the number of Treaty Indian children are increasing every year. I will enclose a copy of the names of all the Treaty Indian children who live there.\n\nIn regard to the school itself, if the department so desired, I would turn over to them a building that I erected there within the past two years. It is 60 feet long and 18 feet wide. It would make an ideal school for there. There is also a large garage and woodshed that goes with it. At present I am using it for a Winter Chapel, but as I have a church there about a mile distant I can again use it.\n\nWould it be possible for you to come up in October or November and look the matter over. If you could arrange to come to Spanish, I would meet you there with the car and drive you to Batchawana. On the way you could visit the Indian schools of Serpent River Reserve, Mississauga, Garden River, Goulais Bay, and Batchawana. I sincerely hope you will be able to come. This part of the country is beautiful this time of year.\n\nWith very best wishes, I am\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

This term, the Agent states, there are 24 pupils attending the school, of whom only 6 are Treaty Indians. He further advised that it was the intention of the people in that district to organize into a school district and establish a white school, to which the Indian children could be sent. Presumably this school would be a separate school, under Catholic auspices, as all the children attending the school are Catholics. We therefore decided to advise the Agent that he should notify those interested that it is our intention to close the Batchawana School on June 30, 1945. I note from your letter that you state there are 19 Treaty Indian children living at Batchawana Bay. Evidently all of them are not attending, as the Agent states that there are only 6 Treaty Indian children at the school this year.\n\nI think you will agree that we can hardly be expected to continue operating an Indian school for only 6 Indian children. This Branch is not responsible for the education of half-breed children or the children of enfranchised Indians. It might be advisable for you to discuss the matter early in the new year with Indian\n\nReverend T. J. Dwyer, S.J.,\nGarden River, Ont.\nAgent Laurence, at which time you could write me again. As you will note, from the information given above, it is not our intention to take any definite action in the matter until the end of June.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nWith reference to your letter 13-1-1 dated November 9th, 1944, I beg to state that Father Dwyer has advised me that a white school has now been organized at Batchewana and will be ready to take over when the Indian school closes on June 30th, 1945.\n\nAs a number of Indian children will be attending this school, I would recommend that the equipment in the present Indian School be turned over to the new school when it commences. Most of the equipment is old, especially the desks, and is not worth shipping to another school.\n\nRPGI/NY\n\nR. P. G. Laurence,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 22, 1945.\n\nMr. R.P.G. Laurence, Indian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 19th instant, in which you state that a white school is being organized at Batchewana for the academic year 1945-46. This means that we will close our school on June 30, 1945, as stated in Mr. Hoey's letter of November 9, 1944.\n\nRegarding the last paragraph of your letter, please let me know the exact items of furniture, etc., which you consider might be transferred to the white school. You should also let me have an estimate of the approximate value of each of these articles of furniture. I realize that there may not be any large amount involved, but at the same time we are expected to receive definite authority before transferring government property to any other school than one of our own, and therefore the information mentioned above is required.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 22, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nREPRESENTATIVE OF THE TREASURY.\n\nRe: Batchewana Indian Day School, No. 379.\n\nPlease note that it is our intention to close this school at the end of the current academic year.

I would suggest a remedy for this, if the Batchewana Band were allowed to purchase the Residence of the late Chief Pat Sayers it could be fitted up for a School room and also used as a Hall, and as two Teachers are kept at the Catholic School one of them could be removed over to Frenchtown as they are all Catholics living there. The place could be fitted up so that the teacher could have living quarters upstairs and the first floor used for School and Hall, this arrangement would do away with the necessity of sending any children to the Spanish, I would be pleased to have your opinion on the above suggestion.\n\nA. D. McNabb,\nIndian Agent.\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, March 8, 1921.\n\nSir,\n\nI have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3rd instant, in which you suggest, in order to meet the educational requirements of the Indian children who are living at Frenchtown on the western side of the Batchewana Reserve, that a house be purchased and fitted up for a school-room and living quarters for the teacher, and that one of the teachers at present in the Roman Catholic school at Garden River be removed to Frenchtown.\n\nIn connection with this matter I have to request that you will be good enough to state the number of Indian children of school age at present residing at this point, the cost that would be involved in purchasing the house and having it fitted up as a class-room and living quarters for the teacher. You should also state whether these Indian families reside at this point permanently and also, if one of the teachers is transferred from the Catholic school, whether the teacher who remains would be able to carry on the work there. The last quarterly return received from the Garden River (R.C.) School showed a total enrolment of 46 children in both class-rooms, with an average attendance of 25. As soon as the above information is received the Department will be in a position to consider your suggestion. You should give as full information as possible regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste.

As for the cost of building a School I cannot give any estimate on account of the unsettled condition of Labor at this time.\n\nI am quite satisfied that either one of the Teachers that are here now could take care of either school and give good satisfaction.\n\nIf we could get the Pat Sayer House at 5 or 666.00 Dollars the Indians are willing to give one or two days gratis to put the building in shape for a school. If we had to build it would be much more expensive as it is almost impossible to get any building contractor to any work only on a Commission basis, on account of the labor problem.\n\nThe people are very anxious for school and I would like to see them get one if at all possible.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent,\n\nJ.

Indian Day School.\n\nIn reply, I beg to say that the Department has no funds from which to purchase the house owned by Pat Sayer and have it fitted up for school purposes. If, however, the Indians are willing to provide the necessary funds from the money at their credit in \"Trust Fund\", the Department will then consider the question of opening this school, and the transferring of one of the teachers from the Roman Catholic school at Garden River. You should place this matter before the Band and obtain a resolution authorizing funds necessary from the funds at the credit of their account.\n\nIt might be advisable, before taking the matter up with the Indians as to the funds, to ascertain definitely whether the house mentioned by you can be obtained, and the cost of same, as well as the cost of the changes that would be required in making it suitable for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nA. D. McNabb, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nSault Ste. Marie, Ont.\nSir,\n\nI beg to report in reference to the Sale of the House belonging to the Pat Sayer Estate. At the Sale Fred Belleau of the Garden River Band bid it in for $475.00, he cannot make his payment although I have given him 10 days over the time specified at the sale.\n\nThe Batchewana Band is willing to buy the House for a School room and Hall, they are waiting anxiously for permission from the Department.\n\nMr Cook of the Department can give you some report on this matter, I showed him the hardship that the young children that live in French Bay have to endure going to school in the winter. We are keeping two teachers during the winter months when there is not pupils enough attending to keep them busy, if we had a School in French Bay even for the winter months and take one of the teachers over there they would both have a good school. In the summer we could have them both together from April to November.\n\nKindly give this matter your serious consideration and let me know at your earliest opportunity the result.\n\nI may say that about $200.00 over and above the purchase price would fit it up in good shape.\n\nI have the honor to be Sir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nJ.

As you have been informed, the Department is unable to provide funds for the purpose, and it would unduly tax the funds of the band to provide the money at the present time.\n\nIt is thought that satisfactory arrangements could be made with a reliable man who has horses and a good wagon to draw the Indian children who reside on the western side of the Reserve to and from their homes to the Garden River (R.C.) Indian Day School, where there is ample accommodation for them.\n\nI will, therefore, be pleased if you will consider this suggestion. You should state whether the services of a competent man could be obtained who would enter into an agreement to provide the equipment and draw the children to and from school each day. You should also state the amount that would be charged each day for the purpose. It would be necessary for him to take the children in time in the morning and bring them home in the afternoon.\n\nI may say that this arrangement has been tried on other Reserves, and when the services of a reliable man have been obtained, to draw the children to and from school daily, has met with fair success. It will, no doubt, be possible to arrange with an Indian who has a team and a wagon; or the services of a white man could be obtained to do the work.\n\nIt is considered that this arrangement could be carried out at a moderate cost, and the children and teacher receive better accommodation in the Roman Catholic Day School where there is every facility for the children's education, and also accommodation for the teacher.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

I have noted the enclosed tenders and your recommendation that this work be authorized immediately.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Department authorizes you to accept the tender of Thomas Thibault, with the understanding that a comfortable vehicle and proper protection from the weather will be supplied. The amount of $4.50 per day entitles us and the children to adequate accommodation and conveniences.\n\nWill you make every effort to see that the children who are being called for in the mornings are ready to make the trip, and enlist the services of Thomas Thibault in connection with a check in the matter of attendance. Once a month you should prepare properly certified vouchers in favour of this man and have them forwarded to the Department for payment. It has been decided that this expenditure will be taken one half from the school vote and the other half from Band Funds.

Indian day school, the same as was done last winter. It is also noted that at Batchewana you can arrange to have the children taken to the school and returned to their homes for $10 per week, as there are only 9 or 10 there to be drawn.\n\nRegarding the drawing of the children who reside on the western end of the Garden River Reserve, I beg to say that you may obtain tenders from reliable persons who have the necessary horses and a good vehicle for the drawing of the children to the Garden River R.C. Indian day school. You should attend to this matter at once, and submit the prices received to the Department, in order that if possible arrangements can be completed and the work begun when the school re-opens after the Christmas holidays.\n\nRegarding the drawing of the children to the school at Batchewana, it is presumed that you refer to the school known as Batchewana Bay, and the Department would like to be further informed as to the necessity of engaging a team to draw the children to this school. Your letter is not clear and we are unable to decide from it whether or not you request that arrangements be made for the drawing of the children to the Garden River R.C. school as well as the school at Batchewana Bay.

The isolation of this School was pointed out to you by Mr Bennett the R. C. School Inspector last Fall.

If you can obtain the services of a competent man to do this work - one who has the necessary horses and rig - you may engage his services, and the Department will pay the sum of $10 per week for this service. It should be necessary to haul the children to this school during the months of January, February and March, only, or, at the latest, to the middle of April, and we would not be prepared to allow this service to be continued after that time.
