Indians returned to the scene of battle, having attesting a war or chiding any feeling.\n\nThe prisoners all died natural deaths.\n\nUp to the time of Riot's execution they paid attention to the priests, as they felt convinced they were going to get killed, and they thought they had heard of cases of Indians hanging so confusedly.\n\nMiserable Man wanted to know what kind of hell it was that provided about three meals a day, and clothes, while here and did not provide any for white men who killed Indians.\n\nTHE CHIT-CHAT LOCALS\n\nGathered by our Reporters.\n\nBirthday Cards in Bookseller.\n\nFirst Method is creating a school district.\n\nFull line of School Books at Cassie's Bookstore.\n\nSpecial offer eight thousand books of grade are being sold at reduced prices.\n\nThe people of Q Appelle have started a school, and one of their children has been appointed director.\n\nBirthday Cards in Bookseller.\n\nR.

She arrived at Halifax on the 18th of last month, and in the results of her voyage all our doubts have been set at rest and our most sanguine expectations more than realized. Six parties were placed at different points so situated as to overlook the whole straits, and the information acquired by them will be of a double value\u2014navigability of the straits\u2014a period sufficient to ensure the success of the much doubted Hudson Bay route. Lieut. Gordon, the commissioner of the expedition, in his report to the Government, from what he has stated at different interviews we feel sure that it will be a very valuable document, and one that will have a very direct effect upon the future prosperity of Canada, and especially upon this part of it where we are endeavoring to build up homes for ourselves. In an interview Lieut. Gordon said:\n\n\"The strait was examined several times a day with a telescope from the selected points of observation, which in each case was at a considerable height above the sea. The sum total of the observations is 140. The ice took at the western end of the strait in the latter end of October, and from that date throughout the winter I don't think the strait could have been navigated.\"\n\nI am confirmed in the opinion I expressed last year that the strait and bay are navigable to properly equipped steamers for four months of the year. The feasibility of the route for traffic is a question for commercial men who understand the cost of building and handling such ships as are required for such a trade and such a short season of navigation. In other words, there is no doubt in my mind as to the practicability of navigating the strait season named; it is a question whether the cost would be such as to compete with existing routes. The weather temperature was not so low as we anticipated. At none of the stations was the minimum temperature as low as we frequently have recorded at similar points on the North coast. Notwithstanding the severity of the weather along the Hudson Straits have never been tested by properly equipped seamen ships. Neither of these vessels were built for such navigation, both being built for carrying small cargoes with auxiliary steam power. To steam half especially for no navigation, we believe the straits would be navigable for a much longer period than the steamer Gordon. But against four months of safe navigation is sufficient to ensure the opening of the route and the building of the Hudson Bay railway line. If the building of the steamer Gordon is more than the cost of ordinary steamship work, the cost of building the line will not nearly so much less. We are convinced that the steamer Gordon will be able to navigate the strait during the winter months after the steamer Gordon has paid her dues, and during the winter months when the straits are closed she would find plenty to do among the open water on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. Besides demonstrating the feasibility of this route, the expedition has done much towards opening a large section of country to the shipping of Hudson Bay trade thought to be only fit for Esquimaux, but which abounds in mineral wealth compared to which the mineral wealth of Nova Scotia seems insignificant, and has a climate less severe than our own, which will before long be the happy homes of thousands of new Canadian citizens, who will bring wealth and prosperity to the Canadian soil, and justify the policy that a greater Canada would eventually spring up west of the great lakes.\n\nThe Canadian Pacific Railway is now completed. The last spike was driven by the Hon. Donald A. Smith, and the first trip was made from end to end by Mr. Van Horne. The greatest transportation road in the world is a reality. In about five years nearly three thousand miles of road have been completed, and it reflects great credit upon Canadian energy and enterprise. We regard the success capacity of the men who took hold of the road and to whom we owe its completion at this early date. We congratulate the shareholders who grasped with such a sagacious understanding this great through line from ocean to ocean will be the settlement of an immense population in the North West, the opening up of development of the country, and also the great tide of traffic will flow into Canada. Now since the C. P. R. has been completed, it is to be hoped that the building of branch lines will be proceeded with, and that the same energy and sagacity that has characterized the building of the main line may be put forward in building branch lines.\n\nAfter several months, the archduke had escaped his crimes upon the gallows. He had committed great deeds, but had his sentence commuted, but all without avail. He was pardoned for the part he took in the reaction in 1879, and after a course of study returned to his country, and was not justified in coming to the North-West to stir up sedition and occasion bloodshed. Kid was a cold-blooded murderer, and more justly punished the fate he had brought upon him.\n\nWe are now engaged in our exchanges, the MacLeod Guard, that a town detachment of the N. W. M. P. has been stationed in that town as well as in Prince Albert, and that it has been very peaceful during the past few weeks. At first we were not inclined to view the placing of a police station in our midst with much favor, not knowing exactly what manner of activities such a detachment would affect ourselves as citizens. We are very glad, however, to be able to state that the fact of the Police being stationed in the MacLeod is done in much honor to the administration of order in Prince Albert as our contemporary states has been done here at MacLeod. This has been remarked to us by more than one of our peace-loving citizens, and who have willingly given their heart, and Capt. Perry is to be congratulated on the quiet, thorough and efficient manner in which these duties have been performed. We are very glad to be able to quote the before mentioned sentiments expressed that the placing of a town detachment in Prince Albert was a great triumph, and that it has insured more order in the town than we thought was possible, and we are much congratulated ourselves in having a town as orderly as it is peaceable.\n\nWe are glad to see by the recent advertisements that the town is applying for small tenders for supplies, as shown by the different notices lately issued by the N. W. M. P., that they have determined to give as much as possible to the town, and to the best of our knowledge of competing for these same supplies, and so procuring work and remuneration for themselves. This is only as it should be, and we are glad to see that the wants of the community of Prince Albert and the surrounding district have not been quite forgotten by those in power where duty is being such, and we thank the Government. And we trust that the matter of providing our farmers with grain for sowing purposes will also not be overlooked, as it will be to their advantage to have a store of grain\u2014both in superior quality and adequate quantities\u2014that we may look forward to the success of our coming crop.\n\nTHUS, POWERS,\n\nCONTRACTS\n\nBrick, Plastering and Stone Work.\n\nAll orders promptly attended to.

It is therefore recommended that the detachment of N.W.M.P. be ordered to be humbly asked to increase the detachment of Mounted Police in this district. It is also respectfully requested that the full complement to at least 200 men, and that they be so arranged between the centres and western portions of the town as to enable them to be brought to the aid of those who may be threatened by the said enemy, that they may afford protection to such and at the same time be able to meet the enemy in battle array.
