GAGE & COMPANY,\n1881.\nPREFACE.\n\nThe present edition of my English Grammar is the outcome of the constant labour of the last three years. The work has been subjected to a searching revision from end to end. In its general form and scope no material alteration has been made, and the numbering of the paragraphs has been left to correspond as closely as possible with that of the last edition, so that the two editions may be used together in class-work without practical inconvenience. I have, however, followed the arrangement of my 'Shorter English Grammar' in introducing the antique forms of the language as they are needed from time to time, instead of relegating them to an Appendix.\n\nSince my 'English Grammar' was first written, various paragraphs in it have been rendered superfluous by the publication of my more elementary grammars. By the excision of such portions, and of several rather long notes devoted to the discussion of points about which there is no longer any dispute, and by the adoption of an improved style of typography, room has been found for the introduction of a good deal of new and valuable matter, illustrating the structure, history, and affinities of the English language. I have\nendeavoured to enable the learner to gain an intelligent insight into the real functions of words and forms, and in that way to rise from the mere mastery of rules to the comprehension of principles. In the Syntax I think I have succeeded in elucidating various troublesome constructions which have not before been explained. Many new examples of analysis have been introduced, and the solution of difficulties made as intelligible as possible by carefully graduating and contrasting the illustrations.\n\nThe Exercises in the previous edition were inadequate for the purpose they should have served. In the present edition I have introduced the most appropriate portions of the rather copious exercises attached to the 'Shorter English Grammar,' with such references to the entire series (re-published) in a cheap form under the title 'English Grammar Practice') as will enable learners who need greater practice in elementary work to go through the whole course. I strongly recommend that this should be done, if time can be found, as advanced pupils are often hampered by the lingering remains of early misconceptions.\n\nThe reader who desires a fuller investigation of the Subjunctive Mood than space could be found for in the present work, is referred to the Appendix to my 'Shorter English Grammar,' republished (with some additions) under the title 'Remarks on the Subjunctive and the so-called Potential Mood.'\n\nIn the preparation of this edition the indispensable study of original sources has been aided and supplemented by diligent use of the great works of M\u00e4tzner and Koch, and of the valuable stores of Grein and Fick. It will be seen, by references made from time to time, that I have received some important suggestions from Professor Skeat's most\nvaluable and interesting 'Etymological Dictionary of the English Language.' Dr. Murray's admirable account of the 'Dialect of the Southern Counties of Scotland' has been of great service. I need hardly say how much the study of the early English writers has been facilitated by the capital editions of parts of Chaucer, and 'Specimens of Early English' by Prof. Skeat and Dr. Morris, and their more elaborate and truly scholarlike work in editing several of the most important remains of old English. Constant and (it is hoped) not unprofitable use has been made of March's 'Anglo-Saxon Grammar,' Sweet's 'Anglo-Saxon Reader,' Skeat's 'Moeso-Gothic Glossary,' and the Anglo-Saxon dictionaries of Grein, Ettmuller, and Leo.\n\nC.

Some persons have the mistaken idea that a preterite like felt or taught, in which, as compared with the present tense, there is a change of the vowel sound, is a combination of the Strong and the Weak formation and so call such verbs 'mixed.' This is quite wrong. The change of vowel is merely phonetic, it is not formative. It is a result of the addition of the suffix. The shortening of the vowel in felt is like the change of n\u0101 in nation into n\u0101 in national. Sometimes the change ensued much later than the formation of the tense. In old English cacchen (= catch) and cahte (= caught) had the same vowel. In Anglo-Saxon t\u0113can (teach) and t\u0101hte (taught) were alike in vowel sound. Indeed in many cases it is the present, rather than the preterite, which has undergone change. The sound of teach is comparatively modern.\nHISTORICAL OUTLINE.\n\nThe various languages spoken by mankind admit of being grouped together in certain great families, the members of each of which resemble each other more or less closely in the words used to express ideas, and in the grammatical framework of forms and inflexions by which the words are combined. One of these families of languages has been called the Indo-European or Aryan family.\n\nThis family of languages* has two divisions\u2014an Asiatic division and a European division.\n\nA. To the Asiatic division belong\u2014\n1. Sanskrit, the ancient language of the Hindus (the oldest known form of which is found in the Vedas or sacred hymns), with its later forms and offshoots.\n2. Zend, the ancient language of Persia, with its later forms, the Parsi and the modern Persian.\n\nB. To the European division belong\u2014\n1. The Teutonic\u2020 languages, comprising:\u2014\n   a. The Low German dialects, spoken by the tribes inhabiting the low-lying lands of North Germany, towards the Baltic and the German Ocean. To this subdivision belong Moeso-Gothic\u2021; Old Saxon\u00a7 (or the Saxon spoken on the Continent), English, Frisian, Dutch, Flemish, and Platt-Deutsch.\n   b. The Scandinavian languages of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, of which the Old Norse of Iceland is the purest and most antique in form.\n   c. Old and modern High German, spoken originally by tribes inhabiting the highlands of Southern Germany.\n      Some authorities regard Scandinavian and High German as offsets from the Low German stock.\n2. The Slavonic languages of Russia, Poland, Bohemia, Bulgaria, &c., and (related to these) the Lithuanian dialects spoken in some of the Baltic provinces.\n\n* Schleicher and March give diagrams (copied by several other writers), intended to show how the various languages of this family branched out from a parent stock. Such diagrams have the disadvantage of exhibiting a good deal that is merely conjectural as though it were settled fact. The modes and the relative dates of the separation of the different languages from the parent stem, and from each other, are yet a long way from being settled.\n\n\u2020 Some writers use the term 'Gothic' instead of, or as well as, 'Teutonic,' as the name of this stock.\n\n\u2021 Spoken in Dacia by a tribe which appears to have migrated eastward down the Danube. We still possess important fragments of the translation of the Bible, made in this dialect by Bishop Ulphilas in the fourth century.\n\n\u00a7 A specimen of this, in the form which it had assumed by the ninth century, is preserved in the poem (or metrical version of the Gospels) called the Helland (i.e. Saviour).\n3. The Keltic languages, divided into the Kymric branch (Welsh, Cornish, and the Armorican of Brittany), and the Gaelic or Gadhelic branch (Erse, Gaelic, and Manx).\n\n4. The Greek-Latin group, comprising ancient Greek (with its descendant Romaic, or modern Greek), and the Latin and other dialects of Italy, with the Romance languages descended from them\u2014Italian, French, Spanish and Portuguese, Romansch and Wallachian.\n\nSome authorities class the Keltic and Italic dialects together, as branches of a common stock.\n\nIt thus appears that English belongs to the Low German branch of the Teutonic stock. It is most akin to the ancient Moeso-Gothic and Old Saxon, and to the modern Frisian.\n\nThe inhabitants of Gaul and Britain, when those countries were invaded by the Romans, were of Keltic race, and spoke various dialects of the Keltic group of languages.\n\nThe conquered Gauls adopted the Latin language, and the Franks and Normans, who at a later time established themselves in the country, adopted the language of the people they conquered. Thus it has come about that French is for the most part a corrupted form of Latin, belonging to that group of languages which is called 'Romance.'\n\nThe Keltic inhabitants of Britain did not adopt the Latin language, but retained their own Keltic dialects. One of these is still spoken by the Keltic inhabitants of Wales.\n\nEnglish is the language brought into England by the Saxons and Angles, who in the fifth century conquered and dispossessed the British or Keltic inhabitants, and drove the remnants of them into the remote mountainous corners of the island, especially Wales, Cornwall (which was called West Wales), and Strathclyde (comprising Cumberland, Westmoreland, and the Western Lowlands of Scotland). They were a Teutonic race, coming from the Lowland region in the north-western part of Germany. The name Angle appears to have belonged at first only to one division of these Teutonic invaders; but in course of time, though long before the Norman Conquest, it was extended over the rest, and the entire body of the Teutonic inhabitants of our country called themselves and their language English, and their country Englan (Angle-land). In speaking of themselves they also, at least for a time, employed the compound term Anglo-Saxon. English thus became the predominant language in our\n\n---\n\n*That the inhabitants of Wessex, Sussex, Middlesex, and Essex called themselves Angles before they came to this island, and that Saxons was not their own proper name, but one applied to them by their Welsh neighbours and enemies, and only adopted by themselves as a kind of alias, is rather hard to believe. It would be extraordinary that Romans, Franks, and Welshmen should all have agreed in calling them Saxons, if they did not call themselves so. The divisions of the tribes certainly called themselves West Saxons, South Saxons, East Saxons, and Middle Saxons respectively as soon as they settled down in England, which argues that they called themselves Saxons as a whole. It should be noted that when Bede enumerates the descendants of the Angles in England, he excludes the inhabitants of the Saxon area. If Bede's authority is invoked to show that Angle and Saxon were alternative names, it should be remembered that it; his Latin sive and vel signify and.*\nisland from the Firth of Forth * to the English Channel, and has continued so far more than thirteen centuries. During this time it has, of course, undergone many changes. It has adopted many new words from other languages, and its forms have been altered to some extent; but it has lasted in unbroken continuity from its introduction until now.\n\nModern English is only a somewhat altered form of the language which was brought into England by the Saxons and Angles, and which in its early form, before the changes consequent upon the Norman Conquest, is commonly called Anglo-Saxon. The grammatical framework of Modern English is still purely Anglo-Saxon.\n\nAs regards its form, Anglo-Saxon (or old English) differed from modern English in this respect, that it had a much greater number of grammatical inflexions. Thus nouns had five cases, and there were different declensions (as in Latin); adjectives were declined, and had three genders; pronouns had more forms, and some had a dual number as well as a singular and plural; the verbs had more variety in their personal terminations. The greater part of these inflexions were dropped in the course of the three centuries following the Norman Conquest,\u2020 the grammatical functions of several of them being now served by separate words, such as prepositions and auxiliary verbs. This change is what is meant when it is said that Anglo-Saxon (or ancient English) was an inflexional language, and that modern English is an analytical language.\n\nThe greater part of the foreign words that have been incorporated into English, and are now part and parcel of the language, may be divided into the following classes:\n\n1. Words of Keltic origin.\u2014The Anglo-Saxons adopted a few Keltic words from such Britons as they kept among them as slaves or wives. These words consist chiefly of geographical names, such as Avon, Don, Usk, Exe, Ouse, Pen (in Penith, Penzance), Mendip, Wight, Kent, &c.; and words relating to common household matters, such as kiln, crook, clout, darn, gruel, matlock, mop, rug, wive, &c. As the Gauls were of Keltic race, Keltic words naturally made their appearance in French, and some were thus introduced into our language not directly from the Britons, but through the medium of Norman-French (such, for example, as basket, button, gown, wicket, bran, steam).\n\n2. Words of Scandinavian origin.\u2014Men of Scandinavian race (Picts, Norsemen, and Danes) made repeated incursions into this island during several centuries, and established themselves in force in East Anglia, Northumbria, Cumberland and Westmoreland, and part of Mercia. In consequence of this a good many Scandinavian words made their way into common use, and Danish or Scandinavian forms appear in many names of places in the districts occupied by the Scandinavian invaders, such as by ('town,' as in Grimsby); Scaw ('wood,' as in Scawfell); force ('waterfall,' as Stockgill Force); holm.\n\n* Lowland Scotch is a genuine Anglican dialect, and has kept closer to the Teutonic type than modern English. Early Scotch writers (as Barbour and Dunbar) expressly call their language 'English.'\n\n\u2020 In the Northern dialect this change began much earlier, and was accelerated by the Danish (or Norse) incursions and settlements. By the end of the thirteenth century this dialect had become as uninflectional as modern English.\n('island,' as in Langholm); *ness* ('headland,' as in Furness); *ey* ('island,' as in Orkney); *b\u00e6k* ('brook,' as in Troutbeck), &c. The influx of the Scandinavian element produced on the northern dialects the same sort of effect that the Norman-French element did on the southern dialects; it accelerated the weakening and disuse of the inflexions, and introduced some fresh elements into the language.\n\n3. Words of Latin origin, and Greek Words introduced through Latin.\u2014Of these we have now immense numbers in English, the words of classical origin being considerably more than twice as numerous as those of Teutonic origin, there being, according to some authorities, about 29,000 of the former, to about 13,000 of the latter. These words came in at various periods, and under various circumstances.\n\na. A few Latin words, connected with names of places, were adopted by the Britons from the Romans, and by the Angles and Saxons from the Britons, and appear, for example, in Chester (*castra*), Gloucester, Stratford (*strata*), Lincoln (*colonia*), Fossbury (*fossae*).\n\nb. A good many words of classical origin were introduced between the settlement of the Saxons and the Norman Conquest by the ecclesiastics who brought Christianity into England. These words are mostly ecclesiastical terms, and names of social institutions and natural objects previously unknown to the English. These words came direct from Latin, or from Greek through Latin.\n\nc. A much larger number of words of Latin origin came to us through Norman-French, the acquired language of the Norman conquerors of England. After the Conquest this was of course the language of the Norman nobles and their retainers throughout England.\u2020 To a more limited (though still considerable) extent it had been introduced as the language of the court of Edward the Confessor. Most of the words in our language which relate to feudal institutions, to war, law, and the chase, were introduced in this way. The terms employed in science, art, and the higher literary culture are, to a large extent, of the same origin. Not that Anglo-Saxon had not such terms, but they belonged to the *literary*, and not to the ordinary spoken language. After the Conquest Norman-French became the literary language, because literature continued to be cultivated only among the dominant class. English thus lost its old literary vocabulary, which became forgotten, and had to be replaced from Norman-French. But the words of ordinary life were used as freely and vigorously as ever by the mass of the native population. An important change, however, in the English language was at least accelerated, if not first commenced, by the influence of the Norman-French, which was established side by side with it. Of the two races which made up the population, Normans and Englishmen, each had enough to do to learn the vocabulary of the other, without troubling themselves with an alien system of inflexions. Thus the numerous grammatical inflexions of the older English came to be first levelled\u2021 in a great many cases to a monotonous and meaningless -e, and finally lost altogether. In the course of the three centuries that followed the Conquest they were reduced to little more than their present number.\n\nd. The revival of the study of the classical languages in the sixteenth\n\n---\n\n* Beware of the mistake of saying that these words were introduced into English by the Romans.\n\u2020 Though William himself tried to learn English, and sometimes used it in public documents.\n\u2021 For this convenient and expressive term we are indebted to Mr. H. Sweet.\ncentury led to the introduction of an immense number of Latin and Greek words, which were taken direct from the original languages. Many of these importations have since been discarded. It often happens that the same classical word has given rise to two words in English, one coming to us through Norman-French, the other taken direct from Latin. In such cases, the former is the shorter and more corrupted form. Compare, for example, hotel and hospital, reason and rational, poison and potion.\n\n4. Words of Miscellaneous origin.\u2014The extensive intercourse maintained during the last three hundred years with all parts of the world naturally led to the introduction of words from most languages of importance, relating to natural productions, works of art, or social institutions, with which this intercourse first made us acquainted.\n\nThus it has come about that the two chief constituents of modern English are Anglo-Saxon and Latin, mixed with a small proportion of words of miscellaneous origin. Most of the Teutonic elements of English were introduced by the Saxons and Angles. A good many also came in with the Danes and Norsemen (for the Scandinavian races are of the Teutonic stock), and a few more passed from the Norsemen into Norman-French, and so found their way into English.\n\nAs a general rule (admitting, of course, of numerous exceptions) it will be found that words relating to common natural objects, to home life, to agriculture, and to common trades and processes, are usually of Teutonic origin. Words relating to the higher functions of social life\u2014religion, law, government, and war, to the less obvious processes of the mind, and to matters connected with art, science, and philosophy, are commonly of classical and mostly of Latin origin. Most words of three or more syllables, and a large number of those of two, are of classical origin. The Teutonic element prevails (though very far from exclusively) in words of one or two syllables, and is by far the most forcible and expressive. Hence it predominates in all our finest poetry. It is impossible to write a single sentence without Teutonic elements, but sentence after sentence may be found in Shakspeare and the English Bible, which is pure English, in the strictest sense of that term.\n\nOne great advantage which English has derived from the mingling of the Teutonic and Romance elements is the great richness of its vocabulary, and its power of expressing delicate shades of difference in the signification of words by the use of pairs of words, of which one is Teutonic and the other French.*\n\nThe changes by which Anglo-Saxon (or the oldest English) became modern English were gradual, and no exact date can be given for the introduction of this or that particular alteration. Still the process was influenced or accelerated at certain points by political events. The Norman Conquest, and the political relations between the conquering and the conquered race, naturally made Norman-French the language of the court and the nobles, of the courts of justice, of the episcopal sees, and of garrisoned places. But the loss of Normandy in 1206, the enactments of Henry III. and Louis IX., that the subjects of the one crown should not hold lands in the territory of the other, and the political movements under John and Henry III., stopped the further influx of the Norman element. At the same time the absolutist tendencies of the kings drove the nobles into closer union with the Anglo-Saxon elements\n\n* Compare, for example, feeling and sentiment, work and labour, bloom and flower. The number of pairs of exactly synonymous words is small.\nof the nation; and the French wars of Edward III. roused an anti-French feeling among all classes, which extended itself even to the language, insomuch that we learn from Chaucer, that in his time French was spoken in England but rarely, and in a corrupted form. In 1362 appeared the edict of Edward III. that legal proceedings in the royal courts should be conducted in English, though French continued for sixty years longer to be the language of Parliament, and for yet another sixty years to be the language of the laws.\n\nKoch divides the historical development of English into five periods, in the following manner:\n\nFirst Period, that of old Anglo-Saxon.* This period extends from the time of the oldest literary monuments to about A.D. 1100. The language was divided into two groups of dialects, the Northern or Anglian, and the Southern or Saxon. The Northern speech (that of Northumbria) was the first to become a cultivated literary language, but there are few remains of it in its earliest form. Under the ravages of the Danes the literature perished.\n\nOn the rise of the kingdom of Wessex to supremacy the Southern, or (more strictly) the West-Saxon dialect became the standard literary language. It is in this that the bulk of the works usually called Anglo-Saxon are written. It was not an imported form of speech, but simply the cultivated form of the dialect of the district.\u2020 It did not oust the other dialects from use in oral speech, even when used for literary purposes beyond the Saxon area. In the latter part of the period the levelling (see p. 4) of the inflexions had already commenced.\n\nSecond Period, that of late Anglo-Saxon. This period extends over about 150 years, to the middle of the thirteenth century, and shows marks of the influence of the Danish and Norman settlements in disturbing the older system of inflexions, obliterating many of its distinctions, and so preparing the way for the still greater simplification which followed. In the latter part of the period Norman-French words begin to be incorporated in the language.\n\nThird Period, termed by Koch Old English. This period, which extends over some 100 years, from about 1250 till about 1350, exhibits a continued weakening of the old forms, spoken sounds and their written representatives being both in an unsettled state, and the influence of Norman-French being distinctly traceable.\n\nThe Norman Conquest displaced the Southern dialect from its literary supremacy. In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries three dialects, or groups of dialects, held equal rank. These were\u2014\n\n1. The Northern dialect, which prevailed on the East of the Pennine range from the Humber to the Firth of Forth. In the course of time this dialect received a somewhat special development in Lowland Scotch. It was by much the earliest to exhibit the levelling and loss of its inflexions.\n\n2. The Southern dialect, spoken south of the Thames and in Gloucestershire and parts of Herefordshire and Worcestershire.\n\n* Our forefathers (or some of them) called themselves for a time Anglo-Saxons. It is disputed whether this term denoted a people made up of the Angles and the Saxons, or the Saxons of England, as contrasted with the Old Saxons of the Continent. There is a similar ambiguity in the term as applied by modern writers to the language. It may be held to include the scanty remains that we have of the old Northumbrian dialect, though practically what is called Anglo-Saxon is the old South Saxon speech.\n\n\u2020 It was called Englisc by those who wrote it, perhaps (as Mr. Earle suggests) because the first cultivated book-speech was Englisc, i.e. Anglian.\n3. The Midland dialect,* which prevailed in the intervening districts.\u2020\n\nFourth Period, called by Koch Middle English, reaching to near the end of the fifteenth century. The great feature of this period is the establishment of the East Midland dialect, through the influence of Wycliffe and Chaucer, as the standard literary language of England generally. This dialect also extended its area as the language of common life, especially in the eastern part of the Southern area.\u2021\n\nFifth Period, that of Modern English.\u00a7\n\nLeaving the vocabulary of the language out of consideration, it may be stated summarily that English has preserved from its Anglo-Saxon stage the suffixes that it still possesses in nouns and pronouns; the conjugation of its verbs; the articles, pronouns, prepositions, conjunctions, and numerals; the comparative and superlative suffixes of adjectives, and the formation of adverbs; the flexibility and variety which it has in the formation of compounds; the most important part of the suffixes and prefixes by which derivatives are formed; the predominant principles of accentuation; and the compactness and straightforwardness of the syntactical arrangement of its periods. To French we owe a considerable modification of the sounds of the language, the suppression of the sound of l before other consonants, such as j, v, k, m, &c.; the softening or disuse of the hard, guttural sounds of h and gh, the change of hard c into ch, and the use of e mute at the end of words;\n\n* One characteristic point of difference between the three dialects was, that all three persons of the plural of the present tense ended in -es in the Northern (at least when the personal pronouns did not come immediately before them), in -en in the Midland, and in -eth in the Southern. Also in the Imperative plural the Northern had -es, the Midland and Southern -eth. The Northern dialect had dropped the personal suffixes in the past tense. The Imperfect Participle ended in -and in the Northern and in -inde or -ynde in the Southern. In the Perfect Participle the Northern dropped the prefix ge-. In many cases initial f was preferred to sh (sal, suld for shal, shulde). We find k for ch (bink for bench, hirk for chiricle); at for that, thir for thise, at and til for to in the infinitive mood. The Northern dialect was the most tenacious of the old sounds of the language, the Southern dialect was most tenacious of the old inflexions. The latter preferred the flat sounds of z and v to the sharp sounds of s and f, and the broad vowels o and u to a and i.\n\n\u2020 The dialects of Cumberland, Westmoreland, and Lancashire are classed by Dr. Morris in the West Midland, by M\u00e4tzner in the Northern group. These districts belonged at first to Cumbria and Strathclyde. It seems natural to suppose that the Northern part of the district, at any rate, owed most, both in population and in language, to Northumbria, to which it was contiguous. Moreover, Norsemen settled in force in part of the district. It is to Dr. Morris that we are indebted for the first thorough and systematic discrimination of these dialects.\n\n\u2021 Hence Puttenham, towards the end of the sixteenth century, describes this speech, then prevalent in London and the home counties, as 'Southern English,' the old Southern dialect maintaining its ground in the Western counties; and so he describes the dialects of England as Northern, Southern, and Western, instead of Northern, Midland, and Southern.\n\n\u00a7 The above subdivision is, perhaps, more elaborate than is necessary. There is no break of any consequence between the Third and Fourth Periods. No new principle of change begins to operate. We simply have in the Fourth Period a still further development, on exactly the same lines, of what was going on in the Third. There is no epoch at the dividing line of these two periods comparable to those formed by the Norman Conquest, which preceded the Third Period, and the invention of printing and the revival of letters, which ushered in the latest period. It would be simpler and quite sufficient to divide English, in its historical aspect, into three periods\u2014the first (Old English or Anglo-Saxon) embracing Koch's first two periods; the second (Middle or Transition English) comprising Koch's third and fourth periods; and the third (Modern English) coinciding with Koch's fifth period. Mr. Sweet (who however does not divide the periods at quite the same points as Koch, though the difference is not great) characterizes these three cardinal divisions as the Period of Full Inflections, the Period of Levelling Inflections, and the Period of Lost Inflections. Each period has naturally an earlier and a later stage. The names First Period, Second Period, &c., are very bald and unsuggestive.\nthe introduction of the sibilant sounds of j, g, ch and c; the use of the letter z, and the consonantal sound of v, and a great deal of change and confusion in the vowel sounds. French influence assisted in the recognition of s as the general sign of the plural in nouns. To French we also owe a considerable number of the suffixes and prefixes by which derivatives are formed, and are probably indebted for our deliverance from that stiff and involved arrangement of sentences under which modern German still labours. (M\u00e4tzner.)\nENGLISH GRAMMAR.\n\nINTRODUCTION.\n\n1. Speech or language is the expression of thought by words.\n\n2. Grammar (from the Greek gramma, 'letter') is the science that treats of speech or language. English Grammar is that portion of the science which treats of the speech of the English people.\n\n3. Words are significant combinations of sounds. These sounds are represented to the eye by marks or symbols called letters (Latin litera), the whole collection of which is called the Alphabet (from alpha, beta, the names of the first two letters of the Greek Alphabet). The right mode of uttering the sounds that make up a word is called Orthoepy (from the Greek orthos, 'right,' and epos, 'spoken word'). The right mode of representing the sounds that make up a word by letters is called Orthography (from the Greek orthos, 'right,' and grapho, 'I write').\n\n4. A sentence (Latin sententia, 'thought') is a collection of words of such kinds and arranged in such a manner as to express some complete thought. Words are of different sorts according to the purpose which they serve in a sentence.\n\nThus, in the sentence \"The little bird flies swiftly through the air,\" bird is the name of something that we speak about; the points out which bird is meant; little describes the bird; flies states what the bird does; swiftly denotes the manner in which the bird does this; through shows how the action of the bird is related to the air.\n\nThe different sorts of words are called Parts of Speech.\n\n5. Etymology (from Greek etymos 'true,' and logos 'word' or\nENGLISH GRAMMAR.\n\n'statement') is that part of grammar which treats of words separately. Syntax (Greek syn 'together,' and taxis 'arrangement') is that part of grammar which treats of the way in which words are combined in sentences.\n\nTHE ALPHABET.\n\n6. The English alphabet consists now of twenty-six letters, each of which is written in two forms, the large letters being called Capitals, or Capital Letters*:\n\nA, a : B, b : C, c : D, d : E, e : F, f : G, g : H, h : I, i : J, j :\nK, k : L, l : M, m : N, n : O, o : P, p : Q, q : R, r : S, s : T, t :\nU, u : V, v : W, w : X, x : Y, y : Z, z.\n\n7. The English alphabet is the ordinary Roman alphabet, with the addition of the letter w. The old English (Anglo-Saxon) alphabet had no j, q,\u2020 v, or z, and contained two symbols which have since been discarded, namely, \u00f0 (eth) and \u00fe (thorn), which both stood for th.\u00a7 Instead of w the symbol \u00fe (wen) was used. Also for a time, in the Transition Period of English, the sign \u021d was used for a sound like g or a guttural y.\n\nVOWELS.\n\n8. The letters a, e, i, o, u are called Vowels (Latin vocalis, \"that can be sounded\"). They can be sounded by themselves, with a continuous passage of the breath. The remaining letters are called Consonants (Lat. con 'together,' sonans 'sounding'). They either stop (partially or completely), or else set free the passage of the breath by which vowels are sounded. They therefore have a vowel either before or after them.\u00a7\n\n9. There are thirteen simple vowel sounds in English; the sounds of a in fall, father, fate, fat; the sounds of e in met and mete; the sound of i in pin; the sounds of o in not and note; the sounds of u in rule, pull, fur, and but. Of these sounds some are long, some short.\n\nThe primary vowel sounds are \u026a (as in pin), \u0251\u0301 (as in far), and \u028a\u0301 (as\n\n* Capital letters are used at the beginning of proper names, for the nominative case singular of the personal pronouns of the first person, and for any noun, adjective, or pronoun, used in speaking of the Divine Being. They may also be used at the beginning of a common noun, when it is used in a special or technical sense, as Mood, Voice, Person, the Solicitor-General, the Lord Chief Justice, and at the beginning of a noun, or an adjective and a noun, denoting something specially important. Adjectives derived from proper nouns are also written with capitals. We also write His Majesty, Her Majesty, &c. The first word of a sentence and of a line of poetry must begin with a capital.\n\n\u2020 The very name of q is French,\u2014queue = 'the tailed letter.'\n\n\u2021 Both \u00f0 and \u00fe are probably modined forms of d, \u00fe being a D which has had the backstroke lengthened both ways. In the oldest English there seems to have been no difference of sound between them. Some MSS. use \u00f0 in all cases, others \u00fe. When the sound of th in thing became different from that of th in the, \u00f0 was appropriated to the latter. The \u021d in the old-fashioned way of writing 'the' (\u021dr or ye) is a corruption of \u00fe.\n\n\u00a7 \"A vowel is the result of an open position of the organs of speech, a consonant is the result of an opening action of the organs of speech\" (Metiville Bell).\nin full); all others are lengthenings, combinations, or modifications of these.*\n\n10. When two dissimilar vowel sounds are uttered without a break between them, we get a vocal or sonant diphthong (Greek dis 'twice,' and phthonge 'sound'). There are four of them:\n\n1. i, as in bite, made up of the a in far and the e in mete.\n2. ot, as in hoist, also written oy (boy) and uoy (bouy), made up of the sound of a in full and e in mete.\n3. eu, as in eulogy, also expressed in writing by u (mute), ew or ewe (few, ewe), eau (beauty), ui (suit), ue (hue), yu (yule).\n4. ou, as in noun. This is also expressed in writing by ow (now).\n\nWhen two of the letters called vowels are used to represent a simple vowel sound, we get an improper diphthong or digraph.\n\n11. The letters w and y are commonly called semi-vowels. When they are followed by a vowel sound in the same syllable, their sound approaches that of a consonant, as in win, twin, you, yonder. They form a connecting link between vowels and consonants. When a vowel precedes them in the same syllable they combine with it to form either a diphthong or a simple vowel sound; as awe, how, dray, bey, buy. Y is a pure vowel whenever it is followed by a consonant (as in Yttria). It was always a pure vowel in Anglo-Saxon.\n\n12. All the vowel sounds are produced by the unimpeded passage of the breath, when modified by the glottis into voice, through the tube of the mouth, which is made to assume different shapes by altering the form and position of the tongue and the lips.\n\nCONSONANTS.\n\n13. Consonants or voice-checks are divisible into two chief classes:\u2014A. Consonants which only partially stop the current of the breath, allowing it still to escape either past the tongue, or through the nostrils. These consonants have been termed by different writers continuous, spirant (i.e. breathing), or fricative (the breath, as it were, rubbing past).\n\nThe continuous consonants are subdivided into\u2014\n\n1. The Liquids (or flowing sounds) l, m, n, r. Of these m and n are nasal sounds, the breath escaping through the nose. Closely allied to n is the distinct nasal sound ng.\n\n2. The Sibilants (or hissing sounds). These are\u2014\n\na. Simple:\u2014s; z (as in zeal); sh; zh (in azure).\nb. Compound:\u2014ch (in chest), equivalent to tsh; j (in jest) or soft g (in gentle), equivalent to dzh. X is merely a double letter = ks (in next), or gx (in exact).\n\n3. The Lisping sounds, th (in thin) and th (in this).\n\n4. The Labials (or lip letters) f and v.\u2020\n\nB. Consonants which wholly stop the passage of the breath. These\n\n* On observing the position of the organs of speech it will be found that a (= ah) is midway between i (= ee) and u (= oo). If, without stopping the voice, a is made to pass into u, the sound of o intervenes; if it is made to pass into i, the sound of a (in fate) intervenes.\n\n\u2020 F, v, and th are sometimes classed among the mutes and called aspirates; but it would be better to discard the name. The sounds are perfectly simple, they are not really made by blending the sound of h with those of p, b, t and d.\nare commonly called Mutes.* They are p, b, t, d, k (or hard c), g. They are sometimes described as momentary, or explosive.\u2020\n\nLabials, Dentals, and Gutturals.\n\n14. All the consonants (or voice-checks), whether continuous or momentary, may be arranged in groups according to the organ of speech which is chiefly brought into action in forming them. These groups are\u2014\n\n1. Labials (Latin labium 'lip') formed with the lips:\u2014p, b, f, v, m. With these may be classed the semi-vowel w.\n\n2. Dentals (Lat. dens 'tooth'), or Palatals (Lat. palatum 'palate') formed by different sorts of contact between the tongue and the palate:\u2014t, d, th, the trills l and r, the nasal n, and all the sibilants.\n\n3. Gutturals (Lat. guttur 'throat') formed at the root of the tongue or the top of the throat:\u2014k (or hard c), hard g and the nasal ng. H was a guttural letter in Anglo-Saxon, something like ch in the Scotch loch.\u00a7 It now forms a division by itself, being a simple impulse of the breath, and yet not a vowel. It is called an Aspirate (Lat. ad 'at', spirare 'to breathe'). To the gutturals is allied the semi-vowel y.\n\nHard (or Sharp) Consonants and Soft (or Flat) Consonants.\n\n15. In pronouncing p, t, or k, it will be felt that the muscles which adjust the organs of speech are in a state of sharper tension than when b, d, or g is sounded. The former consonants have a hard or sharp sound, the latter a soft or dull sound.\n\nTo the class of Hard \u00a7 or Sharp Consonants (or Hard Checks) belong p, t, k (or hard c), f, th (in thin), s, sh, ch.\n\nTo the class of Soft \u00a7 or Flat Consonants (or Soft Checks) belong b, d, hard g, v, th (in this), z (in zeal), z (in azure), j or soft g.\n\n16. Assimilation.\u2014When a hard and a soft consonant come together,\n\n* Do not confound the Mutes with mute letters such as e in fate, or p in psalm.\n\u2020 This term is more fanciful than correct. It is the breath, not the stoppage of it, that explodes.\n\u2021 The guttural sounds of ch and gh do not now belong to English; ch (hard) is sounded as k, and gh is silent, or sounded as f.\n\u00a7 Instead of the contrasted terms Hard and Soft, or Sharp and Flat, the older grammars (especially those for Latin and Greek) give us the terms thin and middle (the soft consonants being regarded as half-way between the thin and the aspirate mutes). Later writers use the terms surd and sonant, or breathed and voiced (which mean much the same as surd and sonant). The terms breathed and voiced are becoming very usual with writers on Phonetics. 'Breath' becomes 'Voice' when the vocal chords are stretched and set in vibration. Now if we adjust the organs of speech for one of the soft consonants (say b), it is possible to make a sort of sound in the mouth without opening the lips; but if we adjust the organs of speech for a hard consonant (as p), it is impossible to convert the breath in the mouth into voice without breaking the contact by which the consonant is formed, and letting the breath out. Hence p is called a breathed consonant, and b a voiced consonant. These terms, however, are open to the objection that they 'put the cart before the horse.' A consonant like b does not get its peculiar quality as contrasted with p by forming voice in the mouth, it must have its peculiar quality by the adjustment of the organs before voice can be produced. The two classes of consonants would be better described as tense and lax. If the terms sharp and flat are employed, it must be kept in mind that they involve no reference to a difference of pitch.\nthe one gets assimilated to the other. Hence tricked is sounded as trickt, and the soft sound of the plural s or es acts upon the f of calf or swift, and produces the forms calves, wives. So the sharp s of house is softened in houses. (Not, however, in horses, &c.)\n\n17. A syllable (Greek syllabe, 'a taking together') is a single vowel, or a group of letters containing only one vowel sound.\n\nA word which consists of a single syllable is called a Monosyllable (Greek monos, 'single'), such as man, horse, hut.\n\nA word of two syllables is called a Disyllable, as folly, learning.\n\nA word of three syllables is called a Trisyllable, as loveliness.\n\nA word that consists of more than three syllables is called a Poly-\nsyllable (Greek polys, 'many'), as singularity.\n\n18. When a syllable beginning with a vowel is added to a monosyl-\nlable or a word accented on the last syllable, ending in a single\nconsonant preceded by a single vowel, the final consonant is doubled:\nAs sin, sinner; sit, sitting; expel, expelled; confer, conferred. But if\nthe accent does not fall on the last syllable, the final consonant is not\ndoubled; as offer, offered; differ, different; visit, visiting. The letters\nl and s, however, are generally doubled, as travel, traveller; hocus,\nhocuspious. There are also some other words in which the rule is\nviolated, as worshipper. The reason for this doubling of the con-\nsonant is that the quantity or length of the preceding vowel may be\npreserved. A doubled consonant usually shows that the preceding\nvowel is short. Compare running and tuning, sinning and dining,\nmanning and waning. Before ll and ss, a and o are often long, as in\nroll, stroll, squall, fall, gross, grass, &c.\n\nWhen a syllable (not beginning with i) is added to a word ending in\ny preceded by a consonant, the y is changed into i, as happy, happily,\nhappier; pity, pitiless. When the final y is preceded by a vowel it\nis not changed, as buy, buyer. When ing is added after ie, the i\nis changed into y; as die, dying; lie, lying. For the sake of distinc-\ntion dye makes dyeing. Long y is not changed before a consonant, as\ndryness.\n\nMute e after a single consonant usually shows that the preceding\nvowel is long: compare shin and shine, ban and bane. It is generally\nomitted when a syllable that begins with a vowel is added; as force,\nforcible, and sometimes when the added syllable begins with a con-\nsonant as in truly, duly; but it is retained if it is required to preserve\nthe pronunciation of the consonant, as in change, changeable. It is\nalways put after final v.\n\n19. Words must be divided into syllables according to the way in\nwhich the component sounds are grouped together in speaking. Thus\nwe must write fa-ting, not fuc-ing; de-cent, not dec-ent. But when it\nis possible, the syllables should correspond to the significant parts of\nwhich the word is made up, as in trans-port, in-spect.\n\nANOMALIES OF THE ENGLISH LETTER SYSTEM.\n\n20. A. The same letters are used to represent different\nsounds.\n\n1. The letter A represents five simple vowel sounds, as in fate, fall,\nfar, fat, want.\nThe letter E represents five simple vowel sounds, as in ni\u00e9te, p\u00e9t, herd, clerk, pretty.\n\nThe letter I represents two simple vowel sounds, as in pit (long in marine) and fir; and one diphthongal sound as in bite.\n\nThe letter O represents three simple vowel sounds, as in poke, pot, for.\n\nThe letter U represents four simple vowel sounds, as in rude, pull, fun, fur.\n\nCompare also au in aunt, saunter; ai in laid, said, aisle; ea in great, beat, breast, heart, earth; ei in neigh, sleight, receive; ey in prey, eye; ie in belief, friend; oa in coat, broad; oe in shoe, doe; oo in tool, door, flood; ou in scour, pour, journal, through; ow in tow, cow.\n\nC is hard (= k) before a, o, and u (can, cob, cut); but soft (= s) before e, i, and y (cell, city, Cyprus).\n\nCH is hard (= k) in ache, mechanics, but generally soft (= toh), as in much, child, &c. Like sh in a few words taken from French, as machine.\n\nThe soft sound of ch is due to the influence of Norman-French.\n\nG is hard before a, o, and u (gave, go, gun), soft before e (gem), and before i and y in words not of Teutonic origin (gin, gypsy); but hard in gill (of a fish), give, gill, &c., and in Gertrude, Geddes.\n\nThe hard sound of g is often maintained by putting u after it, as guile, guild, guest.\n\nTH has both a hard and a soft sound (thin, this).\n\nGH is sometimes mute (as in though), sometimes sounded like f (laugh).\n\nB. The same sounds are represented in different ways.\n\n1. Compare the following words in sound and spelling:\n\nFate, braid, say, great, neigh, prey, gaol, gauge.\nFall, for, fraud, claw, broad, ought.\nFar, clerk, aunt, heart.\nMete, meet, meat, people, chief, receive,* quay, key, aether, Phoebus, marine.\nPet, many, said, says, bury, tread, friend, heifer, Leonard.\nHerd, bird, cut, earth.\nPit, pretty, sieve, busy, build, syllable, surfeit.\nBite, thy, eye, height, dies, buy, aisle.\nPoke, coat, toe, soul, tow, sew, owe, door.\nPot, what.\nRude, rood, flew, blue, fruit, through, shoe.\nFull, good.\nFun, love, does, flood, rough.\n\n2. Compare the consonantal signs in find, Philip, laugh:\n\nSent, cent, cinder, mercy, scent, base, face.\nZeal, pans, reserve, Xenophon, addr, adze.\nSuch, crutch,\u2020 nature.\nShun, tension, nation patrician, sugar.\nAzure, vision, occasion.\n\n* It is convenient to bear in mind that with the exception of the words seize and ceiling, ei with the sound of ee is found only in words derived from the Latin capio as deceit (decipio), receipt (recipio), conceit (concipio), &c.\n\n\u2020 T before ch, and d before g in the same syllable are often inserted merely to show that the following consonant is to be sounded as a sibilant.\nINTRODUCTION.\n\nJest, gentle, adage, bridge, judgment.\nKeep, cat, cot, cut, mock, quench, ache, mechanics.\nGave, guile, ghost.\n\nC. Simple sounds are sometimes expressed by two letters,\nas in cauld, priest, and words containing the other improper diphthongs\n(or digraphs). So also ck = k, ch = k (sometimes).\n\nComplex sounds are sometimes expressed by single letters,\nas by i and u in mine and pure, by j in just, g in gentle.\n\nLetters are often written but not pronounced, as in know,\nbenign, through; walk, and the numerous examples of mute e* (bane,\ntuneful, &c.).\n\nHard c, q, x, and perhaps w and y are superfluous letters; their\nsounds may be represented by other letters.\n\nIf we include w and y as separate sounds, and the nasal ng, we shall\nhave forty-one elementary sounds in English. Wh is pro-\nnounced like hw, and is not a separate simple sound.\n\n21. The anomalies that exist in English spelling have arisen chiefly from the\ncircumstance that great changes have taken place in the pronunciation of words,\nwhile the changes in the written language have not kept pace with the changes\nin pronunciation. In its Anglo-Saxon stage our language was free from these\nanomalies. The mixture of Norman-French with English disturbed the\npronunciation greatly. We owe to it the sound of j, the soft sounds of c and\ng, and the introduction of z and qu. Initial f in Anglo-Saxon was sounded\nlike v. The softening of ti, or of tu before r, into ch or sh (as in question,\nnation, nature) occurs only in Romance words, as is also the case with di or\ndu in soldier and verdure.\n\n22. In Anglo-Saxon long i was sounded like ee in seen, never as in pine;\n\u0113 was sounded like \u0101 in fate, never like ee; \u0101 as in father, never as in fate,\nthe sound of a in bat being denoted by \u00e6; \u016b and \u016b were sounded as in rule\nand full, the sound of \u0101 in but not being used. The letter o represented\neither \u014d, as in bone, or \u014d as in on, never a u sound as in son or soon.\n\nAs regards the consonants, c and g were always hard. The sibilants sh, z\nas in azure, ch and j did not exist. The aspirate h had a more guttural sound\nthan in modern English. The weakening of this sound was due to the\ninfluence of Norman-French, and led to the introduction of g before it, to\npreserve the guttural pronunciation (as night for niht, might for miht). But\nthe guttural sound died out all the same, and gh came to be regarded as little\nmore than a sign that the preceding i must be sounded long. Hence it was\ninserted even in words that had no claim to a guttural of any kind,\u2020 as in\nsprightly (compare sprite). The passing of the guttural gh into the sound of\nf is interesting. It was once more common than now; e.g., daughter was\npronounced dafter (like laughter).\n\n* In many cases mute e makes its appearance not because it has been put in to show that\nthe preceding vowel is long, but because, having been once itself syllabic, it has been made\nmute owing to the lengthening of the previous vowel; thus n\u0101ma became n\u0101me and then\nname.\n\n\u2020 Spenser even uses whight (= white) and spight (= spite). See Earle's Philology of\nthe English Tongue, p. 126. In More's Utopia, hanghty is spelt hawte. It is from the\nFrench hautain.\n23. **Emphasis** is the utterance of one word in a sentence with more force than the rest to give prominence to the idea which it conveys.\n\n**Accent** is a stress laid upon one syllable of a word of two or more syllables, as *tender*, *misery*, *indecent*. Words of several syllables may have two or even three accented syllables, as *d\u00e9mocratique*, *litt\u00e9ral*.\n\nIn English two systems of accentuation have been at work, the Teutonic or genuine English, and the French. The characteristic tendency of Teutonic accentuation is to throw the stress upon the root-syllable of a word, and leave the inflexions and formative syllables unaccented, as *love*, *lover*, *loveliness*. In French the accentuation naturally, in the first instance, followed that of Latin, which was not etymological but rhythmical, so that the accent often shifted its position with an alteration in the number of the syllables, falling on the penult (or last syllable but one) if it was long, or on the ante-penult (or last syllable but two) if the penult was short. Hence in old French *pastor* became *p\u00e2tre*, *pastorem* became *pasteur*. The omission of final syllables of inflexion in French often left the accent on the last syllable, even when that was not the root-syllable. Thus *vir:itum* became *virtu*; *civitatem* cit\u00e9.\n\nWhen such words first passed from French into English they naturally had their French accent, as *distance*, *contr\u00e9e* (country), *man\u00e8re* (manner); *soldice*, &c. In Spenser we still find *progres*, *succoir*, *usdige*, *bondage*, &c. Most of these adopted words, however, have been affected by the English accentuation, which tends to keep the accent away from the last syllable. In words of French or Latin origin, and of more than two syllables, there is a tendency to throw the accent back on to the ante-penult, as in *monopoly*, *geography*. Thus we now say *advertisement* (not *advertisment*), *th\u00e9atre* (not *theatre*), &c. French derivatives ending in *ade*, *-ier* or *-eer*, *-ee*, *-oon*, *-ine* or *-in*, keep the accent on the last syllable. So also do adjectives which are seemingly taken from Latin with the simple rejection of the final syllable, as *benign*, *robust*, *humane*, *polite*. The natural weight of the syllable has of course to be taken into account. Compare, for example, *concentrate* and *remonstrate*; *cosmogony* and *declension*, *b\u00e9n\u00e9ficient* and *b\u00e9n\u00e9factor*. There is also a tendency to accentuate the root-syllable of the definitive word in a compound, as *all\u00e9gory*, *m\u00e9lancholy*. Words which have been adopted without alteration from foreign languages keep their original accent, as *torp\u00e9do*, *cor\u00f4na*, *octavo*.\n\nThe influence of accent upon the etymological changes of words has been very important. When one syllable is made prominent, those adjacent to it, especially if short and unimportant in themselves, are pronounced carelessly, and frequently get dropped altogether. Thus we get *bishop* from *episcopus*, *receive* from *gerefa*, *sample* from *example*. English has thus lost most of its syllabic suffixes.\n\nWhen this loss takes place at the beginning of a word, it is called by grammarians *aphaeresis*, i.e., 'taking away,' as in *squadron* from *escadron*; *story* from *histoire*; *stranger* from *\u00e9tranger* (*\u00e9tranger*); *Spain* from *Hispania* or *Espagne*; *van* from *avant*; when it occurs at the end of a word\n\n---\n\n* In compounds in which the component parts preserve a syntactical relation to each other, the accent falls as it would if the words were kept separate, as *ill-will*, *ill-fortune*, *split-fleece*, *indeed*, *forsooth*, &c. Nouns compounded with adverbial particles have the accent on the particle, as *offshoot*, *uproar*. Verbs have it on the verbal root, as *out-do*, *with-sit-and*.\nETYMOLOGY.\n\n24. Etymology is that division of grammar which deals with separate words. It treats of their classification into the groups called Parts of Speech, of the changes of form which they undergo to mark differences in their signification or in their grammatical relations, and of the mode in which they are formed out of their constituent elements. This involves a reference to the connection which exists between words and forms in different languages which are related to each other.\n\nPARTS OF SPEECH.\n\n25. Words are distributed into the following eight classes, called Parts of Speech:\n\n1. Noun-Substantive\u2020 (usually called Noun).\n2. Noun-Adjective\u2020 (usually called Adjective).\n3. Pronoun.\n4. Verb.\n5. Adverb.\n6. Preposition.\n7. Conjunction.\n8. Interjection.\n\n* Aristotle recognized four Parts of Speech, Nouns (including Adjectives), Verbs (or Predicates), Conjunctions (including apparently Prepositions and Adverbs), and Articles, or Joints (the Pronouns and the Definite Article). The Alexandrian grammarians made eight divisions, Noun, Verb, Participle, Article, Pronoun, Preposition, Adverb, and Conjunction. The Roman grammarians treated the Participle as belonging to the Verb, and dropped the Article (Latin having no Definite Article), but they divided the Noun into Substantive and Adjective, and added the Interjection, so as still to keep the mystic number eight.\n\n\u2020 The Adjective was originally identical with the Noun, which in the infancy of language named objects by naming some attribute by which they were marked. In course of time the Adjective was developed into a separate Part of Speech, the function of which was to attach itself to the Noun. Even now it is difficult to draw the line between them, as Nouns are sometimes used attributively, and Adjectives pass by various stages into Nouns. Still the functions of the two sorts of words are now, in the main, so different that it is more convenient to treat them as two Parts of Speech, than as subdivisions of one. The extension of the term Noun so as to include the Adjective is of no practical value except to explain the term Pronoun; and the term Substantive, as the equivalent of Noun-Substantive, is objectionable, because some Pronouns are Substantives. Moreover the terms Noun and Adjective are now so familiarly used for the older Noun-Substantive and Noun-Adjective, that a good deal of confusion would result from interfering with the general custom, which will accordingly be followed in this work in all ordinary cases.\nThe definitions of these several Parts of Speech will be found in the sections which treat of them respectively.\n\nThese parts of speech have not at all times been equally essential elements of language. They do not stand upon the same level, some being primary, others secondary.\n\nThe cardinal elements of every sentence * are the Subject and the Predicate (see \u00a7\u00a7 344, 376). For the expression of these we get the primary Parts of Speech, namely, the Substantive (Noun and Pronoun) and the Verb.\n\nIn the next rank come the Adjective, which limits or modifies the Substantive, and the Adverb, which limits or modifies the Verb.\n\nThe adverb, in course of time, was developed into the Preposition and the Conjunction.\n\nAdverbs, Prepositions, and Conjunctions were originally for the most part nothing more than Cases of Nouns and Pronouns, which being restricted in practice to particular uses, hardened into separate Parts of Speech.\n\n**NOTIONAL AND RELATIONAL WORDS.**\n\n26. Words are divisible into Notional Words and Relational Words.\n\nNotional Words are those which present to the mind a distinct conception of some thing, or of some action or attribute of a thing. To this class belong Nouns, Qualitative Adjectives, and Verbs.\n\nRelational Words bring things before our minds, not by naming or describing them, but by indicating their relations to other things. The most important words of this class are the Substantive Pronouns, and the Quantitative and Pronominal Adjectives. Thus Thou or He brings a person before the mind by indicating his relation to Me.\n\nAdverbs are partly notional (as wisely, brightly), partly relational (as now, thus, whence). Prepositions and Conjunctions are only relational, the former with respect to things, the latter with respect to thoughts.\n\nIt thus appears that Substantives and Adjectives admit of the following classification:\n\nSubstantives \\( \\{ \\)\n1. Notional (Nouns).\n2. Relational (Substantive Pronouns).\n\nAdjectives \\( \\{ \\)\n1. Notional (Qualitative Adjectives).\n2. Relational (Quantitative and Pronominal Adjectives).\n\nBoth Verbs and Adjectives express notions of the actions and attributes of things. Verbs assert the connection of the thing and its action or attribute; Adjectives assume this connection. To borrow a metaphor from Mechanics, the Verb is a Dynamic Attributive, the Adjective is a Static Attributive.\n\n**IMPERFECT SEPARATION OF THE PARTS OF SPEECH IN ENGLISH.**\n\n27. In English the same word (that is to say, the same combination\n\n---\n\n* That is as regards languages of so advanced a type as the Aryan. There are forms of language (Polynesian) which have not advanced so far as to have a verb.\n\n\u2020 Beginners must beware of the mistake of supposing that any and every substantive word (such as he, who, that, &c.) may be called a noun.\nof letters) often belongs to more than one Part of Speech.* Thus iron is a noun in 'A piece of iron,' an adjective in 'An iron tool,' and a verb in 'The laundresses iron the shirts'; early is an adjective in 'The early rose,' an adverb in 'He came early.' \u2020\n\nIt will be shown in the Syntax how the functions of nouns, adjectives, and adverbs are often sustained by combinations of words forming clauses or phrases; but only a single word can properly be said to be a noun, adjective, or adverb.\n\n**INFLEXION.**\n\n28. Inflexion (Latin inflectere, 'to bend') is a change made in the form of a word either to mark some modification of the notion which the word stands for, or to show the relation of the word to some other word in the sentence.\n\nInflexion is now of two kinds.\n\n1. Some inflexions consist in the addition of certain letters to a word, as book, books; pant, panted. What is thus added is called a suffix (Latin suffixus, 'fixed on'). These suffixes were once significant words, but gradually lost their full form and meaning.\n\n2. Some inflexions (in certain verbs) consist in a change in the vowel sound, caused by first doubling a root syllable, and then blending the two sounds together, as in fight, fought; find, found.\n\n3. The addition of a suffix often caused the vowel of a preceding syllable to be weakened (compare nation and national, vain and vanity). This change often remained when the suffix was lost, as in man, men; feed, fed. What we thus get is only a spurious inflexion.\n\nNouns and Pronouns are inflected to mark Gender, Number, and Case. Inflexion for Case (singular and plural) is called Declension. Adjectives and Adverbs are inflected to mark degree. This inflexion is called Comparison.\n\nVerbs are inflected to mark Mood, Tense, Number, and Person. This inflexion is called Conjugation.\n\nPrepositions, Conjunctions, and Interjections, are not inflected. That portion of a word which it has in common with other words that relate to the same notion, is called the Root.\n\nThe Stem (or Crude Form) of an inflected word is that portion of the word upon which the inflexions are based.\u2020\n\n* This is mainly due to the fact that in English roots stripped of inflexions often do duty for words. A root-word like love is not in itself either noun or verb, and may be used as either. But the same freedom does not exist in the case of words like wisdom, blithesome, strengthen, in which roots have been differentiated into Parts of Speech by means of formative elements.\n\n\u2020 All this shows how much of the meaning which we attach to words we hear or read is left unexpressed by the actual words, and is put in by our own intelligence as guided by the context.\n\n\u2021 The stem of a word should properly consist of the root modified by some suffix or letter-change into a noun or verb; and on this stem the grammatical inflexions would be based. Thus in Latin the root am is made into the verb-stem amo, and the noun-stem amor. In English digger and ditch are both stems formed from the root dig. But in modern English, in a great number of instances, stems have been so worn down that they no longer drop roots.\nSome writers of authority restrict the term Inflexion to those changes which constitute Declension and Conjugation.\n\n**NOUN.**\n\n29. The word **Noun** means **name** (Latin *nomen*). A noun is a word used as the name of something.\n\n**CLASSIFICATION OF NOUNS.**\n\n30. Nouns are divided into two principal classes:\u2014\n\n1. **Common Nouns.**\n2. **Proper Nouns.**\n\nI.\u2014COMMON NOUNS.\n\n31. A **common noun** (Latin *communis*, 'shared by several') is a word that is the name of each thing out of a class of things of the same kind, as *horse*, *stone*, *city*, or of any portion of a quantity of stuff of the same sort, as *wheat*, *iron*, *water*.\n\nA common noun is so called because the name belongs *in common* to all the individual things in the class, or to all the portions into which the whole quantity of stuff may be divided.\n\nA common noun distinguishes what belongs to some class or sort from everything which does not belong to it. Thus the name *horse* distinguishes that animal from all other sorts of things, but does not distinguish one horse from another.\n\n32. Common Nouns are subdivided into:\u2014\n\n1. **Ordinary Class Names.**\n2. **Collective Nouns.**\n3. **Abstract Nouns.**\n\nAn **Ordinary Class Name** is one that belongs to each individual of a class, or to each portion of some sort of material, as *horse*, *tree*, *water*, *marble*. Names of materials are used in the plural when different sorts of the material are spoken of, as 'teas,' 'sugars,' &c.\n\nA **Collective Noun** is one which in the singular stands for one collection of several individual things, as *herd*, *multitude*. In the plural it stands for several such collections.\n\nAn **Abstract Noun** is the name of a quality, action, or state, as *hardness*, *running*, *growth*, *sleep*. As Arts and Sciences are in fact processes of thought and action, their names are **Abstract Nouns**, as *astronomy*, *logic*, *grammar*.\n\n33. Abstract nouns are derived from adjectives (as *hardness* from *hard*),\n\n---\n\n* See Note on \u00a7 25, p. 17\nfrom verbs (as *growth* from *grow*), or from nouns that denote a function or state (as *priesthood* from *priest*, *widowhood* from *widow*). The infinitive mood is often used as an abstract noun.\n\nThat which is denoted by an Abstract Noun has no independent existence, but is only thought of by itself, the quality being 'drawn off' (Latin *abstractus*) in thought from that to which it belongs.\n\nAn abstract noun is a common noun, because it stands for every instance of the quality or action that it denotes.\n\nAbstract nouns are sometimes used in the concrete sense, that is, standing for that which possesses the quality which they denote. Thus *nobility* frequently means the whole body of persons of noble birth; *youth*, the whole class of young people. Compare the double sense of *witness*, *relation*, *painting*, *sculpture*, *nature*, *vision*, &c.\n\nThere is a class of nouns which are sometimes confounded with abstract nouns, and which in reality do not differ from them very widely. These are Significant (or Connotative) General Names, such as *Space*, *Time*, &c.\n\n34. Common nouns are significant. They not only denote, or mark out, the objects to which they are applied, but also connote, or note at the same time, the whole combination of marks or attributes, through their possession of which the various individuals named by the common noun are grouped into one class.\n\nII.\u2014PROPER NOUNS.\n\n35. A Proper Noun is a word used as the name of some particular person, animal, place, or thing, as *John*, *London*, *Bucephalus*, *Excalibur*. The word proper (Latin *proprius*) means own. A proper name is a person's or thing's own name.\n\nProper nouns are written with a capital letter at the beginning.\n\n36. Proper nouns, as such, are not now significant. Even if the name, considered merely as a word, has a meaning, it is not applied to the object which it denotes in consequence of that meaning. *Margaret* means *pearl*, but it is not implied that a person called *Margaret* has pearly qualities. Many proper names, however, such as *Snowdon*, *Blackwater*, *Newcastle*, were at first descriptive, as was in fact also the case with names of persons, which, if not actually descriptive, had a prophetic or optative character.\n\n37. Proper nouns are sometimes used like common nouns, when they denote classes or collections of persons grouped together because they resemble each other in certain attributes that marked some individual, as if we say of a poet, 'He was the Homer of his age,' or of a strong man, that he is 'a Hercules,' or speak of 'the Howards,' meaning philanthropists like Howard.\n\nWhen a proper name belongs to several persons, it may be used in the plural, but is still a proper name, as 'the Georges,' 'the Caesars.'\n\nINFLEXIONS OF NOUNS.\n\n38. Nouns are inflected to mark Gender, Number, and Case, though these distinctions are not always marked by inflexion.\n39. Living beings are divided into two classes or sexes, the male sex and the female* sex, the individuals in the one sex corresponding to those in the other. Things without life are not of either sex. Thus all things are arranged in three classes\u2014things of the male sex, things of the female sex, and things of neither sex.\n\n40. In like manner, nouns are divided into three\u2020 classes or sorts called Genders, which correspond to the three classes of things just mentioned. These are the Masculine Gender, the Feminine Gender, and the Neuter Gender. Gender comes from the Latin genus, 'a kind or sort.'\n\nThe name of anything of the male sex is called a masculine noun, or a noun of the masculine gender (Latin masculinus, 'belonging to a male').\n\nThe name of anything of the female sex is called a feminine noun, or a noun of the feminine gender (Latin femininus, 'belonging to a female').\n\nThe name of anything of neither sex is called a neuter noun, or a noun of the neuter gender\u2021 (Latin neuter, 'neither').\n\nMan, king, father, horse, cock, bull, James, are masculine nouns. Woman, mother, mare, hen, cow, Mary, Jane, are feminine nouns. Stone, tree, house, London, are neuter nouns.\n\nIn the case of animals and young children we often take no account of the sex, but refer to them by means of neuter pronouns.\n\n41. The names of animals sometimes do not indicate their sex,\u00a7 as sheep, bird, hawk, bear, mouse, raven, swan, dove. Also various names of persons, as parent, spouse, servant, &c. Such nouns are said\n\n* The word female is not connected etymologically with male. Male is a contraction of masculus. Female is a corruption of femella, a diminutive of femina, assimilated in form to male through confusion.\n\n\u2020 Nothing is gained either in convenience or in philosophy by the attempt to restrict the term gender to the masculine and the feminine. Those who run the term neuter so hard as this should be consistent, and translate it into neither when they use it. To talk of nouns being of Neuter Gender (especially with a capital N) is not good Latin, good English, or good sense. German grammarians, who have the terms m\u00e4nnlich, weiblich, and s\u00e4chlich, are spared the temptation to air this little crotchet. In inflected languages such as Latin, Greek, and German, the neuter gender has its own distinctive marks, and is not indicated merely by the absence of the marks for masculine and feminine.\n\n\u2021 It is only in modern English, however, that this simple classification is observed. In Latin, Greek, French, and other languages, the names of many things which do not belong either to the male or to the female sex, are either masculine or feminine. When this is the case, gender ceases to answer (except partially) to any natural distinction, and becomes merely grammatical, though originally, no doubt, based upon a real, or fancied, natural distinction. A noun is known to be masculine (or feminine), not by its denoting a thing of the male (or female) sex, but by its having associated with it adjectives and pronouns with masculine (or feminine) terminations. This arbitrary, or merely grammatical gender has disappeared from modern English. In Anglo-Saxon, the genders were to a great extent merely grammatical or arbitrary, as in Latin. Even wolf (woman) was neuter.\n\n\u00a7 But in poetry, fables, or lively narratives, animals are treated as male or female, even when the name is of common gender, with a general tendency to consider the larger and fiercer animals as male, and the gentler and more timid as female.\nto be of common or undetermined gender.* Some masculine nouns (as horse, dog), and some feminine (as duck, goose), are often used to denote either sex.\n\n42. Things without life are often personified, or spoken of as if they were living beings of the male or female sex. Accordingly masculine and feminine pronouns are used in speaking of them.\n\nThus the Sun,\u2020 Time, Day, Death, rivers, winds, mountains, the ocean, the seasons, the stronger passions (as Fear, Anger, Despair), actions connected with strength or violence (as Murder, War, &c.), are spoken of as male persons.\n\nThe Moon, the Earth, Virtue, Night, a ship, countries and cities\u2014such as Europe, England, Paris\u2014Night, Darkness, the Arts and Sciences, most abstract conceptions, as Nature, Liberty, Charity, Victory, Mercy, Religion, &c., the Soul, the gentler emotions, &c., are spoken of as female persons.\u2021\n\n43. Sex is a distinction between things, not between names. Gender is a distinction between names, not between things. It is therefore wrong to speak of the masculine sex or the male gender; to speak of a man as a masculine being, or to talk of things being of the masculine or feminine gender. Things may be of the male or female sex, but only words can be of the masculine, feminine, or neuter gender.\n\nMODES OF DENOTING GENDER.\n\n44. The sex of living beings is indicated in three ways\u2014\n\nFirst Mode.\u2014Quite different words are used,\u00a7 as:\u2014\n\n| Masculine | Feminine | Masculine | Feminine |\n|-----------|----------|-----------|----------|\n| Bachelor  | maid or spinster | Horse     | mare     |\n| Boar      | sow      | Husband   | wife     |\n| Boy       | girl     | King      | queen    |\n| Broth     | sister   | Lord      | lady     |\n| Buck      | doe      | Man       | woman    |\n| Bull      | cow      | Miller    | spawner  |\n| Bullock or steer | heifer | Monk or friar | nun |\n| Cock      | hen      | Nephew    | niece    |\n| Colt or foal | filly | Papa     | mamma   |\n| Dog       | bitch    | Ram or wether | ewe |\n| Drake     | duck     | Sir       | madam    |\n| Drone     | bee      | Sire      | dame or dam |||\n| Father    | mother   | Son       | daughter |\n| Gander    | goose    | Stag      | hind     |\n| Gentleman | lady     | Uncle     | aunt     |\n| Hart      | roe or hind | Wizard | witch |\n\n* But if there is anything to show the sex of the person denoted by the noun, the noun is treated as being masculine or feminine accordingly, and a masculine or feminine pronoun is used to replace it. Such a plural as parents is of necessity common. These nouns are usually of Romance origin.\n\n\u2020 In Anglo-Saxon (as in German) 'sun' was feminine.\n\n\u2021 Strictly speaking this does not constitute grammatical gender. There is nothing in the form of the words to show for which sex they stand.\n\n|| Grandam (grandam or granny) answers to grand sire. Sire and dam, in contrast with each other, are applied only to animals.\nMan (like the German Mensch) was formerly used of the female as well as of the male. We see this in the compound woman, a modified form of winman\u2014i.e., wifman. The vowel sound of the first syllable is still preserved in the plural, women.\n\nMaid,* in Chaucer's time was applied to a grown-up person of either sex. Thus, 'I wot well that the apostle was a maid.' Girl (a diminutive of the Low German g\u00f6r) once denoted a young person of either sex.\u2020\n\nFather \u2021 means 'one who feeds;' from the same root as fee-d and fa-t (compare pa-ter and pa-sco). Mother is from a root ma\u2014'bring forth' (Morris). Daughter (Gr. \u03b8\u03c5\u03b3\u03ac\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1) meant originally 'milk-maid.' The root is the same as in dug. Brother signifies 'one who bears or supports' (Fick, Vergl. W\u00f6rterb. vii. 204).\n\nHusband (A.S. h\u00fasbonda) is the manager or master of the house (Mitzner). In A.S. buan means 'to inhabit, or cultivate.'\n\nIn husbandman and husbandry we have vestiges of the old meaning. In Anglo-Saxon wif (neuter) meant simply a woman.\n\nNephew and niece come to us (through French) from the Latin nepos (nepot-is) and neptis. The older Anglo-Saxon words were nefja and neje. Uncle and aunt are from avunculus and amita. The provincial and colloquial appellations gaffer and gammer are corruptions of godfather and godmother.\n\nQueen (or quean) meant simply female or mother. In Anglo-Saxon cwyn-fygel means hen-bird.\n\nLord is a shortened form of hl\u00e1ford (i.e., hl\u00e1feward, 'loaf-warden,' or 'bread-dispenser' (Mitzner and K\u00f6ch). Lady (hl\u00e1fildige) is from the same word hl\u00e1f, but the meaning of the second part is uncertain. Some connect it with the Gothic verb digan or deigan, 'to knead' (Skeat, Et. Dict.). Sir or sire is from senior; madam from mea-domina; monk from monachus, 'one who leads a solitary life'; nun = nonna, 'grandmother.' Friar is from frater (Fr. fr\u00e8re).\n\nWitch is now only feminine, but it might come indifferently from the Anglo-Saxon masculine \u00a7 wicca, or from the feminine wice. Wizard comes from the Scandinavian viskr, 'wise,' through the old French guiscart, and means 'a very wise man' (Mitzner). See 'Etymology: Adjective Suffixes.'\n\nDrake (old Norse andriki; root and = Lat. anat; riki, connected with German reich, and Latin reg-em) means 'king of the ducks.' Duck is connected with the verb duck, 'to dive.' In Anglo-Saxon we find a masculine hana, 'cock' (Germ. Hahn). Goose has lost the letter n (Germ. Gans). Gander is formed from the feminine, d being only an offgrowth of the n. Goose is often used as a masculine, especially as a descriptive epithet, as 'Tom is a goose.' Geese is of common gender.\n\nBee is now of common gender, but was originally feminine.\n\n45. Second Mode\u2014Inflexion.\u2014Gender is indicated by the termination of the word.\n\n*Maid is a short form of maideu, a diminutive of maiged, from 'm\u00e6g' 'a growing youth,' i. 'm\u00e6ge' (root mag) Skeat, Et. Dict. s. v.\n\n\u2020Thus Chaucer (Prol. 664) \"The yonge gurles of the diocese.\" In Piers Plowman, i. 29, Lot's sons are spoken of as 'gerles that were charles.'\n\n\u2021Or (according to other authorities) 'the defender,' 'he who guards the flock' (Fick, Vergl. W\u00f6rterb. i. 132).\n\n\u00a7\"He is such a holy witch, that he enchants societies unto him.\"\u2014(Shaksp. Cymb i. 7.)\nA. Different suffixes are used for the masculine and the feminine.\n\n| Masculine       | Feminine      |\n|-----------------|---------------|\n| Murderer        | murderess     |\n| Caterer         | cateress      |\n| Governor        | governess     |\n| Emperor         | empress       |\n| Sorcerer        | sorceress     |\n\nThe termination -er (in Anglo-Saxon -ere) is a true English suffix. The corresponding feminine suffix was -ster (A.S. -estre) as m. b\u00e6cere, f. b\u00e6cestre (baker); m. hopere (dancer), f. hoppestre. Spinster still preserves the feminine force of the suffix. Many words in -ster now used as masculine (or common), or as proper names, once denoted occupations carried on by women, as maltster, tapster ('barmaid'), Baxter (from bake), Webster (from webban 'to weave'), &c. Seamstress and songstress are double feminines. The suffix -er has now ceased to be exclusively masculine.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon -a was a masculine suffix and -e a feminine suffix, as nefa, nefe (nephew, niece), webba (male weaver), webbe (female weaver).\n\nB. The feminine is formed from the masculine by feminine suffixes.\n\n1. The commonest of these, and the only one by which fresh feminines can be formed is -ess, as count, countess; mayor, mayoress.\n\nThis termination came to us through French, from the Latin suffix issa. (Compare Gr. \u1f21\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1 and \u1f21\u03c3\u03c3\u03b1)\n\nWhen this suffix is added to the masculine terminations or and er, the vowel is usually omitted, as in actor, actress; hunter, huntress. The masculines author, mayor, prior, and tutor, suffer no abbreviation. The o of negro and the y of votary are dropped (negress, votaress).\n\nAbbess (from abbot) is a shortened form of abbades. Lass is probably from laddess. Duchess follows the French form duchesse. In mistress the a of master is modified through the influence of the suffix (See \u00a7 28).\n\n2. One word, vixen, the feminine of fox, preserves the old Teutonic feminine suffix, en or in (compare German inn), the root vowel of the masculine being modified (\u00a7 28). (Compare German Fuchs, F\u00fcchsin.) In oldest English we find such feminines as gyden, 'goddess;' cen, 'nun' (from munec); elfen, 'female elf,' &c. So in Scotch, we have carlin, 'old woman.'\n\nThe suffixes -trix (as in testatrix), -ine (as in heroine), -a (as in sultana), -ina (as in czarina), do not belong to English grammar, but are foreign importations.\n\nWidower is perhaps a masculine formed from a feminine, or -er may represent the A.S. suffix a (masc. widuwa, fem. widuwe). Bridegroom is merely a compound noun, groom * = goom = guma, 'man' (Anglo-Saxon).\n\n* The r of bride has dragged in the other r after it. So cartouche has become cartridge, corporal has become corporal.\n46. Third Mode.\u2014Masculine and feminine nouns or pronouns are prefixed or affixed to nouns of common gender.\n\n| Masculine          | Feminine         | Masculine          | Feminine         |\n|--------------------|------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Man-servant        | maid-servant     | Dog-fox            | bitch-fox        |\n| Man-singer         | woman-singer     | He-goat            | she-goat         |\n| He-devil           | she-devil        | Pea-cock           | pea-hen          |\n| Boar-pig           | sow-pig          | Guinea-cock        | guinea-hen       |\n| Buck-rabbit        | doe-rabbit       | Turkey-cock        | turkey-hen       |\n| Bull-calf          | cow-calf         | Roebuck            |                  |\n| Cock-sparrow       | hen-sparrow      |                    |                  |\n\nSometimes, proper names are used to answer this purpose, as in jack-ass, jenny-ass; tom-cat, tib-cat; billy-goat, nanny-goat; jackdaw. In Anglo-Saxon, carl and owen were used, as carlfugel (cock-fowl), owen-fugel (hen-fowl).\n\nNUMBER.\n\n47. Number is a variation in form which shows whether we are speaking of one thing or of more than one.\n\n48. There are now* two numbers in English, the Singular and the Plural. The Singular Number of a noun is that form of it which is used when we speak of one of the things for which the noun stands, as ship, horse, herd. The Plural Number of a noun is that form of it which is used when we speak of more than one of that for which the noun stands, as ships, horses, herds.\n\nAs it is simpler to think and speak of one thing than of several things at once, the singular is the original form of the noun.\n\nMODES OF FORMING THE PLURAL.\n\n49. First Mode.\u2014By adding the syllable es shortened to s whenever the pronunciation admits of it. The full syllable es is now added only when the singular ends in a sibilant (s, sh, soft ch, x or z), as gas, gases; lash, lashes; witch, witches; box, boxes; topaz, topazes.\u2020\n\nWords like horse, horses really come under this rule.\n\nThe letters es are also added (but without being sounded as a separate syllable) after several\u2021 words ending in o, as hero, heroes; potato, potatoes; in the word alkalies; after y when it is preceded by a con-\n\n* Formerly our language had a dual number, in the personal pronouns used in speaking of two persons. The dual is probably older than the plural, and took its rise at a time when our primitive forefathers could not count beyond two.\n\n\u2020 Though we write -es, it is sounded like -is or -ys, which we find in Wycliffe and in the Scotch dialect, and sometimes in Chaucer. Plurals like woundes, handes, are not uncommon in Spenser.\n\n\u2021 The usage in the case of words ending in o is arbitrary, and by no means uniform, es being commonly added. But s only is added to words ending in io and oo, and to the following words:\u2014domino, virtuoso, tyro, quarto, octavo, duodecimo, mosquilo, canto, grotto, solo, rondo.\nsonant, the y being changed to i, as lady, ladies*; and after words of Anglo-Saxon origin ending in lf or f preceded by any long vowel sound except oo. In these cases the flat sound which s always has in es affects the preceding consonant, and f is changed to v, as elf, elves; shelf, shelves; leaf, leaves; thief, thieves; loof, loaves. Wife and knife get f changed to v in a similar way\u2014wives, knives. Nouns ending in oof, ff, and rf, and nouns in t of Norman-French origin, retain the hard sound of the f, which causes the s to take the hard sound, as roof, roofs; cliff, cliffs; dwarf, dwarfs; chief, chiefs. So also reef, rife, and strife. Beef, beves; and staff, staves, are exceptions in modern English Wharves, turves, scarves are found in the older writers.\n\n50. All nouns except those above mentioned, and the few nouns which form their plurals in the second and third modes hereafter specified, have their plurals formed by the addition of s only, as book; books; father, fathers; the s having its sharp sound after a sharp mute (as in books, cats, traps), and its flat sound (z) after a flat mute, a liquid, or a vowel\u2020 (as in tubs, eggs, pails, rams, fleas). When y at the end of a word is preceded by a vowel, s is added to form the plural, and the y is not changed, as valley, valleys; boy, boys. Qu counts as a consonant; hence soliloquy, soliloquies.\n\n51. The plural suffix -es is a modification of the Anglo-Saxon plural suffix -as. The latter, however, was only one of several modes of forming the plural, and was used only for masculine nouns. The influence of Norman-French caused the general adoption of -es or -s as the plural suffix of all kinds of nouns. The usage first became prevalent in the Northern dialect.\n\n51a. The plurals of proper names, and of words belonging to other parts of speech used as substantives, are formed by most writers in the ordinary way (as 'the Smiths,' 'the Percies,' ayes, noes, extras), by some by the addition of 's ('the Percy's,' the pro's and con's, &c.).\n\n52. Second Mode.\u2014By adding en, as ox, oxen; cow, kine;\u2020 brother, brethren\u2021; child, children.\u00a7 Formerly more common.\n\n53. Third Mode.\u2014By changing the vowel sound|| of the word, as tooth, teeth; mouse, mice; foot, feet; goose, geese; man, men (see \u00a7 28).\n\nThe second and third modes of forming the plural are restricted to a few nouns of Anglo-Saxon origin.\n\n* In words of this kind it is more accurate to say that ie has been changed in the singular into y; as the old English way of spelling the words in the singular was ladie, glorie, &c. In proper names some writers retain the y in the plural.\n\n\u2020 In Chaucer nouns of Romance origin often have a plural in z, as heraldz (Kn. T. 1741), vestimentz (Kn. T. 2000).\n\n\u2021 These words are double plurals, kine being formed from cy (Scotch kye), the old Anglo-Saxon plural; children from childer (A.S. cidru), still used as a provincial form; brethren from brether, the plural form in the Northern dialect. In A.S. the plural was brothru, or cen (= eyes) in Scott and Byron. Assen, treen, been, fon (= foes), also occur in old writers. The Southern dialect was more tenacious of these plurals than the Northern.\n\n|| Originally there was nothing distinctively plural in the change of vowel. The forms men, hit, brether were used in the dative singular in A.S.\n54. Fourth Mode.\u2014By leaving the singular unchanged, as sheep, deer, grouse, fish, head (as in \"ten head of cattle\"), yoke, year, pound. Most of these words were neuter in A.S. and had no plural suffix.\n\n55. The plural is often the same as the singular in nouns expressing quantity or number, as \"The stone weighs ten hundred-weight\"; \"He shot five brace of birds\"; \"Ten gross of buttons\"; \"He weighs eleven stone\"; \"Three dozen knives\"; \"Two pair of boots\"; Four score years\"; \"Thirty fathom\"; \"Ten mile\" (Shaksp.). Month, winter, night, shilling, mark formerly had the plural like the singular. We still say \"a twelvemonth\"; \"a fortnight.\" Compare \"a three-foot rule\"; \"a five-pound note\"; \"a three-penny book.\"\n\nHouse and foot (for horse-soldiers and foot-soldiers), shot, cannon, like fish, fowl, people, are collective nouns.\n\nPlurals of foreign words.\u2014These generally retain their own proper plurals. Thus\u2014\n\n(1.) In Latin words\n\nNouns in us (masculine) form the plural in i, as focus, foci;\nus (neuter) era, as genus, genera.\num a, as datum, data.\na se, as formula, formulae.\nix or ex ices, as radix, radices.\nies ies, as series.\n\n(2.) In Greek words\n\nNouns in on form the plural in a, as phenomenon, phenomena,\nsis ses, as crisis, crises; basis, bases.\nma mata, as miasma, miasmata.\n\n(3.) Cherub and seraph (Heb.) make cherubim and seraphim; bandit makes banditti; beau (Fr.), beaux; madame, mesdames; mister (i.e., master), messieurs; virtuoso (Ital.), virtuosi.\n\n56. If a foreign word has passed into common use, the plural may be formed in the English fashion, as cherubs, bandits, dogmas.\n\n57. Double Plurals.\u2014Some nouns have two plurals, which differ in meaning, as:\u2014\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Brother | brothers (by birth) | brethren (of a community) |\n| Cloth | cloths (kinds of cloth) | clothes (garments) |\n| Die | dies (for coining) | dice (for play) |\n| Fish | fishes (regarded separately) | fish (collective) |\n| Genius | geniuses (men of talent) | genii (spirits) |\n| Index | indexes (tables of contents) | indices (in Algebra) |\n| Pea | peas (regarded separately) | pease (collective) |\n| Penny | pennies (separate coins) | pence (sum of money) |\n| Shot | shots (discharges) | shot (balls) |\n\n* Also the names of several sorts of fish, as cod, salmon, trout, pike, &c. Others, as shark, whale, herring, eel, turbot, &c., form plurals as usual.\n\n\u2020 Shots means discharges, not missiles.\n\n\u2021 So animalculum, pl. animalcula; effluvium, effluvia; arcanum, arcana; addenda; errata; strata.\n\n\u00a7 The singular pea has been made out of the collective word pease, mistaken for plural and then the plural peas has been made from pea.\n58. Plurals used as singulars.\u2014\n1. Words in -tes from Greek adjectives, as mathematics.*\n2. Certain words, as means, amends, wages, pains, are usually preceded by a singular demonstrative (this, that) and by much or little (not many, or few), but may be followed by a verb in the plural, as 'Means were found,' 'Pains were taken,' 'Wages have risen.' News is now\u2020 always singular. Small-pox (sing. pock, dimin. pocket) is a plural in origin. Gallows is used as singular.\n\n59. Plurals in appearance.\u2014\nRiches (Fr. richesse, and so in Chaucer), alms (A.S. \u00e6lmesse, from \u1f00\u03bb\u03b7\u03b8\u03b5\u03af\u03b1), eaves (A.S. efese), summons (old French semonse) are not plurals, but have been mistaken for such.\n\n60. Nouns used only in the Plural.\u2014Names of things which are double or multiform are used only in the plural, as\u2014\n1. Instruments or articles of dress made double, as scissors, tongs, breeches, drawers.\n2. Portions of the body, certain diseases, games, ceremonies, &c., usually regarded as aggregates of a number of parts, as entrails, measles, billiards, nuptials, matins, ashes, stocks.\n\n61. Many plurals have a secondary signification which does not belong to the singular, as compasses, matins, vespers, pains, corns, effects (property), grounds, (dregs), respects, parts (capacity), stocks, spectacles, letters (literature), draughts, returns, gripes, grains, lists, lights, returns, shrouds (of a ship), vapours (ill humour), &c. Hangings, leavings, sweepings, &c., denote the product of the action denoted by the singular. Sometimes the singular denotes a substance, the plural things made of it, as leads, sands, silks, coppers, irons.\n\n62. Abstract nouns and names of materials may be used in the plural to denote different instances or varieties of the quality or substance referred to, as affinities, negligences, sugars, wines.\n\nIt is (strictly speaking) incorrect to use a plural of the word folk, as it is a noun of multitude, and in the singular stands for several persons. We should write 'folk say,' not 'folks say.' Still the plural use is of long standing.\n\n63. Plurals of Compound Nouns.\u2014Compounds of a noun and an attributive word or phrase, in which the parts are not fused together into a single word, annex the plural inflexion to the noun, as courts-martials, fathers-in-law. Similar compounds of two nouns inflect both parts, as knights-templars, men-servants. Compounds in which the fusion of the two parts is complete have the s at the end, as handfuls, rosetrees, &c.\n\n* Some have supposed that the different use of the singular logic and the plural mathematics, &c., has arisen from the fact that in the former we have adopted the Greek singular \u1f21 \u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (\u03c4\u03b5\u03c7\u03bd\u03ae), and in the latter the neuter plural \u03c4\u1f70 \u03bc\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac. This explanation of the use of the singular is, of course, correct, but as applied to the plural it is far-fetched and unnecessary. It is doubtful whether the first man who spoke of having the rheumatics thought he was representing the plural \u03c4\u1f70 \u1fe5\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac. When adjectives are converted into substantives, it is the tendency of our language to use the plural form. A man talks of having the rheumatics, just as in country districts they talk of having the dumps or the dismals, \"Let them die that age and stills have.\" (Shakspeare, R. II. ii. i.) English freely allows the use of adjectives as substantives, provided the plural be employed, as establis, valuables, greens, sweets.\n\n\u2020 In Shakspeare \"These ill news\" (Much Ado II. i. 180); \"The amazing news of Charles at once were spread\" (Dryden).\nIt is usual to say 'The Miss Smiths,' not 'The Misses Smith.'* The latter is correct, but is considered pedantic.\n\nCASE.\n\n64. Things stand in various relations to other things and to their actions and attributes. Nouns have corresponding relations to nouns, verbs, and adjectives. These relations are marked by making nouns assume different forms, called Cases.\n\n65. Definition.\u2014Case is the form\u2020 in which a noun (or pronoun) is used, in order to show the relation in which it stands to some other word in the sentence.\n\n66. The relations of things which were first marked in language were probably their simple relations in space\u2014motion from, motion to, and rest in. These were the ideas originally expressed by the genitive, the accusative, and the dative respectively.\u2021 By analogy these cases were extended in meaning, so as to include other less obvious relations, and when they were found insufficient, additional forms (or cases) were invented. In the Indo-European languages we find at various stages seven cases (excluding the Vocative, which is not properly a case at all,\u00a7 since it does not bring the noun into grammatical relation to any other word), the Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Locative, Accusative, Ablative, and Instrumental. The somewhat vague import of the different cases, arising out of their wide application, led to the use of prepositions, by which definiteness was given to the vague sense conveyed by the case itself (see the section on 'Prepositions' further on), and the use of prepositions in its turn rendered some of the cases\n\n* So in Shakspeare 'Three Doctor Faustuses' (Merry W., IV. 5, 71). 'One of the Miss Flamboroughs' (Goldsmith). \"Miss-Smith\" must be regarded as a compound name. If there is no definite article, we must have the plural Misses, as \"Misses Jane and Mary Smith.\" So also we say \"The Mr. Smiths,\" but \"Messieurs John and George Smith.\"\n\n\u2020 Some writers have misunderstood the term 'Case' (Latin casus) as meaning 'state' or 'condition.' This is quite wrong. Casus was the Latin translation of the Greek word \u03c0\u03c4\u03c9\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, which means 'falling.' This word was first used by Aristotle to denote a modification of form either in nouns or in verbs. Even the formation of an adverb from an adjective was called ptosis by him. In nouns he used the term \u1f30\u03b4\u03af\u03b1 (onoma), i.e. noun or name, for what we call the nominative, and applied the term 'fallings' to the other cases, which he did not distinguish from each other by special names. The word 'ptosis' had nothing to do with the 'falling or resting of one word on another'; it denoted the 'fall' of a word 'from a certain standard form.' The Stoics called this standard form the 'straight' or 'upright,' and called the other cases (to which they gave the separate names \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, \u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, and \u1f00\u03c4\u03b9\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba\u03ae) the slanting or oblique falls.' Some reckoned the Vocative as an 'upright,' others as a 'slanting fall.' Of course the term 'upright fall' (casus rectus) was sharply criticised as self-contradictory; it was defended on the rather shuffling pretext that it denoted a 'fall' from the general conception in the mind to the particular. (\"Quod a generali nomine in specialia cadit.\" Priscian V. 13.) A collection of these 'falls' was called the 'declension' or 'sloping down' of the noun.\n\n\u2021 There is good reason for believing that the Nominative was not the primary case, but was of later origin than some of the rest. It will be shown hereafter that the earliest forms of predication sprang out of the use of an oblique case, not of the nominative. The nominative was probably based upon the subjective conception involved in the use of the pronoun 'I,' which (as we see in the case of children) is of late growth (See Sayce, 'Principles of Comp. Phil.' p. 286). Language, in the case of children, continually 'harks back' to primitive methods.\n\n\u00a7 In Latin and Greek the Vocative is only a weakened form of the stem or crude form, it has no case-ending of its own. Very commonly the Nominative does duty for it.\nsuperfluous. In Latin the functions of the Locative and Instrumental cases were divided between the Dative and the Ablative; in Greek the Locative, the Instrumental and the Ablative were merged in the Genitive and Dative.\n\n67. English was anciently a more highly inflected language than it is now (see Hist. Introd.). In its Anglo-Saxon stage it had five cases (at least in pronouns), the Nominative, Genitive, Dative, Accusative, and Instrumental. This last was dropped in nouns. There was no Vocative distinct from the Nominative. There were also several declensions of nouns. Ultimately the Dative came to be used to do duty for the Accusative as well as for itself, and was called the Objective, and one uniform mode of marking case was adopted for all nouns. We have now only three cases, the Nominative Case, the Possessive Case, and the Objective Case. In nouns the nominative and objective cases are alike in form.*\n\nNOMINATIVE CASE.\n\n68. The nominative case is that form in which a noun (or pronoun) is used when it is the subject of a verb \u2020; that is, when it stands for that about which something is said by means of a verb, as \u2018Men build houses,\u2019 \u2018The boy was struck by his brother.\u2019 If the verb of the sentence be in the active voice, the subject of the verb stands for the doer of the action described by the verb. If the verb be in the passive voice, the subject of the verb stands for the object of the action described by the verb. In either case the subject stands for that about which something is said by means of the verb.\u2021\n\n69. It answers the question made by putting who? or what? before the verb, as \u2018Who build houses?\u2019 \u2018Men.\u2019 \u2018Who was struck?\u2019 \u2018The boy.\u2019\n\n70. The Nominative (Latin nominativus, \u2018naming\u2019) is the Naming Form, and names either the person or thing spoken of, or the person or thing spoken to, as in \u2018O solitude, where are thy charms?\u2019 When used in the latter way it is called the Nominative of Address, or (by some) the Vocative.\n\n* Case in English has never ceased to be fundamentally what it was in Anglo-Saxon. Nothing ought to be called a \u2018Case\u2019 now, which would not have been so named in Anglo-Saxon, German, Latin, &c. In none of these languages would the combination of a preposition and a substantive be called a case. The combination \u2018of John\u2019 has no more right to be called a case than \u2018of him\u2019; and \u2018of him\u2019 is on a par with de eo (Latin) and von ihm (German). It was long ago pointed out that if a preposition and a noun together make a case, there must be as many cases as there are prepositions. The attempt to limit them to the six of the Latin grammar is futile. There is no normal or necessary number of cases in language. It does not follow, because a certain relation of ideas may be expressed in two ways, that these different ways should bear the same name.\n\n\u2020 Such expressions as \u201cThe noun boy is the nominative case to the verb\u201d are incorrect. A noun is not a case; and the subject of a verb is a word and not a form of a word.\n\n\u2021 This definition must not be taken to mean that the Nominative Case has no other uses. The term is not a good one, because nouns in all cases name that for which they stand.\n71. The possessive case * is that form of a noun (or pronoun) which shows that something belongs to or is connected with the person or thing for which it stands. Thus in 'I saw John's book,' the possessive case John's shows that something (namely a book) belongs to John.\n\n72. In Anglo-Saxon the Genitive Case had a very wide range of meaning, including the ideas of separation, partition, size, age, material, time when, means, manner, &c. The general sense of 'connected with' appears in such phrases as 'a stone's throw,' 'a day's journey,' 'my uncle's death,' &c. In the English Bible 'Thy fear' means 'the fear of thee.' So in Shakspeare 'one man's awe' (J. Caes.) means 'awe of one man'; 'his taking off' means 'the taking off of him.' Here the possessive answers to the Latin objective genitive, as in amor pecuniae, 'the love of money.'\n\n73. With the exception of a few phrases, such as 'the earth's axis,' 'the moon's orbit,' the possessive inflexion is not now used (except in poetry) unless the noun denotes a person or animal, or something personified.\n\n74. The meaning of the possessive case may be expressed by means of the preposition of with the objective case after it. Thus, for 'My father's house,' we may say, 'The house of my father.' But the possessive case must not be substituted for the preposition of, unless the of comes after a noun.\n\n75. The possessive case in the singular number, and in those plurals which end in any other letter than s, is formed by adding the letter s with an apostrophe before it (thus, 's) to the nominative case; as, John's, men's, geese's. In those plurals which end in s the possessive case is indicated in writing by placing the apostrophe after the s, as, 'the birds' feathers.'\n\n76. The Genitive or Possessive suffix in Anglo-Saxon was -es (still preserved in full in writing, though no longer pronounced as a syllable, in Wednesday, i.e. Wodnes-day). It was used only in masculine and neuter nouns of the Strong Declension, and in the singular number.\u2020 After a\n\n* The Possessive Case answers to the Genitive in Latin, &c. The name comes from the Latin possidere (sup. possessum) 'to possess.' The equivalent Greek term \u03ba\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1 was one of the aliases of the Genitive.\n\nThe Latin grammarians have been much abused for using the term genitivus as the translation of \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. Max M\u00fcller says that the latter means 'causa generalis,' i.e., 'the case of the genus,' whereas genitivus means 'the case of origin or birth.' The Roman grammarians were not great at the philosophy of language, but it seems unlikely that they should have committed so gross a blunder under the guidance of the Greek grammarians from whom they learnt grammar; and it should be noted that one of the names given to this case by the Stoics was \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae, which implies that it was the 'case of paternity' (See Lersch, Sprachphilosophie der Alten).\n\n\u2020 It was the Northern dialect in which s was first adopted as the Possessive suffix in all nouns, and in both numbers. In Anglo-Saxon and Transition English it was often omitted after words denoting family relations, and a few others. Thus Chaucer uses finder, brother, heven, &c., as possessives. This omission was common in the Northern dialect. The term 'Lady-day' (compare 'Lord's-day') has come down from the time when feminine nouns had not this suffix. So Chaucer (Prol. 695) says 'oure lady vevl.' As an adverbial formation the suffix -es was added to feminines in Anglo-Saxon, as in nithes, 'by night.'\nsibilant the vowel is sounded, though not written, as in *Thomas's*. Chaucer uses *-es*, Wycliffe *-is* or *-ys.* The apostrophe before the *s* marks that the vowel of the suffix has been dropped. It is placed after plurals ending in *s*, and sometimes after a singular noun ending in a sibilant, to indicate to the eye that we have a possessive case without a suffix, as 'for conscience' sake,' 'Aeneas' son.' The use of the apostrophe is modern; Milton uses it only after a vowel, as in 'Siloa's,' 'Rhea's.' The use of it in the plural after *s* is still more recent.\u2020 The plural *books* has just as good a right to an apostrophe as the possessive *book's*, the vowel of the older suffix *-as* or *-es* having been omitted.\n\n77. In the case of a complex name, the termination of the possessive case is only affixed to the last of the names; as \"Julius Caesar's death;\" \"John Thomas Smith's father.\" It is even usual to carry out the same principle when *one thing* is possessed by several persons; as, \"John, William, and Mary's uncle;\" that is, the uncle of John, William, and Mary. This practice, however, cannot be defended on grammatical principles. In compound nouns like *father-in-law*, or when a noun is followed by determinative adjuncts of any kind, as 'Henry the Eighth,' 'The Queen of England,' 'Smith the baker,' &c., the possessive sign *'s* is placed at the end,\u2021 as 'My father-in-law's house,' 'the Queen of England's name,' &c. We no longer allow such constructions as \"It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant general;\" but in old English such combinations as \"The emperour's mother William\" were not uncommon (Skeat, note on Chaucer's *Sq. T*).\n\n78. The possessive *'s* is the only case suffix of nouns that has come down to us. The letter *s*, as the characteristic of the genitive, is of general occurrence in the Aryan languages.\n\n**OBJECTIVE CASE.**\n\n79. The objective case is that form in which a noun or pro\n\n---\n\n* The syllabic *-es* is often found in Spenser, and traces of it occur in Shakspeare, as 'whales bone' (*Love's L., L. V. 2*), 'the moones sphere' (*Mids. N. D. II. 1*). In modern Lowland Scotch it is even pronounced after plurals in *-s*, as *bairns's*, *farmers's*.\n\nFrom the time of Ben Jonson to that of Addison the absurd notion was entertained that the possessive *'s* is an abbreviation of *his* ('The king's crown' = 'The king his crown'). But the word *his* itself is the possessive case of *he*, so that, on this principle *his = he + his = he + he + his = he + he + he + his*, and so on ad infinitum. Moreover *Mary's bonnet* must be *Mary his bonnet*. It is quite true, however, that it was the practice for a long time to use such expressions as 'John Smith his book.' This arose from a pleonastic use of the pronoun for the purpose of showing the Syntax of the noun. The demonstrative pronoun was commonly thus used in early English after the indeclinable relative *that*, and in other cases (e.g., \"A semely man our host he was.\") Chaucer, *Prol. 751*). A similar idiom is found in Low German dialects. M\u00e4tzner (i. p. 315) quotes 'Vatter sin hus' (= father his house), 'Mutter er d\u00f6k' (= Mother her cloth).\n\n\u2020 In the seventeenth century there prevailed the curious fashion of putting the apostrophe before the *-s* of the possessive plural (*lord's = lords*; *friend's = friends*), as though the plural suffix *s* had been elided. (See Wallis's and Maittaire's grammars.)\n\n\u2021 This power of treating an inflected form or a complex phrase as though it were a single declinable word, and adding inflections to it, is very remarkable in English. Thus in Anglo-Saxon the genitives of the personal pronouns were treated as pronominal adjectives and declined; an inflected infinitive was used after to form the gerund (see Gerund \u00a7 167) and even such a compound as *nithwylc* (ne wat hwylc = I know not which), has suffixes like an ordinary adjective, as \"in niqesele nithwylicum,\" \"in I-know-not-what dwelling.\" Murray gives as good Lowland Scotch \"That's the-man-that-you-met-yesterday's daughter.\"\n\nD\nnoun is used when it stands for the object of the action spoken of in some verb, or when it comes after a preposition. In the sentence, 'The stone struck the boy,' the word boy, which stands for the object of the action, is called the object of the verb, and is in the objective case. In Latin, Greek, German or Anglo-Saxon it would be in the accusative case. In the sentence, 'John was riding in a coach,' the noun coach, which comes after the preposition in, is in the objective case.\n\n80. The objective case is also used, like the Latin dative, to denote the indirect object of a verb, that is to say, it stands for some person or thing indirectly affected by the action, but not the direct object of it; as, 'I gave the man a shilling,' 'Tell me a tale.' In old English the dative differed in form from the accusative.\n\nThe objective case in English therefore does duty both for the Accusative and for the Dative of other languages.* The direct object is the answer to the question formed by putting 'whom or what' before the verb and its subject. Thus (in the example given above) 'Whom or what did the stone strike?' Ans. 'The boy.' The indirect object is the answer to the question formed by putting 'To or for whom or to or for what' before the verb, subject and direct object. 'Thus in 'I gave him a book,' the indirect object 'him' answers the question 'To whom did I give a book?'\n\n81. In nouns the objective case is the same in form as the nominative. They can only be distinguished by their use. In an ordinary declarative sentence the nominative case precedes the verb and the objective case comes after the verb.\n\n82. The following are examples of the declension of nouns:\n\n| Singular | Plural | Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|----------|--------|\n| Nominative Case | Man | Men | Father | Fathers |\n| Possessive Case | Man's | Men's | Father's | Fathers' |\n| Objective Case | Man | Men | Father | Fathers |\n\n* The endeavour to distinguish a dative and an accusative case in modern English is at variance with the genius and history of the language. We see from the pronouns that the form which maintained its ground was the dative, which first ousted the instrumental and usurped its functions, and then did the same with the accusative. It is unphilosophical to re-introduce grammatical distinctions which a language has ceased to recognize. One might as well attempt to restore the Locative Case to Latin, or the Ablative to Greek. As there is but one form (him, her, them, &c.) to denote both the direct and the indirect object, not only is nothing gained, but an important piece of linguistic history is obscured by having two names for it. It is much better to use the common name objective. It is true that there are two uses of the objective case, but that is another matter. A case is not the same thing as the relation that it expresses, any more than a noun is the same as the thing which it names. Moreover, the absorption of the accusative by the dative is intimately connected with the peculiar English idiom, that the word which stands for either kind of object with an active verb, may usually be made the subject of a Passive verb. \"I was struck\" and \"I was told the story\" are equally good English. Nothing of this sort is possible in German or Latin.\n\nTo say that English has only one case\u2014the Possessive\u2014is palpably wrong. It has only one inflected case (at least in nouns); but father and father's make two forms of the noun. The fact that pronouns still distinguish the Objective from the Nominative, so as to have three distinct forms, compels us to recognize three cases in English even in nouns.\nANCIENT ENGLISH DECLENSIONS.\n\nANGLO-SAXON FORMS.\n\nSTRONG DECLENSIONS.\n\nA.

By this time most of the inflexions had disappeared. Except a few traces of a dative singular in -e, inflexions in nouns had been reduced to the formation of the plural number and the genitive case.\n\n1. The common plural inflexion was -es* (Chaucer) or -is (Wycliffe), shortened sometimes to -s, for which z is now and then found in words of Romance origin, as instruments (Chaucer, Squieres Tale, 270 ed. Skeat), paraments (Kn. T. 1643), olifaunte (Maundeville).\n\n* Written -is and -us in some MSS. The suffix -es was sounded as a syllable after monosyllables (see ProL. 1-14). Words of more than one syllable usually have -s. If -es is written, it is sounded as -s.\n2. Plurals in -en or -n were rather more common than now, as kneen, hosen, ashen, eyen, sustren, doughteren, lambren,* &c.\n\n3. Some old neuter words continued without plural suffix (see \u00a7 83), as hors, hous, thing.\n\n4. The genitive or possessive singular was formed by adding -es (Chaucer), -is, or -ys (Wycliffe), or -s. Feminine nouns occasionally have not -s, but -e, as 'heorte + blood' (heart's blood). See note on \u00a7 76.\n\nIn the plural the genitive was usually not distinguished from the nominative, when the latter ended in -s. Otherwise -es was added, as mennes. Traces of the old ending -ena are sometimes met with.\u2020\n\nADJECTIVE.\n\n85. When we speak of a thing we often require to mention some quality or state of the thing, or its number or quantity, or some relation in which it stands to ourselves or to other things. The words that do this are called Adjectives.\u00a7\n\nIn the phrase 'a white horse,' the word white is an adjective. It denotes a certain quality of the horse.\n\nIn the phrase 'a book lying on the table,' the word lying is an adjective. It denotes a state of the book.\n\nIn the phrase 'two men,' the word two is an adjective. It points out the quantity or number of that for which the noun stands.\n\nIn the phrase 'this child,' the word this is an adjective. It points out that the child stands in a certain relation (of nearness) to me.\n\n86. Definition.\u2014An Adjective is a word used with a noun to describe, to measure or count, or to indicate that for which the noun stands.\n\nThis may also be expressed by saying that an Adjective is a word used with a noun or pronoun to denote some attribute of quality, quantity, or relation which marks that for which the noun or pronoun stands.||\n\n* Those with r before -en are usually from A.S. plurals in -ru.\n\n\u2020 So also mona (= moon's) occurs once as a possessive (Sir Thopas 169). The genitive in A.S. was monan. We still say Monday (Monan dag) and Sunday (Sunnan dag), not Moonsday and Sunsday (Skeat, Int. to Chaucer's Pr. Tale, p. xlix.).\n\n\u2021 As in Piers Plowman (i. 105), \"Criste Kingene Kynge\" = 'Christ King of Kings.'\n\n\u00a7 Latin adjectivus, 'capable of being attached to,' from adjectus, 'added to.' The older and fuller term for this Part of Speech is 'Noun Adjective' (nomen adjectivum). See \u00a7 25.\n\nThe term 'Adjective' differentiates this class of words not from nouns (for it is, strictly speaking, one of the two divisions of nouns), but from Substantives (which may be either nouns or pronouns).\n\n|| Beware of the absurdity of saying that \"an adjective denotes the quality of a noun.\" When we speak of a red rose, the adjective red does not denote a quality of the name rose, but of the thing for which the name stands. The blunder is very obvious, but is committed in most English Grammars.\nAn adjective answers the questions (1) 'Of what sort?' or 'In what state?' (2) 'How much?' or 'How many?' (3) 'Which?'\n\n87. When it is attached directly to the noun to which it refers, an adjective is said to be used attributively; as 'a red ball;' 'a bird flying through the air;' 'which hand will you have?' The adjective and noun together form a compound description of that which we have in our thoughts. When an adjective is connected with a noun by means of some part of the verb be (or some other verb of incomplete predication, such as become), it is said to be used predicatively, as, 'the ball is red;' 'the bird was flying.' All true adjectives can be used in both ways.\n\nAs things are distinguished by quality, quantity, and relation, an adjective joined to a noun usually distinguishes what the noun stands for from other things that may be named by the same noun.\n\n88. The class-name 'horse' stands for that aggregate of resemblances by virtue of which one horse is like another. The compound name white horse means all that horse means, and white besides. It adds something to the meaning of horse. But the more marks we group together to distinguish a class, the smaller must the class be. The class denoted by white horse is smaller than the class denoted by horse. Hence we may also have the following\n\nDefinition.\u2014An Adjective is a word which may limit the application of a noun to that which has the quality, the quantity, or the relation, which the adjective denotes.*\n\nTo be an adjective, a word must do this by virtue of its own proper meaning. Certain forms and uses of other parts of speech may also have a definitive or limiting force. Thus in 'John's book' the possessive case 'John's' has this force, but 'John's' is still a noun in the possessive case, and not an adjective, just like 'Caesaris' in the Latin 'Caesaris uxor' (Caesar's wife). But the possessive case is so like an adjective, that in some pronouns it was formerly declined like an adjective.\n\nIn combinations like teaspoon, apple-tree, cannon ball, the first word is not an adjective. It does not express an attributive idea, it merely suggests one. It has a limiting but not an attributive force. The two nouns form a compound name. Hence those most commonly used have come to be written as one word. The word tea, apple, or cannon, cannot be used as a predicate, as a true adjective can.\n\nIn many cases the first (or limiting) member of the compound may be looked upon as an uninflected possessive case, in which position supplies the place of inflexion. Compare seaman and landsman, pikeman and swordsman, buckhorn and hartshorn.\n\n* This, however, is not invariably the function of adjectives. 'Socrates' names a single person. 'Wise Socrates' names and describes this same person, but does not limit the application of the name.\nCLASSIFICATION OF ADJECTIVES.\n\n89. Adjectives may be arranged in the following classes:\u2014\n\n1. Qualitative * Adjectives, or Adjectives of Quality.\n2. Quantitative \u2020 Adjectives, or Adjectives of Quantity.\n3. Demonstrative Adjectives, or Adjectives of Relation (Latin demonstro, 'I point out').\n\nRespecting the division of Adjectives into Notional and Relational see \u00a7 26.\n\n90. I. Qualitative Adjectives (or Adjectives of Quality) denote some quality or attribute, as virtuous, white, large, small, great, little (in the sense of 'small'), such. They may also be called Descriptive Adjectives. The verbal adjectives called Participles belong to this class.\n\n91. II. Quantitative Adjectives (or Adjectives of Quantity) denote how much or how many of that for which the noun stands we have in our thoughts. This class includes\u2014\n\na. The Cardinal Numeral Adjectives, one, two, three, &c. (The words hundred, thousand, million, like pair and dozen, are nouns.\u00a7 They may be used in the plural, as hundreds.)\n\nb. The words all, any, some, half, many, few, much, more, most, little, less, least, both, several, none, or no (= not any), enough.\n\n92. All, any, some, enough, more, most, none or no, relate to quantity when used with a noun in the singular, and to number when used with a noun in the plural.\n\nExamples. 'All men are mortal.' 'He sleeps all night.' 'I have some pens.' 'Give me some wine.' 'Wait half an hour.' 'Few persons will believe that.' 'I have much pleasure in doing this.' 'He has more sense than his neighbour.' 'Most persons admire valour.' 'He had both eyes put out.' 'Make no noise.' 'Give none offence.' This use of none is now obsolete.\n\n93. Most of these words may be used as substantives, as 'All is lost'; 'Much has been said, but more remains to be told'; 'He lost less than I did'; 'Enough has been said.'\n\n94. The words all, half, little, less, least, much, more, most, enough, none, no, are also used as adverbs; as \"all round the world;\" \"half afraid;\" \"I am\n\n* From the Latin qualis 'of what sort.'\n\u2020 From the Latin quantum 'how much.'\n\u2021 Large, small, great, describe the magnitude of the thing referred to, but do not tell us how much of it we are speaking about.\n\u00a7 In A.S. they were followed by the genitive case, as though we said 'A hundred of sheep,' &c. In such phrases as 'A hundred sheep,' 'A dozen books,' the noun sheep or books is in apposition to the noun hundred or dozen.\n|| Any and some are discussed under the head of 'Pronouns.'\nbut little encouraged by that;\" \"he is less careful than his brother;\" \"he is the least ambitious man that I know;\" \"he is much more studious than he used to be;\" \"he is most anxious to succeed;\" \"he is tall enough;\" \"I am no better;\" \"he is none the worse.\"\n\n95. Half is connected with the old English noun half (A.S. healf), meaning 'side or part.'* Half (healf) was also a declinable adjective in Anglo-Saxon. In 'The half of my goods,' it is a substantive. In 'A half holiday,' 'half way,' it is an adjective.\n\nThe adjective whole is a descriptive adjective. It properly means 'unbroken,' and thence 'undiminished.' 'A whole holiday' means 'an unbroken holiday'; 'The whole distance' is 'the undivided or undiminished distance.'\n\nMany is a substantive \u2020 in 'A great many men' (the noun that follows it being in apposition to it). It is an adjective in 'Many years have passed.' It may be used with a noun in the singular when the indefinite article \u2021 intervenes, as 'Many a man.'\n\nFew (A.S. sing. \u00a7 fed, plural fedwe) is probably always an adjective.|| Such a phrase as 'A few books' may be treated as on a par with 'A twenty bokes' (Chaucer, Prol.), where a numerically defined collection is taken as a whole.\n\nFew (without the article) denies that there are many; a few denies that there are none. There is a similar distinction between little and a little.\n\nMore formerly meant greater, as in 'The more part' (Acts xix. 32). But even in A.S. m\u0101ra meant both 'greater' and 'additional.'\u2020 It has this latter sense in such phrases as 'There is some more wine in the bottle.' In 'I have more money than you' it measures the whole quantity of money.\n\nLittle, less, and least, when they denote size, are qualitative or descriptive adjectives, as 'a little boy,' 'The less evil of the two,' 'Not in the least degree.' They are quantitative adjectives** in such phrases as 'I have but little money left,' 'Less rain fell to-day,' 'He showed the least courage of all.'\n\nBoth, from the stem b\u00e1 (A.S. masc. begen, fem. b\u00e1, neut. ba or bu), and a\n\n* In Maundeville we find 'On this half the see' = 'on this side the sea'; in the Ormulum 'O Godes halfe' = 'on the part of,' or 'by order of God' (Stratmann s. v. Koch ii. 441). In modern English 'On behalf of' is the result of a confusion. There were two equivalent phrases in A.S. 'on healfse' = on side, and 'be healfse' = by side or beside (Grein iv. p. 53). These were jumbled together into 'on behalf,' which is as if we said 'on by side' (Skeat, Et. Dict. s. v.).\n\n\u2020 In A.S. there was both a noun menigo = 'multitude,' and an adjective manig = 'many.' The use of the descriptive adjective great before many shows that the latter is a genuine substantive.\n\n\u2021 The indefinite article was not necessary in old English. In the Ormulum (693) we find manig mann. Compare the German mancher (which is the same word), and the Latin 'Plurimus in Junonis honorem aptum dict equis Argos' (Horace). The old English word fele (A.S. fela, German viel) was still used by Wycliffe and Chaucer, as 'dates fele' = 'many days' (Clerkes T. 917).\n\n\u00a7 Fea was an adjective equivalent to the Latin paucus = 'rarely occurring,' 'met with but seldom.' Thus 'fed \u00e6nig was monna cynnes,' 'there was but here and there one of the race of men.' The singular was indeclinable, and followed by the genitive. In the Scotch phrase 'A few porridge,' few seems to have the sense 'a small quantity.' The plural feawe was declined in A.S.\n\n|| Hence we say 'A very few,' the adverb qualifying the adjective.\n\n\u00b6 Thus 'n\u00e1n marra man' = 'not one more man' (Menolog. 161. See Grein iv. p. 212).\n\n\u00a7 In A.S. a small quantity or number of anything was expressed by the substantive lyt with the genitive ('A lite' is found in Chaucer). From lyt was formed the adjective lytel (little). The adjective little is used substantively in 'A little wine,' wine being in apposition to little. The word is from a root lut meaning 'to deceive' (Skeat, s. v.) Respecting less and least see under 'Comparison of Adjectives.'\nsuffix -th of uncertain origin,* indicates that two objects are regarded in conjunction. Each implies that two or more are regarded separately.\n\nEnough is a substantive in 'Enough has been said'; it is an adjective (as is indicated by its position) in 'I have money enough.'\u2020 In early English 'enough' was used of quantity, 'enow' of number.\n\nNone (A.S. ndn = ne-\u00e1n) was originally singular in sense (not one), and was not used with reference to quantity. By Chaucer's time it was used of more than one (\"Noon holy men,\" Prol. 178). In modern English it is used substantively with reference both to number and to quantity, as 'Give me some pens (or some money), I have none.'\n\nNone = no one is becoming obsolete.\u2021 As an adjective none is now used in the shortened form no,\u00a7 as \"He has no friends and no money.\"\n\n96. Such expressions as 'All of us,' 'The whole of the day,' 'Both of you,' are of course illogical. It has been suggested\u2225 that they have arisen from a confusion between 'All we' and 'Some of us,' &c.\n\n97. III. Demonstrative Adjectives, or Adjectives of Relation, point out that which we are speaking of by indicating some relation which it bears to ourselves, or to some other person or thing. This class includes:\n\n1. The Definite Article the and the Indefinite Article an or a.\n2. The Adjective Pronouns. (See Table of Pronouns \u00a7 130.)\n3. The Ordinal Numerals, first, second, third, &c.\n\n98. Adjectives are often used without having any noun expressed to which they may be attached.\n\n1. A previously expressed noun is understood, i.e. not expressed, but intended to be kept in mind, as \"He picked out the black balls and left the white.\"\n\n2. The adjective refers to some substantive notion which is too vague to be expressed. In a singular sense this use of descriptive adjectives is now restricted to universal concrete ideas, as 'The sublime,' 'The beautiful'; ** and to a few phrases, as 'In common'; 'At random'; 'In future'; 'For better or worse,' &c. Adjectives thus used may be termed Adjectival Substantives, or Adjectives used as Substantives. Quantitative and demonstrative adjectives are often used thus, as 'That was agreed to'; 'Much \u2020\u2020 has been accomplished.'\n\n* This -th appears in the Gothic haioths (compare the German beide). It is often confused with the twa ('two') with which b\u0113d is sometimes compounded in A.S. (bitwud, neut butu = 'both two.' Compare both twain in Shakspeare, Love's L. L. V. 2). The root ba or bai is the same as the bo in the Latin ambo (Fick, Vergl. W\u00f6rter, i 18).\n\n\u2020 In such cases it was declined in A.S., as \"hlaf gen\u014dhne habba\u00fe\" = 'have bread enough' (Luke xv 17). The plural form ynoewe occurs in Chaucer (see Sq. T. 470). The e, i or y at the beginning represents the ge of gen\u014dh (Germ. genue).\n\n\u2021 Dryden still wrote \"None but the brave deserves the fair.\"\n\n\u00a7 So in early English one became o or oo, and mine, &c., became my, &c.\n\n\u2225 E.g. by Dr. Abbott.\n\n\u00b6 In older English we find such phrases as \"every rewful\" = every sorrowful person (Chaucer). \"The poor is hated\" (Prov. xiv 20); \"Thy dearest far\" (Young).\n\n** Do not call these abstract. The abstract names are 'sublimity,' 'beauty,' 'The sublime' is that in which the quality of sublimity is found. It is therefore a concrete idea.\n\n\u2020\u2020 But much, when so used, must still be qualified by an adverb, not by an adjective, as Very much, \"So much.\" \"This much\" is a blunder. It must be \"Thus much.\"\nADJECTIVE.\n\n3. Some adjectives are used completely as substantives, and form plurals and possessives. The adjectives which admit of this are\u2014\n\n1. National names, such as German, Italian, Roman. We say, \"A Roman's rights\"; \"The Germans crossed the Rhine.\" Names which end in a sibilant (Dutch, Chinese, &c.) have no inflexion.\n\n2. Names denoting the members of a sect or party; as Christian, Lutheran, Stoic, Jacobite, &c.\n\n3. Various Latin comparatives, as senior, junior, inferior, &c., with the Anglo-Saxon elder and better.\n\n4. Various adjectives denoting persons, and of French or Latin origin, as native, mortal, noble, saint, criminal, ancient, modern, &c., together with a very few of Anglo-Saxon origin, as black, white, and grammatical terms, as nominatives, &c.\n\n5. Adjectives used as substantives in the plural only, as vitals, intestines, eatables, moveables, valuables, greens, the blues, sweets, &c.\n\n6. The adjective other. Some writers also use either's and neither's in the possessive singular.\n\n7. Numerals used pronominally, as 'For ten's sake'; 'They arrived by twos and threes.'\n\nNUMERALS.\n\n99. It has been pointed out that the Cardinal Numerals are Adjectives of Quantity, and that the Ordinal Numerals are Demonstrative Adjectives, or Adjectives of Relation.\n\n100. The Anglo-Saxon cardinal numerals * are (1) \u00e1n; (2) twegen, tw\u00e1i; (3) bri, \u00fereo; (4) f\u00e9ower; (5) f\u00edf; (6) six; (7) seofon; (8) eahta; (9) nigon; (10) tyn or tin; (11) endlufon, endleof or endlif; (12) twelf; (13) \u00fereotype; (14) f\u00e9owertyne, &c.; (20) twentig; (30) \u00feritig, &c.; (70) hundseofontig; (80) hundeatatig; (90) hundnigontig; (100) hundeteontig or hund; (110) hundendlufontig; (120) hundtwelftig.\n\n101. The syllable -tig (-ty) is really a substantive, meaning 'a lot of ten' (Gothic tigus, having the same root as dec-em). Hence the numerals twentiig, &c. in Anglo-Saxon were sometimes substantives followed by the genitive plural. The curious 'eleventy' and 'twelvety' should be noticed.\n\nEndlufon or endlif means one + ten; en (d) is a variety of the word one, and lif is really identical with the root of dec-em and dek-a.\u2020 Similarly twelf is a compound of twa and lif (two + ten).\n\n* On comparing the English numerals with those of Latin and Greek by the aid of Grimm's law (bearing in mind that a guttural is very apt to be softened into f or v, as we see in laugh compared with A.S. klithan and German lachen, or to disappear from between vowels), it will be seen that they are radically the same. The German f\u00fcnf and Gothic fimf show that an n has disappeared from f\u00e9u (f\u00e9f). In ten there has been the loss of the guttural which we have in decem (d\u00e9ko), and the Gothic ta\u00edhun. The syllable hund is a remnant of the Gothic ordinal ta\u00edhund = tenth (as centum is of centum, a neuter ordinal of decem). Hundred is a compound of hund and red or red ('reckoning'), and means 'tenth count.' In Gothic the complete form for 'a hundred' was ta\u00edhun-ta\u00edhund, i.e. 'tenth ten,' Reckoning by tens being presupposed. Hund (i.e. tenth) was used by itself in A.S. for a hundred (Skeat, Moeso-Gothic Gloss. and Etym. Dict.). 'Dozen' is from duodecim. 'Score' means a cut. Reckoning by scores was characteristic of Keltic peoples.\n\n\u2020 D and l are frequently interchanged, as in ol-eo and od-or, d\u00e1kpu and lacrima.\nThe forms for *one*, *two*, and *three* were always declined, as were those for *four*, *five*, *six*, *seven*, *nine*, *ten*, *eleven*, and *twelve* when used without a substantive following. The compounds of *-tig* were sometimes substantives, sometimes adjectives. *Twegen* = *twain*.\n\n*First* is a superlative of *fore*. The A.S. *forma* is also a superlative of *fore*, as *primus* in Latin is of *pro*. *Second* is the Latin *secundus* (following). The old word for second was 'other.' We still say 'every other day,' i.e., 'every second day.' *Third* was in A.S. *\u00feridda*, where *da* replaced *\u00f0a* (= modern *-th*) after the *d*. The *r* keeps its place before the *i* in the Yorkshire term *riding* (= *thriding*, 'a third part'). The A.S. form *le\u00f0a* 'tenth,' without *n*, appears in *tith*. The forms which retain the *n* (seventh, ninth, tenth, &c.) were adopted from the Northern dialect.\n\n**INFLEXION OF ADJECTIVES.**\n\n102. Adjectives, in modern English, are not declinable words, with the exception of the words *this* and *that*, plurals *these* and *those*.\n\n**ANGLO-SAXON FORMS.**\n\n103. Adjectives preceded by a demonstrative word were declined like masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns of the weak declension.\n\nWhen not preceded by a definitive word, adjectives were thus declined:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Masc.    | Fem.   | Neut. | M. and F. | Neut. |\n| Nom.     | til (good) | til -u | til | tile | tilu, -e |\n| Gen.     | tiles | tilre | tiles | tilra* | tilra |\n| Dat.     | tilum | tilre | tilum | tilum | tilum |\n| Acc.     | tile  | tile  | til   | tile  | tilu, -e |\n| Abl.     | tile  | tilre | tile  | tile  | tilu |\n\n**FORMS OF THE TIME OF CHAUCER.**\n\n104. By the time of Chaucer the various suffixes had been reduced to an inflexional *r* in the plural, especially in adjectives of one syllable, and of adjectives used substantively, at the end of adjectives preceded by demonstratives and possessives, and in the vocative case, as 'O stronge God' (*Kn.* T. 1515).\n\nNorman-French adjectives sometimes have *s* in the plural, when placed after their nouns, as *cosins germaines*, *places delitables* (*Koch* i. p. 447).\n\n**COMPARISON OF ADJECTIVES.**\n\n105. Adjectives have three forms called Degrees of Comparison. These are\u20141. The Positive Degree. 2. The Comparative Degree. 3. The Superlative Degree.\n\n---\n\n*Shakspeare has preserved a solitary specimen of the old genitive plural suffix *er* (A.S. *-m*) in the word *alderliefest* (for *allerliefest*, *d* being an offgrowth of *l* before *r*), meaning 'dearest of all' (*Hi. King H.* V. i. 1). Compare the German *allerliebst*. In Chaucer we find *alderlewest*, *alderfirst*, as well as *youre aller* = 'of you all.' In *olden*, *en* is perhaps a relic of the ancient inflexion.*\n106. The Positive Degree of an adjective is the adjective in its simple form, used to point out some quality or attribute of that which we speak about, as 'A black cat,' 'A fine day.'\n\n107. The Comparative Degree of an adjective is that form of it by means of which we show that one thing,* or set of things, possesses a certain quality or attribute in a greater degree than another thing, or set of things.\n\n108. The Comparative Degree (Latin *comparativus*, from *comparo*, 'I put together') is formed from the Positive by adding to it the syllable -or\u2020 before which mute -e is dropped, and y is dealt with in the same way as before the plural suffix -es (\u00a7 49), as 'My knife is sharper than yours;' 'John's book is pretty, but mine is prettier;' 'Your clothes are finer than mine.' One thing may be compared either with one other, or with a group of several; and a group of things may be compared either with another group or with a single thing. Also a thing may be compared with itself under other circumstances, as 'John is stouter than he was last year.'\n\n109. It must not be imagined that the comparative degree always expresses the existence of more of a certain quality in an object than the positive degree does. If we say, \"William is a clever boy,\" and \"John is cleverer than Thomas,\" we are not to infer that cleverer in the second case implies more cleverness in John than clever implies in the case of William. The fact may be that William is cleverer than John.\n\n110. Some adjectives in the comparative degree are now used merely to mark relations in space or time, as former, latter, elder, upper, inner, &c.\n\n111. The Superlative \u2021 Degree of an adjective is that form of it which shows that a certain thing, or group of things, possesses the attribute denoted by the adjective in a greater degree than any other among several, of which it is one.\u2021 It is formed by adding st or est \u00a7 to the adjective in the positive degree; as, greatest, largest. Thus, of several boys in a group, we may say, 'John is the tallest.'\n\n112. If we say \"John is taller than all the other boys in the class,\" we express the same relation as to height between John and the rest as if\n\n---\n\n* The word thing means generally whatever we can think about, i.e., make a distinct object of thought, including persons, as well as what we commonly denominate things.\n\n\u2020 In Anglo-Saxon the suffix was -er or -or, in declension dropping the vowel, and inflected according to the weak declension. The letter r is the softened form of a sibilant. In Gothic the suffix is -iza. With this we may compare the Latin comparative suffix -tus (Key Lat. Gr. \u00a7 241), the s of which is softened to r in declension. It is an ancient Aryan suffix. (Sansc. tyas.) Another Aryan comparative suffix, tar or ter, which we get in the Greek -tepot, appears also in the Latin -ter and the English -ther, to indicate that one thing is viewed in its relation to some other, as alter 'one of two'; uter 'which of two'; neuter: other, either, neither, whether.\n\n\u2021 Superlative (Lat. superlativus, from superlatus) means 'lifting up above.' The superlative degree lifts the thing that it is applied to above all the rest of the group.\n\n\u00a7 In Anglo-Saxon the termination was -est or -ost. In early English writers we still find comparatives in -or and superlatives in -ost, and sometimes in -ust and -yst.\nwe say, \"John is the tallest boy in the class.\" But in the former case, John is considered apart from the other boys of the class, so that the two objects which we have in mind are John and the other boys in the class. When the superlative degree is used, John is considered as one of the group of boys compared with each other.\n\nWhen two things forming one group are compared, it is usual and proper to employ the comparative degree, as \"This line is the longer of the two.\"\n\n113. Many adjectives, from the nature of the ideas which they express, cannot have comparative and superlative degrees; as, right, left, wrong, square, triangular, together with some of the quantitative adjectives, and all the demonstrative adjectives. Sometimes, however, adjectives are used in a sense which falls short of their strict meaning, and then they admit of degrees of comparison which would not otherwise be tolerable. For example, extreme, perfect, chief. As when we say, \"This specimen is more perfect than that\"; \"He died in the extremest misery\"; \"The chiefest among ten thousand.\"\n\n114. The superlative degree is sometimes used in an absolute sense, when the thing spoken of is not compared with the rest of a class, but is regarded as possessing a certain quality in a very high degree, as 'Hail, divinest Melancholy' (Milton). Most is now usually prefixed to the positive to express this sense. Spenser even uses the comparative absolutely, as 'Help thy weaker (= too weak) novice' (f. q. Profl.).\n\nIRREGULAR COMPARISON.\n\n115. In the case of some adjectives, comparison is marked by what are commonly termed irregular forms, which in some cases are derived from totally different roots.\n\n| Positive | Comparative | Superlative |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Good     | better*     | best        |\n| Bad      | worse\u2020      | worst       |\n| Little\u2021  | less        | least       |\n| Much\u00a7    | more        | most        |\n\n* In Gothic we find Pos. bats, Comp. batiza, Sup. batista, all from the same root bat = 'good,' from which better and best are formed with vowel-change, like elder from old, and the A.S. lengra, longest ('longer, longest'). The root in a positive sense is found in the phrase 'to boot,' which answers precisely to the colloquial expression 'Having something to the good.'\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon and early English the comparative form bet is found, the suffix -er being thrown off as it was in leng (longer), eb (more easily), mo (more), dr (sooner). Thus \"Bet is to dyen than have indulgence\" (Chaucer); \"Do-wel, Do-bet and Do-best\" (Langland).\n\n\u2020 Worse (from A.S. woor = 'bad') has the old s of the comparative suffix (\u00a7 108, note).\n\nThe softened suffix -e appears in the Scotch waur and the old English forms warre (Orm. 489), warre or war (\"The world is much war than it wont,\" (Spenser)). Worse and worst also do duty as comp. and sup. to 'evil' and 'ill.' Chaucer (Sy. T. 224) has badder.\n\n\u2021 Little (A.S. lytel) is formed from the subst. lyt (\u00a7 95). Less and least come from a root las 'feeble.' From las would be formed either lessa or lessa as a comparative, and lesest as a superlative. Lesser (= smaller) may be the modern form of lasra, and so older than less which would be formed from it as bet from better. Most writers, however, treat lesser as a double comparative. Less sometimes means 'smaller,' as in \"How to name the bigger light, and how the less\" (Shaksp. Temp.)\n\n\u00a7 Much is the modern form of the A.S. micel 'great,' which has the same root as \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2 and magnus. More (A.S. mdra = magna) and most (A.S. m\u00e6st = magest) have lost the g. Moc (A.S. md), without the comparative suffix, is found in old English when referring to number. More and most meant greater and greatest (we still speak of 'the most part,' and used to say 'the more part'). The words have nothing to do etymologically with many.\n### ADJECTIVE\n\n| Positive | Comparative | Superlative |\n|----------|-------------|-------------|\n| Many     | [more]      | [most]      |\n| Late     | later* or latter | latest or last \u2020 |\n| [Nigh \u2020 adv.] | nigher | nighest or next \u2021 |\n| [Fore adv.] | former | first \u2020 or foremost |\n| Old      | older or elder \u00a7 | oldest or eldest |\n| [Forth adv.] | further || | furthest \u00b6 |\n| Far      | farther \u00b6 | farthest \u00b6 |\n\n116. In Anglo-Saxon there were two superlative suffixes, -ost or -est and -ema (compare the Greek \u1f30\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 in \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, and the Latin -imus in similis-imus, intimus, &c.). There are a few superlatives in English ending in -most: hindmost, inmost, foremost, utmost, or uttermost. ** Most of these are derived from adverbs. They are not compounds of the adverb most, but double superlatives, \u2020\u2020 formed by the use of both terminations -ema and -ost.\n\n117. Adjectives of more than two syllables, and most adjectives of two syllables, do not allow of the formation of comparative and superlative degrees by means of suffixes. But the same ideas are denoted by prefixing the adverbs more and most to the adjective in the positive degree. Thus we say, Virtuous, more virtuous, most virtuous; Learned, more learned, most learned. The dissyllabic adjectives which do admit of suffixes of comparison are those ending in -y (merry, merrier, merriest; holy, holier, holiest); in -er (as tender, tenderer, tenderest); those in -ble (as able, abler, ablest); those accented on the last syllable, as polite, politer, politest; severe,\n\n---\n\n* Later and latest refer to time; latter and last generally to position in a series. Last is a contraction of latest.\n\n\u2020 There is no proper adjective form for the positive. The A.S. forms were neah, nearra, nearest. The comparative nearra passed into the forms nerre and ner (\"Ner and ner\" \u2014 nearer and nearest in Chaucer, Pr. T. 1710), and ner or near came to be used as a positive, and then nearer and nearest were formed from it. The three degrees ought to be nigh, near, next. Shakspeare uses near as a comparative, \"The near in blood, the nearer bloody\" (Mach. ii. 3).\n\n\u2021 Elder (A.S. fyrst) is the superlative (with vowel-change) of fore. Another superlative form in A.S. was forma. Chaucer speaks of \"Adam our forme (= first) fader.\" Tale of Mel. From this was made the anomalous comparative former and the double superlative foremost.\n\n\u00a7 Elder and eldest answer to the A.S. yldra and yldest, formed with vowel-change as well as suffix from eald = 'old.' (Compare lengra and lengest from lang; gyngra and gyngest, 'ynger' and 'youngest' from geong.) 'Elder' is now used to denote the precedence which is the consequence of being older. The old word eld is an abstract noun = A.S. yldu.\n\n|| Most writers set down further and furthest as made from forth. M. Skeat (Etym. Dict.), on comparing the Dutch and German forms, is inclined to regard further as made from fare by the comparative suffix -ther (\u00a7 108, note). It would then be the exact etymological equivalent of \u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 (see Grimm's law). In that case furthest would be made on a false analogy, as if from forth.\n\n\u00b6 These are false forms, made through confusion to resemble further and furthest. The forms in A.S. are fyrra and ferrest, in Chaucer ferre and ferrest (Prol. 48, 494). Far as a comparative is found in Shakspeare,\u2014 \"Far than D\u00e9calon off\" (Wint. T. iv. 3).\n\n** The r in uttermost, innermost, &c., is merely phonetic, not formative. In Anglo-Saxon we find hindemest, eyfemest, innemest, &c.\n\n\u2020\u2020 It is likely enough, however, that some of these words (as hithermost, middlemost, undermost, topmost) were really formed under the false conception that -most was the superlative adverb. We even find the comparative more in the double comparative furthermore. Topmost and endmost are formed by a false analogy from nouns.\nseverer, severest; and some others, as pleasantest, pleasantest; narrower, narrowest, &c. The older writers often use more and most with monosyllabic adjectives, as more strong, more sad.\n\n118. Combinations like more learned, most virtuous, may be called degrees of comparison, though not inflected, just as 'shall go' is called the future tense of the verb 'go.' This analytic mode of comparison is of Norman-French origin. Double comparatives and superlatives are common in the older writers, as 'worse,' 'more braver,' 'the most unkindest cut of all' (Shaksp); 'the most straitest sect,' &c.\n\n119. Some comparatives, as near, outer, inner, have come to denote the relation of an object to a certain standard or starting point.\n\nARTICLE.\n\n120. The Articles\u2020 are not a separate part of speech; they belong to the Demonstrative or Relational Adjectives (\u00a7 97). There are two Articles, the Indefinite Article an or a, and the Definite Article the.\n\n121. The Indefinite Article an is another form of the numeral one (A.S. \u00e1n). It indicates that we are speaking either of some one, or of any one of the things for which the noun is a name, as, 'I saw an old man'; 'A (i.e., any) child should obey its parents.'\n\n122. The form an is used before words beginning with a vowel sound or mute h, as an apple, an heir.\n\nAn drops the n,\u2020 and becomes a before words beginning with a consonant, the aspirate h, or the letter u when the sound of y is put before the u in pronunciation, as A man, a horse, a yellow ball, a useful book. But an is kept before the aspirate when the accent is not upon the first syllable of the word, as 'an historical event.'\n\n123. In some expressions what is now commonly regarded as the indefinite article a was originally a weakened form of the preposition on (=in).\u00a7\n\n* Euphony is the guide in this matter. The suffixes er and est were more freely employed by the earlier writers. Thus, e.g., we find unhopefullest in Shakspeare, honourablest in Bacon, virtuousest in Fuller, &c. In poetical diction comparatives and superlatives in er and est are allowed which are not usual in ordinary prose, such as divinest, perfectest, propeatest.\n\n\u2020 Latin articulus (Greek \u1f01\u03c1\u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03c2), 'a joint.' The term was first used by Aristotle to denote the pronouns generally, as being the 'joints' or 'sockets' by which the real limbs of language, the Noun and the Verb, were jointed together. The Stoics distinguished the Definite Articles (i.e. the Personal Pronouns) from the Indefinite Articles (i.e. the other pronouns, including what we call the Definite Article). The grammarians of Alexandria separated the Article from the Pronoun. (See more in Lersch and Peile.)\n\n\u2021 In Old English the form a or o is found for an (as ae in Scotch for ane), even when used as a numeral. We still say 'They are both of a size,' i.e., of one size.\n\nAn was sometimes employed in Anglo-Saxon as the Indefinite Article. Thus, e.g., 'Job ascrappon wyrm of his lice mid anum crosccearde' ('Job scraped the corruption off his body with a potsherd,' Alfr. Hom.). Its regular use in this manner was not established till after the Norman Conquest. From its origin and meaning an or a occupies a kind of border land between the Quantitative and the Demonstrative Adjectives.\n\n\u00a7 It is going too far, however, to assert that the Indefinite Article was never used with a distributive force. In 'A shilling a pound,' a = on or in would be without meaning. It is here undoubtedly the article or numeral a, as it is also in \"\u00e1n gear \u00e1n man,\" \"[they ruled] a year a (= each) man\" (Alfr. Transl. of Oros, ii. 2, 3).\nThus 'Twice a week' was 'tuwa on wucan' (Luke xviii. 12. See Koch, ii. p. 85; Morris, Hist. Outl.)\n\n124. The Definite Article the is used to designate among all the things denoted by a noun that one, or those, that we are speaking of.\n\n125. The definite article the is a weakened form of the neuter of the old demonstrative se, sed, that, which in Anglo-Saxon, besides its ordinary force, had the weaker force of the article.*\n\n126. (A) The is used to mark out in a class the particular thing or things that we are speaking of. It does this (1) by directing attention to some previous mention of the thing, as \"He was armed with a rapier and a dagger; the rapier he held in his right hand, and the dagger in his left\"; (2) by pointing to a proper (or individual) name by which a common or general name is particularized, as \"The Emperor Augustus\"; (3) by directing attention to some attributive adjunct by which the individual is distinguished. Thus when we say 'the black horse,' the points attention to the adjective black. When we say 'the Queen of England,' the points to the adjunct 'of England;' (4) The also indicates that particular thing with which we have some obvious connection or concern, or which has some obvious claim to precedence in our thoughts, as when we say the sun, the moon, the Queen, the City, the Church, &c. The definite article does for objects in the sphere of conception what the demonstrative that does for visible objects within our view.\n\n(B) The word the is used to show that one individual is taken as the representative of its class, as when we talk of the lion, the eagle, or to show that we are speaking of the whole of the class to which the name belongs, as when we speak of the stars, the English, the good, the Alps, or before an abstract noun used in the concrete sense, to show that the noun is taken in its whole significance, as 'the nobility,' 'the aristocracy.'\n\nThere is a corresponding use of the when it occurs before an adjective, when the two together form a universal concrete name, as 'the sublime,' 'the ridiculous.'\n\nRespecting the word the (the old instrumental case of that) in such phrases as \"the sooner the better\" (= 'by how much the sooner, by so much the better'), see under the head of Pronominal Adverbs.\n\n* The neuter that was early employed in the Northern dialect as a demonstrative for all genders, and was ere long supplanted (when used as an article) by the uninflected form the. Later this form was adopted in the Southern dialect, which retained the inflected demonstrative or article longer than the Northern. In 'Cursor Mundi' and Hampole we find the, this, and that used just as in modern English, while the contemporary Southern dialect had twelve inflected forms of this, and fifteen of the or that. (Murray, Dial. of S. Counties of Scotland, p. 181)\n\nIn early writers of the Northern dialect are found the curious forms the tone and the tother. These were no doubt nothing more than that one and that other divided wrongly. Similarly another was divided a-nother, and nither became an independent word (Murray, l.c. p. 176).\nPRONOUN.\n\n127. A Pronoun * (Latin pro, 'for,' nomen, 'name') is a word used instead of a noun, as when the speaker, instead of naming himself, or the person to or of whom he is speaking, says, 'I am rich'; 'You said so'; 'He that is down need fear no fall.' Demonstrative Pronouns enable us to avoid the repetition of a noun that has already been used, as 'John has come home, he is very tired,' instead of 'John is very tired.'\n\n128. The real function of Pronouns would, however, be better expressed by the following\n\nDefinition.\u2014Pronouns are words which designate persons or things by their relation to other persons or things. (See \u00a7 26.)\n\nThus I, Thou, We, designate certain persons by means of their mutual relation, as speaking, or spoken to. This and that designate something by its relation of nearness to, or distance from me. Either designates a thing by its alternative relation to some other thing.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PRONOUNS.\n\n129. Pronouns are divided into two classes, Substantive Pronouns and Adjective Pronouns.\n\n130. TABLE OF THE PRONOUNS.\n\n| Substantive | Adjective |\n|-------------|-----------|\n| I. Personal | I, thou, we, you or ye |\n| II. Demonstrative | he, she, it, they |\n| III. Relative | that |\n| IV. Interrogative and Relative | who, what |\n| V. Indefinite | one, aught, naught |\n| VI. Distributive | ... ... ... |\n| VII. Possessive | ... ... ... |\n\n* The term Pronoun is based upon the wider signification of the term Noun as including both the Noun Substantive and the Noun Adjective (see \u00a7 25). The etymological definition of it is, however, imperfect and misleading. The words I, thou, we, you, do a great deal more than replace nouns (see the definitions of the Personal Pronouns). Avoidance of repetition is only one of the purposes served even by demonstrative pronouns, and is never a function of the Personal Pronouns.\n\nWords like horse, red, &c., are limited in their application; but there is nothing that may not, in its relation to something else, be spoken of by means of a Pronoun. The name of this Part of Speech in Sanskrit signified 'Name for everything.'\nPRONOUN.\n\nSubstantive. Adjective.\n\nVIII. Reflective: \\{ self and selves in myself, ourselves, &c. \\} self and selves in himself, themselves, &c.\n\nThe Nominative Case I is always written with a Capital letter.\n\nI.\u2014PERSONAL PRONOUNS.\n\n131. The Personal Pronoun of the First Person is the pronoun which is used when a person speaks of himself singly, or of himself in conjunction with one or more others, without using any names. It is made up of the following forms:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nominative Case | I |\n| [Possessive Case] | [Mine or My] |\n| Objective Case | Me |\n\n| We |\n| [Our] |\n| Us |\n\n132. The Personal Pronoun of the Second Person is the pronoun which is used when we speak of the person or persons spoken to. It is declinable, and has the following forms:\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Nominative Case | Thou |\n| [Possessive Case] | [Thine or Thy] |\n| Objective Case | Thee |\n\n| Ye or You |\n| [Your] |\n| You or Ye |\n\n133. Ye was once exclusively nominative, and you objective (ye from A.S. g\u00e9, you from \u00e9ow), but even the best writers sometimes used ye as the objective,* and now you is indifferently nominative and objective.\n\n134. In Anglo-Saxon only the singular forms of this pronoun were used in addressing a single person. In ordinary usage the singular is now restricted to solemn addresses, as in prayer to the Deity and in poetry. In Shakspeare's time the singular was also used as the pronoun of affection towards children\u2020 or friends, of good-natured superiority to servants, and of contempt or anger to strangers\u2021 (Abbott, Sh. Gr. p. 153.) At a very early period the plural came to be used in speaking to a single person. It was at first employed as a mark of special respect (as when a subject speaks to a king, or a son to his father), as though the person addressed were as good as two or more ordinary people.\u00a7 You and your are now the ordinary pronouns of address, whether we are speaking to one person, or to more than one.\n\n135. The Personal Pronouns have, properly speaking, no Possessive Case, that is to say, no Possessive Case with the force of a substantive. In Anglo-Saxon, when the genitives of these pronouns were used in\n\n---\n\n* 'His wrath, which one day will destroy ye both' (Milton). 'The more shame for ye, holy men I thought ye' (Shakspeare). In the English Bible ye is nominative and you objective.\n\n\u2020 In Spenser you, as a nominative, is emphatic, ye is unemphatic.\n\n\u2021 'If thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amiss' (Twelfth N. iii. 2).\n\n\u00a7 'Prithee don't thee and thou me: I believe I am as good a man as yourself' (Miller of Mansfield).\n\n\u00a7 The use of the first person plural by royal personages has a similar origin.\nthe possessive sense, they were regarded as adjectives and inflected accordingly.* As the possessive sense is the only one in which we have retained these forms, they should now be regarded as adjectives. My and thy are short forms of mine and thine.\n\n135a. We is not, in the ordinary sense, the plural of I; it does not imply a simple repetition of myself. Indeed, the notion involved in I does not admit of plurality.+ \n\n136. The pronouns of the first and second persons do not mark distinctions of gender, because when a person speaks of himself or to another person, the sex, being evident, does not need to be marked, and the plural forms may include persons of different sexes.\n\n137.

In early English it was sometimes blended with the verb following \u00a7 as ichabbe = 'I have'; ichill = 'I will.'\n\nDEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.\n\nA.\u2014THE PERSONAL PRONOUN OF THE THIRD PERSON.\n\n138. What is commonly called the Personal Pronoun of the\n\n---\n\n* In Anglo-Saxon these genitives, when used as substantives, were governed by verbs, &c., or used in the partitive sense, as 'gemun \u00feu m\u00edn' (remember thou me) = memineris mei. This substantive use of m\u00edn and \u00fein did not last beyond the Anglo-Saxon stage of our language. The substantive use of our (\u00farc) and your (\u00e9ower) lasted till a later period. Thus in Chaucer (Prol. 823) we find \"oure aller cok\" = the cock of us all; in Piers Plowman \"Youre aller hele\" = 'the salvation of you all' (aller, alder, or alther is the same as the A.S. genitive e\u00e1tra). So later still \"For both our sakes.\" The abbreviated forms my and thy were not employed till the substantive use of m\u00edn and \u00fein had disappeared.\n\n\u2020 In Sanskrit the forms equivalent to we and ye signified 'I and he,' or 'I and these,' and 'Thou and he,' or 'Thou and these' (Koch, i. p. 463).\n\n\u2021 The forms of the Pronoun of the First Person come from two different stems. Ik is connected with the Latin ego, the Greek \u03b5\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd and the Sanskrit ah\u0101r. The remaining forms belong to a stem ma, of which the m gets weakened to a w in the plural (Koch, i. p. 463). Us has lost an n, which is found in Gothic and the modern German uns. (Compare goose, tooth, &c.).\n\n\u00a7 So in King Lear (iv. 6, 211), in an imitation of the west country dialect, we find chill = 'I will,' chud = 'I would.'\nThird Person is the Pronoun which is used for speaking of persons or things different both from the speaker and from the person spoken to. It is more correct to call it the Demonstrative Pronoun* of the Third Person. It is inflected for number, case, and gender.\n\n| Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |\n|-----------|----------|--------|\n| Nominative Case | He | She | It |\n| Possessive Case | His | Her | Its |\n| Objective Case | Him\u2020 | Her | It |\n\nPlural.\n\n| Nominative Case | They |\n| Possessive Case | Their |\n| Objective Case | Them |\n\nFor all genders.\n\n139. The plural forms must be ambiguous as to gender, because they may be used when speaking of persons of different sexes, or of persons and things together.\n\n140. She (she or sheo) comes from the feminine demonstrative seo.\u2021 The proper feminine of he is heo, of which a later form hoo is still heard in Lancashire, &c. Heo kept its ground in the Midland and Southern dialects long after seo or she had been adopted in the Northern.\n\nIt was in A.S. hit. The t is a neuter suffix, like d in i-d, quo-d, &c. The regular genitive or possessive case of hit was his, as \"If the salt have lost his savour,\" &c. The possessive case its is of comparatively modern origin.\u00a7 It is found in Shakspeare, but even there his is more common. There is only one example || of it in the English Bible (Lev. xxv. 5). Him continued to be used as an objective of it down to a late period.\u00b6\n\n141. All the modern plural forms of this pronoun, together with the nominative of the feminine singular, are borrowed from the demonstrative seo, seo, \u00fe\u00e6t. The genitive plural her, hir or hire, and the objective plural hem were in use (as in Chaucer) for some time after thai or they had been adopted for the nominative in standard English, and after they had themselves disappeared from the Northern dialect.**\n\n142. The genitive cases of this pronoun were not declined as adjectives in Anglo-Saxon.\u2020\u2020 Their retained a substantive force after the other\n\n---\n\n* It is obvious that the signification of a Personal Pronoun ought to be complete in itself. But in \"He to-day that sheds his blood with me\"; \"They in France of the best rank,\" &c., he and they only point to the description that follows.\n\n\u2020 Him and them were once dative cases. (See \u00a7 80, note.)\n\n\u2021 The characteristic s appears in the Gothic si, the old Saxon siu and the German sie.\n\n\u00a7 The form its is not only a late, but a false form; the neuter suffix t should have been dropped in the possessive, s in \u00fe\u00e6t from \u00fe\u00e6t.\n\n|| And even there it is a misprint, the original version having it, an uninflected possessive not uncommon in early English, as \"Go to it grandam, child, and it grandam will give it a plum\" (Shaksp. K. J. ii. 1). See note i. \u00a7 76.\n\n\u00b6 Thus in Lily's grammar we read \"The Subjunctive Mood hath commonly some conjunction joined with him.\"\n\n** The colloquial abbreviation a for the third personal pronoun occurs in old writers. \"A brushes his hat o' mornings... A rubs himself with civet\" (Much Ado, iii. 2). It is still a provincial idiom. It is even used as a plural (Koch, i. p. 469).\n\n\u2020\u2020 Traces of inflexion, however, appear later, as in the Ormulum (Koch, i. p. 473, ii. p. 234. Mitzner, i. p. 316).\npossessives had become pronominal adjectives. Traces of their substantive force still exist in their use as antecedents to relatives; as, \"whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation.\" \"Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God.\" They may now, however, be classed with the other possessives.\n\n143. ANGLO-SAXON FORMS\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Masc.    | Fem.   | Neut. | hi (hig) |\n| Nom.     | h\u00e9     | he\u00f3   | hit     |\n| Gen.     | his    | hire  | his     |\n| Dat.     | him    | hire  | him     |\n| Acc.     | hine   | h\u00ed (hig) | hit |\n\nFORMS OF THE TIME OF CHAUCER.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Masc.    | Fem.   | Neut. | Of all Genders |\n| Nom.     | he     | she, sche | hit, it |\n| Gen.     | his    | hire, hir | his |\n| Obj.     | him    | hire, hir, here | hit, it |\n\nB.\u2014POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS,\n\n144. Besides the simple possessives her, our, your, their, we use the secondary or double possessive forms, hers, ours, yours, theirs.* These are only used when the noun to which they relate is not expressed, as, \"My pen is a bad one, give me yours.\" In modern English prose mine and thine follow the same rule. In poetry mine and thine are often used for my and thy before a vowel or mute 'h.\n\nIn the phrases of mine, of yours (as 'a book of mine') some grammarians\u2020 consider that we have a repetition of the idea of possession.\n\nC.\u2014THE DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS THIS AND THAT.\n\n145. The word this (pl. these) and that (pl. those) may be used both as adjectives and as substantives. They refer to persons now only when used adjectively.\n\n146. This and That may be used as real demonstratives (to\n\n* Compare the double superlatives (\u00a7 118). It is now usual to omit the apostrophe in these words, but as the older forms were owre, yowres, &c., there is no valid reason for not putting it. Another class of double possessives, owrn, yowrn, &c., though as good as the others, are not recognized in polite English.\n\n\u2020 The general explanation is that \"a book of mine\" means \"a book of my books\" (Latham, Eng. Lang., p. 443). If this were necessarily the case, such an expression as \"this sweet wee wife of mine,\" in Burns's song, would suggest unpleasant ideas of bigamy. Koch (ii. p. 236) suggests the explanation that of is partitive, and mine, &c., universal in sense, so that of mine means 'of all that belongs to me.' Perhaps the true explanation is that the of does little more than mark identity, as in the expressions, 'The city of Rome,' 'A brute of a fellow.' In 'a book of yours,' we have a triple expression of the possessive idea, in of, r, and s.\npoint to things themselves). In this case *This* points to what is 'near me,' *That* points to what is 'at a distance from me,' as 'This book,' 'That chair.'\n\n*This* and *That* may also be used as logical demonstratives (to refer to some description or name), as 'The general was in command of a large force. *This* force consisted of infantry and artillery.' They often refer to whole sentences or to the general idea conveyed by a preceding phrase, as, \"I know that he is innocent, and *this* is my chief consolation\"; \"Lend me a shilling, *that's* a good fellow.\" Here *that* = 'a person who will lend a shilling.'\n\nWhen two things which have been already mentioned are referred to, *this* refers to what has been mentioned last, *that* refers to what was mentioned before it; as \"Virtue and vice offer themselves for your choice: *this* leads to misery, *that* to happiness.\"\n\n147 The adverbs *there* and *here*, combined with another adverb, form compounds which are often substituted for *that* and *this* preceded by prepositions; thus *therein* = *in that*; *hereby* = *by this.*\n\n148.\n\n**ANGLO-SAXON FORMS.**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| Masc.    | Fem.   | Neut. | M.

It will be seen from the above table that *this* and *that* are neuter forms, which have come to be used for all genders.* This simplification was first introduced in the Northern dialect.\n\nWhen *p\u00e1* came to be used as the plural of *he, she, it,* two forms of it were adopted, *thai,* *thei,* or *they* for the Personal Pronoun, *tha* or *tha* for the demonstrative adjective. *Thei* and *tha* are thus used in Chaucer, &c. Apparently from confusion with the plural of *this,* the Northern and Midland dialects adopted a form *thas* or *those* for the plural of *that,* as well as *tha* or *tho,* and then *this* received a new plural *thir* (a Scandinavian form), *thise,* or *these.* Ultimately *thas* (*those*) was discarded from the Northern dialect, and *tha* or *tho* from the Midland dialect; but the latter retained *thas* (*those*), which passed into modern English. In vulgar and provincial English *they* and *them* are still used as plural forms of *that.*\n\nThe instrumental case *b\u00fd* appears in the form *the* in \"the sooner the better,\" &c.\n\n* As substantives *this* and *that* were formerly used with reference to either number, as \"*P\u00eds sindon p\u00e1 d\u00f3mas*\" (*this* are the decrees); \"*P\u00e1et were Brut and hys*\" (Rob. GL).\nD.\u2014THE DEMONSTRATIVES SO, SUCH, AND YON.\n\n150. So (A.S. s: 'a) still exists as a pronoun * (not adverb); as in \"I drank a pint or so (i.e. or about that quantity) of beer\"; \"I told you so (= that)\"; \"Is that man your friend? He is so.\"\n\nSuch (A.S. swilc or swylc) is a compound of swy or swt, the instrumental case of swa (so) and lic (like). It appears in early English in a great variety of forms, swulc, swulch, sulch, swuch, switch, swich. The form in Chaucer is swich. The form sich (answering to which) is considered vulgar.\u2020\n\nSuch is commonly the equivalent of the Latin talis ('of that sort'); but it sometimes drops its reference to quality, and is a mere demonstrative,\u2021 as in \"If you repay me not on such a day, in such a place, such sum or sums,\" &c. (M. of V.).\n\nYon, from the A.S. geond (= be-yond) is now a demonstrative adjective. It has the same root as the German jen-er.\n\nRELATIVE PRONOUNS.\n\n151. A Relative \u00a7 Pronoun is a word which refers to some noun or pronoun already used to denote the person or thing spoken about, and called the antecedent of the relative, and which joins the clause in which it stands to that which precedes it. Thus, in the sentence, 'He is reading about the battle that was fought at Hastings,' that refers to the noun battle, which is called the antecedent to the relative that, and joins the clause 'that was fought at Hastings' to the word 'battle' in the preceding clause. In 'This is the man whose house we saw,' whose refers to man, and man is the antecedent to whose.\n\n* We are so accustomed to so as an adverb, that we are apt to think that it must always have been one. But as an adverb, it was in origin only a modification of a pronoun. There is no adverbial force in swa or so in swa-hwa-swia or whosoh. In the Ormulum we find whasunum (= whosoh), made with the pronoun sum (some). In Piers Plowman (1721) occurs the phrase \"by so (= provided that) ye hadde my silver.\" Here so must of course be a demonstrative pronoun. In old-fashioned German so was used as a relative pronoun.\n\n\u2020 Modern standard English has preserved only one of three demonstrative pronouns compounded of lic (= like), namely such. The other two were ylc or ilk (still used in Scotch), made with f or y, the instrumental form of the root hi or i (in he, it), and thilk or thylc, compounded of by and lic. Thuck or theck (= that) is still in use in Wiltshire, &c. Thilke is used by Chaucer (Prol. 182).\n\n\u2021 In A.S. swylc was a relative (= qualis) as well as a demonstrative (= talis), as \"Swylce gedrefednessa swylce ne gewurdon,\" = 'Such tribulations such (= which or as) were not' (Mark xiii. 19).\n\n\u00a7 Relative is a bad name, because it is insufficient. He, the, it, that also relate to an antecedent substantive, and therefore have an equally good right to be called Relative Pronouns. Is, ipse, &c., were in fact called relative pronouns by the ancient grammarians (Priscian xii. : xvii. 9). The essential characteristic of the so-called Relative Pronouns is, that they are connective pronouns, and have the power of grammatical subordination. The best name for them would be Subjunctive Pronouns. This would, in fact, only be a revival of the Articulus Subjunctivus of the Latin grammarians (Priscian, l. c.).\n152. The Relative Pronouns in English are the following:\n\n(1.) THE RELATIVE PRONOUN THAT.\n\nThat is the oldest of our relative pronouns.* It is the neuter of the Anglo-Saxon demonstrative se, seo, that, used now for all genders. All relative pronouns were once demonstrative or interrogative. In old English the relative or connective force was given to the demonstrative pronoun \u2020 by doubling the demonstrative word, an indeclinable particle be (the), which was, in fact, only a weakened form of the ordinary demonstrative, being placed after se, seo, that. Sometimes the demonstrative dropped out, and the indeclinable the appeared as a relative; sometimes the was dispensed with, and the simple demonstrative itself was used as a relative. That is always a substantive; it may relate either to persons or to things. It is now uninflected,\u2020 and never has a preposition placed before it. If it is governed by a preposition, the preposition is put at the end of the sentence.\u00a7\n\nThat cannot now be used in all cases where who can be used. Who sometimes has a merely continuative force, being equivalent to and he (see Syntax, adjective clauses), but a clause beginning with that\n\n* Addison is quite wrong when in his \"Humble Petition of who and which\" he makes the petitioners say: \"We are descended of ancient families, and kept up our dignity and honour many years, till the Jack Sprat that supplanted us.\" \"That came into use during the twelfth century to supply the place of the indeclinable relative the, and in the fourteenth century it is the ordinary relative. In the sixteenth century which often supplies its place; in the seventeenth century who replaces it. About Addison's time that had again come into fashion, and had almost driven which and who out of use\" (Morris). Steele ridicules the too common use of that in the sentence: \"My lords, with humble submission, that I say is this; that that that gentleman has advanced is not that that he should have proved to your lordships\" (Spect. 80). (Ben Jonson's statement that which was the only relative is incomprehensible in view of the usage of his time.)\n\n\u2020 The connective or subordinative force of that is not inherent in the pronoun itself, but is infused into it by the intelligence of the hearer. Originally the principal clause and the relative clause were co-ordinate, as \"Se h\u00e6f\u00f0 bry\u00f0, se is bry\u00f0guma\" = \"He has the bride, he is the bridegroom.\" The preponderating importance of the defining clause was marked by strengthening or doubling the demonstrative, the uninflected form be being appended to the inflected form:\u2014 \"Se \u00fee bry\u00f0 h\u00e6f\u00f0, se is bry\u00f0guma\" = \"He that has the bride,\" &c.\n\nThe indeclinable \u00fee could even give a connective or relative force to the Personal Pronouns, as \"Fader \u00fee \u00feu \u00fee eart on heolenum,\" \"Our Father which (= thou that) art in heaven\"; \"Ic com Gabriel, ic \u00fee stande beforan Gode\" (\"I am Gabriel, who stand before God\"). Compare der ich, der du, &c., in German.\n\n\u2021 The want of inflexion was formerly supplied by putting the requisite form of the demonstrative pronoun of the third person where it would indicate the construction of the relative. Thus in Chaucer, A knight ther was . . . That from the time that he first began To ryden out, he lovede chyvalrye (Prol. 43), where that \u2014 he = who. 'A litel clergeon . . . That day by day to scole was his wone' (Prior, T., where that \u2014 his = whose). It answers to a well-known vulgar use of which:\u2014 'Let her take a jolly pliceman, Which perhaps his name is X.' (Thackeray). This idiom is still common in Lowland Scotch, as:\u2014\"The man at (= that) his weyfe's deid,\" 'The man whose wife is dead' (Murray, L. c. p. 196). This construction was common in Anglo-Saxon with the uninflected be, as \"Eadig ys se \u00fee \u00feo \u00fee hys hlaford hyne gemet\" = 'Blessed is the servant whom (= that him) his lord finds,' &c. At is the common relative in Lowland Scotch. It is also found in Hampole (e.g. 171). At is the Scandinavian form of that.\n\n\u00a7 In such cases we should perhaps regard the preposition as an adverb forming a compound with the verb. Formerly the preposition (or adverb) was placed before the verb, as though we should say \"the land which they in-lived\"; \"the settlement which they from were-driven\" (Koch, ii. p. 260). This idiom was first adopted for the uninflected the and that, and afterwards extended to the other relatives.\nlimits the noun to which it refers, and is therefore improper when that noun does not admit of further limitation. Hence we cannot say 'Thomas that died yesterday,' or 'My father that is in America.' That was formerly used like what, with its antecedent understood,* as \"That thou doest, do quickly\" (John xiii. 27).\n\n(2.)\u2014THE INTERROGATIVE AND RELATIVE PRONOUNS\n\nWHO, WHAT, WHICH, WHETHER.\n\n153. The pronoun who, neuter what (A.S. hwa,\u2020 neuter hwat) was in Anglo-Saxon an Interrogative Pronoun.\n\nModern Forms.\n\n| Nom. Who \u2020 | Nom. hwa | hwat |\n| Poss. Whose | Gen. hw\u00e6s | hw\u00e6s |\n| Obj. Whom | Dat. hw\u00e1m (hw\u00e6m) | hw\u00e1m (hw\u00e6m) |\n| Acc. | hwone (hw\u00e6ne) | hwat |\n| Inst. | | hwi (hw\u012b) |\n\n154. What has the neuter suffix t. It is the neuter of who. It is now indeclinable, and is used not only as a substantive, but also as an adjective.\u00a7 When used as a substantive it is neuter.\n\n155. Which (A.S. hwylc or hwilc), is a compound of hwol or hwyl (the old instrumental case of hwa), and llc (like). In Scotch it is still quhilk. It was equivalent to the Latin qualis, 'of what sort?'|| It is properly an adjective, as \"Which dress do you prefer?\" but is also used substantively, as \"Here are por and sherry, which will you take?\" Which asks for one out of a definite number;\u00b6 who and what ask indefinitely.\n\n* In such sentences, however, we might regard that as the antecedent of a suppressed relative (see Adjective Clauses in the Syntax). This is actually the construction of \"Gebrygde \u00fe\u00e6s on \u00fe\u00e6m beame geweoxo,\" \"Tasted of that [which] grew on the tree\" (Caedmon, Gen. 483). But it is the antecedent which is omitted in \"\u00deonne abirst \u00fet \u00fe\u00e6s \u00fee he swygian sceold\u00eb, then bursts out [that] about which he should be silent\" (Alf. Trans. of Cura Past).\n\n\u2020 Hwa has the same root as the Latin quis and qui. H was guttural in A.S. We still pronounce the h before the w in what, &c.\n\n\u2021 Note that these are all singular forms. So in Latin se, sui, sibi are singular forms, even when they relate to more than one.\n\n\u00a7 Like the neuters this and that it was used predicatively in Anglo-Saxon as a substantive without regard to gender and number, as \"Hw\u00e6t syndon ge?\" (what are ye?). It was often followed by the genitive case, as \"hw\u00e6t godes?\" (what of good?); \"hw\u00e6t weorces?\" (what of work?). When the genitive suffix came to be dropped, except when it denoted possession, these combinations gave rise to an apparently adjectival use of what, which was subsequently admitted before masculine and feminine as well as before neuter nouns. What is used adjectively with an intensive force in exclamations, as \"What a fool he was!\"; \"What knaves they are.\" In old English which was similarly used, as \"O, which a pitous thing it was\" (Chaucer, CL T. 1086).\n\nWhat is sometimes used as an adverb, as \"What (i.e. for what purpose) need we any further witness?\" \"Lord, what these weathers are cold\" (Wakefield Myst.).\n\n|| \"He wiste hwat and hwylc \u00feys wif ware,\" \"He would have known what, and of what sort this woman was.\" This sense has now vanished.\n\n\u00b6 This restriction is, however, purely arbitrary.\n156. Whether (A.S. hwe\u00f0er) is derived from who (hwu) by means of the suffix ther,* and means 'which of the two?'\n\nWHO, WHAT, and WHICH as RELATIVES.\n\n157. From being simply Interrogatives, the above Pronouns (like quis and ris) acquired the force of Indefinite Pronouns,\u2020 meaning some (or any) one or thing, especially after if (gif). We still have this sense in the phrase \"As who should say,\" (i.e. 'as should some one say,' or 'as [if] some one should say'), and in the compounds somewhat, &c. They were then converted into Indefinite Relatives by the addition of the pronouns so, some, or that \u2020 (which had already acquired a connective or subordinative sense), the compounds of so being often strengthened by the addition of ever.\n\nWhoso and Whoever are not now declined, but soever may be added to all the three cases of who.\n\n158. Lastly who, which, and what were used as relatives without so or that appended.\u00a7\n\nWho refers only to persons. Its antecedent is sometimes omitted, as \"Who steals my purse, steals trash.\"\n\nWhat was originally the neuter of who, and, as a substantive, refers only to an antecedent that is neuter and singular. It is also used adjectively, as \"I gave him what help I could;\" \"What time I am afraid, I will trust in Thee.\" The possessive case of it (whose = hwces or whas), is still in use, though rarely employed except in poetry: as \"The question whose solution I require\" (Dryden); \"I could a tale unfold, whose lightest word,\" &c. (Shakspeare); \"The roof, whose thickness was not vengeance proof\" (Byron). Whom is no longer used as a neuter objective.||\n\nWhen what is used as a relative in modern English, the antecedent is\n\n* Uter (once guuter or cuter, from quis) is precisely analogous to whether, as is \u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 from the cognate root \u03c0\u03bf.\n\n\u2020 That is to say, in order to indicate a person or thing as yet unknown or undetermined, a word was employed that asked who or what it was. This use of the interrogative was quite common in Anglo-Saxon, as \"gif hwa eow \u00e6nig \u00feing t\u00f3 cw\u00fd\u00f0\" (Matt. xxi. 3), 'If any one say anything to you,' 'Gif eow hwylc seg\u00f0' (Mark xiii. 21), 'If any man say to you,' In 'I'll tell you what,' what = something. The derived adverbs when, where, how, &c., had in like manner an indefinite sense. We still say somewhere, somehow, &c.\n\n\u2021 Chaucer still uses that or as for a mark of relativity or subordination after who and its derivatives, as \"Who that I serve\" (Kn. T. 373); 'Catoun which that was so wis a man' (Y. P. T. 120). Similarly \"when that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept\" (Shaksp.); \"when as sacred light began to dawn\" (Milton). Whereas still keeps its ground. In A.S. swa was placed before as well as after the hwa, swa-hwa-swa. In the Ormulum we find whasnum and whatsnum for whose and whatso. This formation is still preserved in the (now vulgar) words whatsoever, howsoever, &c., sometimes turned into whatsomed-er, &c.\n\n\u00a7 What (hwe\u00f0) was sometimes a relative in A.S., as \"\u00fe\u00e6t hw\u00e6t David dyde\" = 'that what David did' (Luke vi. 3). The genitive and dative of who were used as relatives earlier than the nominative. What (who) as a relative in the nominative is first found in the Ormulum (l. 945). See March, A.S. Gram. p. 179.\n\n|| In Wycliffe we find \"The tyge tree whomt thou cursedist\" (Mark xi. 21).\nENGLISH GRAMMAR.\n\nsuppressed.* In poetry it is sometimes followed by that, as \"What he hath won, that hath he fortified\" (King J. iii 4).\n\n159. Instead of what, the ordinary relative relating to animals or things is which. (\u00a7 155.)\n\n160. It is, however, quite a mistake to call 'which' the neuter of 'who.' It was formerly used like 'who,' as \"Our Father which art in heaven.\" In Chaucer it is followed by that ('which that,' or 'the which that'), and long after was preceded by the, as in the English Bible and Shakspeare. (Compare the French le quel.)\n\n161. The proper correlative of which is such (\u00a7 150), as \"Such which must go before\" (Bacon). Such\u2014which = talis\u2014qualis.\n\n162. Which preceded by a preposition is often replaced by where, as wherein = in which; whereto = to which, &c.\n\n163. Who and which can always be used where that\u2020 can be used. They have also a continuative force, which that never has. (See \u00a7 152.)\n\n164. The relative pronoun is frequently understood, as, \"That is the person I spoke of,\" \"for the person whom I spoke of.\" But it is not now omitted unless, if expressed, it would be in the objective case.\n\n(3.)\u2014THE RELATIVE PRONOUN AS.\n\n165. The word as (A.S. ealswa=also, i.e. all so, German als) is often used as a relative pronoun, especially after same and such; as, \"This is not the same as that;\" \"His character is not such as I admire.\" So also in the phrases as to and as for, as is a relative pronoun, the subject of a verb understood. In \"As to that, I have nothing to say,\" \"as to that\" = 'quod ad hoc [attinet]' = 'what [relates] to that.' So in French 'quant \u00e0 vous' = quantum ad vos attinet. As is a strengthened form of so, which, as we have seen (\u00a7 150), is sometimes a pronoun, and, like that, might have a relative force.\u00a7\n\nINDEFINITE PRONOUNS.\n\n166. The numeral one is also an Indefinite Pronoun.\n\nThe numeral one is an indefinite demonstrative when used as the\n\n---\n\n* In the older writers we find all what, that what, &c., in some grammars what is called a compound relative. This is wrong and misleading. The name is absurd, because what is not a compound word at all, though large numbers of unfortunate learners are actually led to believe that what is made up of the beginning of which and the end of that. What is not even equivalent to that which; it is nothing more than a relative with its antecedent suppressed, like who in the sentence quoted above. Those who make what contain its own antecedent, should equally make the antecedent contain its own relative in \"That is the man I spoke of,\" and call 'man' a compound antecedent.\n\n\u2020 Some grammarians assert that who and which are not properly used to introduce a limiting or defining clause, and that in such sentences as \"That is the man who spoke to us yesterday,\" \"The house which he built still remains,\" the word that is preferable. The best writers of English prose do not countenance this view.\n\n\u2021 As is clearly an ordinary Relative Pronoun in Chaucer (Kn. T. 1000), \"his hundred as I spak of now.\" So in Maundeville (quoted by Skeat), \"Zaracon as was padre to Salahodyn.\" Mr. Skeat (Et. Dict. s. v.) considers as to be identical with the old Scandinavian relative es. This is an interesting view of the matter, but the analogy of the relative so used in old-fashioned German seems to show that the relative as may be treated as a compound of so.\n\n\u00a7 (noted by Mr. Skeat)\n\n|| \"Homo\"\narticle an. It has long been used in the sense of 'some\u2014or other,' 'a certain.' Thus (as an adjective) \"His wrath which one day will destroy ye both\" (Milton); \"One Titus Oates had drawn on himself censure, &c.\" (Macaulay). As a substantive it was used to denote some one, or more, of a class already named, as \"Get me some better pens, this is a bad one\" (or these are bad ones); and then came to be used as a general indefinite demonstrative, as \"One in a certain place testified\" (Heb. ii. 6). It is very common after some, each, and every, and is used in the plural, as \"That the poor may fall by his strong ones\" (Ps. x. 10). As an indefinite substantive it assumed the sense of the French on (=homme), as, \"A quiet conscience makes one so serene\" (Byron); \"A sonnet to one's mistress\" (Shakespeare). In this sense it at last ousted the old Anglo-Saxon word man (= German man), which we still find in Chaucer as men* or me, and which was also in part replaced by the indefinite they.\n\nNone (= ne \u00e1n) as a substantive in the singular\u2020 is now obsolete, having been replaced by no one. In everybody, somebody, &c., 'body' is used as a kind of indefinite pronoun.\n\n167. Aught (A.S. \u00e1wiht) is derived from the Anglo-Saxon substantive w\u00edht, a 'thing,' or 'creature' (used as a masculine\u2021 in wight) and \u00e1 = ever. The negative of aught is naught or nought. Not is the same word, used as an adverb.\n\n168. Any (\u00e1nig) is a derivative from \u00e1n, 'one,' just as ullus in Latin is a diminutive of unus (Key, Lat. Gr. \u00a7 334). It is properly an indefinite demonstrative adjective; as in \"Did you see any person?\" but it is also used as an indefinite quantitative adjective, referring either to number or to quantity, as 'I did not take any apples'; 'Will you have any bread?'\n\n169. Other implies 'not this one' (out of some two) (like the Latin alter). It is formed from the root an.\u00a7 a variation of the al of \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 and alter, by means of the comparative suffix ther (see \u00a7 155, note). As a substantive it has the ordinary inflexions of a noun.\n\n170. Some (A.S. sum) originally meant 'a certain' || (Lat. quidam). It still has this force in somebody, sometimes, something.\n\n* This men is not a plural; see e.g., 'That blisful yok which that men clepeth (sing.) spousail' (CL T. 115). The fact that man or men maintained its ground during the period when the influence of Norman-French was strongest, and only disappeared after that influence had ceased, is opposed to the idea that the indefinite one is identical with the French on = homme. This view, however, is held by Latham and other good authorities.\n\n\u2020 E.g., \"None better knows than you\" (M. for M. I. 3, 7).\n\n\u2021 \"He was a wight of high renown\" (Othello II. i, 159). We also employ it in the form whit ('not a whit') as a neuter.\n\n\u00a7 Not the an that means 'one.' In Moeso-Gothic 'one' is 'ain,' but 'other' is 'anthar,' (not ainthar).\n\n|| Thus \"sum man h\u00e6fde twegen suna,\" a certain man had two sons' (Luke xv. 11); \"His feonda sum,\" 'one of his enemies' (Matt. xiii. 25).\nIt now also denotes an undetermined part of a whole, and is used with numerals to give the sense of about, as \"He will last you some eight year or nine year\" (Hamlet). It is the pronoun of indefiniteness with respect either to quantity or to relation, as in \"I have some money\"; \"This is some monster of the isle.\"\n\nTHE DISTRIBUTIVE PRONOUNS.\n\n171. Each (A.S. \u0101lc = \u00e1-ge-hwylc,* i.e., 'ever every one of a sort,') is used both adjectively and substantively.\n\n172. In the phrases 'each other,' 'one another,' the two pronouns were formerly independent in their construction, as \"They foynen (thrust) ech at other\" (Chaucer, Kn. T. 796). \"With greedy force each other doth assail,\" (Spenser), i.e., \"each doth assail other.\" So in old-fashioned English we find 'each to other,' 'one from another,' and so on. Nowadays both pronouns are placed after the preposition, as \"They did not speak to each other for a week;\" \"They hear from one another daily.\" The pronouns must therefore now be regarded as forming a sort of compound like the Greek allelo\u00ed.\n\nIt is customary to use each other when two are referred to, one another when more than two are referred to, but this distinction does not spring out of the meaning of the words.\n\n173. Every (old English everelc, everilk, or everych, that is, ever each) is a compound of A.S. aefre, 'ever,' and \u0101lc, and denotes all of a series taken one by one.\n\nEach may refer to two or to more than two; every is now \u2020 used only with reference to more than two.\n\nIn Chaucer everych (every) is used as a substantive. We still say 'each and every' in legal phraseology.\n\nEvery has much the same meaning as each, but in a stronger form, equivalent to 'each without exception.'\n\n174. Either has two meanings and represents two separate words. 1. It means 'each of two,' as, \"On either side one\" (John xix. 18). In this sense it is the modern form of the Anglo-Saxon '\u00e6g\u00f0er' (\u00e6gther) = '\u00e1-ge-hw\u00e6\u00f0er,' a compound of \u00e1 = ever, and hw\u00e6\u00f0er = 'both,' where the syllable ge has its collective force (see \u00a7 171, note). 2. It means 'one of two, but not both.' In this sense it represents '\u00e1-hw\u00e6\u00f0er' ('ever some one of two'), but is, in fact, the modern form of \u00e6g\u00f0er, which has supplanted the\n\n* The particle ge was prefixed to the indefinite pronouns in Anglo-Saxon to give the idea of universality or aggregation, as ge-hwa = everyone; ge-hwylc = every one; ge-hw\u00e6\u00f0er = both. (Compare the German Gebriider and Geschwister.) These forms were strengthened by prefixing \u00e1 = ever. Hence came \u00e1-ge-hwylc = \u00e1lc = each; \u00e1-ge-hw\u00e6\u00f0er = \u00e1g\u00f0er = either. Both-lic (all-like) and \u00e1-ge-lic (ever alike) have also been suggested as etymologies.\n\n\u2020 Chaucer uses it when speaking of two, as \"Everych of hem help for to armen other\" (Kn. T. 793).\nform another, other or outher.* Neither (A.S. n\u00e1\u00f0er) is a compound of the latter and the negative ne, and used to be spelt nother or nouther, but has got assimilated to either.\n\n175. Either may be inflected as a substantive of the singular number, as \"Where either's fall determines both their fates.\"\n\nEach, every, either, and neither are always singular.\u2020\n\nREFLECTIVE PRONOUNS.\n\n176. The objective case of the Personal Pronouns, and of the demonstrative he, she, it, may be used in a reflective sense (Latin reflecto, 'I bend back'), when an action directly or indirectly affects the doer of it. Thus\u2014\n\n\"I'll disrobe me\" (Shakspeare, Cymb. v. i, 22).\n\"I can buy me twenty\" (Macb. iv. 2, 40).\n\"Prepare thee\" (Sh. M. Ven. iv. i, 324).\n\"Get thee wood enough\" (Tempest, ii. 2, 165).\n\"Signor Antonio commends him to you\" (M. V. iii. 2, 235).\n\"Let every soldier hew him down a bough\" (Macb. v. 44).\n\n177. In Anglo-Saxon the personal pronouns, i.e. whatever case they were used, were strengthened by having the adjective s\u012blf, i.e. self (= same \u2020) agreeing with them, as me s\u012blfum, his s\u012blfes, &c. But even in A.S. we find the curious idiom, that strengthened reflectives in the dative case (me-s\u012blf, us-s\u012blf, &c., made with an uninflected s\u012blf) were placed in apposition to pronouns in the nominative, in place of the inflected adjective s\u012blf or self ('I me s\u012blf,' 'we us s\u012blf,' &c.), or might be used as nominatives by themselves.\u00a7 Constructions of this type were common for all three persons, and are still used for the Third Person, himself, herself, &c.\n\nVery early, however, self came to be regarded as a substantive,|| and\n\n* In A.S. \u00c6\u00dfer existed side by side with \u00e6\u00dfer. Other or outher (= \u00e1-hw\u00e6\u00dfer) must not be confounded with the 'other' which = Gothic anthar (\u00a7 169). It is still used in some provincial dialects.\n\n\u2020 The older writers were not clear upon this point. Shakspeare frequently gives a plural sense to every and neither. Thus \"Every one to rest themselves betake\" (Rape of Lucrece, i. 2); \"When neither are alive\" (Cymb. iv. 2, 252).\n\n\u2021 In that s\u0113lf moment,\" = 'in that same moment' (Chaucer); \"That s\u0113lf (= same) mould\" (Shakspeare). Compare the compound self-same.\n\n\u00a7 Thus Pilatus hymself \u0101vrat ealle \u00fe\u0101 \u00feing (\"Pilate himself wrote all those things,\" Ern. Nic. 34); \"Hym self was on heofenas farenede\" (\"Himself was going to heaven,\" ib. 34); \"Hif himself wolde\" (\"if himself would,\" Piers Pl. 1268); \"Thei can himself devysse\" (Chaucer, R. N. T. 296); \"We us self\" (Chaucer, Cl. T. 168). We find an inflected form of self in early English. Thus:\u2014\"\u00deurh Godd Allmahhtig selffenn\" (Orm. 413); \"What = why) should he make himselfe wood, i.e. mad (Chaucer, Prol. 184). \"He loved his neighbour as himselfe\" (Prol. 825). Also with the nominative, \"I mysyven\" (Prol. 803). These examples show that the suffix -en was not restricted to marking the plural. It is not unlikely that the dative which seems to be in apposition to a nominative is rather a dative absolute. \"I myself did it\" = 'I, no one helping me, did it.'\n\n|| This substantive use of self is clearly seen in \"My own self,\" \"Your own selves,\" &c. Themselves seems to have the plural selves in apposition to them. The substantive self is found in A.S., as \"heora \u00e1g\u0113nes sylfes\" (M\u00e4tzner, ii. p. 11).\nwas preceded by the possessive pronouns (myself, thyself, ourselves,* yourselves). This combination was formerly (and quite as legitimately) used for the third person (his-self, their selves). The history of all these changes of usage is obscure and perplexing.\n\n178. There is nothing reflective about the word self, either as adjective or as substantive. (See e.g. \"He himself said so\"; \"I love you for yourself alone,\" &c.). The reflective force belongs altogether to the pronoun to which it is appended.\n\n179. In early English writers we find ane or one (= A.S. ana, 'alone') used like self. Thus \"All himm ane\" = all by himself (Orm. 1025); \"Him ane bi himm sellfenn\" = him alone by himself (Orm. 822); \"Walkyng myn one\" = walking by myself (Piers Pl. 5023). The word lane (= alone) is still used thus in Scotch, as 'my lane' (by myself), 'him lane' (by himself). The pronoun appears to vary between the possessive and the objective, as it does with self.\n\nVERB.\n\n180. Definition. A verb\u2020 is a word by means of which we can say something about some person or thing.\n\nThe word which stands for what is spoken about is called the subject of the verb, and is in the nominative case. In relation to the Subject, the verb is called the Predicate.\n\nA verb tells us with regard to what is spoken about that it does something, or that it is in some state, or that it has something done to it.\n\nVerbs as well as adjectives stand for attributes; but when we attach an adjective to a noun, as in 'a flying eagle,' the phrase denotes two notions which are regarded as already united into one compound whole; when we attach a verb to a noun, as in 'the eagle flies,' the use of the verb effects the union of the two notions. (See \u00a7 26.)\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF VERBS.\n\n181. Verbs are divided into two classes\u2014\n\n1. Transitive \u2021 Verbs. 2. Intransitive Verbs.\n\nA Transitive Verb is one which denotes an action or feeling which is directed towards some object,\u00a7 as, strike, \"He strikes the\n\n---\n\n* When our and your relate to a single person, myself and yourself are used, as \"We will ourself in person to the war\"; \"You must do it yourself.\"\n\n\u2020 Latin verbum ('word'), the verb being emphatically the word of the sentence. Verbum imperfectly represents the Greek term \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2, which means 'predicate.'\n\n\u2021 Latin transire, 'to go across'; the action goes over, as it were, from the doer to the object.\n\n\u00a7 A verb does not cease to be transitive because the object of the action is too vague to be expressed. In \"About, seek, fire, kill\" (Shaksp. J. C.) the verbs are all transitive. It will of course be understood that a transitive verb is still transitive when it is used in the passive voice. It still denotes an action directed to an object, although that object is denoted by the subject of the passive verb.\nball;\" love, \"He loves his father.\" The word which stands for the object of the action described by the verb is called the object of the verb. It is put in the objective case. The grammatical object of a verb must not be confounded with the real object of the action.\n\nAn Intransitive Verb is one which denotes a state or condition, or an action or feeling which is not directed towards an object; as, to be, to dwell, to sit, to rejoice, to run. Verbs of this kind are sometimes called Neuter Verbs.\n\n182. Many verbs are used, with a difference of meaning, sometimes as transitive verbs, sometimes as intransitive verbs; as, \"He ran away;\" \"He ran a thorn into his finger.\" \"The child speaks already,\" i.e., 'utters articulate sounds'; \"He speaks several languages,\" i.e., 'employs the languages to express his thoughts.' A transitive verb is used reflectively when the action which it denotes is done by the doer to himself, and the verb is consequently followed by a reflexive pronoun. This pronoun, however, is often omitted, as \"The sea breaks (itself) on the rocks;\" \"The earth moves (itself);\" \"The clouds spread (themselves) over the sky;\" \"The boats drew (themselves) clear of one another;\" \"The needle turns (itself) towards the pole.\" Verbs thus used must not be confounded with intransitive verbs. In old English intransitive verbs were often followed by a pronoun used reflectively, as \"Hie thee * home;\" \"Fare thee well;\" \"Sit thee down.\" Some compound verbs are used curiously in this way, as, \"To over-sleep oneself;\" \"He over-ate himself;\" \"Vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself,\" i.e., 'leaps farther than it intended,' and some verbs complemented by an adjective, as \"I have talked myself hoarse;\" \"The child screamed itself black in the face.\"\n\nReflective verbs are not a particular kind of verb, but simply transitive verbs used in a particular manner.\n\n183. Transitive verbs are sometimes used with a sort of passive signification, as \"The meat cuts tough,\" i.e., 'is tough when it is cut'; \"The cakes eat short and crisp,\" i.e., 'are short and crisp when they are eaten'; \"The book sold well;\" \"The bait took;\" \"The bed feels hard,\" i.e., 'it is hard when it is felt;' \"The rose smells sweet;\" \"The wine tastes sour.\"\n\n* In such phrases the pronoun was originally in the dative, marking that the actor was affected by the action, but not that he was the direct object of it. Thus:-\"Hie him h\u00e1meheard ferdon,\" 'They marched them homewards' (Alf. Ors, i. 9). Sometimes what looks like an accusative (or objective) of cognate meaning may be regarded as a complement of the predicate. Thus \"It rained fire and brimstone\" = 'It rained, and the rain was fire, &c.' For the use of what is called the cognate objective (as in 'to run a race') see the Syntax.\n\n\u2020 The following verbs are some of those that may be used reflectively without having the reflective pronoun expressed:\u2014push, extend, stretch, drag, rest, lean, incline, keep, set, bend, feed, open, shut, harden, shorten, lengthen, melt, dissolve, recover, reform, prepare, wash, yield, change, dash, refrain, obtrude, intrude, pour, press, remove, settle, steal.\n\nSeveral intransitive verbs were once reflective, as wend (went), abscond, venture, depart, consort, retire, &c.\n\n* The following are a few of those which are both transitive and intransitive:\u2014act, talk, cat, drink, blow, fly, grow, abide, answer, boil, rain, shake, slip, stay, survive, &c.\nThis is probably the origin of such passive expressions as \"A great experiment was making\" (Macaulay); \"A treaty of union was negotiating\" (Robertson). Only a limited number of verbs admit of this construction.\n\n**INFLEXIONS OF VERBS AND SUBSTITUTES FOR INFLEXION.**\n\n184. Verbs admit of the following modifications:\u2014Voice, Mood, Tense, Number, Person.\n\nThese are expressed partly by inflexion, partly by the use of auxiliary verbs.\n\nNumber and Person are expressed solely by inflexion, Voice, Mood, and Tense partly by inflexion and partly by the use of Auxiliary Verbs.\n\n**Notional and Auxiliary Verbs.**\n\n185. A verb is a *notional* verb, when it is so used as to retain its full and proper meaning, as \"I will go\" (i.e., 'I am resolved to go'); \"You may play in the garden\" (i.e., 'You are permitted to play'); \"Thou shalt not steal\" (i.e., 'thou art bound not to steal'); \"He would not come when I called him\" (i.e., 'He did not choose to come').\n\nA verb is an *auxiliary* verb when its own proper signification drops out of sight, and it merely serves to mark some modification of the notion expressed by another verb. Thus in \"He will fall,\" *will* does not imply that he is resolved to fall, but only marks futurity. In \"I work hard that I may gain the prize,\" *may* does not express permission, but helps to indicate the subjunctive mood of the verb 'gain.' In \"I have been ill,\" *have* has altogether lost the idea of possessing, and has become a mere tense-sign.*\n\nNotional verbs and auxiliary verbs are not two distinct classes; the same verb may be sometimes notional and sometimes auxiliary.\n\n**VOICE.**\n\n186. Voice is the form of a verb by means of which we show whether the subject of the sentence stands for the doer, or for the object of the action spoken of by the verb. There are two voices\u20141. The Active Voice. 2. The Passive Voice.\n\nThe Active Voice is made up of those forms of a verb which denote that the subject of the sentence stands for the doer of the action described by the verb; as, \"The boy strikes the ball.\" \"The cat killed the mouse.\"\n\n* All inflexions were once significant words, which were attached to other words, but have become so worn down by use, that in many cases their original meaning can be only guessed at. Their origin is illustrated by the *of loved*, which can be traced to *loved-did*, i.e., did-love. So in French *j'irai* is made up of *je-ir-ai*, i.e., *ego-tre-habeo* = 'I have to go.' The use of auxiliaries is therefore a return to the original method of going to work.\nThe Passive Voice is made up of those forms of a verb which denote that the subject of the sentence stands for the object of the action described by the verb; as, \"The ball is struck by the boy.\" \"The mouse was killed by the cat.\"\n\nThe same action may be expressed by either voice, but then the word that is the object of the active verb must be the subject of the passive.\n\n187. In the strict sense of the above definition only transitive verbs could properly be used in the passive voice, and only the direct object of the active verb could become the subject of the passive verb. This is in fact the usage in Latin, German, &c. But English has blended the accusative and the dative into one case, the 'objective,' and as a consequence of this allows (in most cases) the objective of either kind of object to become the subject of the passive. \"I told him the news\" becomes either \"The news was told him,\" or \"He was told the news.\"\n\nMoreover English has singular freedom in the way in which it treats groups of words as though they were single nouns, verbs, &c. (See \u00a7 75.) When a complex expression containing a verb in the active voice is attended by a noun or pronoun in the objective, whether after a preposition or not, that noun or pronoun may be made the subject of a complex passive phrase. Thus we may say: \"He spoke to the man\u2014the man was spoken to\"; \"They took great care of him\u2014he was taken great care of.\" Similarly, \"He was promised a new coat\"; \"The dead were refused burial,\" &c.\n\n188. The Passive Voice of a verb is formed by prefixing the various parts of the verb be to the perfect participle of the verb.* The perfect participle of a transitive verb is passive in meaning.\n\nSome intransitive verbs have their perfect tenses formed by means of the verb be, followed by the past or perfect participle; as, \"I am come\"; \"He is gone.\" Great care must be taken not to confound these with passive verbs. The sign of the passive voice is not the verb be, but the passive participle that follows it. Come and gone are not passive.\n\nMOOD.\n\n189. Moods\u2020 (that is Modes) are certain variations of form in verbs, by means of which we can show the mode or manner in\n\n---\n\n* In Latin and Greek the Passive Voice has sprung out of the Middle or Reflective Verb. Thus amatur is made up of amat and a reflective pronoun. So in the Scandinavian languages a passive is made by attaching the reflective pronoun to the active voice. In the third person this suffix was -sk. A trace of this formation is found in English in two verbs, viz., \"to busk\" = 'to get oneself ready' (from bua 'to prepare'), and 'bask' = 'bathe oneself.'\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon and early English the passive verb was also made with the auxiliary werden 'to become,' as the passive voice is now made with werden in German. Thus (in Piers Pl.), \"No creature withouten cristendom worth saved.\" The verb woe\u00f0an is probably connected with vertere 'to turn.' We still say \"The milk turned (= became) sour.\"\n\n\u2020 Mood comes from the Latin modus 'manner'; Indicative from indicare, \"to point out\"; Imperative from imperare, \"to command\"; Subjunctive from subjungere, \"to join on to\"; Infinitive from infinitus, \"unlimited,\" i.e., as regards person, number, &c.\nwhich the action or fact denoted by the verb is connected in our thought with the thing that is spoken of.*\n\nThere are four moods \u2020:\n\nA. Three Finite Moods. 1. The Indicative Mood. 2. The Imperative Mood. 3. The Subjunctive Mood.\n\nB. The Infinitive Mood.\n\nI.\u2014THE FINITE MOODS.\n\n1.\u2014THE INDICATIVE MOOD.\n\n190. The Indicative Mood comprises those forms of a verb which are used when a statement, question, or supposition has relation to some event or state of things which is treated by the speaker as actual, and independent of his thought about it; as, \"He struck the ball\"; \"We shall set out to-morrow\"; \"If he was guilty \u2021 his punishment was too light.\"\n\n2.\u2014THE IMPERATIVE MOOD.\n\n191. The Imperative Mood is a form of the verb by means of which we utter a command, request, or exhortation; as, \"Give me that book.\" \"Go away.\" The subject of a verb in the imperative mood is usually omitted, but may be expressed, as, \"Go thou and do likewise.\" Its subject must of course be in the second person.\n\nWhen we express our will in connection with the first or third person, we either employ the subjunctive mood (as \"Cursed be he that first cries hold\"; \"Go we to the king\"), or make use of the imperative\n\n* \"Modi sunt diversae inclinationes animi, varios ejus affectus significantes\" (Priscian).\n\nThere is a great deal of discrepancy and confusion in the statements of the ancient grammarians about the Moods. Opinion ultimately settled down amongst the Roman grammarians to the recognition of five Moods, the Indicative, Imperative, Optative, Subjunctive, and Infinitive. The separation of the Optative and Subjunctive was perfectly needless. The forms were identically the same; it was only the uses to which the forms were put that differed. It would have been as reasonable to give half a dozen names to the Ablative Case, according to the uses to which it was put.\n\n\u2020 To these moods many grammarians add the Potential Mood, meaning by that mood certain combinations of the so-called auxiliary verbs may, might, can, could, must, with the infinitive mood. This is objectionable. I can write, and I must go, are no more moods of the verbs write and go, than possim scribere is a mood of scribo in Latin; or, Je puis \u00e9crire, Ich kann schreiben and Ich muss gehen moods of the verbs \u00e9crire, schreiben, and gehen in French and German. Moreover, this potential mood would need to be itself subdivided into Indicative forms and Subjunctive forms. The sentences \"I could do this at one time, but I cannot now,\" and \"I could not do this, if I were to try,\" do not contain the same parts of the verb can. In the first sentence, could is in the indicative mood; in the second, it is in the subjunctive mood. (For a full discussion of the subject see the Appendix to the author's 'Shorter English Grammar,' or his 'Remarks on the Subjunctive and the so-called Potential Mood,' published separately.)\n\n\u2021 This conditional use of the Indicative Mood must not be confounded with the Subjunctive or (as it is sometimes called) Conditional Mood. Let particular attention be paid to this. A verb is not in the Subjunctive Mood because it is used in a subjoined clause.\nlet (which is of the second person, with its subject omitted), followed by an infinitive complement, as, \"Let us pray\"; \"Let him be heard.\" These are not imperative forms of pray and hear.*\n\n3.\u2014THE SUBJUNCTIVE MOOD.\n\n192. The Subjunctive Mood comprises those forms \u2020 of a verb which are used when a statement, question, or supposition has relation to an event or state of things which is only thought of, and which is not treated by the speaker as matter of fact, independent of his thought about it.\u2020\n\nIf we use the term Objective for what is regarded as having an existence of its own independent of the thought of the speaker, and Subjective for what exists (or is dealt with as existing) only in the thought of the speaker, we may say that the Indicative is the Mood of Objective Predication, and the Subjunctive the Mood of Subjective Predication.\n\nThe Indicative Mood, which relates to actual fact (or what is dealt with as such), must necessarily be simple in its application, because a fact external to our thought about it does not admit of being shaped in our thought as we please. But when an act or state is connected with something that we speak about only in our thought, the relation of the two may assume various forms. Consequently the Subjunctive Mood admits of a great variety of uses, especially in languages in which its forms are fully preserved. In modern English these uses have become very much restricted.\u00a7\n\nIn modern English the Subjunctive is employed to express a will or wish, as \"Thy kingdom come\"; in clauses denoting purpose, as\n\n* It may be said that it is much easier to call 'Let us go' the first person plural imperative of the verb go, and so on. So it is. It is always easier to shirk a difficulty than to solve it. The objection to the easier course is that it is false. Us cannot be the subject of a finite verb, and let is not of the first person. (Compare the German 'Lasset uns beten.') A complex grammatical phrase has not been explained when its parts have been jumbled together into one lot, and ticketed with a wrong name.\n\n\u2020 Many writers have actually forgotten what they are dealing with when they speak of the Subjunctive Mood. It is therefore necessary to insist upon the very obvious truth, that in all languages the Subjunctive Mood is not a particular way of using verbs, but a particular group of verb-forms. Such forms as sum, est, amo, monebo, audivi, &c., in Latin; bin, hasti, liebi, sprach, &c., in German; was, has, am, is, &c., in English, belong to the Indicative group, and are Indicative whatever may be the construction in which they are found. Such forms as sim, esset, amem, audiverim, &c., in Latin; sey, w\u00e4re, habest, spr\u00e4che, &c., in German; [he] be, [I] were, [thou] have, &c., in English, belong to the Subjunctive group. The Mood is constituted by the verb-form, and not by the use of a conjunction. There are, however, grammars still in use, the unfortunate learners of which are taught that 'If I am' is the Subjunctive Mood of the verb to be.\n\n\u2021 This definition has the sanction of the best grammatical authorities. It is well developed by M\u00e4tzner. Peile (Primer of Phil. p. 93) says: \"In the Subjunctive Mood the action is not stated as a fact, though it may be one, but as a conception of the mind,\" Madvig (Lat. Gram. \u00a7 346) says:\u2014\"In the Conjunctive a thing is asserted simply as an idea conceived in the mind; so that the speaker does not at the same time declare it as actually existing.\"\n\n\u00a7 In modern English it is getting (unfortunately) more and more common to use the Indicative Mood in cases where the Subjunctive would be more correct. Thus for \"See that all be in readiness,\" many people say \"See that all is in readiness;\" for \"If that were to happen,\" they say, \"If that was to happen.\"\n\"See that all be in readiness\"; \"Govern well thy appetite, lest sin surprise thee\"; in clauses denoting the purport of a wish or command, as \"The sentence is that the prisoner be-imprisoned for life\"; to express a supposition or wish contrary to the fact, or not regarded as brought to the test of actual fact, as \"If he were here (which is not the case) he would think differently\"; \"Oh! that it were possible.\" In this last case the possibility of the thing is treated purely as a matter that is merely thought of.\n\nOf course these varieties of signification are not actually expressed by the Subjunctive Mood. That Mood merely supplies us with a form of predication which can be shaped by our intelligence, according to circumstances, so as to suit the meaning to be conveyed.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon the functions of the Subjunctive Mood were much wider than in modern English. It was used wherever we now use it, and it was also employed\u2014\n\n1. In indirect questions, as \"\u00e1csia\u00f0 hw\u00e1 s\u00fd wyr\u00f0e\" = 'ask who is (be) worthy.'\n2. In reported statements for which the reporter does not vouch, as \"He s\u00e6de \u00f0\u00e6t \u00f0\u00e6t land sie swi\u00f0e lang nor\u00f0\" = 'he said that that land is (be) very far north.'\n3. In putting a general case, or describing a type of a class, as \"Hw\u00e6t is \u00f0inga \u00f0e bietere sie\"? = 'what of things is [there] which be more bitter?' \"Se \u00fee h\u00e6bbe \u00e9ran t\u00f3 geh\u00fdranne geh\u00fdre\" = 'He that hath (have) ears to hear, let him hear.'\n\nThe Subjunctive Mood cannot be used in a simple declarative or interrogative sentence. A predication made in thought only is meaningless, except as related to some other predication. Hence the mood was called the 'subjunctive' or 'joining-on' mood, because (except when expressing a wish) it is only employed in complex sentences.*\n\nA verb in the Subjunctive Mood is generally (but not always) preceded by one of the conjunctions if, that, lest, though, unless, &c.; but the Subjunctive Mood is not always used after these conjunctions, nor is the conjunction a part of the mood.\n\nIn modern English the simple present or past tense of the Subjunctive Mood is often replaced by phrases compounded of the verbs may, might, and should, which for that reason are called auxiliary or helping verbs. Thus for \"lest sin surprise thee,\" we now say \"Lest sin should surprise thee\"; for \"Give me this water that I thirst not\" we say \"that I may\u2020 not thirst.\"\n\n* Conjunctive is a better name than Subjunctive, because the mood is not confined to use in a subjoined clause. But neither name is good, for neither name expresses in the slightest degree the real function of the mood, and both are misleading. Conceptual would be a better name. The learner must beware of the bad logic involved in supposing that because a verb in this mood is usually conjoined or subjoined to some other verb, therefore every clause that is subjoined to another contains a verb in the Subjunctive Mood. (See further in the Appendix to the 'Shorter English Grammar.')\n\n\u2020 These auxiliary verbs form compound subjunctive tenses, not by virtue of their significance in the combination, but solely because they are themselves in the Subjunctive Mood. Their notional meaning has evaporated (\u00a7 185), and only their mood-power remains to give modality to the compounds. This was long ago pointed out by Dr. Lowth in his English Grammar.\n193. The three finite moods of verbs may be described as the Mood of Fact (Indicative), the Mood of Conception (Subjunctive), and the Mood of Volition (Imperative).\n\nTHE VERB AS A SUBSTANTIVE.\n\n1.\u2014THE INFINITIVE MOOD.\n\n194. The Infinitive Mood expresses the action or state denoted by the verb without reference to person, number, or time. It cannot be attached to a subject to make an assertion, but it may be attached to a subject in dependent phrases, as \"I saw him full,\" \"I know him to be honest,\" \"No wonder is a lewed man to ruste\" (Chaucer, Prol. 503). This use justifies us in calling it a 'Mood' (see definition). It commonly has the force of a substantive, and may be used either as the subject or as the object of another verb, or after certain prepositions (namely to and but), as \"I cannot but admire his courage.\" When thus used it is not properly a mood at all.\n\n195. The preposition to is not an essential part of the infinitive mood, nor an invariable sign of it. Many verbs (as may, can, shall, will, must, let, dare, do, bid, make, see, hear, feel, need) are followed by the simple infinitive without to,* as \"You may speak\"; \"Bid me discourse\"; \"He made me laugh\"; \"I had rather not tell you.\"\n\nThe simple infinitive (without to) used as the subject of another verb is legitimate, though somewhat archaic, as \"Better be with the dead\" (Macbeth iii. 2, 20); \"Will't please your highness walk\" (Lear iv. 7); \"Better dwell in the midst of alarms than reign in this horrible place\" (Cowper); \"H'm luste ryde soo\" = it pleased him [to] ride so (Chaucer, Prol. 102). So in Anglo-Saxon: \"Leofre is \u00fas gef\u00f3n fisc\"; \"It is more agreeable to us to catch fish.\" This infinitive denotes purpose after verbs of motion, as \"I will go seek the king\" (Hamlet ii. 1, 101).\n\n196. In Anglo-Saxon, the infinitive mood ended in -an, and when used as such, had no to before it. A verb in the infinitive might be the subject or object of another verb. The infinitive was, however, treated as a declinable abstract noun, and a dative form (called the gerund), ending in -anne, or -enne, and preceded by the preposition to, was used to denote purpose. Thus in \"He that hath ears to hear,\" to hear = t\u00f3 gehyranne; in \"The sower went forth to sow,\" to sow = t\u00f3 s\u00e1wenne. This gerundive infinitive passed into modern English with the loss of the dative inflexion, as in \"I came to tell you\"; \"The water is good to drink;\" i.e., for drinking; \"This house is to let.\"\u2020 Here the to has\n\n* Similarly zu is omitted after the corresponding verbs in German.\n\u2020 The active infinitive in these phrases is the older and truer form. In Chaucer we find \"it is to despise\" = 'it is to be despised.' In the North they still say 'What is to do it?' for \"What is to be done?\"\nits full and proper force. From denoting the purpose of an action, the to came to mark the ground of an action more generally, and so may indicate the cause or condition of an action, as \"I am sorry to hear this\"; \"I am glad to see you,\" i.e., \"at seeing you\"; \"To hear him talk (i.e., on hearing him talk), one would suppose he was master here.\" But this gerund with to came to be used in place of the simple infinitive, as the subject or object of another verb,* and so we say, \"To err is human, to forgive divine\"; \"I hope to see you.\" Here the to is utterly without meaning. We even find another preposition used before it, as \"I was about to observe\"; \"This is Elias which was for to come\"\u2020 \"There is nothing left but to submit.\"\n\nAs this infinitive preceded by to \u2020 has come to us from the Anglo-Saxon gerund, it is called the gerundial infinitive.\n\n2.\u2014THE GERUND.\n\n197. A Gerund is a substantive formed from a verb by the suffix -ing, and which, when formed from a transitive verb, has the governing power of the verb, as, \"He escaped by crossing the river.\" The Gerund is like the imperfect participle in form, but is totally distinct from it in origin and construction.\n\nThe gerunds of the verbs have and be help to form compound gerunds, as \".He went crazy through having lost his fortune\"; \"He is desirous of being admired.\"\n\n198. Gerunds are used either as subjects or as objects of verbs, or after prepositions, as \"Losing his fortune drove him mad\"; \"I like reading\"; \"He is fond of studying mathematics.\"\n\n199. Participles (being adjectives) are never used as the subjects or objects of verbs, or after prepositions. It must be observed too that in all such compounds as hiding-place, walking-stick, &c., it is the gerund, and not the participle which is used. If made with the participle, a 'walking-stick' could only mean 'a stick that walks.'\n\n200. The origin of the Gerund is a point about which there is some difference of opinion.\n\n1. It is held by some that the Gerund in -ing is simply the modern representative of the Anglo-Saxon abstract noun in -ung. That these nouns in -ung are now represented by verbal nouns in -ing is quite true. Thus: \"For earnunge \u00e9can lif\u00e6,\" 'for earning of eternal life' (Grein, ii. p. 286); \"Thei\n\n* Even in A.S. we find such constructions as \"hyt is \u00e1lyfed wel t\u00f3 d\u00f3nne\" ('it is allowed to do good'); \"He ond\u00e9d \u00feyder t\u00f3 f\u00e1ranne\" ('he dreaded to go thither'). It is interesting to observe that the older infinitive forms in Latin and Greek (\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9, &c.), and still more those in Sanskrit, show that the infinitive mood was the dative case of an abstract noun, used to express the object or purpose of an action.\n\n\u2020 This infinitive with for to is even found as the subject or object of another verb, as \"Unto a poure ordre for to give is signe that a man is wel ischrive\" (Chaucer, Prolo. 216); \"Ye lerneth for to love\" (Piers Pl. 14624); or with a subject, \"This prison caused me not for to crye\" (Chaucer).\n\n\u2021 In the Northern dialect at was used instead of to, as \"I hafe noght at do with the\"; \"That es at say,\" (Koch, ii. p. 61; Skeat, Et. Dict.) Til was also employed for to. In the phrase 'Much ado,' ado is at do, 'Much ado' = much to do,\nweren at robbinge,\" 'they were a robbing' (Layamon); \"On hunting ben they ridden,\" 'a hunting are they ridden'; \"I fare to gon a begging\" (Chaucer); \"I go a fishing\" (John xxii. 3); \"Forty and six years was this temple in building\"; \"While the ark was a preparing\" (a = on or in). Such phrases as \"I am a doing of it,\" though now considered vulgar, are perfectly grammatical. It may have been the mere omission of the preposition which produced what looks like * a passive use of the participle in -ing, as 'the house is building.' Compare \"Ge beo\u00f0 on hatunge\" = 'ye shall be hated' (Matt. x. 22).\n\nThe difficulty about this view is, that it furnishes no explanation of the origin of the compound gerunds (as 'he was punished for having broken the window'), and that the nouns in -ung never had the power of governing an objective case, as gerunds have. When we say \"He was hanged for killing a man,\" the objective relation of 'man' to 'killing' is (now at any rate) as distinctly in our thoughts, as that of 'man' to 'killed' when we say \"He killed a man.\" Consequently, even if it could be shown that the formation in -ung was the parent of all verbal nouns in -ing, a large class of these would still be entitled to be classed by themselves under a distinct name, just as adverbs that have acquired the force of prepositions require to be classed and named as such.\n\n2. Koch (ii. \u00a7 98) regards the gerund in -ing as being descended from the old Anglo-Saxon gerund in -anne or -enne, which passed through such forms as 'to rixiende,' 'for to brennyng,' 'I am to accusinge you' (Wycliffe, John v. 45); and as having got confused with the descendants of the nouns in -ung, and so used without the preposition to. The objection to this is that the Anglo-Saxon gerund has its unquestionable representative in the modern gerundial infinitive (\u00a7 196), and that throughout its history the 'to' stuck to it with great tenacity.\n\n3. M\u00e4tzner's view is that the verbal noun in -ung, on getting assimilated in form to the participles in -ing, got so far confused with them as to assume their power of forming compounds (see above) and governing the objective case, being aided in this by the confusion in French between the gerund in -ant (Lat. -andum or -endum) and the participle in -ant (Lat. -antem or -entem). This is probably the correct view of the matter.\u2020 It is at least curious that the verbal noun in -ing occurs in the early writers (as Chaucer) most commonly after in, as the French gerund does after en.\n\nSome grammars set down an infinitive in -ing, as a modification of the old infinitive in -an or -en. This is a perfectly needless invention, and is quite unwarranted by the history of the forms. (See Dr. Morris, Hist. Outl.) In \"Seeing is believing\" we have merely two verbal nouns in -ing, descendants of the older formation in -ung.\n\n* According to Dr. Murray, however (Dial. of S. Counties, &c., p. 225), we really have the participle in these phrases. In Scotch the phrase is \"the hoose is buildan\" i.e., \"buildand.\" He considers this to be a relic of the Middle voice = buildan' itsel'. In colloquial English we often meet with such expressions as \"I want a button sewing on,\" where the participle has a passive sense. (Comp. \u00a7 183.)\n\n\u2020 It is a great mistake to speak of the gerund, or verbal substantive in -ing, as being the imperfect participle used as a noun. The participle is an adjective, and though an adjective may be used as a concrete noun, it cannot possibly pass into an abstract noun without having the definite article before it. The grossness of the mistake which is involved in confounding the gerund with the participle is seen when beginners, who have been led astray by their English grammars, render 'He talks about fighting,' by 'loquitur de pugnante.'\nThose verbs in -ing which represent the old formation in -ung should properly be followed by of and not by the simple objective case, as \"The hunting of the Snark\": \"To dissuade the people from making of league\" (North. Plut.). This ought always to be the construction when the verbal is preceded by the, and is the present usage; but (owing to a confusion between the two verbs, the noun and the participle) the older writers did not always adhere to it. Thus we find: \"Nothing in his life became him like the leaving it\" (Macbeth); \"The seeing these effects\" (Cymb.).\n\nTHE VERB AS AN ADJECTIVE.\n\nPARTICIPLES.\n\n201. Participles are verbal adjectives. They are so called because they partake of the nature both of a verb and of an adjective (Latin participare, 'to partake').\n\nThere are two participles formed by inflexion, the Imperfect Participle and the Perfect Participle. The imperfect participle always ends in ing.* When formed from a transitive verb, it may have an object, as \"Hearing the noise, I went to the window.\" The perfect participle in verbs of the Strong Conjugation formerly always ended in -en, and still does so in many verbs; in verbs of the Weak Conjugation it ends in -d, -ed, or -t.\u2020 The Imperfect Participle is always active, the Perfect Participle is passive, provided the verb be a transitive verb; as, \"I saw a boy beating a dog,\" \"Frightened by the noise he ran away.\" In \"He has come,\" come is perfect, but not passive.\u2021\n\nEven in the perfect tenses, as \"I have written a letter,\" the origin of the construction is, \"I have a letter written,\" where written is an adjective agreeing with letter; in Latin, Habeo epistolam scriptam. In French the participle agrees with the object in some constructions; as \"Les lettres que j'ai \u00e9crites.\" In Anglo-Saxon the perfect participle was inflected, and made to agree with the object.\u00a7\n\n202. The participles are often used as mere adjectives of quality, as \"A striking remark\"; \"The dreaded hour has come.\"\n\n* The termination of this participle in Anglo-Saxon was -ende, which was subsequently changed to -inde, and finally to -inge, -inge, and -ing. In the Northern dialect the termination was -ande or -and, which still maintains its ground in Scotch. The essential letters of the suffix are nd. This suffix is akin to the Latin -ent or -nt and the Greek ovr or evr. We have now three totally different formations in -ing. 1. The abstract noun, as \"Seeing is believing\"; \"He was aroused by the striking of the clock.\" 2. The German (capable of governing an objective case), as \"He made a noise by striking the gong.\" 3. The participle (an adjective attached to a substantive), as \"I saw a boy striking a dog.\"\n\n\u2020 The letter y, which is found as a prefix in one or two old forms (as yclept 'called') and affected by some writers in others, is derived from the A.S. prefix ge. At first, and for some time, the Northern dialect, while dropping the prefix ge, retained the suffix -en. The Southern dialect discarded the suffix, but retained the ge.\n\n\u2021 Even the past participle of transitive verbs is often used with a curious active signification, as \"You are mistaken,\" i.e. \"You have mistaken [the matter]\"; \"Why are you drawn?\" (Tempest, ii. i), i.e. \"Why have you drawn [your words].\"\n\n\u00a7 As \"He h\u00e6f\u00f0 man geweorhtne,\" 'he has created man.'\nTENSE.\n\n203. Tenses (Latin *tempus*, 'time') are varieties of form in verbs, or compound verbal phrases made with the help of auxiliary verbs, which indicate partly the *time* to which an action or event is referred * and partly the *completeness* or *incompleteness* of the event at the time referred to.\n\n204. There are three divisions of time\u2014the Present, the Past, and the Future. There are also three ways in which an action or event may be viewed:\n\n1. It may be spoken of as *incomplete*, or still going on. A tense which indicates this is called an *imperfect tense*.\n2. It may be spoken of as *complete*. A tense which indicates this is called a *perfect tense*.\n3. It may be spoken of as one whole, without describing it as complete or incomplete in relation to other actions. A tense which does this is called an *indefinite tense*.\n\n205. An action may be viewed in these three ways with reference to past, to present, or to future time. We thus get\n\n**NINE PRIMARY TENSES.**\n\nA. 1. The *Past Imperfect* (or *Progressive*), showing that at a certain past time an action was going on, as, *I was writing; I was being taught*.\n\n2. The *Past Perfect*, showing that at a certain past time an action was complete; as, *I had written; I had been taught*.\n\n3. The *Past Indefinite* (or *Preterite*), speaking of the action as one whole referred to past time; as, *I wrote; I was taught*.\n\nB. 1. The *Present Imperfect* (or *Progressive*), showing that an action is going on at the present time; as, *I am writing; I am being taught*.\n\n2. The *Present Perfect*, showing that at the present time a certain action is complete; as, *I have written; I have been taught*.\n\n3. The *Present Indefinite*, speaking of the action as one whole, referred to present time; as, *I write; I am taught*.\n\nC. 1. The *Future Imperfect* (or *Progressive*), showing that at a certain future time an action will be going on; as, *I shall be writing; I shall be being taught*.\n\n2. The *Future Perfect*, showing that at a certain future time an action will be complete; as, *I shall have written; I shall have been taught*.\n\n3. The *Future Indefinite*, speaking of an action as one whole, referred to future time; as, *I shall write; I shall be taught*.\n\n*The marking of time is so essential a characteristic of verbs, that some grammarians make it the ground of the definition of a verb. In German the verb is called 'Zeitwort,' i.e. 'Time-word.'*\n206. From this table it appears at once that perfect and past are not the same. When we say \"I have written,\" although the act of writing took place in past time, yet the completeness of the action (which is what the tense indicates) is referred to present time. Hence the tense is a present tense. The use of this tense implies that the state of things brought about by the action exists at the present time. We may say \"England has founded a mighty empire in the East,\" because the empire still lasts; but we cannot say \"Cromwell has founded a dynasty,\" because the dynasty exists no longer.\n\n207. The indefinite tenses are often imperfect in sense. Thus, \"I stood during the whole of the performance.\" \"While he lived at home he was happy.\" The verbs in such cases would have to be rendered into the past imperfect tense in French, Latin, or Greek (see \u00a7 216).\n\nSECONDARY TENSES.\n\n208. Besides the primary tenses, we have the following *:\n\nThe Present Perfect of continued action\u2014I have been writing.\nThe Past Perfect of continued action\u2014I had been writing.\nThe Future Perfect of continued action\u2014I shall have been writing.\n\nCOMPLEX FORMS OF INDEFINITE TENSES.\n\n209. The Present and Past Indefinite Tenses are often replaced by compound forms \u2020 made with the auxiliary verb do, thus:\n\n\"You do assist the storm\" (Shakspeare, Temp. i. i. 15).\n\"They set bread before him and he did eat\" (2 Sam. xii. 20).\n\nThese forms become emphatic when a stress is laid upon the auxiliary verb. They are commonly employed in negative and interrogative sentences.\n\nFORMATION OF TENSES IN THE ACTIVE VOICE.\n\n210. The Present Indefinite and the Past Indefinite in the Active Voice are the only two tenses formed by inflexion.\n\nThe Imperfect tenses are formed by the indefinite tenses of the verb be, followed by the imperfect participle.\u2021\n\nThe Perfect tenses are formed by means of the indefinite tenses of the verb have, followed by the perfect participle. (See again \u00a7 185 and \u00a7 201.)\n\n* It is very absurd to give the name of 'tenses' to such phrases as 'I am going to write.' It would be as rational to extend the name to \"I am on the point of writing,\" or, \"He is in the very act of writing.\"\n\n\u2020 In Chaucer's time gan was used as a mere tense-auxiliary, equivalent to did. Thus \"He gan conclude\" (M. of L. ProL. 14).\n\n\u2021 The view that these tenses originated in the use of the verbal nouns in -ing, so that \"I am writing\" was developed out of \"I am a writing,\" is incorrect. The participle in -ende, -and, -yng, or -ing with the verb be is found from the earliest period, side by side with the use of the verbal noun in -ung or -ing; as \"Hig waron etende and drincende,\" \"they were eating and drinking\" (Matt. xxiv. 28); \"Harold was command\" (P. Langtoft); \"Ther hope I that thay be dwelland\" (Townl. Myst. p. 278). Even in Gothic we get \"Skulans sijaima,\" \"we are owing\" = \"we owe\" (Matt. vi. 12).\nThe Future tenses are formed by means of the auxiliary verbs *shall* and *will*, followed by the infinitive mood; *shall* being used for the first person, *will* for the second and third in affirmative principal sentences; but in subordinate clauses, after a relative, or such words as *if*, *when*, *as*, *though*, *unless*, *until*, &c., the verb *shall* is used for all three persons; as, \u201cIf it shall be proved\u201d; \u201cWhen He shall appear we shall be like Him.\u201d\n\n211. When the verb *will* is used in the first person and the verb *shall* in the second and third, it is implied that the action spoken of depends upon the will of the speaker. *Shall* (like *sollen* in German) implies an obligation to do something. Hence *shall* is appropriately used in commands (as \u201cThou shalt not kill\u201d), in promises or threats (as \u201cYou shall have a holiday\u201d), and in the language of prophecy, which is an utterance of the Divine will or purpose. *Shall* is used in the first person, as a simple auxiliary of a future tense, on much the same principle as that on which a person subscribes himself at the end of a letter, \u201cYour obedient humble servant.\u201d It implies a sort of polite acknowledgment of being bound by the will of others, or at least by the force of circumstances. By a converse application of the same principle, the verb *will* is used in the second and third persons to imply that the action referred to depends upon the volition of the person to or of whom we speak. In questions, however, and in reported speeches the force of the verb *shall* is the same in the second and third persons as it would be in the answer, or as it was in the direct speech: \u201cShall you be present?\u201d \u201cI shall.\u201d \u201cI shall not set out to-morrow\u201d; \u201cJohn said that he should not set out to-morrow.\u201d The verb to be used in a question depends upon the verb expected in the reply. We say, \u201cWill you go?\u201d if we expect the answer, \u201cI will.\u201d\n\n212. When *shall* and *will* are used as mere tense-signs, their notional force disappears. (See \u00a7 185.) When they are used with their full notional power (as in \u2018Thou shalt not kill\u2019; \u2018I will have obedience,\u2019 i.e., \u2018I am resolved on having obedience\u2019) we no longer get a future tense, but a combination of a verb of incomplete predication and its complement. (See Syntax, Complex Predicate.) All depends upon whether the verb \u2018shall\u2019 or \u2018will\u2019 is used to predict or not. If it is, we get a future tense, but not otherwise. Thus, \u201cThou shalt not steal\u201d involves no prediction; we may speak thus to one whom we know to be about to commit a theft. We assert a present obligation, we do not predict a future act. Consequently in this sentence we have not got a future tense.\n\n213. There are sentences, however, in which \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018will,\u2019 while used to predict, and therefore forming future tenses, retain something of their notional force, as \u201cI will call upon you to-morrow\u201d; \u201cYou shall have an answer on Monday.\u201d In all such instances the action referred to depends upon the will of the speaker.\n\nThe two sorts of future have been conveniently distinguished (by Dr. Latham) as the Predictive Future and the Promissive Future. In the Promissive Future \u2018will\u2019 is used for the First Person, and \u2018shall\u2019 for the Second and Third.\nFORMATION OF TENSES IN THE PASSIVE VOICE.\n\n214. All moods and tenses in the Passive Voice are made by means of auxiliary verbs, the Passive Voice of a verb consisting of its perfect participle, preceded by the various moods and tenses of the verb be. (See \u00a7 188 and the note.)\n\n215.

The Present Indefinite Tense is used:\n\n1. To state what is actually taking place, as, \"Here comes the rain.\"\n2. To state what frequently or habitually takes place, or is universally true, as, \"It rains here daily;\" \"Honesty is the best policy.\"\n3. In lively narrations a person often imagines himself to be present at the events he is describing, and so uses the present tense (Historic Present) in speaking of past events.\n4. It is used for the future when the real time is fixed by the context, as, \"We start next Monday for the Continent.\"\n\nBesides its ordinary use, the Past Indefinite Tense is used:\n\n1. With the force of an Imperfect, as, \"They danced while I played.\"\n2. To express what happened frequently or habitually, as, \"In those days people ate without forks.\"\n\nThe combinations which form the Indefinite Tenses of the Passive Voice are a little ambiguous in meaning. They may refer either to the action indicated by the verb, or to the results of the action. In the latter case they are not strictly tenses of the passive voice, but the participle that follows the verb be is used as an adjective. In \"Every house is built by some man,\" is built is a present indefinite tense passive of the verb build. In \"This house is built of stone,\" is is the verb, and built is used as an adjective.*\n\nTENSES IN ANGLO-SAXON.\n\n217. In Anglo-Saxon the Present Indefinite tense was also used as a Present Imperfect tense, and also as a Future \u2020 or even as a Future Perfect. The Past Indefinite was also used as a Past Imperfect, as a Present Perfect\u2021 and as a Past Perfect. Compounds of the verb 'have' and the perfect participle were also used, but the participle agreed in case, &c., with the object.\n\nCombinations of the verb be with an imperfect participle are found.\n\nThe greater precision of modern English in marking tense arises from its having become more of an analytic and less of an inflected language. Auxiliary verbs and prepositions are more exact than inflexions.\n\nNUMBER.\n\n218. Number is a modification of the form of a verb, by means of which we show whether the verb is spoken of one person or\n\n* This distinction can be easily marked in Greek, Latin, and in German. \"The letter is written,\" i.e., 'the act of writing takes place,' is rendered \u1f21 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9. \"Epistola scribitur,\" and \"Der Brief wird geschrieben.\" \"The letter is written,\" i.e., 'is in a written state, or has already been written,' is rendered \u1f21 \u1f10\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \u03b3\u03ad\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03b5\u03bd \u1f26\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9, \"Epistola scripta est;\" and \"Der Brief ist geschrieben.\"\n\n\u2020 Thus: \"Aefter \u00ferim dagon ic arise,\" (After three days I shall rise again) (Matt. xxvi. 63); \"\u00c6scle treow . . . . by\u00f0 forcorfen,\" (Every tree . . . . shall be cut down) (Matt. iii. 10), but the compounds with shall and will were also used.\n\n\u2021 The past indefinite often served for the modern past indefinite, present perfect, and past perfect, e.g., \"mine eagan gesawon \u00feine h\u00e6le,\" \"mine eyes have seen thy salvation\" (Luke ii. 30).\nthing, or of more than one. There are, therefore, two numbers in verbs, the Singular and the Plural, corresponding to the two numbers in substantives.\n\n**PERSON.**\n\n219. Person * is a modification of the form of verbs, by which we indicate whether the speaker speaks of himself, or of the person or persons addressed, or of some other person or thing.\n\nThere are three persons\u20141. The First Person; 2. The Second Person; 3. The Third Person.\n\nThe First Person is used when the speaker speaks of himself either singly or with others.\n\nThe Second Person is used when the subject of the verb stands for the person or persons spoken to.\n\nThe Third Person is used when the subject of the verb denotes neither the speaker nor the person spoken to.\n\n**CONJUGATION OF VERBS.**\n\n220. The Conjugation of a Verb is the formation of all the inflexions and combinations used to indicate Voice, Mood, Tense, Number, and Person.\n\n---\n\n* The suffixes by which Person is marked were originally Personal Pronouns. The oldest forms to which they can be traced are (in the singular) -x, ma; 2. tva; 3. ta. These were weakened to -i, mi; 2. ti; 3. ti, the second being still further weakened to si. The plural forms for the first and second persons were either -x, mas, 2. tas, or i, masi, 2. tasi. In the former case -as would be a plural sign added to the pronoun; in the latter masi = I + thou (= we); ta-si = thou + thou (= ye). The suffix of the third person was an-ti, made up of the root of ana-s (that), and ti = ta (he), and equivalent to he + he = they (Koch, 1. p. 322). This suffix appears in the Latin 'ama-nt', &c., and the Greek \u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03bd\u03c4\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9, &c.\n\nThe characteristic letter of the First Person (-m) is seen in am (= as -m) and beam, in the Latin sum, ingem, amen, &c., and the Greek eiou, &c. The characteristic letter of the Second Person (-s) is seen in Latin and Greek, in Gothic and in the Northern dialect of English ('thou hopes,' 'thou bindes,' &c.). The -t in -st is an offgrowth of the -s (compare whilst, &c.). In some verbs the original t reappears, as a hardened form of the -s (shall, will, art). The suffix -th is a modification of -t. It was first modified into -s in the Northern dialect.\n\nThe suffix -anti, which properly belongs to the Third Person, was adopted in primitive English for all three persons of the plural, its original sense having been lost sight of. (In the first instance it was, of course, as much a piece of bad grammar as it would be now to say 'I does,' 'Thou does,' 'He does,' in the singular.) The Northern dialect dropped the n, and softened the t to s, giving such forms as 'we hopes,' &c. The Southern dialect also dropped the n, but softened the t to th, giving such forms as 'we hopeth,' &c. The Midland dialect dropped the t and retained the n, giving the forms 'we hopen,' &c.\n\nMr. Garnett (Phil. Essays, pp. 280-342) gives cogent reasons for considering these pronominal suffixes to be not nominatives, but oblique cases (genitives or ablatives), combined with an abstract verbal substantive, so that asmi, esmi, sum, or am would mean not 'I am,' but 'being of me.' docetis would mean 'teaching of (or by) you,' &c. He shows that this is the actual mode of formation in a great variety of languages, spoken in all parts of the world, which proves that it is a possible and natural mode of expressing predication in the infancy of languages. Its possibility in the Aryan class is proved by its existence in Celtic.\n\nIn English and other Teutonic languages the plural suffixes have been assimilated to each other or dropped. In early English it is common to find the personal pronoun blended with the verb, as 'schaltou' = shalt thou; 'maystou' = mayest thou; 'So theeich' = so thee ich (so prosper I). It is a mistake to treat these as a recurrence to the primitive formation. They are mere phonetic abbreviations. In maystou, hastou, &c., the verb has its pronominal suffix in the s, before the other pronoun is pronounced along with it.\nThere are two classes of verbs in English, distinguished by the formation of the Preterite. These are\u2014\n\nA. Verbs of the Strong Conjugation.\nB. Verbs of the Weak Conjugation.\n\nTHE STRONG CONJUGATION.\n\n221. The preterite of verbs of the Strong Conjugation is formed by modifying the vowel-sound of the root.\n\nThe Strong Conjugation is based upon a mode of forming the preterite which belongs to various members of the Aryan family of languages. In the Strong Conjugation the Preterite (or Past Indefinite Tense) was originally formed by reduplication, i.e. by repeating the root of the verb. This formation was weakened (1) by omitting the final consonant from the first member of the doubled root;* (2) by weakening the vowel sound of the initial syllable to one uniform letter, and frequently by weakening or modifying the vowel sound of the second root as well;\u2020 (3) by omitting the initial consonant of the second member of the doubled root, so that the vowel of reduplication and the vowel of the root came in contact with each other, and were commonly blended into one \u2021 sound. Thus it has come to pass that in English (with two exceptions), the preterite of verbs of the Strong Conjugation is formed by modifying the vowel sound of the root.\n\nTwo preterites in English distinctly show reduplication, namely, did from do, and hight (was called) from the old verb h\u0101tan, where gh is a variety of the guttural h at the beginning.\u00a7\n\nIn English the perfect participle of all verbs of the strong conjugation was originally formed by the (adjective) suffix -en and the prefixed particle ge. The suffix -en has now disappeared from many verbs, and the prefix ge from all.\n\nThis Conjugation contains no verbs but such as are of the old Teutonic stock of the language. If we disregard an occasional prefix the verbs that belong to it are all monosyllabic.\n\n* In Sanscrit perfect tenses are formed thus, just as in Latin, from tud (the root of tundo) we get tu-tud-i; from mord, mo-mord-i; from dic (the root of disco) di-dic-i.\n\n\u2020 In Greek the initial consonant is repeated, but with the vowel sound weakened to e (as \u1f10-\u03b2\u03bf-\u03ba\u03b1). This formation occurs in several verbs in Latin, as pe-pul-i (from pello); pe-pig-i (from pango); ce-cid-i (from cado). In Gothic the reduplication consisted of the initial consonant followed by ai, as haitan (to call), hai-hait. In Anglo Saxon the reduplication once consisted of the first consonant followed by eo. (Koch, p. 240.)\n\n\u2021 Thus in old Frisian the preterite from the root halld passed through the stages ha-hald, ha-hild, he-hild, to held. In Latin the root leg (in lego) passed through the stages le-leg-i, le-eg-i, to legi; the root v\u0113n (in veni) through v\u0113-v\u0113n-i, v\u0113-ven-i, to v\u0113ni; the root fac through f\u0113-fic-i, f\u0113-ic-i, to f\u0113ci.\n\nIt is obvious that the changes described tended to result in giving a fuller and broader sound to the vowel of the root.\n\n\u00a7 In Gothic the preterite is hailhait. A few other Anglo-Saxon preterites show reduplication, especially when compared with Gothic. Thus r\u0101dun (to advise), pret. reord, shortened from reo-red (Gothic r\u0113dan, rairotth); l\u0113ian (to let), pret. leort (for leolt), shortened from leolot (Gothic l\u0113tan, laitolot); lacan (to leap); p.t. leole, shortened from leol-le (Gothic laikan, tailaikan); on-\u0101redan (to dread), pret. on-\u0101redord, shortened from on-\u0101red-o-\u0101red.\nTHE WEAK CONJUGATION.\n\n222. The preterite of verbs of the Weak Conjugation is formed by adding -ed or -t to the stem, e final (if there is one) being omitted, as wait-ed, lov-ed, deal-t.\n\nThe suffix -ed is pronounced as a separate syllable only after a dental mute, as in need-ed, pat-t-ed, mend-ed. The vowel y after a consonant is changed into i before it, as pity, pitted. After a sharp guttural or labial mute ed has the sound of t, as in tipped, knocked. In several verbs the suffix has vanished, though its previous existence is sometimes seen either in the weakening of the vowel of the stem, or in the change of final d into t, as meet, met; bend, bent.\n\n223. This suffix is in reality a preterite form * of the verb do, which was shortened in Anglo-Saxon into -de or -te. The suffix -de was attached to the root by the connecting vowel o or e, which, however, disappeared after some consonants. In modern English -de has become -d, and the connecting vowel is always -e, as in mend-ed. This vowel is omitted before -t, as it was in A.S. before -te.\n\nIt thus appears that in origin as well as in meaning, I loved is equivalent to I love did, or I did love; so that this preterite tense is in reality formed by means of an auxiliary verb.\u2020\n\n224. The perfect participle of most verbs of the weak conjugation is the same in form as the preterite. It had its origin in an adjective suffix -d or -t, akin to -tus in Latin. The prefix ge has been dropped. This conjugation contains many verbs of the old Teutonic stock of English; some verbs once of the Strong Conjugation; all verbs of Norman, French, or foreign origin; and all fresh formations.\n\n225.\u2014A. VERBS OF THE STRONG CONJUGATION.\n\n[Words in italics are obsolete forms.]\n\nI.

Whenever fresh verbs are formed or introduced, they are of the weak conjugation.\n\n\u2021 The verb fret is a compound of cat (for -cat = 'eat away'; Germ. veressen, jessen).\n\n\u00a7 A weak preterite bette or bet is found in old writers.\n### VERB\n\n| Pres. | Pret. | P.

In most of the following verbs the preterite in A.S. had a i in the singular and u in the pl. 3l. Hence probably came the twofold forms of the preterite. The perfect participle has usually lost its suffix. In these verbs the i of the present tense, and the u of the perfect participle are weakenings of the root vowel a.\n\n---\n\n* \"Jacob chode with Laban\" (Gen. xxxi. 36). Chid (= chidde) is of the weak form.\n\u2020 Took, forsook, shook, rode, broke, spoke, are used as participles by Shakspeare.\n\u2021 Born is now used only with reference to birth. Borne means carried.\n\u00a7 Also of the Weak Conjugation.\n\u2016 There is also a transitive verb hang of the Weak Conjugation, which has got mixed up with the Strong intransitive verb. Chaucer uses heng as transitive.\n\u00b6 In the phrase \"Some shall dear abide it\" (Sh. ful. Caes. ii. 2, x19), 'abide' is probably a mistake for the old verb abie or abyve (in old English abiggen, pret. abought), derived from cygan = 'to buy,' and means \"Some shall pay dear for it.\"\n** Also weak, awake, awaked. This verb (A.S. aweccan) is properly intransitive; the transitive verb ought to be weak (A.S. awacian). The forms have got mixed.\n### English Grammar\n\n#### Pres. | Pret. | P.

Besides the large class of what are frequently called Regular Verbs, because the preterite and perfect participle are uniformly made by the simple addition of -ed, which includes all verbs of French or Latin origin, the following verbs belong to the Weak Conjugation:\n\n- These forms are now usually avoided by the best writers. It may be that the preterite with u is simply the past participle adopted as a preterite, as in the vulgar idioms \"I seen him,\" \"He done it.\" This idiom is common in the Slavonic languages (Latham, *Introductio Phil.*, p. 58). The abbreviated participles driv, smit, rid, writ were used as preterites in the sixteenth century.\n- These forms are now used only as adjectives.\n- It is a mistake to make wound the preterite of wind = 'sound with the breath.' That verb is only a modern adaptation of a noun, and ought to be of the weak conjugation.\n- In these verbs the vowel of the present has been assimilated to that of the perfect participle. In A.S. the forms were yrnan and berstan. Compare the Scotch rin.\n- Also weak, cleave, cleft, cleft; heave, heaved, heaved; dig, digged, digged.\n- The simple verb queath (cue\u00f0an) is no longer used. To begueth is 'to allot a thing by speaking.' In A.S. the plural of the preterite had d instead of s in the plural; hence the form quod, used by Chaucer.\n### VERB.\n\n1.

In a similar way frore is found for frozen. \"The parching air burns fore\" (Par. Lost, ii. 595). In A.S. the verb was le\u00f3san, le\u00e1s-luron, loren, of the Strong Conjugation.\n\n\u2021 In early English we find the pretterites bledde, bredde, fedde, ladde, mette, &c.\n\n\u00a7 From the A.S. lesth\u00e6t. The verb light or alight, 'to come down gently,' is from lihtan (liht = German leicht). The two verbs, however, have been confounded, and the forms lighted and lit are used indifferently.\n\n\u00b6 Beseech is a compound of seek; k, ch, and gh are only varieties of the guttural sound.\n\n\u2020\u2020 The t is not radical. It is only used to indicate that ch has the sibilant sound. Chaucer uses raughte and straughte for reached and stretched (Kn. T. 2058). So also saught = fetched, pight = pitched, snaught = snatched. Straight is another form of stretched.\n\n** These in these verbs is not radical.\n\n\u2020\u2020 Bended became bent, just as in Chaucer standeth becomes stant; rydeth, ryt, &c.\n\n\u2021\u2021 Shend (German schinden) is used by Shakspeare.

Tight is a participle of tie (A.S. tigan). Distraught is an exceptional form from the verb distract. Straight is for stretched. Dight (shortened from dighted) is from A.S. dihtan = 'to adorn.' Yclept is from the old verb clypian = to call. Go borrows a preterite from the verb wend, properly to wend (or turn) one's way.|| Went was formerly a participle as well as a preterite tense. (\"Is went\" occurs in Chaucer, Pr. T. 1730.) The form yede (A.S. e\u00f3de) = 'went' used by Chaucer, is from the root i = 'go.'\n\n* In these verbs, however, the second person singular of the preterite is made in full, castest, thrustest, &c.\n\n\u2020 In old English the verb let ('allow' or 'leave alone') was a Strong Verb (A.S. letan). The strong preterite let is used by Chaucer. The past participle was lateu, leten, or lete. From this came the adjective late (A.S. let), meaning 'left alone' or 'left behind,' coming after the rest.' From this was made the causative verb let (A.S. lettan) = 'to make late, to hinder.' Of this Chaucer uses the (weak) preterite letted. The two verbs were distinct enough in Chaucer's time (as \"Sche let no morsel from her lippes falle,\" ProL 128; \"He letted nat his felawe for to see,\" i.e. 'he hindered not his companion from seeing,' Kn. T. 1034), but are confounded in modern English. The meaning 'leave' which the strong verb had (e.g., \"He let (= left) his sheep encombered in the myre,\" ProL 508) is still seen it 'Let me alone,' &c. Let had also the stronger meaning of 'make' or 'cause,' as \"This proude king leet make a statue of gold\" (Monkes T. 3349).\n\n1 Clad is a shortened form of claddle, A.S. claddle.\n\n2 The y in these verbs is a weakened form of the double guttural cg.\n\n|| Ago is a shortened form of agone.\nFrom the old verb *won* = 'to abide' or 'be accustomed' comes the preterite \"I wont\" = I was accustomed, and the present perfect \"I am wont\" (made like 'I am come'). The participle *wont* was turned into a noun (= custom), and from this noun is formed the adjective (not participle) *wonted*.\n\nFraught is a shortened form of fraughted from fraught (Dutch vrachten) a variety of freight. \"If thou fraught\" is found in Shakspeare (Cymb.).\n\n9. The following Weak Verbs were once of the Strong Conjugation:\n\n| Infinitive | Preterite in A.S. | Infinitive | Preterite in A.S. |\n|------------|-------------------|------------|-------------------|\n| carve      | cearf-curfon      | sleep      | sl\u00e9p (sleep in Ch.) |\n| cleave     | cleaf-clufon      | starve     | stearf-sturfon    |\n| creep      | creap-crupon      | step       | st\u00f3p (stope in Ch.) |\n| delve      | dealf-dulpon      | swell      | sweall-swullon    |\n| help       | healp-hulpon      | throng     | thrang (throng in Ch.) |\n| leap       | hle\u00f3p (leap in Ch.) | wash      | w\u00f3sc (wesh in Ch.) |\n| melt       | mealt-multon      | weep       | we\u00f3p (weep in Ch.) |\n\nPERSONAL INFLEXIONS OF AN ENGLISH VERB.\n\n227. The following table exhibits the personal inflexions of a verb. Let a single stroke (\u2014\u2014\u2014) stand for the infinitive mood (without *to*), and a double stroke (\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014) for the first person singular of the past indefinite tense.\n\n**Indicative Mood.**\n\n**Present Indefinite Tense.**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1.       |        |\n| 2.       | est or st |\n| 3.       | eth,\u2020 es, or s. |\n\n**Past Indefinite Tense.**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1.       |        |\n| 2.       | est or st,\u00a7 |\n| 3.       |        |\n\n**Subjunctive Mood.**\n\n**Present Indefinite Tense.**\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1.       |        |\n| 2.       |        |\n| 3.       |        |\n\n* Milton uses \"he wons\" = he dwells (German wohnen).\n\n\u2020 In early English the termination of the plural of this tense in all three persons was -es in the Northern, -en in the Midland, and -eth in the Southern dialects: \"They hopes\" (n); \"They hopen\" (m); \"They hopeth\" (s).\n\n\u2021 The pronunciation of fle-eth, se-eth, &c., shows that the suffix is -eth, not -th. The e of -est may be dropped whenever the pronunciation permits.\n\n\u00a7 This suffix originally belonged only to the weak conjugation. In the strong conjugation the suffix was -e, which we still find in Chaucer. (See \u00a7 230.) In the Northern dialect the e was thrown off, so that we find such forms as thou gaf, thou saw, &c. (See \u00a7 236.) In early English est or st was often thrown off in verbs of the weak conjugation, as \"Why nad (= ne had) thou put\" (Chaucer). This was especially the case in the Northern dialect.\n**Post Indefinite Tense.**\n\nThe same* as in the Indicative Mood.\n\nThe suffix *es* is added to verbs ending in a sibilant (as *pass-es*, *catch-es*); or *o* (as *go-es*, *do-es*); or *y* preceded by a consonant, as *fly-es*, *pity-es*. If a verb ends in *ic*, *c* is changed to *ck* before *-ing*, *-ed*, or *-eth*, to preserve the hard sound of the *c*, as *trafficking*, *mimicked*.\n\n### VERBAL INFLEXIONS IN ANGLO-SAXON.\n\n#### 228.\u2014A.

The use of *-est* or *-st* in the second person singular of the subjunctive does not belong to the earlier stages of the language.\n\n\u2020 This change is still found in Chaucer, as \"I wroot,\" \"we writen\"; \"I heng, they hynge.\"\nVERBAL INFLEXIONS IN CHAUCER.\n\n230. The Infinitive ends in -en or -e. The Imperfect Participle ends in -yng or -ynge. The Past Participle of Strong Verbs ends in -en or -e; that of Weak Verbs in -ed or -d (sometimes in -et or -t), and often has the prefix ge-, or its weakened form i-.\n\nThe inflected gerund is occasionally found (as 'to seeene,' Kn. T. 177). The Present Indicative has in the Singular the suffixes (1) e, often dropped or elided, (2) est, (3) eth, and in the Plural -en or -e for all persons.\n\nWhen a verb ends in -d or -t, -deth, or -teth is replaced by -t, as stant=standeth, ryty=rydeth, brest=bresteth (bursts).\n\nThe same inflexions occur in the Preterite Indicative of Weak Verbs. The suffix of the Preterite in Weak Verbs was -ede, -de, or -te. When the verb-stem ended in -t, the d of the suffix often disappeared, as in caste=castede. After -t we get -te, as lette, mette, &c. After -d the suffix was -de, as ledde, fedde, &c.\n\nThe Preterite of Strong Verbs has -e (now and then -est) in the Second Person Singular, and -en or -e in all persons of the plural. The plural also sometimes shows the curious change noticed in \u00a7 225, 4. Thus 'I schal,' 'ye schul'; 'I heng, they hynge,' &c.\n\nThe Present and Preterite Subjunctive have -e in all persons of the Singular and -en in all persons of the Plural.\n\nThe Imperative ends in -eth in the Plural, and (in some classes of verbs) in -e in the Singular. The Northern dialect has -s for -th in the Imperative.\n\nDEFECTIVE AND ANOMALOUS VERBS\n\n231. The verbs shall, will, may, must, can, dare, wit are defective; that is, have not all the usual moods and tenses.\n\nA peculiarity which all these verbs (except will) have in common, is, that the present tense is in reality a preterite of the strong conjugation, which has replaced an older present, and has had its own place supplied by a secondary preterite of the weak conjugation. One consequence of this is, that they none of them take -s as a suffix in the third person singular, as that suffix does not belong to the preterite tense. They take after them the infinitive without to.\n\n232.\n\n[Infinitive in A.S. sculan = 'to owe.']\n\nIndicative Mood.\n\n| Present Indefinite Tense | Past Indefinite Tense |\n|--------------------------|----------------------|\n| **Singular**             | **Plural**           |\n| 1.

(See \u00a7 219, note.) In early English we often find 'Thou shal,' 'Thou wil,' 'Thou can,' 'Thou may.'\nSubjunctive Mood.\n\nPast Indefinite Tense.\n\nSingular...1. [I] should. 2. [Thou] should or shouldst* 3. [He] should.\nPlural......1. [We] should. 2. [You] should. 3. [They] should\n\nShall (A.S. sceal) is (in form) a preterite.\u2020 When it came to be used as a present tense, another preterite (should) of the weak conjugation was formed to supply its place. The ou of should comes from the u of sculan. In Anglo-Saxon the verb means 'to owe'\u2021 It then came to indicate some compulsion or obligation arising either from the will of some superior authority, or from some external source. Hence it is used in direct or reported commands, as \"Thou shalt not steal\"; \"Ye shall not surely die,\" i.e. 'There is surely no edict that ye shall die'; \"The tyrant shall perish,\" i.e. 'Circumstances or the will of others demand that the tyrant shall perish'; \"He demanded where Christ should be born,\" i.e. 'Where it was fated or prophesied that he was to be born'; \"You should always obey your parents,\" i.e. 'It is your duty to obey your parents.' It often conveys this sense in the first person, as \"What shall I do?\" i.e. \"What ought I (or am I) to do?\" and even when used as an auxiliary the verb does not always altogether lose this force. (See \u00a7 213.)\n\nIn exclamations it is often omitted, as \"What, I love! I sue! I seek a wife!\" \"Thou wear a lion's hide!\" (Shakespeare).\n\nIn Scotch and in the Northern dialects I shall is often abbreviated to Pse or Ish.\n\nWILL.\n\nInfinitive Mood\u2014To Will (A.S. willan).\n\nIndicative Mood.\n\nPresent Indefinite Tense.\n\n| Singular | Plural |\n|----------|--------|\n| 1.

It has this force in all its persons, as\u2014\"Not as I will, but as thou wilt\"; \"In spite of warning, he will continue his evil practices.\"\n\nThis verb is also used to express the frequent repetition of an action;\n\n* This -est or -st is modern. (See note \u00a7 on \u00a7 227.)\n\u2020 According to Grimm shall or skal is the preterite or perfect of a verb meaning to kill. As killing involved the payment of the penalty or wer-geld, 'I have killed,' came to mean 'I owe the fine,' and thence 'I owe' simply.\n\u2021 \"Hu micel scealt \u00feu?\" = \"How much shalt thou?\" = \"How much owest thou? (Luke xvi. 5). So in Chaucer, \"The feith I shal (= owe) to God and yow\" (Tr. and Cr. 1600). But the verb is also used in Anglo-Saxon as the auxiliary of the future tense.\nas, \"When he was irritated, he would rave like a madman,\" \"Sometimes a thousand twanging instruments will hum about my ears\" (Shaksp., Tempest).\n\nAn old form of the present was I wol or I wole (compare the Latin volo), whence the negative I won't. In colloquial English the verb is often shortened by the omission of wi or woul, as I'll = I will, I'd = I would. (Respecting chill, chud, &c., see \u00a7 137.) In old English it was combined with the negative ne, ic nille = I will not, ic nolde = I would not. We still have the phrase willy nilly = will he nill he, or will ye nill ye.\n\nThe participle willing has become a mere qualitative adjective. Besides willan there existed in Anglo-Saxon the Weak forms willian and wilrian, meaning, 'to desire or wish for.' From willian comes the transitive verb 'to will,' conjugated like an ordinary weak verb and admitting an object after it, as \"He wills my destruction,\" \"They willed my ruin.\" Chaucer (Sq. T. 120) has wilneth = desireth.\n\n### 234.\n\n**MAY.**\n\n**Indicative and Subjunctive Moods.**\n\n| Present Indefinite Tense | Past Indefinite Tense |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| **Singular.**            | **Plural.**           |\n| 1.

Inf. magan). The modern present, I may, &c., is in reality a preterite tense of an older verb, and (like memini, novi, &c.) had originally a perfect meaning of its own, which passed into a secondary present sense, denoting the abiding result of some action.\n\nA collateral variety of may was mow or move. 'They mowe = they may in Chaucer (Cl. T. 530); \"Nought mought (= could) him awake\" (Spenser, F. Q. I. 1, 42).\n\n### 237.\n\nThe verb may formerly denoted the possession of strength or power to do anything.* It now indicates the absence of any physical or moral obstacle to an action, as \"A man may be rich and yet not happy\"; \"He might be seen any day walking on the pier,\" i.e., 'there was nothing to hinder his being seen.' The notion of permission springs naturally from this meaning. When thus used it is a principal or notional verb.\n\nThe verb may (when itself in the subjunctive mood) is often employed\n\n---\n\n* Thus in Matt. viii. 2, for \"Thou canst make me clean\" we find in Anglo-Saxon \"\u00f0u miht me gleclansian\"; in Wycliffe's version, \"Thou maist make me clene.\" In A.S. \"b\u00fatan nettum h\u00fantian ic mag\" (I can hunt without nets).\n\nThe root of this verb (mag) is identified by some (Fick, Vergl. W\u00f6rte, vol. iii. p. 227) with that of mag-nus, mac-tus, and \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, size and strength being closely related ideas.\nas a mere auxiliary of the subjunctive after *that* and *lest*. Instead of \"Give me this water that I thirst not,\" we now say \"that I may not thirst.\" (See \u00a7 185.)\n\n**MUST.**\n\n238. This verb has now no variations of form.\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon we find *Infinitive* m\u00f3tan = 'to be able.'\n\n*Indic. Pres. Sing.* 1. M\u00f3t; 2. M\u00f3st; 3. M\u00f3t. *Pl. M\u00f3ton.*\n\n*Pret. Sing.* 1 and 3. M\u00f3ste; 2. M\u00f3stedest. *Pl. Moston.*\n\nIn Chaucer, *Sing.* 1 and 3. Mot or moot; 2. Most or must; *Pl.* mooten or moote; though he also uses 'I moste' as a present tense; thus, 'I moste gon' = 'I must go' (*Tale of M. of L.* 282).\n\n239. *Must* (A.S. m\u00f3ste) is the preterite * of the verb m\u00f3tan = to be allowed, or to be in a position to do something.* It still has this sense in such phrases as \"You must not come in,\" *i.e.*, 'You are not permitted to come in.' The old present *mote* is still used by Spenser.\n\n240. When the preterite *must* came to be used as a present, it acquired a stronger sense, and was used to express (1) being bound or compelled to do something, as \"He must do as he is bid\"; (2) being unable to control the desire or will, hence a fixed determination to do something; as \"I must and will have my own way\"; \"So you must always be meddling, must you?\"; (3) Certainty, or the idea that a thing cannot but be as is stated; as \"He surely must have arrived by this time\"; \"It must be so; Plato, thou reasonest well.\"\n\n241. The verb *must* is now used only in the indicative mood, and with a present signification. In the sense 'was obliged' (as in \"He must needs pass through Samaria,\" *John iv.* 4) it is obsolete. \"I must have been mistaken\" means \"It must be the case that I was mistaken,\" *i.e.* 'It can not (present) be that I was not mistaken.'\n\n242.\n\n**CAN.**\n\n*Indicative Mood.*\n\n| Present Indefinite Tense. | Past Indefinite Tense. |\n|--------------------------|-----------------------|\n| Singular.                | Singular.             |\n| 1.

Compare the form *twist* (\u00a7 245). See *Koch*, i. p. 356.\n\n\u2020 E.g., \"Josep bed Pilatus \u00fe\u00e6t he m\u00f3ste niman \u00fe\u00e6s H\u00e6lendes lichaman,\" \"Joseph begged Pilate that he might be allowed to (must) take the Saviour's body\" (*John xix.* 38).\n\n\u2021 \"Fr\u00e9lissa was as faire as faire mote bee\" (*F. Q.* i. 2, 37). Byron, who sometimes affects archaisms without understanding them, uses *mote* as a past tense, \"Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.\"\n243.\n\nANGLO-SAXON FORMS.\n\nInfinitive cunnan; P.

'c\u00fa\u00f0e' and early English 'coude' have lost the n of the root, which was still used in Gothic (kuntha). See \u00a7 137. Coude or could is of the Weak Conjugation.\n\nThe old meaning of the verb is 'to know,'* a sense which it still bears in Chaucer,\u2020 and which is preserved in the form 'to con.' The adjective cunning is the old Imperfect Participle of the verb. A 'cunning person' is a 'knowing person.' Uncouth is a compound of the Past Participle,\u2021 and in Milton means \"unknown\" (Lycid. 186).\n\nCan (= novi in Latin) is the Preterite (Strong form) from a present which has disappeared.\u00a7 Unlike shalt, wilt, &c., 'canst' has -st.\u00b6\n\n244.\n\nOUGHT.\n\nSingular. Plural.\n\n1. [I] ought 1. [We] ought\n2. [Thou] oughtest 2. [You] ought\n3. [He] ought 3. [They] ought\n\nOught is the past tense of the verb to owe\u00b6 and is used in its old sense by Shakspeare (I. King H. IV., iii. 3), \"He said you ought him a thousand pounds.\" It is now used as a past only in the reported form, as 'He said I ought to be satisfied.' In direct sentences the reference to past time is indicated by using a perfect infinitive after it, as \"He ought to have said so,\" i.e., \"It was his duty to say so.\" \"He ought (pres.) to do it\" means \"he owes the doing of it.\"**\n\n* As \"Ne cann ic g\u00f3w\" = 'I knew you not' (Matt. xxv. 12).\n\u2020 As \"Can no division\" = 'Knows no distinction' (Kn. T. 923). It also means 'to be able,' as \"That ne conne not know\" = 'That are not able to know' (Man of L. T. 483).\n\u2021 Connected with the participle couth (A.S. gec\u00fa\u00f0) is the noun kith = 'acquaintance.'\n\u00a7 Kith and kin' means 'acquaintance and kinsfolk.'\n\u00b6 Can is another form of the Aryan root gun or gn\u00e1, which appears as gno or kno in gno-eco and kno. Name (like no-men) contains the root without the g or k. The word kno is cognate, but of Scandinavian origin. (Skeat, Et. Dict.)\n\u00b6 In Gothic, however, it is kant.\n\u2020\u2020 The present tense of A.S. \u00e1gan was 'Ic ah,' &c. This is in reality a preterite formation. From it was formed the secondary preterite \u00e1hte. The guttural h of this word accounts for the gh of ought.\n** Compare the Latin 'Hoc facere debet.' Debeo is a compound of de and habeo; 'I have from' = 'I owe to.'\nThe original meaning of 'to owe' (A.S. dgan) was 'to possess.' It often has this meaning in Shakspeare. (See Schmidt's Lexicon.) \"You owse me a thousand pounds\" means really \"You have for me a thousand pounds.\" Though the dative is essential to the meaning, the verb came to have its modern sense independently of the dative.*\n\nFrom the A.S. dgan was formed a passive participle dgen\u2014'possessed.' The adjective own is the modern form of this. \"My own book\" = 'My possessed book.' This adjective was turned into the verb 'to own,' from which 'owned' was made in its turn. So in A.S. from 'agen' was made 'agnian' = 'to own.' 'To own' = 'to grant or concede' is from the different A.S. verb unnan (still used by Layamon and Ormin). It has got confused with the preceding verb.\n\nThere used to be a perfect participle ought.\u2020 To owe, in its modern sense, is conjugated regularly as a verb of the weak conjugation.\n\n245. WIT.\n\nTo wit (A.S. witan) means 'to know.' \"I do you to wit,\" means 'I make you to know.' The forms I wot, God wot, you wot, they wot, are found in old writers. Wot (A.S. wdt) is a preterite of the strong form, used as a present,\u2021 and replaced by a preterite wist of the weak conjugation.\u00a7\n\nIn Chaucer the forms for the present are\u2014Sing. 1. wot; 2. wost; 3. wot or woot; Pl. witen.\n\nWots, wotteth (Gen. xxxix. 8), and wotted are false forms (see \u00a7 227), as is the participle wottling (Winter's Tale, iii. 2). The old form was witende. The correct form is retained in unwittingly. The past participle unwisit is used by Surrey. (Comp. Germ. ungewusst.) Combination with the negative ne gave the old English forms nat (i.e. ne wdt) = know not, niste (i.e. ne wisle) = knew not, &c.\n\nDARE.\n\n246. I dare is an old preterite, now used as a present. The third person is therefore properly he dare, not he dares (\u00a7 231). The past tense now in use is 'I durst.' (The older form of the root was daurs, which accounts for the s. Compare \u03b8\u03b1\u03c1-\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd.) To dare is also conjugated like an ordinary Weak Verb. The two sets of forms have got confused.\n\nAnglo-Saxon Forms:\u2014Sing. 1. dear; 2. dearest; 3. dear. Pl. durron.|| Past Tense. dorste, &c.\n\n* In early English we find a very curious impersonal use of ought; thus \"Us oughte have patience\" = 'It beseems us to have patience' (Chaucer, Melib); \"As him oughte\" (Man of L. T., 1097).\n\n\u2020 Phrases like \"He hadn't ought to do it\" are perfectly grammatical, though vulgar.\n\n\u2021 The root wot is the same as Fid in the Greek Fideiv, and vid in the Latin vid-eo, and originally meant see. The preterite present wot may be compared with the Greek olou. 'I have seen' = 'I know.'\n\n\u00a7 The s of wist is a softened form of the t of wit before the t of the suffix in witte. This change occurs in various Teutonic languages. Compare must (\u00a7 239, note), \"I wist not that he was the high priest\" = 'I knew not,' &c. (Acts xxiii. 5). Wist has nothing to do with an imaginary pre-ent I wis, which (when not a mere affectation) is simply a corruption of the word ywis = certain (A.S. gerwis). The verb to wis = to show or teach (A.S. wisian or wissan) is a different verb, though derived from the same root.\n\n|| These inflexions mark a preterite tense.\nTHINKS.\n\n247. The impersonal THINKS (in methinks) means 'seems,' and comes from the Anglo-Saxon thincan, 'to appear.' The past tense is methought.* It is not the same as the verb 'I think' (from thencan), though the latter verb (meaning 'I cause to appear,' i.e. to my mind) is related to the former as 'drench' (= make to drink) is to 'drink.'\n\n\"Me LISTS\" = it pleases me. \"Him listed\" = it pleased him. This verb is sometimes used as personal; 'I list,' &c., like please.\u2020\n\n\"Woe worth the day\" = 'Woe be to the day.' WORTH is a relic of the old verb weorthan = to become.\n\nHIGHT (= is called or was called) is properly a reduplicated perfect (Gothic haihait) of hitan 'to call,' or 'be named.' It is also used as a present tense. Chaucer has the present \"I hoote\" (Kn. T. 700), and the preterite \"highte\" (Prol. 616). In Shakspeare 'hight' is a present tense.\u2021 The verb hitan (like heissen in German) means both 'to command or promise' and 'to be called' (i.e. 'to call or proclaim oneself'). In A.S. the preterite was heht in the active sense, and hatte in the passive sense.\n\nNEED, though not a preterite, has been so far assimilated to the preterite-present verbs, that the third person is 'he need,' not 'he needs.' When thus used, the verb has the sense \"to be under a necessity to do something.\" Where it signifies \"to be in want of\" it is conjugated in the ordinary manner. The third person singular needs must not be confounded with the adverb needs (i.e. of need or necessity), as in \"He must needs go through Samaria.\"\n\nDIGHT (from dihtan 'to adorn') is a perf. part. shortened from dighted.\u00a7 Dight was also once used as a present tense and as a preterite.\n\n248.

[They] have.    |\n\n* In Chaucer we find 'it thinketh me' (Kn. T. 3968), and 'it thoughte me' (Prol. 385).\n\u2020 These impersonal verbs were formerly much more common. Thus \"The hunghreth\" (Piers Pl., &c.); \"Me thursteth\"; \"It me forthynketh\" = 'poenitet me'; \"Hem nedeth.\" In Chaucer we find \"Me mette\" = 'I dreamed'; \"Him gamed\" = 'he was pleased'; \"Him smerte\" = 'he was pained.'\n\u2021 As: \"This grisly beast, which by name Lion hight, the trusty Thisbe, . . did scare away\" (Mids. N. D. v. i). There is no participle hight, though Byron invents one. (Compare note on \u00a7 239.) In early English we find 'was haten' or 'was hoten' (= was called). The root of hitan is identical with that of the Greek \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9. This interchange of t or d with l is quite common, as in lacrima = \u03b4\u03ac\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf\u03bd = tear. (See note \u00a7 on \u00a7 101.)\n\u00a7 Decked (from deck), meaning 'covered' or 'adorned,' has got confused with this word.\nENGLISH GRAMMAR.\n\nPresent Perfect Tense.\nSingular. [I] have had, &c.

In Anglo-Saxon the stem of the verb is *hab* (*Infin.*, 'habban'). But the *b* is softened to *f* before a suffix beginning with a consonant. The personal inflexions are those of the Weak Conjugation.\n\nFor the infinitive or plural haven Chaucer uses *han*. He also uses *nath* (*ne hath*) = *hath* not; *nadde* or *nad* (*ne hadd*) = *had* not. Similar forms were used in Anglo-Saxon.\n\nWhen the verb is used as a mere auxiliary of perfect tenses, the notion of 'possessing' has (now) altogether evaporated.\n\nThere is nothing anomalous in the conjugation of *Have*, except that *havest* becomes *hast*; *haved*, *had*; *haves*, *has*; and *haveth*, *hath*.\n\nThe verb *have* sometimes has the meaning of *keep* or *hold* (as 'to have in mind'). It may then be conjugated like an ordinary verb.\n\n250.

In \"Everything that pretty bin\" (Shaksp.), *bin* is probably *blural*, everything being treated as equivalent to *all things* (see \u00a7 175). Byron's use of *bin* (\"There bin another pious reason\") is of no authority. See note on \u00a7 239. In the Northern dialect (e.g., in Hampole and \"Cursor Mundi\"), *es* and *er* (= *is* and *are*) are alternative plural forms for all persons. Shakespeare often uses *is* as a plural. As the word consists of the mere root (*is* = *as*) without suffix, it may as well be plural as singular. Similar remarks apply to *wes* and *wer*, which are both plural in the Northern dialect.

Inspection of the preceding forms will show that the conjugation of this verb is made up from three different roots.\n(1.) The present tense of the indicative mood is formed from the old Aryan root *as*, which appears in Greek and Latin in the form *es*. The *s* of the root is dropped in *am* = *a(s)m*, and softened to *r* in *art* and *are*.\n\nIn *am*-m is a relic of the pronoun *me* of the First Person* (\u00a7 219). It occurs in no other English verb. Respecting the suffix -i in *art*, see \u00a7 219 and note. *Is* is the mere root without personal suffix. *Are* (= *aron*, i.e. *as-on*, of the Northern dialect) is of Scandinavian origin. *Sind* has exactly the same radical elements as *sunt* in Latin.\n\n(2.) The present subjunctive, the imperative, the infinitive, and the participles are formed from the root *be*\u2020\n\n(3.) The past indefinite tense of the indicative and subjunctive is formed from the root *wes* or *was*, *s* being softened to *r* in the plural and in the subjunctive.\u00a7\n\nIn old English *nam* (*ne am*) = *am not*, *nart* (*ne art*) = *art not*, &c.\n\nThe verb *be* has its notional meaning (\u00a7 185) in such sentences as \"To be, or not to be, that is the question.\"\n\n253. The verb *be* is a most important verb for the right understanding of the etymology and syntax of verbs in general, because it has distinct forms for the past indefinite in the indicative and subjunctive moods. The verb *be*, therefore, is a test verb. By substituting it (if possible) in place of any other verb in a sentence where the construction is doubtful or difficult, we can see directly what part of the verb it is that is really used. In such sentences as, \"He would not come (i.e. 'he was not willing to come') when I called him;\" \"He could not lift the weight (i.e. 'he was not able to lift the weight') when he tried;\" \"He told me that I might go\" (i.e. 'that it was permitted me to go'); the verbs *could*, *would*, *might*, are in the indicative mood; the sentences are simple assertions. On the other hand, in such sentences as \"I could not do it if I were to try;\" \"I should not have said that, if you had not asked me;\" \"I would not tell you if I could;\" \"He might have done it if he had liked;\"\u2014the verbs which are in italics are in the subjunctive mood; it is impossible to substitute for them phrases containing the indicative mood of the verb 'be.'\n\n254.

The root *as* (according to some authorities) means 'breathe.'\n\n\u2020 The root *be* is the same as *fu-* or *fo-* in Latin (*fui*, *fore*) and \u03c8\u03c5 (\u03c8\u03b9\u03c9) in Greek, and means 'grow' or 'cause to grow.'\n\n\u00a7 The root *wes* is said to mean 'abide.'\nIndicative Mood.\n\nPresent Indefinite Tense.\n\nSingular. 1.

[You] did; 3. [They] did.\n\n254b. Do (when used as a notional verb) is not defective in Voice, Mood, or Tense. Did is a reduplicated Preterite. (See \u00a7 221.) The forms doest and dooth do not belong to the verb when it is a mere auxiliary, nor do the infinitive mood and the participles. Do requires the simple infinitive (\u00a7 195) after it ('do love,' &c.), except in the phrase \"I (we) do you to wit.\"\n\n255. This verb do (A.S. d\u014dn) must not be confounded with do from A.S. d\u016bgan, 'to avail, to be strong, to profit,' which is used in the phrases 'That will do,' 'How do you do?' &c. (In Scotch dow, pret. docht, doucht or dought, from which we get doughty.) Through confusion the preterite did is now used for both verbs.\n\nDo is used as an ordinary transitive verb, as 'He did the deed'; 'Do justice.' Formerly, also, when followed by the simple infinitive it had the sense of 'make' or 'cause,' as:\u2014\"Sche doth me al this wo endure\" (Chaucer, Kn. T. 1538 = 'She causes me to endure'); \"They have done her understande\" (Gower) = 'They have made her understand'; \"We do f you to wit.\" Do had also the sense of 'put,' as don = 'put on'; dup = 'put up' (i.e. 'open'; compare the German aufhun); doff = 'put off'; dout or douse = 'put out.'\n\nDo is also used as an intransitive notional verb, as \"I shall not do so,\" i.e. 'act so.'\n\n256. Do as an auxiliary verb, followed by the simple infinitive of a verb, constitutes a compound equivalent of the simple present or past indefinite tense of that verb. Thus \"I do see\" = 'I see'; \"He did fall\" = 'he fell.' When an emphasis is laid upon the auxiliary verb this form becomes the emphatic form \u2020 of the verb, as \"I do love you\"; \"That does astonish me.\"\n\nThis compound form is used in ordinary \u00a7 speech instead of the simple present and past indefinite tenses of verbs in negative and interrogative sentences, as:\u2014\"I do not hear you\" = 'I hear you not'; \"We did not speak\" = 'we spoke not'; \"Do you hear?\" = 'Hear you?'; \"Did he not say so?\" = 'said he not so?'\n\nBut the verb do is never employed when the subject of the sentence is an interrogative pronoun, or when an interrogative word qualifies the subject or an adjective attached to the subject, as \"Who broke the window?\" \"Which boy did this?\" \"How many persons voted?\"\n\n* Wedgwood, however, suggests that in this phrase 'do' = 'perform,' \"How do you perform the duties and functions of life?\" and compares the old French \"Comment le faites vous?\" So in German we have \"Was machen Sie?\"\n\n\u2020 Or does this mean \"We put you to the knowing of it\"?\n\n\u2021 The emphatic sense is due entirely to the stress laid upon the auxiliary. It does not exist when there is no stress on the verb do. But then any verb becomes emphatic when a stress is laid upon it.\n\n\u00a7 In poetry the simple forms are frequently retained.\nWith elision of the dependent infinitive, the unemphatic verb *do* forms a weak repetition of a preceding verb, as \"I do not spend so much as he does [spend]\"; \"We went away before you did [go].\"\n\nCompound forms made with the auxiliary *do* are never used to replace a compound tense of the active voice, or any tense whatever of the passive voice; nor is *do* used with the verbs *have*, *be*, *may*, *can*, *must*, *shall*, *will*, except that it may form an emphatic imperative of 'have' and 'be,' as \"Do have patience\"; \"Do be quiet.\"\n\n257.

The verb *have* is used to form all the **Perfect Tenses** (present, past, and future) in both voices. It is solely a tense-sign.\n\n2. The verb *be* is used to form all the **Imperfect Tenses** of either voice, and as the auxiliary of the **Passive Voice.** In the Passive it is both a **Voice-sign** and a **Tense-sign.** The verb *be* is also used to form the Perfect Tenses of some neuter verbs in the Active Voice, as 'He is gone,' 'They were come.'\n\n3. The verbs *shall* and *will* are used in the Indicative Mood as Tense-signs to form the **Future Tenses.** (See \u00a7 210.)\n\n4. *May* and *might,* *should* and *would* are used, when they have themselves a subjunctive force, to make the compound or periphrastic forms of the present and past tenses of the Subjunctive Mood of other verbs. When thus used these verbs are **Mood-signs.** (See \u00a7 237.)\n\n5. *Do* is used as an auxiliary to form Present and Past Indefinite Tenses, under the restrictions stated in \u00a7 256.\n\n**ADVERB.***\n\n258. It has been seen (\u00a7 88) that things belonging to the same group are distinguished from each other by certain qualities or attributes which are denoted by **adjectives.**\n\n---\n\n* Latin *adverbum* (from *ad* and *verbum*), Greek *\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1.* It was so named because its relation to the verb was the most marked and frequent. Adverbs, Prepositions, and Conjunctions are Secondary Parts of Speech. See \u00a7 25.\nIn like manner different instances of an action or attribute are distinguished from each other as regards the Time, the Place, the Manner, the Degree, or the Attendant Circumstances in which each occurs or is found. These constitute the 'Conditions' which limit an action or attribute, or distinguish it from other instances of the same sort.\n\n259. Definition.\u2014Adverbs are words which denote the conditions which limit or distinguish an action or attribute. This is what is meant by saying that an adverb is a word which modifies a verb, adjective, or other adverb, as \"He writes badly\"; \"The book is too long\"; \"He reads very badly.\"\n\n260. An adverb adds something to the meaning of a verb or adjective, but does not alter the meaning of the word itself. 'Writes badly,' means all that 'writes' means, and 'badly' besides. But this word 'badly' restricts the application of the verb 'writes' to a certain class of the actions described by it. Therefore we may also have the\n\nDefinition.\u2014An Adverb is a word which adds to the meaning, and limits the application, of a verb,* adjective, or other adverb.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF ADVERBS.\n\n261. Adverbs may be classified in two ways, (1) according to their syntactical force, (2) according to their meaning.\n\n262. As regards their syntactical force adverbs are of two kinds:\u20141. Simple Adverbs; 2. Conjunctive Adverbs.\n\nA simple adverb is one which does nothing more than modify the word with which it is used, as \"We arrived yesterday\"; \"He is coming hither.\" Interrogative adverbs come under this head, as \"Whither has he gone?\" (where whither modifies has gone); \"How many were present?\" (where how modifies many).\n\nA conjunctive adverb is one which not only modifies some verb, adjective, or other adverb in its own clause, but connects the clause in which it occurs with the rest of the sentence; as when (\"Come when you are ready\"); whither (\"Whither I go, ye cannot come\").\n\nHere when modifies the verb are, and whither modifies go.\n\n263. A relative adverb always refers to some demonstrative word, expressed or understood, which stands to it in the same sort of relation that the antecedent stands in to a relative pronoun, as, \"Come (then) when you are ready;\" \"There, where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,\"\n\n* An Adverb may be attached to an Infinitive Mood or a Gerund, as \"To rise early (or rising early) is a wholesome practice.\"\nCare is necessary to distinguish connective adverbs* from connective words which are not adverbs. Many conjunctions refer to time, place, cause, &c.; but they do not refer to these conditions in connection with any verb or adjective of the clause which they introduce; but the whole of the subordinate clause has the force of an adverb attached to some word in the principal clause of the sentence, as \"He said that because he believed it.\" Here because does not, by itself, modify either the verb believed or the verb said, but the clause because he believed it is an adverbial clause modifying the verb said.\n\n264. The following words are conjunctive adverbs: When, where, whither, whence, how,\u2020 why,\u2021 wherein, whereby, wherefore, whereon, whereat, whereout, whereafter, wherever, as.\u00a7\n\n265. Both simple and connective adverbs may be classified according to their meaning, as\u2014\n\n1. Adverbs of Time: Now, then, after, before, presently, immediately, when, as, \"As I was returning I met him,\" &c.\n\n2. Adverbs of Place and Arrangement: Here, there, thence, where, whither, whence, wherein, whereat, in, out, up, down, within, without, firstly, secondly, &c.\n\n* Such words as where, when, whither, &c., are as unquestionably adverbs when used with a connective force, as they are when used interrogatively, or as are the corresponding words there, then, thither, &c. It is a mistake to class them among the conjunctions. It is true that they are connective or conjunctive words, but so are Relative Pronouns; yet nobody calls who or which a 'Conjunction.'\n\nThe so-called test of an adverb, given by some writers, that it is a word which can be moved about to various positions in the sentence, breaks down completely when applied to the Interrogative and Connective adverbs. All these mechanical modes of distinguishing the Parts of Speech are mere nuisances. They hinder the learner from the necessary work of mastering the functions of words, and teach him to substitute the show of knowledge for the reality.\n\n\u2020 As in such a sentence as: \"This was how he did it.\" In \"How did you do it?\" or \"Tell me how you did it.\" How is a simple interrogative adverb.\n\n\u2021 As in \"That was why I said so,\" or \"That is the reason why I did it.\"\n\n\u00a7 As (in early English also, also, also; A.S. ealso) is simply a strengthened form of so, 'all so,' i.e. 'just so,' completely so.' In A.S. and early English swa and so were both relatively and demonstratively, as \"Swa sone swa heo milten\" = 'as soon as they could' (Layamon, 25625); \"So sone so\" = 'as soon as' (Ancren Rievle, 374). Also or as had the same two functions, and has them still. Thus \"He is as rich as his father\" = 'tam divers est quam pater suus,\" \"Thou art me leof also mi fader\" (Layamon, 3047) is but a step removed from \"Thou art dear to me. All so [dear], i.e. just so [dear] is my father.\"\n\nAs, when used relatively, relates to manner (\"do as I tell you\"), to degree (\"as tall as his brother\"), to time (\"he arrived as we were setting out\"), and to the conditions of an action or event (see Syntax, 'Adverbial Clauses of Condition'). When used demonstratively 'as' only relates to degree, and therefore can only modify an adjective or adverb. With verbs the full form also is used with a modified meaning.\n\nIt has been seen (\u00a7 157) that so (swa) was used to convert an interrogative or demonstrative pronoun into a relative pronoun. As was used in a similar manner, thus: \"Ther as (=where) this lord was keeper of the selle\" (Chaucer, Prolo. 172). So in Spenser (F. Q. iv. 1, 20), \"There whereas all the plagues and harmes abound.\" Whereas is still used as a relative adverb, referring to the circumstances under which something takes place.\n\nA curious use of as before the imperative mood is found in Chaucer and other old writers. Thus: \"As beth not wroth with me\" = 'Pray be not wroth with me,' i.e. 'Just in these circumstances be not wroth with me.'\n\nThose who find it difficult to admit that as is a relative pronoun (\u00a7 165) may explain some of the phrases in which it occurs on the principle that the mode or manner in which a thing is, may represent some quality by which it is distinguished. Thus \"Sic sum. Ego hunc esse aliter credidi. Ego isti nihil sum aliter ac fui\" (Terence, Phorm. III. 2, 42). So in German \"Ein solcher wie er.\"\n3. Adverbs of Repetition: Once, twice, &c.\n\n4. Adverbs of Manner: Well, ill, badly, how, however, so, as.\n   To this class belong the numerous adverbs formed from adjectives by the suffix ly, as rightly, badly, &c.\n\n5. Adverbs of Quantity or Degree: Very, nearly, almost, quite, much, more, most, little, less, least, all, half, any, the (\"the more the better,\" &c., see \u00a7 270). These are only a particular kind of Adverbs of Manner.\n\n6. Adverbs of Affirmation and Negation: Not, no, nay, aye, yea.\n\n7. Adverbs of Cause and Consequence: Therefore, wherefore, why, consequently.\n\nFORMATION OF ADVERBS.\n\n266. Adverbs are for the most part formed by inflexion, derivation, or composition, from nouns, adjectives and pronouns.\n\n267. Adverbs derived from Nouns.\n\n1. Adverbial Genitives.*\u2014Needs (= of necessity), straightways, noways,\u2020 and some others are old genitive cases of nouns. Adverbs of this sort were once more common.\n\nSome adverbial phrases, as 'Day and night,' 'Summer and winter,' 'one day' were once genitives. The genitive suffix was sometimes replaced by of, as 'of a truth' (A.S. s\u014dtes), 'of a morning,' &c.\n\n2. Adverbial Datives.\u2014Whilom (A.S. hwilum) is a dative plural, meaning 'at whiles' ('formerly,' 'on a time'). The adverbs in -meal were compounds of the dative plural maclum, 'by portions,' as piecemal, inchmeal \u2020 (Shaks. Temp. ii. 2), limbmeal (Cymb. ii. 4). Ever and never \u00a7 were once datives singular (afre and nefre).\n\n3. Adverbial Accusatives.\u2014A numerous class of adverbial phrases (\u00a7 372, i) consist of a noun (which was originally in the accusative) qualified by an adjective. Several of these have hardened into compound adverbs, as meantime, sometime, sometimes, alway (A.S. ealne weg), midway, straightway, likewise (= in like manner), yesterday (A.S. gestran dag), somewhat, meanwhile.\n\n* Adverbial genitives were common in Anglo-Saxon, as s\u014dtes 'of a truth'; niktes, 'by night'; dages, by day' (compare 'of a morning,' &c.); sylfwilles, 'of free will,' &c. They sprang out of a peculiar instrumental use of the genitive, as \"Godes ponces, 'by the will of God'; wordes and adele, 'by word and deed.'\n\n\u2020 Some of these are mixed up with compounds of wise (Germ. Weise). Thus we have lengthways and lengthwise, noways and nowise. \"Go thy ways\" contains a genitive adverb, \"bonne rides etc his weges,\" \"then rides each his way\" (King Alf. Tr. of Orostus).\n\n\u2021 A superfluous by is sometimes placed before these words, as \"By inchmeal.\"\n\n\u00a7 Ever is sometimes wrongly substituted for never in such expressions as \"He told never so many lies,\" \"Be they never so many,\" i.e., 'be they many, so that they were never so many.' In like manner people commonly say, 'Don't do more than you can help,' instead of 'Don't do more than you can't help' (De Morgan).\nAlso nouns in the objective case may be used as adverbs without a qualifying adjective, as 'We journeyed home' (or North, South, &c.).\n\n4. A large class of adverbial adjuncts consist of a noun preceded by a proposition (\u00a7 372, 4). Some of these have been welded together into a single word, and so have become Adverbs.\n\nThus with the preposition on (weakened to a*) we get abed, asleep, ahead, afoot, adrift, aloft (= on lyfste 'in the air'), away, &c. With by (weakened to be) we get betimes, besides, between (= by twain).\n\nSimilar formations give forsooth, overboard, to-day, to-morrow.\n\n5. A few adverbs are derived from nouns by the suffix -long (formerly linge, answering to -lings in German), as headlong (formerly heedlynge), sidelong, or sidling\u2020 (sidlinges). Darkling comes from an adjective, as does flatlong (= 'not on the edge') in Shakspeare (Tempest). The suffix lins is still common in Scotch.\n\n268. Adverbs derived from Adjectives.\n\nThe genitive suffix -s appears in else (i.e. elles, the genitive of a root el or al, meaning other), once\u00a7 (for ones, from one), twice (formerly twyes), thrice (formerly thryes or thries), unawares, &c. Much (as in much greater = greater by much) and little were datives (miclum, lyllum). Other adverbs were once accusative cases of adjectives, as all, enough, &c.\n\nBy prefixing a preposition to an adjective and then dropping the old case-ending, we get such adverbs as amid (= A.S. on middum), awry (= on wry), anon (= on ane = on one, i.e. 'at one time,' 'without interval'), afar (= on ferrum), &c. We still say in general, in vain, &c. In inward, outward, &c., we have the adjective weard (= Lat. vergens, 'inclining') preceded by an adverb. These words assumed an s at the end at an early period.\n\n269. The common adverbial suffix in Anglo-Saxon was -o, the omission of which reduced many adverbs to the same form as the adjectives from which they were derived.|| Thus, \"He smot\n\n* In some adverbs of this class a is a weakened form of of, as adown (= of dune 'off the hill'); anew (= 'of new' in Chaucer); afresh (= 'of fresh'); now-a-days (= 'now-of-days'). Sometimes the a represents the French \u00e0, as in apace, achart, apiece, agor (\u00e0 gogo).\n\n\u2020 It has been asserted that to in these words is a demonstrative root, akin to that, but no evidence of this is forthcoming. In Cadmon (Gen. 1031) occurs the full phrase \"to drege pissum.\" So \"to \u00fean \u00e6rdedge,\" at daybreak (Exod. 168). Grein (iv. p. 540) and Strattmann (s. v.) both treat the to as a preposition. The point is settled by the fact that in Gothic 'to-merow' was 'du maurgina, where du is a preposition.\n\n\u2021 Halliwell (s. v.) quotes \"Fell downe noseling\" (= 'on to his nose') from Morte d'Arthur, ii. 286. The word growling (still used as an adverb by Spenser), formerly groflynge, was mistaken for a participle, and the verb grovel was made from it (Skeat, Et. Dict.). In Chaucer (Kn. T. 91) we read \"Thei fillen gruf,\" i.e. they fell face downwards. Sideling or sidling also gave birth to a verb 'to sidle up to.'\n\n\u00a7 Once is sometimes treated as a substantive (= one time), as this once, for the nonce (= for then once, i.e. 'for that one time') at once (Knock ii. p. 369).\n\n|| In old French there was an adverbial use of adjectives which found its way into English, as in \"You play me false,\" \"I scarce touched him,\" \"That is quite true,\" \"Exceeding great and precious promises,\" Less winning soft\" (Par. L. ii. 478), \"Thou didst it excellent.\"\nhim harde\" became \"He smote him hard.\" \"His spere sticode faeste\" = \"His spear stuck fast.\" It was thus that we got such adverbs as those in the phrases, 'to run fast'; 'right reverend'; 'to talk like a fool'; 'to speak loud'; 'to sleep sound'; 'to come early,' &c. In Anglo-Saxon there was a numerous class of adjectives ending in -lic, the adverbs from which ended in lice (= like = ly), as biterlic (bitterlike = 'of a bitter sort'), biterlice = 'in a bitter sort of way.' As the adverbial suffix -e fell into disuse, the suffix lice (= ly) came to be treated as an ordinary adverbial suffix, and is appended to Romance as well as to Anglo-Saxon words, as perfectly, divinely. It is even added to comparatives and superlatives, formerly, firstly, &c.\n\nPronominal Adverbs.\n\n270. These are formed from the roots of he, that, and who.\n\n(1.) By the suffix -re marking place;\u2014here, there, where. These are old locative cases.\n\n(2.) By the suffix ther;\u2020\u2014hither, thither, whither.\u2021\n\n(3.) By the suffix -n (A.S. -ne, the accusative masculine suffix): then or than, when.\u00a7 (Compare tum and quum in Latin.)\n\n(4.) By the compound suffix -nce, of which -ce (= es) is the genitive suffix.\u2014hence, thence, whence.||\n\n(5.) By the Anglo-Saxon instrumental inflexion: the (= by) before comparatives, as in \"The sooner the better,\" why = hwi or hw\u00fd, and how (A.S. h\u00fa) is a modified form of why (hw\u00fd). In old English we find the fuller form for why = because.\n\nWhat? has in old writers the sense of why? or in what degree? (See note \u00a7 on \u00a7 154.) Aught was also used as an adverb, as \"Can he aught telle a merry tale?\" (Chaucer, Canon's Y. T. 597).\n\nThus is the A.S. th\u00eds, the instrumental case of this (\u00a7 148).\n\nThese pronominal adverbs followed the course of the corresponding pro-\n\n(Tam. Sh. I. i. 89). Wondrous (= wondrously) is perhaps another form of the old adverb wonders.\n\nIt is often a question whether we are dealing with an adverb which has got reduced to the form of an adjective, or with an adjective used as the complement of the predicate, as in \"Hope springs eternal in the human breast\" (Pope); \"Slow and sure comes up the golden year\" (Tennyson). The adverbial suffix -e is common in Chaucer. He sometimes combines -ly with it, as softly, boldly.\n\nLike was itself an adverb, as in \"Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them that fear Him.\" Here like is repeated in so. In \"He talks like a fool,\" like is an adverb, and is itself qualified adverbially (\u00a7 372, 4) by [to] a fool. (Compare the dative after similiter in Latin.)\n\nWhen adverbs are formed from adjectives in -le preceded by a consonant, e is cut off and y only is added, as able, ably. Ly is not added to adjectives ending in ly. Y is changed to i before ly, as in bodily, merrily, daily. Before -ly it is reduced to i, as full, ful-ly.\n\nThe e of ne is elided, as in truly.\n\n\u2020 This suffix appears in the Latin ci-tra, and in trans and tra. It comes from an Aryan root meaning 'go beyond.' The comparative theri, in fact comes from the same root.\n\n\u2021 These forms are often replaced by here, there, and where even in the best writers.\n\n\u00a7 Then and when are varieties of the forms than and whan, which are usual in Chaucer.\n\n|| The A.S. hennan passed through the forms: honene, henne (Chaucer, Pard. T.), hennes (Piers Pl.), and hens (Lydgate). Similarly, thence and whence, come from thanon and hananon (whenne \u2014 whence in Chaucer, C.T. T. 588). An or on was a suffix denoting 'from.' Thus norban = 'from the north.' Compare the n in the Latin hi-n-c, i-n-de, u-n-de.\nnouns in their use as interrogative, indefinite, relative, and demonstrative words. Those derived from who form compounds with some, any, and ever; as somewhere, anyhow, &c. The (-by) is both relative and demonstrative.\n\n271. Many adverbs are identical in form with prepositions, as by ('he rode by'), on ('come on'), off ('be off'). From, as an adverb, survives in to and fro. The adverbial use is the older. These adverbs combine with the pronominal adverbs, and form the compounds herein, thereby, whereat, &c.\n\nThere is also a numerous class of adverbs (mostly compounds) which in Anglo-Saxon ended in -an (= 'from,' see note \u00a7 on \u00a7 270), as out (utan), up (tisan), before (biforan), without (writtan), &c. Most of these also appear as prepositions.\n\nAdverbs of Affirmation and Negation.\n\n272. The affirmative particle ay* or aye is the same as the A.S. \u00e1 = 'ever' (For aye = for ever). Yea (A.S. g\u00e6a) is of the same origin as the German ja.\u2020 Yes (A.S. gese) is a compound of yea or ye and the old subjunctive verb si or sie 'be it' (M\u00e4tzner i. 446). In A.S. there was a corresponding negative nese = 'be it not.'\n\nThe old English negative was ne, put before the verb, while not is put after it, when the verb is finite. Not or nat (as in Chaucer) is a shortened form of nought or naught (i.e. ne-\u00e1-wiht = n-ever a thing), and consequently is a strengthened negative meaning 'in no degree,' or 'in no respect.' It was at first used to strengthen a previous negative,\u00a7 just as Chaucer and other writers use nothing (\"Nothing ne knew he that it was Arcite,\" C.T. 1521).\n\nNo and nay are only varieties of nd (i.e. ne-d) = never. No is now || used before comparative adverbs and adjectives, as no further, no bigger, and as the absolute negative, as \"Did you speak? No.\" It must not be confounded with no, the shortened form of none.\n\nAy\u00b6 or aye and nay (= ever and never), modify a verb understood. Thus \"Is this true? Ay sir,\" is at full length. \"Is this true? Ay (i.e. ever) this is true.\" Yes is not an adverb, but an adverb and verb in one word.\n\n---\n\n* Ay is in Gothic aiw, from aiws = an age. It has the same root as aiwv, aerum, ai\u00ebt.\n\n\u2020 From a demonstrative root which also appears in yet and the Latin jam.\n\n\u2021 In A.S. the parts are found separate, as \"He ne neahte wiht gefeoltau,\" \"He could not fight\" (Beowulf). In 'Not a bit,' 'Not a jot,' we have the negative doubly strengthened. A bit, a jot, a straw are adverbial phrases of 'measure.' In 'Not a whit' the word whit is contained twice. The curious use of 'devil,' or 'the devil,' for a strong negative, as \"The devil a bird have I seen\" (Fielding), \"The devil they are\" (Sheridan), i.e. 'Surely they are not,' is found also in modern Low German, as \"He hett den diivel Geld\" (\"he has the devil money\"), i.e. 'he has no money at all.'\n\n\u00a7 In old English negatives were strengthened, not neutralized, by repetition: e.g. 'Ne geseeah n\u00e6fre n\u00e2n man God\" (John i. 18) \"No man hath not never seen God.\" The use and position of not arose from the omission of the negative ne. Thus \"Heo nefden noht ane moder (Layamon i. 10) = \"They ne had not,\" &c., became \"They had not,\" &c. In old English ne-ne = neither-nor.\n\n\u00b6 In Chaucer we still get namore for no more.\n\n|| Ay or aye was written i in the older writers. (See Rom. and J. iii. 2.)\nAdverbs are sometimes used after prepositions, so as to serve as compendious expressions for a qualified substantive, as \"I have heard that before now;\" \"He has changed since then.\" Now is equivalent to \"the time now being;\" then to \"the time then being.\"\n\n273. It has been seen that adverbs are for the most part cases or modifications of nouns, adjectives, and pronouns, or combinations of these with prepositions, which through being restricted to some definite use have 'hardened' into a separate group or 'Part of Speech.' While the case retains its ordinary functions in full, or the preposition is distinct from the word governed by it, we get what may be termed an 'adverbial adjunct'; but if the meaning of the case is restricted or lost,* or the preposition or adjective has been welded into one word with the noun that follows it, the result is an adverb.\n\nCOMPARISON OF ADVERBS.\n\n274. Some adverbs admit of degrees of comparison.\n\nThe comparative degree of an adverb is that form of it which indicates that of two actions or qualities which are compared together, one surpasses the other with respect to some condition of manner or degree by which they are both marked, but in different degrees. Thus, \"John reads ill, but Thomas reads worse;\" \"I was but little prepared, but he was less prepared.\"\n\nThe superlative degree of an adverb is that form of it which indicates that out of several actions or qualities which are compared together, one surpasses all the rest with respect to some condition of manner or degree by which they are all marked, but in different degrees; as, \"Of all these boys, William writes best;\" \"John was less cautious than I, but Thomas was the least cautious of the three.\"\n\n275. The suffixes for comparison are now -er and -est. In Anglo-Saxon they were -or and -ost, which were appended to adverbs in -e and -lice, the final e of which was struck off. In modern English adverbs in -er and -est are seldom formed except from those adverbs which are the same in form as the corresponding adjectives, as hard, harder, hardest; long, longer, longest; fast, faster, fastest, &c. Shakspeare uses prouder, truer, easier, &c. Seldomest, oftenest, and oftenest are still common. The usual mode of indicating comparative and superlative is to prefix the adverbs more and most, as wisely, more wisely, most wisely.\n\n276. The following forms should be noticed.\u2020\n\n* For instance in Latin ibi was a dative case of is, just as tibi is of tu; but having been restricted to the designation of locality, it has become an adverb. The words 'on foot' constitute an adverbial phrase, but afoot is an adverb. It was a dun perception of this which led Servius to say \"Omne verbum, quum desinit esse quod est, migrat in adverbiun,\" i.e. 'Every word, when it ceases to be what it is, betakes itself among the adverbs.' It has been sarcastically remarked that \"When a man gets hold of a word that he does not know what to do with, he calls it an Adverb.\" The Stoics also, in a half jocular way, called the Adverb 'the Panekles' (i.e. 'the all-receiver').\u2020 Compare \u00a7 115 and the notes.\nPositive. Comparative. Superlative.\n\nwell better best\nevil (contr. ill) worse worst\nmuch more most\nnigh or near nearer next\nforth further furthest\n\nPositive. Comparative. Superlative.\n\nfar farther farthest\nlate later fast\n[adj. rathe]+ rather\n\nThe comparatives *nether* (from *be-neath*), *upper*, *inner*, *outer*, or *utter*, *hindar* (*be-hind*), are used only as adjectives. Respecting the superlative forms, see \u00a7 116.\n\nPREPOSITION.\n\n277. Prepositions \u2021 are words placed before nouns or pronouns, by means of which we show the relation in which things, and their actions and attributes, stand to other things.\u00a7 In \"I saw a cloud in the sky,\" *in* is a preposition, and marks the relation (of place) in which the *cloud* stands to the *sky*. In \"Tom peeped through the keyhole,\" *through* denotes the relation (of movement from one side to the other) of the act of peeping to the keyhole.|| In \"He is fond of music,\" *of* denotes the relation of the attribute *fond* to *music*. The noun or pronoun which follows a preposition is in the objective case, and is said to be governed by the preposition.\u00b6\n\n* Ere is now a preposition and a conjunction, but not an adverb. In A.S. *er* was an adverb as well (Grein iii. p. 69). It has lost its comparative suffix (see note * on \u00a7 115). The corresponding word *air* in Gothic was of the positive degree. The comparatives *ore* (adj.) and *oror* (adv.) in A.S. imply a positive *er*. Early = *ere-like*. Or is another form of *ere* ('Or this' = *ere* this in Chaucer, *T. and C.* iv. i). So \"or ever he come near\" (*Acts* xxiii. 15).\n\n+ \"The rathe (early) primrose\" (Milton, *Lycidas*). In the phrase \"I had rather,\" *rather* is an adjective, the complement of the predicate (see \u00a7 391). It is quite correct to say \"That is rather a clever book\" (not \"That is a rather clever book\"); the force of the phrase is \"One would sooner say that it is a clever book than that it is not.\" *Rathest* occurs in Chaucer.\n\n\u2021 The word *Preposition* (from *prae* 'before' and *positus* 'placed') merely implies \"placed before.\" The term has nothing to do with position in syntax. It relates to position in the composition of words. Thus Priscian (xi. 2) says:\u2014\"Praepositio dicitur quae tam nominis quam verbo praeponitur.\" It is, of course, only in composition that these words are placed before verbs. (Compare Pele, *Primer of Phil.*, p. 119.)\n\n\u00a7 All relations are reciprocal. Any mode of expressing the relation of A to B implies the relation of B to A. Take \"John fell from his horse.\" It does not matter much whether we say that *from* denotes the relation of 'horse' to 'John's falling,' or of 'John's falling' to 'the horse.' The latter seems the more natural mode of treating these words, and is therefore made the basis of the definition in the text.\n\n|| Some grammarians maintain the crotchet that a preposition invariably denotes the relation of a thing to a thing. If the above sentence is consistent with this definition, the difficulty of a camel's going through the eye of a needle is reduced to very manageable proportions. In some grammars, preposition is said to be \"a word which shows the relation of one noun to another.\" Does \"Jack in the box\" imply that the noun Jack is in the noun box?\n\n\u00b6 This current expression must not be used without a caution. In strictness it is incorrect. The preposition does not cause the use of the particular case that follows it. Its original function was to modify or define the vague signification of the case before which it is placed. This is easily seen in Greek, where several of the prepositions are followed by (or rather are placed before) different cases. In Greek the Genitive, Dative, and Accusative cases repre-\n278. Things and their actions and attributes can only bear relation to other things. Therefore a preposition can only be placed before a word that stands for a thing; that is, a substantive. It connects the noun or pronoun which follows it with a preceding substantive, verb, or adjective.\n\nORIGIN OF PREPOSITIONS.\n\n279. The original function of prepositions was to give definiteness to the somewhat vague ideas of the relations of actions to things, which were expressed by the case-endings of nouns. They exhibit three stages of construction. (1.) They were prefixed to the verb, which they qualified adverbially, forming in fact a compound with it. (2.) They were detached from the verb, but not prefixed to the noun. At this stage it is often difficult to tell whether we are dealing with a preposition or an adverb. (3.) They acquired the force of prepositions, and were placed before the nouns. The first stage is represented by such a sentence as \"Bigstanda\u00f0 me strange geneatas\" (Caedmon) = 'Stout vassals bystand me'; the second stage by \"Again the false pagans the Christen stode he by\" (P. Langtoft) = 'Against the false pagans the Christians he stood by'; the third by \"He stood by the Christians.\" *\n\n280. From this it is obvious that the Preposition has been developed out of the Adverb, and that its original function was to show the relation between an action or attribute and a thing, i.e., modifying a verb or adjective. The forms of many (such as between, about, behind, amid, &c.) show conclusively that they were originally adverbs or adverbial phrases. It is only through the intervention of an attributive word, which was afterwards dropped, that Prepositions came to show the relation of one thing to another. \"The book on the table\" = \"The book lying (or being) on the table,\" and so on.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF PREPOSITIONS.\n\n281. Prepositions may be arranged in the following classes:\n\npresented respectively (in a somewhat vague form) the ideas of motion from, position at, and motion to. Take the preposition \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac as an example. It denoted the idea of 'alongside of.' Put it before the above three cases in turn, and we get the more definite ideas\u20141. 'from alongside of'; 2. 'in a position alongside of'; 3. 'to a position alongside of.' A moment's reflection is enough to show that \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac could not of itself convey such opposite meanings as 'from' and 'to,' and so cause different cases to be used after it. It does no more than define the 'from' and the 'to' which are denoted by the case-endings. Similarly \u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03c2 indicated 'front of.' Accordingly with the same three cases we get the meanings\u20141. 'from the front of'; 2. 'in front of'; 3. 'to the front of.' The Latin apud is the same word as the Greek \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc, and ab is a shortened form of it. The difference of meaning does not really reside in the preposition itself, but has sprung out of the different cases before which it is placed. From the kind of notion that they express, some prepositions (as ex, de, per, &c.) could only define some one case.\n\nIt will easily be seen how, as case-endings dropped out of use, prepositions became more and more important, and more definite in their signification. In English the primary space-relations of 'motion from,' 'rest at,' and 'motion to' have ceased to be marked at all by case-endings; they are expressed by prepositions and verbs. Some prepositions are used with relation to movement only, as into, through, towards; the greater number are used with reference to motion or rest indifferently. Compare \"He sticks to his work,\" \"He ran to the door,\" \"He works at home,\" \"The dog flew at him,\" &c.\n\n* The student of Greek will have no difficulty in tracing these three stages.\n(1.) Simple Prepositions.\n\nat * forth of or off till ||\nby from \u2020 on to\nfor \u2020 in through \u00a7 up\nwith\n\n(2.) Prepositions derived from Adverbs.\n\na. By a comparative suffix.\n\nafter \u00b6 over ** under \u2021\u2021\n\nb. By prefixing a preposition to an adverb.\n\nabaft (A.S. \u00e1-be-\u00e6stan) beyond (A.S. be-geondan)\nabove (A.S. \u00e1-be-\u00fatan) but (A.S. b\u00fatan = be-\u00fatan)\nabout (A.S. \u00e1-be-\u00fatan) throughout\nafore (A.S. on-foran or \u00e6tforan) underneath (A.S. under-neo\u00f0an)\nbefore (A.S. bi-foran) within (A.S. wi\u00f0-innan)\nbehind (A.S. be-hindan) without (A.S. wi\u00f0-\u00fatan)\nbeneath (A.S. be-neo\u00f0an)\n\n(3.) Prepositions formed by prefixing a preposition to a noun or an adjective used substantively.\n\naboard (= on board) around or round\nacross (from Fr. croix) aslant\nadown \u2021\u2021 or down (A.S. of d\u00fane) astride\nagainst \u00a7\u00a7 (A.S. on-gegn, onge\u00e1n) athwart (A.S. on \u00feweorh crooked)\nalong (A.S. andlang ||||) below\namid or amidst (A.S. on middum) beside or besides (= 'by side')\namong or amongst (A.S. on-gemang\u00b6\u00b6) between *** (= 'by two')\nbetwixt\n\n* At and the Latin ad have the same origin.\n\u2020 Forth is found as a preposition in Shakespear. (See Schmidt's Lexicon.)\n\u2021 The form fra or fro is found in Chaucer, Wycliffe, &c. Now an adverb, in 'to and fro.'\n\u00a7 Connected with the Gothic thairko, 'a hole.'\n|| Till, connected with an old noun til (German Ziel), 'a fixed point, goal, or boundary,' is used of place as well as time by Chaucer, &c. Even in Spenser we read \"He hastened them until\" (F. Q. I. ii. 4). It is of Scandinavian origin (Ettm\u00fcller Lex. p. 519). Douglas uses till for to in the infinitive.\n\u00b6 After is probably made up of af (meaning 'off' in Gothic, and connected with the Latin ab and the Greek \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc) and the comparative suffix -ter (= ther, \u00a7 108). 'After,' therefore, means 'further off,' corresponding in form and meaning to the Greek \u1f00\u03c0\u1f78\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03c9\u03bd (Fick, Vergl. W. i. 17; Skeat, Et. Dict. s. v.). Aft is an abbreviation of after. Af and of are varieties of the same root.\n** Over is a comparative from the root ov = A.S. uf (in uf-an, German oben). Up, \u00fand and sub are varieties of the same root (Fick: V. W. iii. 34). Sub in composition often means 'up from underneath,' as in 'Terra submittit flores' (sends up flowers). Compare sufferre, &c.\n\u2021\u2021 Under (Germ. unter, Lat. inter, Sansk. antar), from the demonstrative root an (see \u00a7 219, note) and the comparative suffix tar, ter, or ther.\n||| Literally 'off the hill.' Dun = hill.\n||| In against, amidst, and amongst the s is the genitive suffix (\u00a7 267, r); the t is a phonetic offgrowth from the s. Again is the older form. Chaucer uses amiddes and amonges.\n|||| From the A.S. particle and = 'opposite, or 'in presence of' (Latin ante, Gr. \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af), which we have in an-swer. Andlang = 'over against in length.' In A.S. it was followed by the genitive, like the corresponding German word entlang.\n\u00b6\u00b6 Gemang in A.S. means an assemblage or multitude.\n*** Between comes from the numeral adjective twon (Lat. binus), a derivative from twa or twi (= two). Betwixt was formed from the root twi. To this was added the adverbial genitive suffix s (betwiir), and subsequently the offgrowth t. (Compare note on \u00a7 219.) The parts of the compound betwironum might be separated. 'Be s\u00e1m twoonum' (by the lakes twain) = 'between the lakes.'\nPREPOSITION.\n\nanent (A.S. on-efen or on-emn = 'on a level,' 'over-against') inside\noutside\n\nAloft ('on lyfte' = in the air) and abreast are used now and then as prepositions. Withal (i.e. 'with all' = 'into the bargain') is sometimes used as a preposition, and placed at the end of the sentence.\n\n(4.) Prepositions formed by prefixing an adverbial particle to a preposition.\n\ninto until\u2020 upon without\nonto unto within\n\n(5.) From the adjective weard (= Lat. vergens, and connected with verto), preceded by the adverb to,\u00a7 we get in Anglo-Saxon the adjective toward ('approaching, future').\u2021 Toweward and towewardes were used as adverbs, and then acquired the force of prepositions.\u00a7\n\n282. In Anglo-Saxon passive and other verbs might be used impersonally without a subject of any kind, simply to affirm that an action takes place. Participles are often employed absolutely and impersonally in exactly the same manner, as \"Speaking generally, this will be found true\"; \"Barring accidents, we shall arrive to-morrow.\" Participles thus used have sometimes acquired the force of prepositions, as \"He asked me concerning my health\"; \"He is undecided respecting his movements.\" In some cases these active participles have supplanted passive participles which qualified the noun. Thus, \"considering his conduct\" was \"his conduct considered,\" just as we still say, \"All things considered.\" Notwithstanding, pending, and during are participles qualifying the noun that follows in the nominative absolute. Save (Fr. sauf) and except are of French origin, and are remnants of Latin ablatives absolute. In Chaucer out-taken is found for except. In Shakspeare we still find excepted; \"Always excepted my dear Claudio.\" As both the nominative and the objective case are used in the absolute construction (\u00a7 372, 5), save he and save him are both allowable. During, save, and except are now usually regarded as prepositions. The adjectives near, nearer, and next (\u00a7 115) were used first as adverbs and then as prepositions. Respecting ere see note \u2020 on \u00a7 276. Past was at first an attributive participle, forming an objective absolute with a noun, \"past the house\" = 'the house being passed.' These quasi-prepositions are usually of French origin.\n\nRelations indicated by Prepositions.\n\n283. The principal relations which prepositions indicate are those of place, time, and causality.||\n\n* Since is a short form of sithens or sithence, made with the adverbial genitive suffix from sithen, a form of Scandinavian origin, based upon the adverb and preposition sith. The A.S. sid\u00f0an is a compound of si\u00f0 and the dative \u00fe\u00e6m.\n\n\u2020 From the Gothic particle und 'all the way' or 'all the time' (equivalent to the German bis), which in A.S. dropped the n (compare tooth and goose) and appeared as ob.\n\nUntil = und-til, unto = und-to, i.e. 'all the way to.'\n\n\u2021 Hence 'inclining to,' 'favourable.' The opposite of this is froward (= from-ward), and the negative of it is unteoward.\n\n\u00a7 Phrases like 'on this side the river,' 'on board ship,' distinctly show us adverbial phrases acquiring the force of prepositions.\n\n|| By causality is meant the cause, reason, or purpose of any action or event. When we say 'full of water,' of marks the cause of the fulness.\nPrepositions were first used to express relation in space, then they were applied to relation in time, and lastly were used metaphorically to mark relations of causality or modality.\n\n284. At, with relation to space, marks (1) the point to which a movement is directed (as 'The dog sprang at him'; 'Look at this'), or the point reached in some progressive movement (as 'We have arrived at our destination'); (2) the locality of an action or thing (as in 'We dined at the hotel'; 'The man at the helm'). Thence it comes to denote the circumstances in which a person is, or in which an action takes place (as 'We were present at the battle'; 'at enmity'; 'at leisure'; 'at full speed'; 'to play at cards'), or the occasion or determining circumstances of an action (as 'He came at my call'; 'We rejoice at your success'; 'I am at your mercy,' &c.) At, as marking a definite point in a progression of any kind, defines quantity and value, as 'At a great price'; 'The expense is estimated at three millions'; 'At the best'; 'At least,' &c. At also fixes an action to a point of time, as 'At noon'; 'At this season'; 'At any time.'\n\nIn early English at also marked the starting point of a movement or action, as \"G\u00e9 ninnad Benjamin at m\u00e9\" = 'ye take B. from me' (Gen. xlii. 36). Vestiges of this use are still found in \"To receive at the hands of,\" &c.\n\nBy means (1) 'Alongside of,' or 'close to,' in connection either with rest or with motion, as 'Sit by me'; 'The path runs by the river'; 'We went by your house'; 'He lives by himself,' i.e., 'with himself as his only neighbour'; 'To put a thing by' is to put it somewhere near, or by our side, not in front; hence, out of the way, just as we say, 'to put aside.' A thing happens by the way when it happens beside the way, that is, not as a part of the main proceeding. If a man swears by an altar or a relic, he places his hand on it, or goes close up to it. To come by a thing is to get close up to it, so as to be able to get possession of it. (2) If I arrive by ten o'clock, the time of my arrival is close to, or just before, ten o'clock. By and by properly denotes a time close to the present.\u2020 'Day by day,' implies that one day is next to the other without interval. (3) It is natural to seek the door or instrument of an act in close neighbourhood to the locality of the action. Hence came to denote the agent\u2021 or instrument, as \"Abel was killed by Cain\"; 'They were stifled by the smoke,' \"He is older by two years,\" implies that the excess of age is caused by two years. One thing is put beside another to measure or compare it; hence such phrases as 'to sell by the yard,' 'to drink by the gallon,' 'by (=in accordance with) your advice.'\n\nIn a more general sense by marks any concomitant circumstance, as in 'by turns'; 'by fits and starts'; 'by moonlight'; 'they came by twos and threes.' In old English 'to know nothing by' meant 'to know nothing about or against,' as in \"I know nothing by myself\" (I. Corinth. iv. 4); \"How say you by the French lord?\" (M. of P. I. 2).\n\nBut (A.S. bitan or biton, in early English buten, bute, bouten, boute, but or bot) is a compound of be, bi or by and itan 'outside' (by-out). It means literally 'on the outside of,' and thence 'without' or 'except.' It is quite common as a preposition in A.S. and in early English and Scottish writers.\u00a7\n\n* Compare for example \"He was pierced through the heart\"; \"It blossoms through the year\"; \"Sanctify them through thy truth.\"\n\u2020 Chaucer speaks of \"two yonge knyghtes ligging by and by, i.e. 'side by side.'\n\u2021 Compare the provincialism 'that's all along of you.'\n\u00a7 E.g. as \"Ealle butan anum\" = 'all but one' (Beow. 705); \"Butan nettum huntian ic mag\" = 'I can hunt without nets' (Sclaf. Coll.); \"But spot or salt\" (Douglas). \"Touch not the cat but a glove\" (Motto quoted in Jamieson's Scotch Dic.).\nSee Stratmann (c.v.) and M\u00e4tzner (W\u00f6rt s.v.). It is still used as a preposition (meaning 'except' or 'leaving out'), as in 'All but one'; 'The last but one'; 'Take any form but that.' It is often followed by the simple infinitive, as 'He did nothing but (=except) laugh.' In the older writers the gerund was used after it, as 'But being charged, we will be still by land' (Ant. and Cl. iv. 2, i), i.e. 'leaving out the case of being attacked, we will make no movement by land.' For the way in which the preposition but developed into the conjunction, see \u00a7 293.\n\nIn formation and meaning but (=by out) is closely analogous to without, which also was by turns adverb, preposition and conjunction. (See Conjunction.) In course of time the prepositional functions were chiefly monopolized by without, the conjunctive functions by but.*\n\nAbout (A.S. dbitan, i.e. d-be-ditan = on-by-out) means 'just on the outside of,' and hence very near to either in space or in time, without any idea of encompassing. Thus 'Have you any money about you?'; 'It is about (i.e. very near to) four o'clock.' 'To set about a business' is 'to set [oneself] close to it, so that there may be no delay in beginning it.' 'I was about to observe' means 'I was close to observing.' Being frequently coupled with round ('round about') it acquired the secondary sense of 'on all sides of,' as 'Set bounds about the mount'; and with a figurative extension 'He told me all about it,' 'I will see about that.'\n\nFor in Anglo-Saxon means 'in front of,' 'before,' with reference both to place and to time. (Compare the Latin pro.) From the idea of standing in front of came first that of defending, as when we say 'To fight for one's king.' This easily passes into the idea of on behalf of, or to the advantage of, as 'I pleaded for him in vain'; 'All this was done for you.' For then came to denote representing, or taking the place of (compare \u00e1vel and pro). Thus an advocate appears for his client, or one person is 'taken for another'; or is 'responsible for another.' This idea of substitution or exchange often occurs, as in 'To die for'; 'To exchange, barter, or sell for'; 'Eye for eye.' Exchange passes into the sense of requital, as 'He was punished for the crime,' and by a further extension into that of the ground, cause, or purpose of an action. This idea underlies such phrases as 'grateful for,' 'sorry for,' 'to seek for,' 'to wait for.' 'He did this for love of me' means 'in presence of his love of me as a stimulating motive.' 'In presence of' may pass into the meaning 'in spite of' (just as when we say 'He persevered in the face of all obstacles'), as in 'For all his wealth, he is unhappy.' One thing may be placed before another to stop it, and so for came to mark hindrance or prevention, as 'He did (i.e. put) on that an habergeoun for percinge of his herte,' i.e. 'to prevent the piercing of his heart.' (Chaucer, Sir Thopas.)\n\nIn and on are varieties of the same root. (See Skeat, Et. Dict.) From marking the locality of what is contained in something else, in came to be used with reference to surrounding circumstances, as 'in difficulties,' 'in hope,' 'in liquor,' 'in motion.' The sphere of a movement or activity suggests the idea of the material or the means employed; thus we get 'wrought in silver,' 'written in blood,' 'to pay in coin.' In is often used in the sense of into, as 'He put his hand in his pocket'; 'He dipped his pen in the ink.' On is common in A.S. in the sense of in, as 'on heofenum' = 'in heaven'; 'His lof hy\u00f0 on minum m\u016bde' = 'his praise shall be in my mouth.' We\n\n* It is necessary to warn the unwary that the be with which this word is compounded has nothing whatever to do with the verb 'be.'\nstill say 'on hand,' 'on a journey,' 'on Monday,' 'on fire' (compare 'in flames'). On gradually came to denote superposition, as \"He lay on the bed,\" and thence to denote the ground of an action, as in 'on condition,' 'on account of,' 'he prides himself on his skill.' In is sometimes used in this sense, as 'to rejoice in,' 'to be offended in' (Matt. xi. 6).\n\nOf and off were originally only various modes of writing and pronouncing the same word. Off is now more commonly used as an adverb, of more commonly as a preposition. In early English of answers for both varieties. It indicates movement or separation from something, or shows that something is the starting-point from which an action proceeds, as in 'Get off that chair'; 'A long way off the mark'; 'To do a thing off hand' (i.e. as though the doing came direct from the hand); 'He went out of the room'; 'He comes of a good stock'; 'To buy of a person'; 'Of a child,' i.e. 'from his childhood.' A vessel is off the coast when it is at a short distance from it. 'He stood within a yard of the fire' means \"He stood off (= away from) the fire within the distance of a yard\"; 'To stop short of a point' is 'to stop a short distance from it'; 'That is very good of you' means 'as proceeding from you.' The idea of separation underlies all such phrases as 'to cure of'; 'to cleanse of'; 'to deprive of'; 'free of'; 'destitute of.' 'To beware of' implies 'keeping aloof from.' If a thing 'smells of musk,' or 'tastes of onions,' the smell or taste comes from the musk or onions.\n\nThat which comes from, or is taken from a thing, was a part of it, or belonged to it in some way. Hence spring two meanings. 1. Of is used in the partitive sense, as in 'A piece of cheese'; 'One of the men'; 'To partake of,' &c. 2. Of denotes possession, as in 'The house of my father,' or marks that an attribute pertains to something, as in 'The brightness of the sun.' It thus becomes the general equivalent of the genitive or possessive.\n\nA thing is made from the material of which it is composed. Hence we say, 'A bar of iron'; 'A book of poetry'; 'A pint of beer.' 'He made a fool of me' (i.e. as though I were the raw material of the product). From denoting the material of a thing, of passes on to denote any characteristic of a thing, as in 'A man of high rank'; 'A person of great wealth.'\n\nA man's works or productions come from him. Hence we speak of 'a play of Shakspeare'; 'a symphony of Beethoven,' &c. Of also marks the source from which an action proceeds. Hence it denotes the agent or means, as 'He was led of the Spirit'; 'Tempted of the devil'; 'The observed of all observers,' i.e., 'The person observed by all observers.' Formerly from (fram), like von in German, marked the agent, or source whence the action proceeds, as in \"w\u00e6ron fram him gefullode\" = 'were baptized by (from) him' (Mark i. 5).\n\nA result springs from a cause. Hence of marks the cause or ground of an action or feeling, as in 'To die of a broken heart'; 'To do a thing of one's free will,' 'of right,' or 'of necessity'; 'To be sick of a fever.' 'The love of money' is 'the love excited by money,' and so 'directed towards it.' So 'Fond of'; 'weary of'; 'guilty of'; 'conscious of,' &c., denote emotions caused by, or springing from something.\n\n'I heard of his death' marks that 'his death' was the starting-point of the news that came to me. Hence of comes to mean concerning or respecting in a variety of phrases, as in 'to think of,' 'to accuse of.' If we 'speak of\n\n* In old writers out of = without, as in \"Neither can anything please God if it be done out of charity.\" We still say \"out of breath\" (i.e. without breath), \"out of one's senses.\"\n\n\u2020 In A.S. verbs of this sort had the genitive after them.\nCicero,' Cicero is the starting-point of our speech. 'A copy of a thing' is 'a copy taken from it.' 'He lived there upwards of a year,' means 'during a certain period reckoned from the end of the year.'\n\nOf is identical in root with the Gothic af, Latin ab, and Greek \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc. In A.S. the two prepositions on and off had a wide range of application.\n\nTo (as an adverb usually spelt too) indicates movement or extension towards some point in space or time (as \"He went to the door\"; \"It goes on from day to day\"), or the proximity which is the result of the movement, as in 'close to,' or (of time) 'to-day,' 'to-night.' See \u00a7 267, 4. To then came to mark the direction of an action or feeling towards an object (as in \"To tell to\"; \"inclined to,\" &c.). It also marks approach or conformity to a certain standard (as in \"equal to\"; \"like to\"; \"brave to excess\"; \"is that to your liking?\"). It denotes the end or result of some change, as 'turned to stone.' One thing is put to another for comparison, or as a stake, hence such phrases as \"They to him are angels\"; \"ten to one\"; \"My estate to your ring.\"\n\nTo also marks the end or purpose of an action, as in many uses of the gerundial infinitive, \"He came to see me,\" &c. (\u00a7 196), and in such phrases as \"They came to dinner\"; \"To have to wife,\" &c. It is also used to mark what is in any way affected by an action, quality, or relation, as in \"happen to\"; \"a friend to the poor\"; \"a prey to anxiety\"; \"hateful to me,\" &c. To has largely replaced the old dative.\n\nThe adverb too is the same word, and means 'in addition.' \"Give him a shilling and a loaf too\" means 'give him a loaf in addition to the shilling.' \"That is too bad\" means 'that is bad in an additional degree, or beyond what is bad in a usual degree.'\n\nIn the Northern dialect til or till was used for to (\u00a7 281). So in Chaucer, \"Til a grove than stalketh Palamon\" (Kn. T. 630). This word is now only a conjunction. Intil (= into) has vanished; until is restricted to time.\n\nWith is a shortened form of the Anglo-Saxon adverb wi\u00f0er, formed by the comparative suffix ther (\u00a7 108, note), from an ancient root wi or vi, denoting separation. The ancient meaning of with (wi\u00f0) is from,* which we still preserve in withhola, and withdraw, and in the phrases 'to part with,' 'to dispense with,' 'to differ with,' &c. The notion of separation passed into that of opposition, from which with derived its ordinary Anglo-Saxon meaning of 'against,' e.g., maintained in 'withstand,' 'to be angry with'; \"weigh oath with oath\" (cf. Old Norse), i.e. 'weigh oath against oath,' &c. Opposition implies proximities; proximity suggests association, and so with came by its modern sense of 'Come with us.' In this sense it denotes attendant circumstances (as 'will come with pleasure'). Among the attendant circumstances of an action is the instrument \u2020 with which it is performed. Hence another of the common meanings of with. With has supplanted the old preposition mid (= German mit).\n\nMost of the above words are adverbs as well as prepositions. When they are prepositions there is always a substantive, expressed or understood, which they govern. In \"He laid one book above the other,\" above is a preposition. In \"One was below, the others above,\" below and above are adverbs.\n\nThe Latin preposition per (throughout) has been adopted with the distributive sense, which it had in late Latin, as 'A pound per day'; 'Three per cent,' &c. It was in part confused with pour (from pro).\n\n* \"He ged\u00e6lde lif wi\u00f0 lice,\" 'He separated life from [the] body' (Beowulf, 733).\n\u2020 In Chaucer with marks the agent, as \"sleyn with (= by) cursed Jewes\" (Pr. T. 1875).\nSans and mangre are now obsolete.\n\nThere is no sufficient reason for giving the name 'compound prepositions' to such phrases as 'by means of,' 'in addition to,' &c. A clear account can be given of the syntax of each member of the phrase. But in some instances (as 'despite,' 'spite of,' &c.) the loss of an essential preposition compels us to treat the residuum as a phrase equivalent to a preposition.\n\nCONJUNCTION.\n\n285. Conjunctions are so called because they join words and sentences together (Lat. con = 'together,' jungo = 'I join'); but a word is not necessarily a conjunction because it does this. Who, which, and that are connective words which are pronouns. When, where, as, &c., are connective words which are adverbs.\n\nDefinition.\u2014Conjunctions are connective words, which have neither a pronominal nor an adverbial signification.\n\nPrepositions show the relation of one notion to another. Conjunctions show the relation of one thought to another. Hence conjunctions for the most part* join one sentence to another.\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF CONJUNCTIONS.\n\n286. Conjunctions are of two kinds\u20141. Co-ordinative Conjunctions; 2. Subordinative Conjunctions.\n\n287. Co-ordinative Conjunctions are those which unite either co-ordinate clauses (i.e. clauses of which neither is dependent on the other, or enters into its construction), or words which stand in the same relation to some other word in the sentence. They may be subdivided according to their meaning into\u2014\n\n1. Simple Conjunctions:\u2014and, both.\n2. The Adversative\u2020 or exceptive conjunction:\u2014but.\n3. Alternative Conjunctions:\u2014either\u2014or; neither\u2014nor; whether\u2014or.\n\n* The single exception is the conjunction and, which, besides uniting one sentence to another, may unite words which stand in the same relation to some other word in the sentence, as in \"Two and three make five,\" where two and three stand in the same relation to the verb make; \"Tom sat between John and James,\" where John and James are in the same relation to sat between. A plural suffix may answer much the same purpose. There is no essential difference between \"Tom sat between John and James,\" and \"Tom sat between the two brothers.\" And lends itself the more readily to this use, as it was originally a preposition meaning 'along with' (\u00a7 282). It is however impossible now to treat and as a preposition. We cannot say \"Tom and me took a walk.\" Some grammarians will have it that in all such cases two co-ordinate sentences are contracted into one, but to say \"Two make five and three make five,\" or \"Tom sat between John and Tom sat between James,\" is sheer nonsense, and it is quite inadmissible to substitute some other verb for make, or some other preposition for between. Grammatical analysis has to deal with the expressions before us, not with something else that we are told to substitute in their place.\n\n\u2020 The Disjunctive Conjunction of many grammars (a joining word which disjoins) is a choice specimen of absurdity.\nAnd (of the same origin as the German und, Icelandic enda, Latin ante, and Greek \u1f00\u03bd\u03c4\u03af) is sometimes a preposition in A.S. meaning 'in presence of,' or 'along with.' From the sense of 'in presence of' and passed into that of against (compare with \u00a7 284), and appears in answer (andswarian), along (and-lang) and various other compounds in A.S.\n\nFrom being a preposition, and developed (in the way explained further on) into a conjunction, with two different senses. 1. It assumed the ordinary copulative sense. 2. It was a hypothetical conjunction,\u2020 the main assertion of the complex sentence being made, as it were, in the presence of the hypothesis. As thus used it is often shortened to an, and sometimes followed by if, which virtually repeats it (an if or and if).\n\nBoth is only the adjective both (\u00a7 95) used with relation to two sentences which are joined by and, and so acquiring the force of a conjunction. When placed before two substantives joined by and, it may still be regarded as an adjective, as \"Both John and Henry are here\" = \"John and Henry are both here.\"\n\nIn old English and\u2014and were used for both\u2014and, as \"And I have clarified and eft I schal clarifie\" (Wycl. John xii. 28).\n\nStrictly speaking both\u2014and should couple only two notions or thoughts, but good writers sometimes use them to join more than two, as \"The God that made both sky and earth and heaven\" (Milton).\n\nThe use of but as an adversative conjunction springs out of its use as a subordinative conjunction. This will be discussed further on (\u00a7 290).\n\nEither is the distributive pronoun which stands for another or other (\u00a7 174, 2), used with relation to a whole sentence, and so becoming a conjunction.\u2021 Or is a contraction of other or another, as wher (in Chaucer) is of whether. Neither and nor are compounds of either and or with ne. The correlatives nor\u2014nor are sometimes used for neither\u2014nor, and are just as correct. Nor is only a contraction of neither (i.e. nouther), and the first neither may as well be contracted as the second.\u00a7\n\nThe use of whether as a co-ordinate conjunction is old-fashioned (as \"Whether did this man sin or his parents?\"). As a subordinative conjunction it is common. The or which follows whether is a contracted compound of whether (see above and \u00a7 174).\n\n288. Subordinative Conjunctions are those which unite sentences of which one is in a relation of dependence upon the other, that is to say, enters into its construction with the force of a substantive or an adverb.\n\n289. Subordinative Conjunctions may be subdivided into\u2014\n\n1. The Simple Conjunction of Subordination:\u2014that.\n2. Temporal Conjunctions, or Conjunctions that express relations of Time:\u2014after, before, ere, till, while, since, now.\n3. Causal Conjunctions, or such as relate to purpose or consequence:\u2014because, since, as, for, lest, that, whereas.\n\n* As \"And heora ordfruman,\" 'in the presence of their creator' (Caedm. Gen. 13); \"emb eahta niht and f\u00e9owerum,\" 'about eight nights and (= along with) four' (Menol. 211).\n\u2020 Enda was similarly used in Icelandic.\n\u2021 Not of the word other which is the equivalent of the Gothic anthar (\u00a7 169). The other either, which is the modern form of \u00e6g\u00f0er, is not now used as a conjunction; but in A.S. \u00e6g\u00f0er\u2014ge, or \u00e6g\u00f0er\u2014and were used for both\u2014and.\n\u00a7 In early English we find nouther\u2014ne, or ne\u2014ne for neither\u2014nor.\n4. Hypothetical or Conditional Conjunctions:\u2014if, an, unless, except, but, whether, &c.\n\n5. Concessive Conjunctions:\u2014though, although, albeit.\n\n6. Alternative Conjunctions:\u2014whether\u2014or.\n\n7. The Conjunction of Comparison:\u2014than.\n\n290. That was originally simply the neuter demonstrative pronoun used as the representative of a sentence to show its grammatical relation to some other sentence. Thus \"I know that he said so\" is virtually \"He said so, I know that,\" or \"I know that, namely 'he said so';\" \"That he did it is certain,\" is virtually \"He did it, that is certain,\" or \"That, namely 'he did it,' is certain.\" Subsequently the word lost its demonstrative and representative character, and became a mere sign of grammatical subordination, the whole clause, including the that, being treated as the equivalent of a substantive. Such a clause may be the subject or object of a verb, as in the preceding examples, or be in apposition to a substantive, as \"The notion that such a plan is possible is absurd,\" or come after a preposition, as \"In that he himself hath suffered\" (Heb. ii. 18); \"For that it is not night\" (Shaksp.); \"It is good for naught but that it should be cast out\" (Matt. v. 13).\n\nThe conjunction that is closely connected with the transformation of the prepositions after, before, ere, since, till, until, for, but, without, into conjunctions. These prepositions were first used as such, followed by an accessory clause beginning with the subordinative particle that* (as in the examples given above). When this connective particle (or conjunction) is retained, it is better to regard the preceding word after, before, for, &c., as still a preposition. But when that is omitted, grammarians generally consider that its connective power has been absorbed by the preceding preposition, and that the latter has consequently become a conjunction. Thus \"Before that certain came from James\" (Gal. ii. 12) consists of a preposition followed by a substantive clause. \"Before the cock crow twice\" is a subordinate clause in which before does duty as a conjunction.\n\nNow sometimes acquires the force of a conjunction in a similar way. If we say \"Now that you have finished your work you may go,\" now is an adverb, having the clause that follows in apposition to it. If we say \"Now you have finished your work you may go,\" now has absorbed into itself the connective force of the that, and become a conjunction.\n\nWhereas was formerly a connective adverb, referring to place\u2020 or\n\n---\n\n* In Anglo-Saxon the syntactical relation of the substantive clause to the preposition was marked by the introduction of a second demonstrative, which was inflected. Thus:\u2014\"Ealle \u00fe\u0101 \u00feing sindon on \u00feinne handa bitan \u00fe\u00e6m \u0101num, \u00fe\u00e6t \u00fe\u016b \u00feine hand on him ne \u0101strecce\" = 'all things are in thy hand but (= except) that one, that thou stretch not thine hand upon him' (Job i. 12); \"\u012ac cwime \u0113r \u00fe\u0101n \u00fe\u00e6t he g\u0101\u00f0\" = 'I will come ere that, that he goes.' Then the subordinative (indeclinable) \u00fe\u00e6t was weakened to \u00fee, which attached itself to the preceding demonstrative, so that \u0113r-\u00fe\u0101m-\u00fee (and similar combinations) became a sort of complex conjunction, as \"\u0113r-\u00fe\u0101m-\u00fee cocc cr\u0101we\" = 'before that [the] cock crow' (Matt. xxvi. 34). The \u00fee was sometimes omitted, as \"For \u00fe\u0101n \u0113ora ye hs\u00f3fena rice\" = 'for that theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'\n\n\u2020 In early English that, so, and as were used after who, which, when, where, as marks of syntactical subordination. (See Chaucer passim.) Whereas properly referred to place, as in \"There whereas all the plagues and harms abound\" (Spenser, F. Q. iv. 1, 20), \"I held my tongue whereas the rest kept talking,\" means properly \"I held my tongue [in circumstances] in which the rest kept talking.\"\nattendant circumstances; but its adverbial force has become forgotten, and it now counts as a conjunction. It is curious that the notional part of when-as and whereas came to be dropped, and the merely formal or relational part 'as' assumed the meaning of the whole word; thus \"I met James as (=when-as) I was coming hither;\" \"As (=where-as) you say so, I must believe it.\"\n\nBecause is merely the compound phrase by cause. It was formerly followed by of, as \"Because of the waters of the flood\" (Gen. vii. 7; compare \"by reason of the fire,\" Deut. v. 5). In Shakespeare, &c., because is often followed by that, which in fact introduces a substantive clause in apposition to the noun cause. On the omission of the connective that, because hardened into a conjunction.*\n\n291. If (A.S. gif) is cognate with the Norse ef, German ob, Dutch of, and Gothic ibai and jabai, and is connected with an old noun iba or eba \u2020 = 'condition' or 'stipulation' (Fick iii. p. 20). It thus answers exactly to the phrase \"on condition that.\" The conditional particle and has already been treated of (\u00a7 287).\n\nA question is one way of putting a hypothesis, as \"Is any afflicted? Let him pray.\" In this way whether-or came to be used as equivalent to either if\u2014or [if'] as \"I will go whether you will or not,\" i.e., \"I will go either if you will or if you will not.\"\n\nLest comes from the Anglo-Saxon expression \"\u00fey l\u00e6s \u00fee\" = Lat. quominus = \"[that] by so much less\" or 'that the less,' where the indeclinable '\u00fee' is the mark of syntactical subordination, and so converts the phrase into a subordinative conjunction.\u2020 Although in reality essential to the construction, '\u00fey' (the instrumental case of '\u00fe\u00e6t') came to be omitted, and l\u00e6s \u00fee or l\u00e6s became lest, either by the blending of \u00fee with l\u00e6s, or by the phonetic offgrowth of t \u00a7 (Skeat, s.v.).\n\n292. Unless is a compound of on and the comparative less. In early English we find the fuller expression 'upon lesse than.'|| The phrase is an imitation of the French \u00e0 moins que. \"He will be ruined unless you help him\" means \"He will be ruined if matters stop at less than your helping him,\" i.e. \"stop short of your helping him.\"\n\n293. But.\u2014The idea involved in the word unless was expressed in A.S. by bitan (see but), which was developed from a preposition into a conjunction (like after, without, &c.) in the way already described (\u00a7 290). The omission of the that which made what followed into a substantive clause, governed by a preposition, left such constructions as \"N\u00e6bbe ge lif on eow bitan ge etan mfn fl\u00e6sc\" = 'ye have not\n\n* The old word forwhy (= 'for the reason that') is now obsolete. It was not interrogative, as Cowper (John Gilpin) mistakenly makes it.\n\n\u2020 Many have attempted to connect gif (/f) with the verb give, as though it were an imperative mood of it, the Scotch gin (= g\u00eeeu = given) being the passive participle. But the word must not be separated from the related forms in cognate languages, and none of these have the slightest connection with any verb meaning 'give.'\n\n\u2021 Thus \"[God commanded us that we should not eat] \u00fey l\u00e6s \u00fee we swulton\" = 'that the less (quominus) we should die.'\n\n\u00a7 Korth (ii. p. 424) quoting '\u00fee leste \u00fee' (from the Sax. Chron. 694, F) seems inclined to regard lest as a superlative.\n\n|| Upon lesse than wee move falle toward hevene from the erthe\" = 'unless we can fall,' &c (Maundeville, p. 184).\nlife in you but (=unless) ye eat my flesh,' i.e. 'leaving out' your eating my flesh, ye have no life in you.' So in Chaucer \"But it were any person obstinate\" (Pro. 524), i.e. 'leaving out the case of its being (i.e. 'unless it were') an obstinate person.' We have a similar use of but as a conjunction (=unless or except that) in, \"But he is something stained with grief, thou mightest call him a goodly person\" (Sh. Temp. I. 2); \"Never may I look on day, but she tells to your highness simple truth\" (Com. Err. V. 211); \"It shall go hard but I will prove it\"; \"Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear.\"\n\nWithout and except acquired the same force in the same way, as in \"Not without the Prince be willing\" \"Except ye repent\"\n\nBut as an adversative co-ordinate conjunction was another product of the same construction. Thus \"Myn handwerk to sle sore gryveth me, but that here synne here deth doth brewe\" (Cov. M. p. 43) would appear in modern English as \"It grieves me sore to slay my handiwork, but their sin doth brew their death.\" This use of but has nearly superseded its older meaning 'unless,' and but in this sense has ousted ac,\u2020 which is the common adversative conjunction in A.S.\n\n* The case excepted is, of course, virtually a negative hypothesis. In the older writers but if and but and (where and = if) are common, as \"but and ye helpe us now\" (Chaucer Troil.)\n\nSentences like that quoted in the text were common in A.S., and in an elliptical form gave rise to sentences like the following\u2014\"Nan man n\u00e1t biton fiedler \u00e1na\" = \"no man knoweth but my Father only,\" for \"biton fiedler \u00e1na w\u00e1t,\" \"but that my Father only knows\"; \"Ne his na god baten he,\" = \"there is no God but he is God.\" This shows that but may be followed by a nominative case provided the ellipse can be filled up so as to allow of its occurrence in the complete sentence. \"Nobody knows it but he\" = \"Nobody knows it but he [knows it].\" It is equally correct to say \"Nobody knows it but him,\" only but is then a preposition, and but him forms a limiting adjunct to nobody.\n\nIt should be noticed that in such cases but introduced an exception to a general negative statement. In later English the negative came to be omitted, and so but appears to be an adverb meaning only. Thus we read in Maundeville \"They euen not but ones a day,\" i.e. \"They eat not but (=except) that they eat once a day.\" We now say \"They eat but once a day\" \"Thar nis but a god\" (Leg. S. Cath. 282) = \"There is not but one God,\" is now \"There is but one God.\"\n\nThere are other instances in which negatives are improperly omitted in modern English. Thus, \"Do not spend more than you can help,\" ought to be \"Do not spend more than you cannot help.\" \"He has lost ever so much money,\" should be \"He has lost never so much money,\" i.e. \"He has lost a quantity of money, and never before lost so much.\"\n\n1 But is a difficult word to deal with; it is so often attended by the ellipse of some important word. The omission of the negative has already been noticed (Note 1). One class of sentences has been much misunderstood. In \"There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark but he's an arrant knave,\" everybody admits that but is a conjunction. In modern English, however, it is very common in such sentences to have either the subject or the object of the verb that follows the 'but' omitted, as \"There's not a man I meet but doth salute me\"; \"Not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver\" (Temp. II. 2, 39); \"No jutty ... but this bird hath made his pendant bed\" (Macb.). Many grammarians say that in such sentences 'but' has become a relative pronoun involving a negative, and is equivalent to which not, or who not. This is putting an extremely violent strain upon the force of words. One can understand how the intelligence of the speaker or hearer can attach a connective force to a word that does not strictly express it, that is only a question of grammatical form; but the conversion of a mere conjunction into a word that stands for a person or thing is a very different affair. It seems much simpler to allow that a pronoun is understood. There are abundant examples of this kind of omission in the case both of relative pronouns and of their antecedents. The analogy of the Latin quin is misleading, because quin actually contains the pronominal root, and even in Latin it is never necessary to take quin as the subject of a following verb.\n\nThere are many sentences beginning with but that, where it does not matter whether we treat but as a preposition followed by a substantive clause, or take but that as a compound conjunction like if that, when that, &c. Thus \"The sky would pour down stinking pitch, but that the sea dashes the fire out\" (Temp. I. 2, 4). In other cases we must regard but\n294. **While** is the A.S. *hwil* = 'time,' which was used in the phrase *hwil hwil* = 'the while that.' *Let by itself, while hardened into a conjunction, its notional sense being forgotten. It assumed the adverbial suffix -s and its offspring t (whiles, whilst).\n\n**Though** is the A.S. *\u00feeah* = 'nevertheless.' It is still used as an adverb, as in \"You are still in time, make haste though.\" In A.S. the connective particle *\u00fee* was appended to it, to convert it into a conjunction, as that was in early English. When the *that* was dropped its conjunctive force was merged in the *though.*\n\n**Than** is another form of the word *then* (see Chaucer, *passim*), in A.S. *\u00feanne* or *\u00feanne.* In A.S. this was a relative or conjunctive adverb, equivalent to our *when.* In this sense it was used after comparatives to introduce the standard of comparison.\u2020 \"John is taller than Charles\" meant originally \"When Charles is tall (i.e. when the tallness of Charles is regarded) John is taller.\" \"He came sooner than I expected\" is \"When I expected [him to come soon], he came sooner.\" \"I have no other home than this\" is \"When I have this, I have no other home.\" But the original sense of *than* has become so completely forgotten, that the word must now be regarded as a mere conjunction. Clauses beginning with *than* are usually elliptical.\n\n**Albeit**, i.e. *all-be-it*, is merely a short concessive sentence. In Chaucer we find \"Al be that he was a philosophre\"; also (without *be*) \"All were they sore hurt\" (*Kn. T.* 1851) where *al* = although.\n\n295. Since all demonstratives involve reference, they always cause a certain connection in thought between two ideas; but for all that, they are not, grammatically speaking, connective words. Such words as therefore, hence, still, consequently, accordingly, yet, likewise, also, &c., are only simple adverbs, not even connective adverbs; still less are they mere conjunctions.\u00a7\n\nwith the substantive clause that follows as forming together a limiting adjunct of a word that involves a general or universal idea, which word may be either expressed or understood, as \"I know nothing about it but that he wished for it.\" (Here *but that*, &c., limits nothing.) \"Think not [anything] but [that] we will share in all thy woes.\" (Here *but we*, &c., limits anything understood.) \"Never dream [anything] but that ill must come of it.\" It is by a confusion that we get such sentences as \"Never doubt but that ill must come of it.\" Here the executive *but* is superfluous.\n\n* \"The while the hut in the water is\" (Wright, *Poh. Tr.* p. 135). 'The while that' is equivalent to 'what time' in \"What time I am afraid,\" &c. (*Psalm* 56). While as is also found in the older writers, as \"While as the first tabernacle was yet standing\" (*Heb.* ix 8) like the Latin *dum,* which in some dialects means *till,* and even has the force of a preposition. Thus \"While then\" occurs in Shakspeare (*Macb.*). In Lyly we find \"while bedtime,\" &c. While has no connection with who, whom, &c. The combination *the whiles* is wrong. If *the* is used, *while* will be a substantive, and the adverbial suffix is improper.\n\n\u2020 In Scotch *be* (= *is*) is used for the same purpose. \"He's yunger be onie o' thaim\" = \"he's younger by the side of (i.e. when compared with) any of them.\" The provincial idiom \"He is older nor John,\" may possibly mean \"He is older, and not John.\" Some explain \"He is taller than John,\" as being \"He is taller, then (i.e. in the next lower degree) John is tall.\" The objections to this are that it will not explain the Anglo-Saxon usage, that it is quite inapplicable to such sentences as some of those given in the text, and that it inverts the logical order of the ideas, making the comparative degree itself the standard of comparison. *Quam* in Latin does not strictly correspond in force to *than.* It is the correlative of *tam,* and always marks degree.\n\n\u2021 Take \"He was able; for that reason he did not succeed.\" We have obviously two complete and independent sentences; but substitute for 'for that reason' its exact grammatical equivalent 'therefore,' and half the writers of grammars will tell us that *therefore* is a conjunction, and that we have one (compound) sentence, not two separate ones.\n\n\u00a7 A great mistake is made when *quam* and *ut* in Latin are called conjunctions. They are\nINTERJECTION.\n\n296. Interjections are words which are used to express some emotion of the mind, but do not enter into the construction of sentences; as, Oh! O! Ah! Ha! Alas! Fie! Pshaw! Hurrah!\n\nIn written language interjections are usually followed by what is called a mark of admiration (!).\n\nThe interjection is a nondescript kind of word. It is scarcely notional, and is certainly not relational.\n\nCOMPOSITION AND DERIVATION.\n\n297. Words may be divided into two classes\u2014primary words, and secondary or derivative words.\n\nA word is a primary word when it does not admit of being resolved into simpler elements; as man, horse, run.\n\nA word is a secondary word when it is made up of significant parts, which exist either separately or in other combinations.\n\nSecondary words are formed partly by Composition, partly by Derivation.\n\nCOMPOSITION.\n\n298. A word is a compound word when it is made up of two or more parts, each of which is a significant word by itself; as apple-tree, tea-spoon, spend-thrift.\n\nAll compounds admit of being divided primarily into two words; but one of these may itself be a compound word, so that the entire word may be separated into three or four words; as handicraftsman (made up of man and handicraft, handicraft being itself made up of hand and craft*); midshipman (made up of man and midship, midship being itself made up of mid and ship).\n\n299. In most compound words it is the first word which modifies the meaning of the second.\u2020 (The second denotes the genus, the first distinguishes the species.) Rosebush means a particular kind of bush, namely, one that bears roses. A haycart is a certain kind of cart, namely, one\n\n* The i in handicraft and handiwork is a relic of the syllable ge in the A.S. handgecraeft and handgewerc.\n\n\u2020 This does not apply to compounds in which the first element is a verb or preposition governing the second, as godsend, asleep, because, &c.\nfor carrying hay. The accent is placed upon the modifying word when the amalgamation is complete. When the two elements of the compound are only partially blended, a hyphen is put between them, and the accent falls equally on both parts of the compound, as in knee-deep.* We do not get a true compound so long as the separate elements both retain their natural and full significance, and their ordinary syntactical relation. Composition is accompanied by limitation of significance. Compare blue bell and bluebell, red breast and redbreast, monk's hood and monkshood.\n\nA.\u2014COMPOUND NOUNS.\n\n300. Compound Nouns exhibit the following combinations:\n\n1. A noun preceded by a noun, of which the first (1) denotes what the second consists of, is characterized by, or attached to, as haystack, cornfield, oaktree, wineshop, churchyard; (2) denotes the purpose for which the thing denoted by the second is used,\u2020 as teaspoon, milking-stool (see \u00a7 202), inkstand; or with which its activity is connected, as man-killer, bush-ranger, sun-shade; (3) is a defining genitive, or the equivalent of one, as swordsman, kinsman, Wednesday (Woden's day), sun-beam, noon-tide, day-star.\n\n2. A noun preceded and modified by an adjective, as roundhead, blackbird, quicksilver, Northampton, midday, midriff (A.S. hrif = bowels). Twilight (twi = two), fortnight (i.e., fourteen-night), sennight (i.e., seven night) are from numerals.\n\n3. A noun preceded by a verb of which it is the object, as stopgap, pick-pocket, make-weight, turncock, wagtail, spitfire.\n\n4. A noun denoting an agent preceded by what would be the object of the corresponding verb, as man-slayer, peace-maker.\n\n5. A gerund preceded by a governed noun, as wire-pulling.\n\n6. A verb preceded by a noun, as godsend (very rare).\n\n7. A noun preceded by an adverb, which modifies (adverbially) the noun, when that denotes an action, as forthought, neighbour (A.S. neah-b\u00e6r = 'one who dwells near'), off-shoot, aftertaste, by-path, anvil (A.S. ansilt or onsilt, from jillian 'to strike').\n\n8. A noun preceded and governed by a preposition, as forenoon.\n\n9. A verb preceded or followed by an adverb which modifies it, the compound constituting a noun, as inlet, welfare, onset, go-between, standstill, income.\n\n301. The following compounds, in which one or both of the elements have been changed or become obsolete, are given by Koch (iii. p. 98):\n\n| bandog | bond-dog | (a dog chained up) |\n| barn   | bere-\u00e6rn | (barley house)    |\n| bridal | br\u00f8\u00f0-ealu | (brid-ale)        |\n| brimstone | bryn-st\u00e1n | (burning-stone)   |\n| distaff | dise-st\u00e6f | (flax-staff)      |\n| garlic, hemlock | from leac | (leek)            |\n\n* The use of the hyphen is very much a matter of usage or fancy. Footsore and heart-broken, henpecked and conscience-stricken are formed alike. Similarly teaspoon, apple-tree, and cannon ball are equally compound words. If two words are sounded together as a compound, the mode of writing them matters but little.\n\n\u2020 The modifying word may be a verb used substantively, as in washtub, grindstone, stewpan; or the pronoun self, as self-will, self-murder.\nB.\u2014COMPOUND ADJECTIVES.\n\n302. Compound Adjectives exhibit the following combinations:\n\n1. An adjective preceded by a noun, which qualifies it adverbially (comp. \u00a7 267), as sky-blue, fire-new, pitch-dark, blood-red, ankle-deep, breast-high, head-strong, childlike, hopeful (and other compounds of full, once formed with the noun in the genitive, as willesful = wilful), shame-faced (originally shamefast, A.S. seamfast), stealthfast.\n\n2. The adjective in these compounds is often a participle, as in seafaring, bed-ridden, heart-broken, tempest-tossed, sea-girt, &c.\n\n3. An imperfect participle preceded by its object, as talz-bearing, heart-rending, time-serving, &c.\n\n4. An adjective or participle preceded by a simple adverb, as upright, downright, under-done, out-spoken, inborn, almighty.\n\n5. A noun preceded by an adjective, as barefoot, two-fold, manifold, a three-bottle man, a twopenny cake, a three-foot rule. (Compare the nick-names Hotspur, Longshanks, Roundhead, &c.) In modern English these compounds have taken the participial ending, bare-legged, one eyed, &c.\n\nC.\u2014COMPOUND PRONOUNS.\n\n303. See the section on Pronouns.\n\nD.\u2014COMPOUND VERBS.\n\n304. These present the following combinations:\n\n1. A verb preceded by a separable adverb, as one do, understand, fulfil, undergo, cross-question. Twit is a corruption of at-witan.\n\n2. A verb preceded by its object, as back-bite, brow-beat.\n\n3. A verb of incomplete predication preceded by its complement (see Syntax, Complex Predicate), as white-wash, rough-hew.\n\n4. A verb followed by an adverb, as don (= do or put on), doff (= do or put off), dout or douse = do out, dup = do up. (Comp. Germ. aufthun.)\n\n305. For compound adverbs, prepositions, and conjunctions, see \u00a7\u00a7 267, 269, 271, 281, 291, &c.\nDERIVATION.\n\n306. Most words in all languages have been built up by the combination of simpler elements. Words generally admit of being arranged in groups, the words belonging to each of which have a certain portion which is common to all, and which represents a certain fundamental notion.\n\n307. Thus, love is common to all the words [he] loves, loving, lover, lovable, lovely, loveless, &c. So in Latin, fac is common to facio, feci, factum, factor, efficio, factio, facies, &c. This common fundamental part of a group of words is called a root. Many of these roots are found in all or several of the kindred languages constituting the Aryan family.*\n\n308. All roots are monosyllabic, and the most primitive roots consist of a single vowel, or a vowel and a consonant. Roots are subdivided into predicative roots, representing notions, and demonstrative or relational roots, indicating the relations of notions to each other or to the speaker. Primitive roots are not words, but elements from which words are formed, either by combination or by making some change in the form of the root; which latter process was certainly in many cases, and possibly in all, the result of the blending of some earlier combination of different roots.\n\nIn the course of time a large number of the elements by which words have been formed from roots, or from other words, have lost their independent existence and significance, and been reduced to mere prefixes and suffixes; and frequently have vanished altogether.\n\n309. Derivation, in the wide sense of the term, includes all processes by which words are formed from roots, or from other words. In practice, however, derivation excludes composition, which is the putting together of words both or all of which retain an independent existence, and inflexion, which is the name given to those changes in certain classes of words by which the varieties of their grammatical relations are indicated. (See \u00a7 28.)\n\n310. The addition of a syllable for inflexion or derivation often causes the weakening of the vowel sound of a preceding syllable. Compare nation with national; vain with vanity; child with children; cock with chicken; long with linger; old with elder; broad with breadth. A weakened vowel sound marks a derived word.\n\nDERIVATION BY MEANS OF TEUTONIC PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES.\n\nDERIVED NOUNS.\n\n311. Noun Prefixes of Teutonic Origin.\n\n1. un; as in unrest, undress.\n\n* Account must be taken of the changes classified in Grimm's law.\n2. *mis*; as in *misdeed*, *mishap*, *mistrust*, *misconduct*. This prefix (connected with the verb *miss*, and the old English *mys* = evil) implies error or fault in the action referred to. In many words of Romance origin, as *mischance*, *mis* = old French *mes*, from Lat. *minus*.\n\n**Noun Suffixes of Teutonic Origin.**\n\n312. 1.

An umpire is one who makes the two sides uneven (in or un, par) by joining one of them.\n\nAdjective Suffixes (Teutonic).\n\n318. -ed;\u2014the common participial suffix. Also added to nouns, as in ragged, wretched, left-handed, &c.\n\n-en or -n (used also as a participial suffix);\u2014wooden, golden, linen (from lin = flax), heathen (a dweller on the heath), green, fain, &c.\n\n-er or -r;\u2014bitter, lither, fair.\n\n-ern (a compound of the two last);\u2014northern, southern, &c.\n\n-el or -le (A.S. -ol);\u2014fickle, little, brittle, idle.\n\n-ard or -art (= hard, A.S. heard, gives an intensive force);\u2014added to adjectives and verbs, as dullard, drunkard, laggard, dotard, braggart, blinkard, stinkard. This suffix made its way into the Romance languages, out of which some derivatives have come into English, as bastard, standard (O.F. estendre = extendere), coward (codardo from Lat. cauda; properly a dog that runs away with his tail between his legs). Dastard is probably connected with daze (Skeat, E. D.).\n\n* A.S. hl\u00f6stma, from the root bla (blow) and the two suffixes -st (see \u00a7 314) and -ma.\n\n\u2020 Properly an adverbial phrase\u2014on life.\n\n\u2021 Shortened from of-byrsted. Of is an intensive particle, not the preposition. An hungred is of similar origin; of was weakened to a, and n put in for euphony.\n-ish, -sh, -ch, added to nouns to denote 'belonging to,' 'having the qualities of,' as swinish, slavish, foolish, Romish, Turkish, Welsh, French. Comp. Germ. -sch. Added to adjectives it naturally gives a diminutive force, as blackish, dullish.\n\n-less (A.S. leas = loose, free from, without). Heedless, senseless.\n\n-ly (a corruption of like), added (of course) to nouns. Godly, heavenly, ghastly (from ghost), manly.\n\n-ow (A.S. -u); \u2014 narrow, callow, &c.\n\n-some, added to verbs and adjectives to denote the presence of the quality that they indicate. Winsome, buxom (from bugan = to yield), tiresome, quarrelsome, wholesome, blithesome, fulsome.\n\n-th or d (originally a superlative suffix), in numerals. Third, fourth, &c.\n\n-y = A.S. -ig; added usually to nouns to indicate the presence of that for which the noun stands. Greedy, bloody, needy, thirsty, moody, sorry (sore), &c. Added to verbs, in sticky, sundry (sunder), weary.\n\n-ward, denoting 'becoming' or 'inclining to' from A.S. weor\u00f0an (see \u00a7 268). Northward, froward (from), toward (to), awkward (from the old adjective auk or awk, 'contrary, wrong'), meaning originally 'back-handedly, transversely.'\n\n319. For Derived Pronouns, see \u00a7\u00a7 154\u2014175.\n\nDERIVED VERBS.\n\nVerb-Prefixes (Teutonic).\n\n320. 1. a- meaning formerly out, away, off (A.S. \u00e1ceorfan 'to cut off'), afterwards back or again, now an intensive particle, prefixed to verbs:\u2014arise, abide, awake.\n\nbe (= by) denotes the application of an action to an object, and so (a) makes intransitive verbs transitive, as bemoan, bespeak, bestride, befall, or (b) forms transitive verbs out of adjectives or nouns, as bedim, begrime (grim), benumb, becloud, befriend, bedew, or (c) strengthens the meaning of transitive verbs, as betake, bestow, bedazzle. Believe is a corruption of A.S. gel\u00edfian (Germ. glauben).\n\nfor (= German ver) usually implies that the action indicated by the simple verb is negated, or done in a bad sense, as forbid, forsake, forget (= 'undo the getting'). Forgive meant originally 'to abandon by giving.' (Compare Lat. condonare.)\n\nmis, denoting error or defect, as in misspell, misbelieve, mistike, misgive. Before Romance words, misadvise, misdirect.\n\nun (Gothic and = against, back, German ent), implies the reversal of the action indicated by the simple verb:\u2014unbind, undo, untie. Unbosom, unkennel, &c., are made from nouns. Answer (A.S. andswarian) has the prefix in the older form; also ambassador (Gothic andbahits = servant).\n\ngain (root of against, German gegen); gainsay, gainstrive.\n\nwith (see \u00a7 284 'with'); withdraw, withstand, withhold.\n\nto (= Germ. zer; not the preposition to); to brake ('broke to pieces') is still found in Judges ix. 53.\n\nVerb-Suffixes (Teutonic).\n\n321. -el or -le, added to the roots of verbs and nouns gives a combined frequentative and diminutive force: dazzle (daze), straddle (stride),\nCOMPOSITION AND DERIVATION.\n\nshovel (shove), su addle (swathe), dribble (drop), gamble (game), waddle (wade), snivel (sniff), grapple (grab); from nouns\u2014kneel (knee), nestle (nest), sparkle (spark), throttle (throat), nibble (nib or neb), curdle, scribble (scribe).\n\n-er (giving much the same force as the last), glimmer (gleam), wander (wend), fritter (fret), flitter and flutter (flit).\n\n-k (frequentative); hark (hear), talk (tell).\n\n-en forming causative or factitive verbs from nouns and adjectives; as strengthen, lengthen, frighten, fatten, sweeten, slacken.\n\n-se, forming verbs from adjectives; cleanse, rinse (comp. Germ. rein).\n\nDerivatives formed by Modifications of Sound.\n\n322. Verbs are often formed from nouns by a modification or weakening of the vowel sound, or of the final consonant, or of both. Thus bind (from bond), sing (from song), breed (brood), feed (food), knit (knot), drip (drop), heal (whole), calve (calf), halve (half), breathe (breath), bathe (bath), shelve (shelf), graze (grass), glaze (glass), hitch (hook). The same process is seen in Romance words, as prize from price, advise (advice), &c. The weakening was occasioned by verbal suffixes, which have since disappeared.\n\n323. Transitive (causative) verbs are often formed by a slight modification or weakening of the root vowel from intransitive verbs denoting the act or state which the former produce. Thus fell (from fall), set (from sit), raise (from rise), lay (lie), drench (drink), wend (wind), quel (quail, A.S. cw\u00e9lan \u2018to die\u2019).\n\n324. A k or g sound at the end of words in old English tends to become softened in modern English. Compare dike and ditch, stink and stench, wring and wrench, mark and march (= boundary), lurk, and lurch, bank and bench, stark and starch, seek and beseech, bark and barge, bake and batch, stick and stitch, wake and watch, tweak and twitch. Also sc tends to become sh, as A.S. scecan = shake, A.S. sc\u00e1du = shadow, A.S. sceal = shall, A.S. sce\u00f0p = sheep, A.S. scapan = shape, A.S. scip = ship, &c., scuffle = shuffle, screech = shriek, scabby = shabby, skirt = shirt, &c.\n\n325. Other collateral forms involve the retention or omission of an initial s. Compare smash, mash; splash, plash; smelt, melt; squash, quash; squench, quench; swag, wag.\n\n326. For Derived Adverbs, Prepositions, and Conjunctions see \u00a7\u00a7 267\u2014291.\n\nDERIVED WORDS CONTAINING PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES OF LATIN ORIGIN.\n\n327.

Suffixes Denoting Persons.\n\n(Doers of actions, persons charged with certain functions, or having to do with that for which the primary word stands.)\n\n* In some cases, when placed before Teutonic words, dis is merely a corruption of mis, as in misbelieve, mislike, mistrust.\n\n\u2020 It is difficult to classify these suffixes with any approach to precision, as some have got very much confused, and adjectives and participles often make their appearance as nouns and verbs.\ntor, -sor, -or, -our, -er (= Latin -tor, -sor, -ator);\u2014doctor, successor, emperor (imperator), Saviour (salvator), founder (fundator), enchanter (incantator).

This suffix denotes (1) the condition or occupation of the person indicated by the primary noun, as vassalage, pilotage; (2) a collection, quantity, or summing-up, as poundage, mileage, herbage; (3) a state or process in which something is concerned, as wharfage, bondage, windage; (4) when added to verbs, the result of an act, or the sum total of separate acts indicated by the verb, as breakage, leakage, pillage (pil or peel = strip), coinage, &c.\n\n-ty, -ity (Lat. -tat, -itat-);\u2014vanity, cruelty, city (civitatis).\n\n-tude;\u2014fortitude, magnitude.\n\n-our (Lat. -ox);\u2014labour, ardour, honour.

Naturalized in the form -ative (compare -able) and added to a Teutonic stem in talkative. Hasty, jolly, testy have lost an f; in old French they are hastif, jolif, testif (= heady). See Koch iii. 2, p. 48.\n-estrial, -estrian (Lat. -estris, anus or alis); -terrestrial, equestrian.\n\nWords in -ave, -tic, -atic, -aceous, -id, -ent, -ence, -mony, -esque (-iscus from icus), -tude, -bund, or -bond, -und, -um, &c., will be readily recognized as of Latin origin.\n\n385. Verb-Suffixes.\n\n-fy (Lat. -ficare, forming compounds rather than derivatives); -terrify.\n-ish (Lat. -esco, through the French inchoative conjugation in -ir, -issant); -banish, punish, &c.\n\n386. There are two principal modes in which verbs are formed\nin English from Latin verbs. One mode is to take simply the crude form of the infinitive mood or present tense, without any suffix; as intend, defend, manumit, incline, opine. The second mode is to turn the perfect participle passive (slightly modified) into a verb, as create (from creatus), conduct (from conductus), credit (from creditus), expedite (expeditus), incense (from incensus). When derivatives are formed by both methods, one generally retains one of the meanings of the original verb, the other another. Compare deduce and deduct; conduce and conduct; construe and construct; revert and reverse.\n\n337. Nouns (or adjectives) and verbs of Latin origin are often the same in form, but are distinguished by the accent, the noun or adjective having the accent on the first syllable, the verb on the second.\n\n| Noun       | Verb     | Noun or Adjective | Verb     |\n|------------|----------|-------------------|----------|\n| accent     | acc\u00e9nt   | object            | object   |\n| affix      | affix    | produce           | produce  |\n| collect    | collect  | fr\u00e9quent          | fr\u00e9quent |\n| concert    | conc\u00e9rt  | abs\u00e9nt            | abs\u00e9nt   |\n| convert    | conv\u00e9rt  | compound          | compound |\n| extract    | extr\u00e1ct  | pr\u00e9sent           | pr\u00e9sent  |\n| insult     | ins\u00falt   | r\u00e9bel             | r\u00e9bel    |\n\nGREEK PREFIXES.\n\n338. The following prefixes are found in words of Greek origin:\n\n- a or an (not). Anarchy.\n- amphi (on both sides, or round). Amphibious, amphitheatre.\n- ana (up). Anabasis, anatomy, analogy.\n- anti (against). Antithesis, antipathy.\n- apo (from). Apogee, apology.\n- cata (down). Catalepsy, catastrophe.\n- di (two, or in two). Dissyllable, diphthong.\n- dia (through, among). Diameter, diaphanous.\n- ec or ex (out of). Exodus, ecstatic.\n- en or em (in or on). Emphasis, enema.\n- endo (within). Endosmose.\n- epi (upon). Epilogue, epitaph.\n- eu (well). Euphony, culogy.\n- exo (outside). Exosmosis.\n- hyper (over). Hyperbolical.\n- hypo (under). Hypotenuse, hypothesis.\n- meta (implying change). Metamorphosis.\n- para (beside). Parabola, paraphrase.\n- peri (round). Peristyle, perimeter.\n- pro (before). Program.\n- pros (to). Prosody.\n- syn (with, together), modified into sym or syl. Syndic, syntax, symbol, syllogism, syllable.\n\nGREEK SUFFIXES.\n\n339. The following suffixes mark words of Greek origin:\n\n- -e: catastrophe.\n- -v (=ia): anatomy, monarchy.\nCOMPOSITION AND DERIVATION.\n\n-ad or -id: Iliad, Aeneid, Troad.\n-ic, -tic: logic, cynic, ethics, arithmetic.\n-ac: maniac, Syriac.\n-sis, -sy, -se (= \u03c3\u03b9\u03c2): crisis, emphasis, palsy (paralysis), hypocrisy, phrensy, eclipse.\n-ma: diorama, enema.\n-tre, -ter (-\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd): centre, meter.\n-st: iconoclast, sophist, baptist.\n-te, -t (= \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2): apostate, comet, patriot.\n-am: sophism, spasm, aneurism.\n-isk: asterisk, obelisk.\n-ize (in verbs): baptize, criticize. This termination and its derivatives have been imitated in modern formations, as minimize, theorize, deism, egotism (or egoism), egotist (or egoist), annalist, papist.\n\nHybrid Forms.\n\n340. When a compound or derived word is made up of elements derived from different languages, it is called a hybrid (hybridz = mongrel, from Greek \u1f51\u03b2\u03c1\u03af\u03c2), as falsehood, politely. Some writers speak as if all such formations were faulty, and lay down as a rule that \"in derived words all the parts must belong to one and the same language.\" This is quite a mistake. When a word of foreign origin has been thoroughly naturalized in English, it is capable of receiving all the inflexions, prefixes, and affixes which are employed in English. If this were not the case we could not decline such words when they are nouns or conjugate them when they are verbs. Such words as falsehood, grateful, unjust, rudeness, doubtless, useless, artful, accuser, seducer, politeness, grandfather; conceited, readable, martyrdom, wondrous are all hybrids, the stem and the prefix or suffix being the one of English, the other of classical origin; but any rule which would condemn such formations should be rejected as arbitrary and groundless. The following principle, however, is observed in the formation of derivatives:\u2014If a derived word has been formed by means of an English suffix, and a secondary derivative has to be formed by means of a prefix, the prefix should be English. If the suffix of the first derivative is of classical origin, the prefix should be classical. Thus we say undecided and indecisive, un- and -ed being both English, in- and -ive both Latin. So ungrateful, ingratitude; unjustly, injustice. But one or two suffixes of Latin origin (like -able) are treated as if of English origin, as in unspeakable.\n\nDisguised and Mutilated Forms.\n\nWords compounded of Latin elements have often undergone considerable mutilation, so that they are not easy to recognize. Thus ostrich = avis struthio; constable = comes stabuli; parsley = petroselinum; bittern comes from mugi-taurus, corrupted into bugi-taurus; megrim (Fr. migraine) = hemi-cranium, 'a pain affecting half the head'; bustard = avis tardus; jeopardy = jocus partitus (a sportive venture, consisting in a choice between two alternatives); copperas = cupri rosa; porpoise = porcus piscis; porcupine = porcus spinosus; vinegar = vinum acre (alegar is 'eager' or sour ale); verdict = vere dictum; verjuice = viridum jus; viscount = vice-comes; grandam, granny (through French\ngrandis domina; gramercy = grand mercy; rosemary = ros marinus; maugre = male gratum; van (avant) = ab ante; rear, arrear = ad retro; chanticleer = chante clair; summons = submoneas; kerchief* = couvre chef; curfew = couvre-feu; tennis = tenez, 'catch'; lamprey = lambe petram, 'lickstone,' from its habit of adhering to rocks by suction; agree (originally an adverb a gr\u00e9) = ad gratum; dandelion = dent de lion; alert = Ital. all'erta (erta from erectus); alarm = Ital all'arme 'to arms' (from arma). Verbs in -fy usually represent compounds of -ficare, as edify, mortify, defy. Cry (Fr. crier from Proven\u00e7al cridar) is from quirritare, said by Varro to mean 'to shout to the Quirites for help.' Defy is from fidere.\n\nCHANGES IN LATIN WORDS PASSING THROUGH FRENCH.\n\n341. An attentive examination of \u00a7 328, &c., will show the usual changes that are to be looked for when a Latin word has passed through French into English. The following (amongst others of less difficulty) should be borne in mind:\n\n1. b often vanishes from between vowels. Compare sudden and subitaneus.\n\n2. c or g often vanishes when it occurs before a dental or between vowels. Compare fact and factum, sure and securus, pay and pacare, deny and denegare, display and displicare, rule and r\u00e9gula, seal and sigillum, allow and allocare.\n\n3. d or t vanishes. Compare prey and praeda, ray and radius, chair and cathedra, cue and cauda, roll and rotulus, round and rotundus, treason and tradition, esquire and scutarius, and look at chance, obey, recreat, defy, say, &c.\n\n4. Initial c becomes ch, as in chief, chance, chandler, chant, change.\n\n5. The consonantal force of ll disappears; as in couch from collocare, beauty from bellitas, &c.\n\n6. b or p becomes v or f, as in chief (caput), ravin (rapio), river (riparius), cover (co-operire), van (ab-ante).\n\n7. di before a vowel becomes soft g or ch or j, as in siege (assedium), journey (diurnata), preach (praedicare), Jane (Diana).\n\n8. ti undergoes a similar change, as in voyage (viaticum), age (aetaticum).\n\n9. bi, pi, vi before a vowel becomes ge or dge,\u2020 as in abridge (abbreviare), change (cambiare), plunge (plumbicare), rage (rabies), deluge (diluvium), assuage (ad-suavis), sage (sapio).\n\n10. l, n, and r intrude, as in corporal (caporal), culprit, principle, syllable, messenger, passenger, vagrant.\n\n11. g appears before n and t, as in foreign, sovereign, impregnable (prendre), spright (spiritus).\n\n* The sense of head (chef) so completely disappeared, that the secondary compound handkerchief was formed; in which again the meaning of hand was disregarded, so that the word neckhandkerchief was made, which literally ought to mean 'a head-covering used for the hands tied round the neck.'\n\n\u2020 These sounds are modifications of the French soft g or j, into which the i before the vowel was developed. When this took place the b, p, or v disappeared.\n12. d and t appear after n, as in gender, tyrant, ancient, sound.\n\n13. Initial syllables sometimes disappear, as ticket (\u00e9tiquette), sterling (Easterling), mend (amend), pert (apertus), censer (incenser), gin (engine), sport (disport), fender (defender), &c.\n\n14. l replaces r, as in marble, purple.\n\nA Latin word adopted in old English or brought in through French has sometimes been re-introduced at a later period directly from the Latin. In that case the older word shows a more mutilated form than the later. Compare bishop and episcopal; minster and monastery; priest and presbyter; pistol and epistle; balm, balsam; sure, secure.\n\nSometimes the older form has kept its ground with a different shade of meaning. Compare penance and penitence; blame and blasphemy; chalice and calix; forge and fabric; countenance and continence; feet and fact; defeat and defect; poor and pauper; ray and radius; treason and tradition; frail and fragile; loyal and legal; couch and collocate.\n\nThere has also been a tendency to reject corruptions, and bring words back again to their original form. Compare referme and affirm; auter and altar; scoler and scholar; noterer and notary; dotyr and doctor; parfynt and perfect; sotil and subtile; dortoure and dormitory; catiff and captive; aunterous and adventurous.\n\nProper names are often curiously disguised in common words. Thus dunce is merely the name of the celebrated schoolman Duns Scotus; tawdry is a corruption of St. Audrey (Ethelrada), a fair at which gaudy wares were sold having been held on her feast-day; grog is so called after Admiral Vernon, who first served out to his sailors rum mixed with water, and was nicknamed Old Grog from a cloak of grogram which he was in the habit of wearing; tram-ways are named after their inventor Outram; cordwainers dealt in Cordovan leather; a lumber-room was a room in which Lombard pawnbrokers kept the goods pledged with them; saracenet was made by the Saracens; cambric was made at Cambrey; cherries came from Cerasus; damsons from Damascus; shalloon was made at Chalons; copper was named from Cyprus; muslin came from Mossul on the Tigris.\n\nSYNTAX.\n\n342. The word syntax means arrangement (Greek syn, together, taxis, arrangement). The rules of syntax are statements of the ways in which the words of a sentence are related to each other.\n\n343. A sentence is a collection of words of such kinds, and arranged in such a manner, as to make some complete sense.\n\nBy \"making some complete sense\" is meant, that something is said about something.\n\nIt is plain, therefore, that every ordinary sentence must consist of two essential parts:\u2014\n1. That which denotes what we speak about. This is called the Subject.*\n\n2. That which denotes what is said about that of which we speak. This is called the Predicate.\n\n344. The functions of the different Parts of Speech and of their grammatical forms are based upon this primary relation.\n\n345. It is the essential function of a Substantive (Noun or Pronoun) to denote some thing\u2020 about which we speak. It is the essential function of a verb to denote what is said (or predicated) respecting that of which we are speaking. The fact that a substantive is the subject of a sentence is indicated by its being in the nominative case. The fact that a verb is the predicate of a sentence is indicated by its being in some finite \u2021 form. What we can predicate of a thing is that it does something, or that it is in some state or condition. The functions of Number, Mood, and Tense have already been described (\u00a7\u00a7 47, 189, &c., 203, &c.).\n\n346. The actions or states of things bring them into various relations to other things. It was the function of the oblique cases (\u00a7 65) of substantives to indicate these relations.\u00a7 By attaching a substantive in an oblique case to a verb, the action or state described by the verb is limited, or more closely defined. \"John struck,\" or \"John went,\" may be said of a great number of strikings or goings, but \"John struck the ball,\" \"John went home,\" are statements in which the predicate is limited or more closely defined.\n\n347. A Substantive may, in most cases, stand for any one out of an indefinite number of things, as horse, child. The possible number of things of which a noun may be the name is limited when we specify certain marks or qualities of that which we intend to speak about. It was the function of Adjectives to limit the possible signification of nouns by denoting these marks or qualities (\u00a7 88).\n\nThus \"white horse,\" or \"this little child\" stands for a smaller number of objects than 'horse' or 'child.' Adjectives were inflected to indicate their connection with the nouns which they defined. As adjectives denote actions or states of things, they may be themselves limited by oblique cases of substantives.\n\n348. We thus get the functions of the primary parts of speech\n\n---\n\n* The grammatical subject of a sentence (which is a word) must not be confounded with the thing that is spoken about. In 'birds fly,' the predicate 'fly' is attached to the (grammatical) subject 'birds,' but flying is predicated of the creatures named by the noun.\n\n\u2020 A thing is whatever we can make a separate object of thought.\n\n\u2021 That is, a form that marks Number and Person.\n\n\u00a7 Thus (speaking roughly, and taking the cases of Latin or Anglo-Saxon) the Genitive Case marked whence the action proceeded; the Accusative Case marked the range of the action, including the point to which it was directed; the Dative Case marked the locality of the action, or the thing indirectly affected by it; the Ablative or Instrumental Case marked by what the action was performed, or some attendant circumstance of the action. But the original function of one and all of them was to limit or define the signification of words denoting the actions or states of things.\nSYNTAX.\n\n143\n\n(the substantive, the verb, and the adjective), and their inflexions. The substantive indicates by its form the relation in which it stands to the verb. In the nominative case it is the Subject, in any oblique case it limits the Predicate. The Substantive is limited by the Adjective, and the Adjective in its turn is limited by oblique cases of the Substantive.\n\n349. The further development of language is based upon these relations of its primary* elements. It has been shown (\u00a7 267, &c.) how the Adverb is nothing more than an oblique case of a Noun or Pronoun which has become petrified or hardened into a distinct Part of Speech; and again (\u00a7 279) how the Preposition was at first nothing more than an Adverb, and (\u00a7 290) how what is a Preposition, when it marks the relation between two notions, becomes a Conjunction when it marks the relation between two thoughts. The primary Parts of Speech stand for notions, these secondary Parts of Speech represent relations. The limiting functions of the oblique cases of substantives were shared by adverbs, and by combinations of a preposition and a substantive; and all these limiting or defining adjuncts came to be attached to substantives through the intervention of some adjective (usually a participle) which was afterwards dropped. Thus \"The book [lying] on the table\" came to be denoted by \"The book on the table\"; \"The light [coming] of or off the sun\" became 'The light of the sun' (= 'the sun's light'). The possessive case in English is now used solely in this way.\u2020\n\nRELATION OF WORDS TO ONE ANOTHER.\n\n350. All the relations that subsist between the words and groups of words of which a sentence is built up, may be ranged under these three heads:\u2014\n\n1. The Predicative Relation.\n2. The Attributive Relation.\n3. The Adverbial Relation.\n\n351. The Predicative Relation is that which subsists between the cardinal elements of a sentence\u2014the Subject and the Predicate.\n\n352. The other two Relations are those through which the other elements of a sentence are attached directly or indirectly to the Subject and the Predicate respectively.\n\n353. (1) The Attributive Relation is that borne to a substantive by any word or combination of words which limits or defines it (\u00a7 347).\n\n(2) The Adverbial Relation is that borne to a verb or\n\n* The word 'primary' is here used in quite a modified sense, as having reference to inflected languages like Latin or Anglo-Saxon, which have reached an advanced stage of development from the first rude beginnings of speech.\n\n\u2020 In Anglo-Saxon (as in modern German) it was freely attached, as a limiting or adverbial adjunct, to verbs and adjectives.\nadjective by any word or combination of words which limits it, or narrows the range of its signification.*\n\nTHE PREDICATIVE RELATION.\n\n354. The Predicative Relation is that in which the predicate of a sentence stands to its subject.\u2020\n\n355. In Logic, the subject of a proposition is the entire description of that which is spoken of: the predicate is all that is employed to represent the idea which is connected with the subject. Thus, in \"This boy's father gave him a book,\" the subject is \"this boy's father;\" the predicate is \"gave him a book.\" But in grammar, the single noun father is called the subject, and gave the predicate, the words connected with father and gave being treated as enlargements or adjuncts of the subject and predicate.\n\n356. In Logic propositions are always reduced to the form of which \"Gold is yellow\" may be taken as a type; that is, two terms (as they are called) are united by the verb is, are, &c. Of these terms the first is called the subject, the second the predicate, and the intervening verb, is, are, &c., is called the copula or link. In grammar this is needless, and would be very troublesome.\u00a7 \"Time flies,\" or \"Tempus fugit,\" is a complete sentence as it stands. The business of grammar is to take it and show of what it consists, not to substitute for it something of a different form. Accordingly in grammar the only copula or link which is recognized as attaching the predicative idea to the subject,\n\n* Dr. K. F. Becker's arrangement is substantially the same as the above. He classes under one and the same head every kind of expression (oblique cases of substantives, adverbs, or substantives preceded by prepositions) by which a verb or adjective is limited; but to everything of this sort he applies the term 'Object,' so that an 'Object' in his system may stand not only for that to which an action is directed, but for the time, place, manner, cause, or source of the action. This terminology rests upon a metaphysical application of the terms 'subjective' and 'objective,' which would be unintelligible to most English learners. A verb like laughs, sleeps, &c., which does not necessarily bring the subject into relation to anything else, is called by Becker a subjective verb. A verb like strikes, stands, went, came, &c., which brings the subject into relation to something else (as in 'he strikes the ball'; 'he stands on the chair'; 'he went to York'; 'he came from Paris'), is called by him an Objective Verb, and whatever is used to complete or define the notion expressed by an Objective Verb is termed by him the Object of that verb. It may be urged as an objection to his terminology that this distinction between Subjective and Objective verbs is open to question, and has been adjudged through the temptation offered by the convenient jingle of the contrasted terms. In 'John strikes' the verb 'strikes,' so far as its relation to 'John' is concerned, is quite as subjective as 'laughs,' in 'John laughs.' The action, as an action, is entirely restricted to 'John'; there is no striking involved which is not John's striking. But, be that as it may, Becker's use of the word 'Object' is so different from what English learners are accustomed to in our current grammatical manuals, that its introduction would be productive of endless confusion. This difficulty is avoided by ranging (as M\u00e4tzner does) every kind of adjunct which Becker calls an 'Object,' under the head of Adverbial Limitations. Everything which limits or completes the notion expressed by a verb is adverbial through the very fact that it is attached to the verb, and it will be shown further on that there is no sufficient reason for separating the object of a transitive verb from the rest.\n\n\u2020 A relation of this sort is, of course, reciprocal. In the sentence, \"The boy ran away,\" while ran is in the predicative relation to boy, boy is in its turn in the subjective relation to ran. But as these are only two different modes of viewing the same grammatical combination, a separate classification is unnecessary.\n\n\u00a7 Grammarians who try to foist the logical copula 'is' into grammar are careful not to travel beyond such examples as \"Man is mortal,\" or \"The bird is flying.\" The task of dealing with such a sentence as \"John went to London,\" they leave to their unfortunate learners.\nconsists of the personal inflexion of the verb. The copula is therefore regarded as a part of the predicate. Thus in the sentence \"Time flies,\" time is called the subject, and flies the predicate.\n\n357. The connection between the Subject and the Predicate may assume more forms than one.\n\n358. 1. When it is our intention to declare that the connection between what the subject stands for and what the predicate stands for, either does or does not exist, the sentence is declarative;* as, \"Thomas left the room.\"\n\n2. When it is our wish to know whether the connection referred to subsists, the sentence is interrogative; as, \"Did Thomas leave the room?\"\n\n3. When we express our will or wish that the connection between what the subject stands for and what the predicate denotes should subsist, the sentence that results is called an imperative or optative sentence; as, \"Thomas, leave [thou] the room,\" \"May you speedily recover.\"\n\n4. When we merely think of the connection as subsisting, without declaring or willing it, we get a conceive sentence. Sentences of this kind can only be used in combination with others. (See \u00a7 192.)\n\n359. In all these forms the grammatical connection between the verb and its subject is the same.\n\n360. The predicative relation to the subject may be sustained by a verb, or by a verb of incomplete predication and its complement. (See \u00a7 392.) In the sentence, \"The boy ran away,\" the verb ran is in the predicative relation to the subject boy. In the sentence, \"The ball is round,\" not only the verb is but the adjective round belongs to the predicate, and is in the predicative relation to the subject 'ball.'\u2020\n\nTHE ATTRIBUTIVE RELATION.\n\n361. When to a noun or pronoun we attach an adjective, or what is equivalent to an adjective, that is to say a word, phrase, or clause by which we indicate more precisely that for which the noun or pronoun stands by stating some quality that it possesses, or its quantity, or its relation to something else, this adjective or its equivalent stands in the Attributive Relation to the noun or pronoun, and is said to be an Attributive Adjunct to it.\n\nATTRIBUTIVE ADJUNCTS.\n\n362. Attributive adjuncts may be of the following kinds:\u2014\n\n1. An Adjective or participle, either used simply, or accompanied by adjuncts of its own; as, \"A large apple, many men;\" \"the soldier, covered with wounds, still fought.\"\n\n* The negative, if there is one, is taken as part of the predicate.\n\u2020 The more minute discussion of the different forms of the Subject and Predicate will be found in \u00a7\u00a7 378; 384; 389.\n2. A noun in apposition to the substantive; as, \"John Smith, the baker, said so,\" or a substantive clause in apposition to some substantive, as \"The report that he was killed is untrue,\" where the clause that he was killed is in apposition to report.\n\nWe have some instances of apposition, such as 'A hundred sheep'; 'A thousand men'; in which originally the second noun * was in the genitive case ('A hundred of sheep,' &c.). In other cases the preposition of has replaced apposition, as, 'What manner of man is this.' In Chaucer we should have, 'No maner wight,' 'A barrel ale.'\n\n3. A substantive in the possessive case; as, \"My father's house\"; \"John's book\"; \"The man whose house was burnt down,\" or a substantive preceded by of, used as the equivalent of the genitive case in any of its meanings; as, \"One of us\"; \"The leader of the party\"; \"The love of money.\"\n\nNouns or pronouns in the Possessive Case are so like adjectives that in old English the possessive cases of the personal pronouns were declined as adjectives (just as cuius was in Latin). In German we often find adjectives in -sch instead of nouns in the genitive.\n\n4. A substantive preceded by a preposition; as, \"A horse for riding\"; \"Water to drink\"; \"The trees in the garden\"; \"A time to weep.\" A simple adverb may be used in a similar way, as \"The house here\"; \"An outside passenger\"; \"The then state of affairs.\" These may be called quasi-attributive adjuncts of the noun.\n\nThis construction had its origin in the use of an adjective or participle which was afterwards dropped, as in Greek ol viv \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03c9\u03bd is ol viv \u1f51\u03c0\u03ad\u03c1 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u1f00\u03bd\u03b8\u03c1\u03ce\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5. 'An outside passenger' is 'An outside riding passenger'; 'The then state' is 'The then existing state,' &c.\n\n5. An Adjective Clause; as, \"They that will be rich fall into temptation\"; \"I have found the piece which I had lost.\"\n\nThe Relative (or Adjective) Clause, containing a finite verb, is sometimes replaced by a Relative Phrase, containing a verb in the infinitive mood, \u00a7 as \"Where there is then no good for which to strive.\"\n\n* With the plural 'of' reappears, as 'hundreds of pounds,' 'dozens of times.'\n\u2020 One curious use of of is that in which it replaces the relation of apposition, as in \"The month of June\"; \"The island of Sardinia\"; \"A brute of a fellow\"; \"A milksoop of a boy.\" The genitive is similarly employed sometimes in Latin.\n\u2021 As the mention of a thing presupposes its being (at least notionally), which is all that is necessary) the omission of that which indicates being is very easy. When a noun is used attributively (\u00a7 362, 2) it may be qualified by an adverb just like any other attributive word, as \"This man, once the possessor of a large fortune.\"\n\u00a7 It is not always easy to distinguish an adjunct of this kind when attached to the object of a verb from an adverbial adjunct of the verb itself. In \"Let me have something to eat,\" or \"He that hath ears to hear,\" it does not matter in which way it is taken. In \"I gave him a lesson to learn,\" \"She gave me this letter to post,\" the gerundial infinitive is an adverbial adjunct of the predicate.\n\u00b6 These phrases may perhaps be regarded as elliptical clauses. 'No good for which we are to strive,' or something of the kind. Sometimes the pronoun disappears, as 'I have not a pen to write with,' where there is nothing for the preposition with to govern. Being the residuum of an adverbial adjunct ('with which') 'with' must now be treated as an adverb.\n363. It is difficult to say how we should class those instances in which an adverb or adverbial phrase is attached to a noun by virtue of the idea of action which the noun involves,* as \"Our return home\" (compare 'We returned home'); \"His journey to Paris\" ('He journeyed to Paris'); \"The revolt of the Netherlands from Spain\" ('The Netherlands revolted from Spain'); \"Progress towards completion,\" &c. So far as the adjunct limits a noun, it is attributive; but inasmuch as it limits the notion of some action, it is adverbial.\n\n364. One attributive adjunct may often be replaced by another. Thus, for \"The king's palace\" we may say 'The palace of the king,' or 'The palace belonging to the king,' or 'The palace belonging to the king,' &c. An attributive adjunct sometimes (especially in poetry) expresses a condition, and may be replaced by an adverbial clause. Thus, in \"Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, which had no less proved certain unforeknown\" (Milton), unforeknown is equivalent to \"if it had been unforeknown.\"\n\n365. Attributive adjuncts may be used in two ways. (1) They may be distinguishing or defining, as when we say, 'A black horse,' or 'Four men.' Here black and four distinguish the thing or things referred to from others comprehended under the same common name. (2) They may be descriptive, i.e., adding some additional description to a thing already defined by its name, or by some definitive word, as in \"Louis Napoleon, Emperor of the French;\" \"Next came the King, mounted on a white horse.\"\n\n366. Several attributive adjuncts may be attached to the same substantive. Sometimes they are co-ordinate, as \"A wise, just, and powerful king, who ruled with firmness and moderation\"; \"The old house near the river.\" But sometimes one attribute can be applied only after the substantive has been qualified by another, as in \"I honour all [men who love virtue].\"\n\nTHE ADVERBIAL RELATION.\n\n367. Any word, phrase, or clause which modifies or limits\u2020 a verb, adjective, or attributive phrase is in the Adverbial Relation to it (see \u00a7\u00a7 347, 349), or is an Adverbial Adjunct to it.\n\nIt is obvious that this definition really includes what is commonly called the Object of a verb, which is quite correctly described as adverbial, since it is attached to a verb, and narrows its signification. But this particular kind of adjunct is usually classed separately in our grammars,\u2021 and its relation to the verb is spoken of as\n\n* It is the notional signification of a verb, not its predicative function, which is qualified by an adverb, or defined by an objective case. Hence gerunds have objects and adverbs attached to them, and some nouns admit of at least an approach to the same construction.\n\n\u2020 That is, narrows the extent of its possible application. Thus, 'He saw' or 'He went' may be spoken of a larger number of acts than 'He saw the fire,' 'He went to Rome.'\n\n\u2021 The sharp distinction which the usual classification makes between the object and the other limiting adjuncts of a verb does not exist in reality. Had it been real language would have marked it by giving to the object a distinct case of its own. In fact, however, we find that in inflected languages like Latin the accusative case is used to mark several related ideas (including the Objective Relation) which admit of being classed as species of one com-\nTHE OBJECTIVE RELATION.\n\n368. When a verb, participle, or gerund denotes an action which is directed towards some object, the word denoting that object stands in the objective relation to the verb, participle, or gerund. Thus, in \"The dog bites the boy,\" boy is in the objective relation to bites. In, \"Seeing the tumult, I went out,\" tumult is in the objective relation to seeing. In, \"Hating one's neighbour is forbidden by the Gospel,\" neighbour is in the objective relation to the gerund hating. The object* of a verb is the word, phrase, or clause which stands for the object of the action described by the verb. It must of course be a substantive, or the equivalent of one.\n\n369. The object of a verb may be of two kinds, the Direct Object and the Indirect Object.\n\nA. The Direct Object \u2020 denotes\u2014\n\n(a) The Passive Object, or that which suffers or receives the action denoted by the verb, as \"He struck the ball,\" \"I heard a noise.\"\n\n(b) The Factive Object, or that which is the product of the action, as \"He wrote a letter\"; \"They made a noise.\"\n\n---\n\nmon genus. In \"Amo puerum\" puerum would be called the Object of the verb; in \"Eo Romam,\" Romam would be treated as having an adverbial relation to eo. Yet there is no substantial difference between the two. In each instance the accusative case marks the quarter to which the action is directed. \"Amo puerum\" means \"My love is directed to the boy\"; \"Eo Romam\" means \"My going is directed to Rome.\" (In Spanish the relation of the direct object is marked by the preposition a, as though we said \"I love to you.\") Nay, this is only one form of a more general idea expressed by the accusative, namely, that of the range within which an action takes place, so that the accusative of the object is brought into close relation to other uses referring to space and time which are usually classed as adverbial. In English (the syntax of which is of rather a rough and ready kind, ignoring delicate shades of distinction), we find that what we call the direct object of a verb has often replaced a genitive or dative, or some combination with a preposition, which we should have had no difficulty in classing as an Adverbial Adjunct. Thus the verbs 'miss,' 'forget,' 'heed' were followed by the genitive in Anglo-Saxon, and later by of; 'follow,' 'withstand,' 'forgive' were followed by the dative or 'to.' Many verbs of French origin take a direct object in English which in French were followed by \u00e0 or de, as obey, enjoy, applaud, approach, oppose, renounce, resist, resemble, pardon, please, survive, &c. We get a beautiful and fruitful generalization of the structure of language when we recognize that all the oblique cases of a substantive served one common purpose, namely to mark how something was brought into relation to something else by means of what it did, or what it was.\n\nBeware of confounding the thing which is the object of an action with the word which is the grammatical object of a verb. It is most unfortunate that we cannot avoid using the same term for both.\n\n\u2020 In many grammars the direct object of a transitive verb is called the completing object, or the completion of the predicate. The term has been borrowed from Becker, but spoilt in the borrowing. It has been pointed out (see note on \u00a7 353) that Becker applies the term 'Object' to everything which denotes that to which the action or state of a thing has a relation. If the meaning of a verb or adjective is such that we necessarily think of something as being in relation to the action or state which it denotes, he calls the object a 'completing object,' but his 'completing object' would include such instances as 'begs for bread'; 'pleased with the gift'; 'acquainted with the way'; 'stands on the table'; 'went to London.' This is consistent at any rate. It is unreasonable to maintain that struck or heard wants to be 'completed,' and that 'went' or 'looked' does not. The term completing object had better be avoided altogether. We can get on very well without it, and it gets confounded with the complement of the predicate which will be dealt with presently.\nThe Direct Object is that which is expressed in the accusative case in Latin, Greek, German, or Anglo-Saxon.\n\nb. The Indirect Object of a verb denotes that which is indirectly affected by an action, but is not the immediate object or product of it, as \"Give him the book,\" \"Make me a coat.\"\n\nIn Anglo-Saxon (as in Latin, German, &c.) the Indirect Object was expressed by the Dative Case. In modern English both sorts of objects are expressed by the same case, the Objective. When it represents the Indirect Object, the substantive in the objective case is often preceded by the preposition 'to' or 'for,' as 'Give the book to John,' 'Make a coat for me.'\n\n370. One remarkable result of the amalgamation of the Dative and the Accusative Case into the Objective Case has been, that not only the Direct Object, but in most cases the Indirect Object of an Active Verb may be made the Subject of a Passive Verb. Thus, \"I told him the story\" may become either \"The story was told him (or to him),\" or \"He was told the story.\" \"They refused him admittance\" yields either \"Admittance was refused him,\" or \"He was refused admittance.\" Whichever of the two objects is made the subject of the passive verb, the other object remains attached to the passive verb.\n\nSome verbs take two direct objects after them, as \"The teacher heard me my lesson\"; \"They asked me my name\"; \"The master taught the boy French.\" In such cases also in the passive construction one of the two objects remains attached to the passive verb, as \"I was asked my name,\" or \"My name was asked me\"; \"They were taught obedience,\" or \"Obedience was taught them.\"\n\nThe Direct Object of a verb is not indicated by prepositions.\n\nADVERBIAL ADJUNCTS.\n\n371. The basis and type of the Adverbial Adjunct is a substantive in an oblique case, used to limit or define the signification of a verb or adjective.\n\n---\n\n* See Shakspeare (Taming of the Shrew, i. 2) for a humourous illustration of the difference between the dative and the accusative sense of the English Objective Case.\n\n\u2020 When the indirect object is expressed simply by the objective case, it must precede the direct object, as \"They gave John an apple.\" If it is placed after the direct object, to or for must be introduced, as \"They gave an apple to John.\" But the word it always comes first, as \"Give it me.\"\n\n\u2021 In this way a passive verb in English may have an object. The action which is viewed passively with regard to one of its objects is still viewed as directed actively towards the other. But it is perfectly allowable to treat the object which is left with the passive verb as an adverbial adjunct (\u00a7 367).\n\n\u00a7 A substantive preceded by a preposition always constitutes either an attributive adjunct (\u00a7 362, 4), or an adverbial adjunct (\u00a7 374, 4). When the preposition is used to denote the relation of a thing to a thing (\u00a7 277), we get an attributive adjunct; when it denotes the relation of an attribute or action of a thing to some other thing, we get an adverbial adjunct. This statement is not invalidated by the remarkable freedom of English in the use of the Passive Voice. \"I am speaking of you\" is precisely analogous to the French \"Je parle de vous,\" the German \"Ich spreche von dir,\" and the Latin \"Locutor de te.\" Nobody would for a moment admit that locoqor de makes a compound transitive verb, and that de has ceased to be a preposition and become an adverb united to the verb. Yet we can say in English, \"This was spoken of;\" but so can we also say, \"He was taken care of,\" \"He was promised a new coat.\" (See \u00a7 187.)\nIn Anglo-Saxon the Genitive, Dative, and Accusative were all used for this purpose.* In modern English the Genitive or Possessive Case is no longer used adverbially, except in some adverbs which were once genitive cases of substantives (\u00a7 267, i); but the Objective Case (which represents both the Dative and the Accusative) either by itself, or preceded by a preposition, forms a common adverbial adjunct.\n\n372. Besides the object of a verb, which has already been discussed, we get the following Adverbial Adjuncts.\n\n1. A Noun in the Objective Case, usually with, but sometimes without an attributive adjunct, and representing sometimes an older genitive, sometimes a dative, and sometimes an accusative. This objective case is used to mark\u2014\n\n(a) Extent or direction in space, as \"He lives miles away\"; \"He walked ten miles\"; \"Go that way\"; \"We returned another way.\"\u2020\n\n(b) Duration of time or time when, as \"We stayed there all the summer\"; \"All day long\";\u2021 \"He arrived last night\"; \"Day by day\"; \"Night after night\"; \"I waited days and days for him\"; \"He wore the same dress summer and winter.\"\n\n(c) Manner, Measure or Degree, or Attendant Circumstance, as \"They went over dry foot\"; \"The ship drove full sail\"; \"He came post haste\"; \"Step by step\"; \"He is not a bit like his brother\"; \"I don't care a button for him\"; \"What need we any further witness?\"; \"Bound hand and foot\"; \"A hundred times better\"; \"Three furlongs broad\"; \"Six years old\"; \"Worth ten pounds\"; \"Not worth the cost\"; \"Worthy the owner and the owner it\" (Shaksp.); \"What trade art thou?\" (Shaksp.); \"He is just my age.\"\n\n2. A Substantive in the Objective Case, supplying the place of an older Dative, as \"He looks like me\"; \"You are nearest the door.\" The Indirect Object really belongs to this class.\n\n3. What is often termed the cognate accusative or objective (as in 'to run a race,' 'to die a happy death') should more properly be classed among the adverbial adjuncts.** In Anglo-Saxon the dative\n\n* For example \"Gilpes \u00feu girstest\" (thou yearnest for fame); \"godes gr\u00e6dig\" (greedy after good); \"modes blide\" (blithe of mind); \"eagun gesah\" (saw with eyes); \"lyxian mone\u00f0e\" (in the sixth month); \"ealne weg\" (all the way). The genitive had a very wide range of use as an adverbial adjunct. (See March, A.S. Grammar \u00a7 309, &c.)\n\n\u2020 In A.S. the genitive case was used here \"o\u00f0res wages.\" (See Chron. 1066.)\n\n\u2021 Long here is for along. In A.S. it is \"andlangne d\u00e6g,\" andlang being an adjective, meaning 'extending without interruption' (Lat. continuus).\n\n\u00a7 'Care' is not a transitive verb, and therefore cannot have 'button' as a direct object.\n\n|| In cases like this the genitive was used in Anglo-Saxon, as \"preora furlanga br\u0101d\" (three furlongs broad). This genitive is represented in old English by of, as \"Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high\" (Esther v, 14); \"He was of eyghte and thrytty yer old\" (Rob. of GL). The dative was used in these comparative. Much (as in much better) or little (as in little more) were datives, 'miclum' and 'lythum.' A foot taller means 'taller by a foot.'\n\n\u00b6 Sometimes cut down to the numeral, as \"She is seventeen.\"\n\n** The cognate objective sometimes appears in a metaphorical shape, as in \"To look daggers at a person\"; \"To rain fire and brimstone.\" The vague pronoun it is freely used in this construction, as, \"We shall have to rough it\"; \"Go it, boys,\" &c.\nwas used in some cases, as \"Men libban \u00feam life\" (Men live that life); \"He feahht miclum feohtum\" (He fought great fights). The accusative was also common. See Koch, ii. p. 94.\n\nThere is not the smallest objection to treating the objective case used with a passive verb when the active takes two objects, as an Adverbial Adjunct. See note \u2020 on \u00a7 370.\n\n4. A substantive preceded by a proposition; as, \"He hopes for success\"; \"I heard of his arrival\"; \"He killed the bird with a stone\"; \"He is fond of reading\"; \"All but one were present.\"\n\nThe gerundial infinitive (\u00a7 192) often forms an adverbial adjunct of a verb or adjective; e.g., \"He toils to earn a living\"; \"He strives to succeed\"; \"We eat to live\"; \"He has gone to fetch his hat\"; \"This food is not fit to eat\"; \"This coat is too good to give away\"; \"This house is to let\u2020 =for letting\"; \"He is to blame\"; \"You are to give this to John (compare \"I am for refusing his request\"); \"He is a foolish man to throw away such a chance.\" Here to throw away, &c., is in the adverbial relation to foolish. An adverbial adjunct may also consist of a preposition followed by a substantive clause (see \u00a7 290), or by an infinitive mood, as \"I was about to observe,\" or by a substantive with an indirect predicate, as \"The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland\"; \"The night is too dark for us to see\" (see \u00a7 397). But, followed by an infinitive mood or a clause, often forms an adverbial adjunct; as, \"I cannot but pity him\"; \"I would buy it but that I have no money,\" where 'but that\u2014money' forms an adverbial adjunct to would buy.\n\nIn many adverbial adjuncts of this class the noun preceded by the preposition of or to was formerly in the genitive or dative case, as, for example, after full, clean, mindful, guilty, weary, &c. Prepositional phrases have sometimes replaced direct objects, as in 'to admit of'; 'to accept of'; 'to dispose of'; 'to approve of,' &c.\n\n5. A substantive (accompanied by some attributive adjunct) in the nominative or objective\u2020 absolute; as, \"The sun having risen, we commenced our journey.\" \"He being absent, nothing could be done.\" A substantive clause may be used absolutely, like a simple substantive, as, \"Granted this is true, you are still in the wrong.\"\n\n* Pay special attention to this preposition 'but' (\u00a7 284).\n\n\u2020 In Anglo-Saxon the active voice is always used in phrases of this sort; e.g., \"Mannes sumu \u00fei t\u00f4 syllanne on manna handa;\" \"the Son of Man is to be given (to give) into the hands of men\" (Matt. xvii. 22). Compare \"You are to blame in this.\" The use of the active voice in this and similar phrases shows that the infinitive cannot be regarded as a complement of the predicate, because the active idea is not predicated of the subject. In \"I saw a house to let,\" it is obvious that 'to let' forms an attributive adjunct of 'house.'\n\n\u2021 Some grammarians insist that in these constructions the objective (as the representative of the old dative) is the only proper case, and that the use of the nominative is the result of a mistake. Milton uses both constructions. Thus, \"Him destroyed for whom all this was made, all this will follow soon\" (P. L. ix. 130); \"Us dispossessed\" (P. L. vii. 146). On the other hand, we find \"Adam, wedded to another Eve, shall live with her enjoying, I extinct\" (P. L. ix. 944); \"Which who knows but might as ill have happened, thou being by\" (P. L. ix.). Shakspeare also uses the nominative; \"Thou away, the very birds are mute.\" When the forms adm t of a choice, the nominative is preferred by modern writers. When the abbreviated participle except (\u00a7 283) is used, we always find the objective case, as all except me. The dative was used in Anglo-Saxon.\nParticiples may be used absolutely in this manner without having any noun to be attached to (see \u00a7 382). In such a sentence as \"Speaking generally, this is the case,\" the phrase 'speaking generally' is an adverbial adjunct of the predicate.\n\n6. An adverb * (see \u00a7 259); as, \"He fought bravely.\" \"I set out yesterday.\" \"He is very industrious.\"\n\n7. An adverbial clause; as, \"I will come when I am ready\"; \"I would tell you if I could.\" (See further 'Complex Sentences,' \u00a7 401.)\n\n373. One kind of Adverbial Adjunct may often be replaced by another.\n\nThus for \"He suffered patiently,\" we may say \"He suffered with patience,\" and vice versa; for \"He failed through carelessness,\" we may say \"He failed because he was careless;\" for \"This being granted, the proof is easy,\" we may say \"If this be granted, the proof is easy.\"\n\n374. Adverbs themselves admit of limitation or qualification as regards degree; as, \"He writes very badly\"; \"He will be here almost immediately.\" Even a preposition may be modified by an adverb, as \"He went all round the town\"; \"He has cut half through the beam.\"\n\n375. When a noun stands in either the predicative or the attributive relation to another substantive, it may have words standing to it in the adverbial relation; as, \"Napoleon, lately Emperor of the French.\"\n\n376. Adverbial adjuncts of all kinds admit of the same classification as simple adverbs. (See \u00a7 265 and \u00a7 415, &c.)\n\n377. Two or more adverbial adjuncts may be attached to the same verb or adjective. Sometimes they are co-ordinate, as in \"He ran to the spot immediately, as fast as he could\"; \"He spoke calmly and without hesitation.\" Sometimes one adjunct can be applied only after the verb or adjective has been modified by the other, as in \"I will not [stand in your way]\"; \"We do not [play at cards every day]\"; \"[Scarce were they gone] when he ordered them to be recalled.\"\n\nIn some grammars a Predicate to which adverbial adjuncts are attached is said to be extended.\u2020\n\nSUBJECT AND PREDICATE.\n\n378. As both the subject and the verb of a sentence are spoken of the same thing, they must agree with each other in those points which they have in common, that is, in number and person.\n\n* The learner may be surprised to see that in this arrangement of Adverbial Adjuncts the Adverb itself has not been put first. The purpose of this is to draw attention to the fact that the Adverbial Objective Case (with or without a preposition before it) is not a makeshift imitation of an independent part of speech, but is a relic of the primary function of the oblique cases of substantives, namely, to limit or define the signification of verbs and adjectives. It is to this that the Adverb itself owes its origin, for Adverbs are (certainly in most cases, and possibly in all) nothing more than inflected forms of nouns and pronouns sometimes with, sometimes without prepositions before them. (See this set forth at length in \u00a7\u00a7 266\u2013273.)\n\n\u2020 It must be carefully borne in mind that what is predicated by the verb is in fact limited by these adjuncts.\n379. The subject of a finite verb is put in the nominative case.*\n\n380. A noun in the singular number which denotes a multitude (as crowd, senate, army, flock) may have its verb in the plural number, when the idea to be kept in view is not the multitude viewed as one whole, but the individuals of which the multitude is composed. As, \"The multitude were of one mind.\" But we should say, \"The army was led into the defile,\" because we then speak of the army as a whole. In A.S. a participle in the plural might be used to qualify a noun of multitude.\n\n381. The verb is put in the plural number when it has for its subject two or more nouns in the singular coupled by the conjunction and;\u2020 as, \"John and Thomas were walking together.\" But when the compound subject is considered as forming one whole, the verb is kept in the singular; as, \"The mind and spirit remains invincible;\" \"Hill and valley rings\" (Par. L. ii. 495); \"Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings\" (Shakespeare, M. of V.).\n\n382. Every finite verb must have a subject in the nominative case expressed or understood.\u2021\n\nSuch a sentence as, \"That is the man whom I heard was ill,\" is faulty, because the verb was is left without a subject; the relative pronoun, which ought to be the subject, being wrongly put in the objective case.\u00a7 It should be, \"That is the man who, I heard, was ill.\" \"I will give this to whomsoever wants it\" is faulty in a similar way. Wants must have whosoever for its subject.\n\nThe subject of a verb is sometimes understood, as \"I have a mind presages me such thrift,\" for 'which presages,' &c.; \"So far as [it] in him lies\"; \"Do [he] what he will, he cannot make matters\n\n* Let the learner beware of the slovenly habit of saying that a verb agrees with its nominative case. The subject of a verb is not a form, but a substantive in a certain form.\n\n\u2020 The preposition 'with' sometimes answers the same purpose, as \"Gedaliah, who with his brethren and son were twelve\" (1 Chron. xxv 9).\n\n\u2021 In A.S. we find passive and other impersonal verbs used absolutely without any subject expressed or understood. Thus \"p\u00e1m ylc\u00e1n d\u00f3n\u00e9 \u00fee g\u00e9 d\u00e9ma\u00e9 \u00e9ow by\u00f0 ged\u00e9med\" ('with the same judgment that ye judge, to you [it] shall be judged'); \"hine hyngrede\" ('him hungered'). Compare the Latin tonat, pluit, pugnatum est, &c. The word that we now use is the mere ghost of a subject.\n\nThe use of the impersonal verb was formerly much more common. Thus in old writers we find 'it glads me'; 'it pities me'; 'him shall never thirst' (John iv. 14); 'me lists'; 'me longeth'; 'if thou liketh' (Chaucer); 'me remembreth of the day of doom' (Chaucer); \"me forthinketh\" ('repents me'); 'it recke me not' (Milton); 'hem (= them) nebeth' (Piers Pl); 'me wondreth'; 'me dremed' (Chaucer). Conversely several impersonal expressions with a dative of the person have been turned into personal ones with a nominative of the person, as 'I please' (for 'it pleases me'); 'he was loth' (for 'loth him was'); 'he were better his dethe to take' (for 'it were better for him to take his death', Townl. M. p. 187); 'to do what I am best' (ib. p. 79); 'you were best to go to bed' (Shaksp.), &c. See Mitzen iii. p. 3.\n\n\u00a7 The construction of a relative or interrogative pronoun may always be tested by that of a demonstrative pronoun used in its stead. The construction of \"Whom I heard was ill,\" would be the same as that of \"I heard him was ill.\"\nworse.\" The subject of a verb in the imperative mood is usually omitted.*\n\n383. Every noun, pronoun, or substantive phrase used as a subject ought to have a verb attached to it as predicate.\n\nBut for the sake of giving greater prominence to the subject, it is sometimes mentioned first, and then repeated by means of a demonstrative pronoun, as \"The Lord, He is the God.\"\n\nAlso in subordinate clauses with *if* and *when*, where a relative pronoun is the subject, there is the difficulty that the relative must come first, and yet the subject must not be separated from the verb by *if* or *when.*\u2020 The older writers in such cases repeated the subject relative in the form of a demonstrative, as \"A right noble lord, who, had he not sacrificed his life, &c.\" (Milton); \"Lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break, thou mayst with better face exact the penalty\" (Merch. Ven.).\n\n**SUBJECT.**\n\n384. The subject of a sentence may be\u2014\n\n1. Simple. 2. Compound. 3. Complex.\n\n385. The subject of a sentence is simple when it is\u2014\n\n1. A single Substantive (Noun or Pronoun), as \"Men are mortal,\" \"I love truth.\"\n\n2. An Infinitive Mood or Gerund, as \"To err is human;\" \"Loving one's enemies is a Christian duty.\"\n\n3. Any word which is itself made the subject of discourse, every word being a name for itself, as \"Thou is a personal pronoun.\"\n\n386. The subject of a sentence is compound when it consists of two or more substantives coupled together by the conjunction *and*; as, \"Caesar and Pompey were rivals.\" \"You and I will travel together.\"\u2021\n\n* If the relation of the Subject and the Predicate is not obvious from the form of the words (as it is in 'I am,' 'thou seest,' 'he lives,'), the learner should determine the subject of any given finite verb by the exercise of his intelligence, discarding all mechanical rules and tests. In most cases the subject of a declarative sentence precedes the verb, but sometimes it does not, especially in poetry, as \"There stood a marble wall, wrought cunningly.\" Some time ago there was an affected fashion of employing this inversion, which was ridiculed in the following parody:\n\n\"So, when 'dogs' meat' re-echoes through the streets,\nRush sympathetic curs from their retreats;\nBeam with bright blaze their supplicating eyes,\nSink their hind-legs, ascend their joyful cries;\nEach, wild with hope, and maddening to prevail,\nPoints the pleased ear, and wags the expectant tail.\"\n\n\u2020 This difficulty does not present itself in Latin. In *qui st dedisset*, 'qui' is the subject of *dedisset*.\n\n\u2021 Many grammarians insist that in cases of this kind we are to regard the sentence as a contraction of two co-ordinate sentences joined by *and*. This explanation might do very well for such a sentence as, \"John and William are eleven years old\"; that is, \"John is eleven years old, and William is eleven years old\"; but it is simply absurd when applied to such sentences as \"Two and three make five,\" \"He and I are of the same age\"; \"Blue and yellow make green.\" The conjunction is sometimes omitted, as \"Where Nature, Freedom, Art, smile hand in hand\" (Campbell).\nThe conjunctions *either\u2014or*, *neither\u2014nor*, do not couple substantives together so as to form a compound subject. They imply that *one* of two alternatives is to be taken. Hence if each subject is singular the verb must be singular. Thus, \"Either he or his brother was in fault;\" \"Neither John nor Thomas has arrived.\"\n\n387. The subject of a sentence is complex when it consists of an infinitive phrase, of a substantive clause,* or of a quotation; as, \"Better be with the dead\"; \"Me chaunced of a knight encountered be\" (Spenser); \"How to do it is the question\"; \"That he said so is certain\"; \"'England expects every man to do his duty,' was Nelson's watchword.\"\n\nA complex subject is very often anticipated by the pleonastic use of the neuter pronoun *it*, which serves as a temporary substitute for the real subject, the grammatical relation of which to the verb it indicates more concisely. Thus: \"It is wicked to tell lies;\" \"It is certain that he said so.\"\u2020\n\nEnlarged or Expanded Subject.\n\n388. The subject of a sentence may have attached to it any attributive adjunct (\u00a7 362) or any combination of attributive adjuncts (see \u00a7 399), as,\n\n\"The man told a lie\" (Demonst. Adj.).\n\n\"Good men love virtue\" (Adj. of Quality).\n\n\"Edward the Black Prince did not succeed his father\" (Noun in Apposition).\n\n\"John's new coat, which he was wearing for the first time, was torn\" (1. Noun in Poss. Case, 2. Adj. of Quality, 3. Adj. Clause).\n\nIf the subject is a verb in the infinitive mood, or a gerund, it may be accompanied by objective or adverbial adjuncts, as,\n\n\"To rise early is healthful.\"\n\n\"To love one's enemies is a Christian duty.\"\n\n\"Playing with fire is dangerous.\"\n\n* In the older writers we often have a substantive with an indirect predicate in the infinitive mood (\u00a7 397) used instead of a substantive clause as the subject of a verb. Thus: \"No wonder is a lewed man to ruste,\" Chaucer, *Prol.* 504); \"It is shame you to bele him,\" *Townl. M.*, p. 198). In Chaucer, Shakespeare, &c., we often find the infinitive with *for to* instead of *to* (as 'unto a poure ordre for to give is signe,' &c., *Ch. Prol.* 225). This form of the infinitive was used as an indirect predicate, as, \"It spedith o man for to deie for the peple\" (Wycliffe, *John* xviii. 14). This construction is preserved (with a slight alteration in the arrangement of the words) in such expressions as: It is a rare thing *for a man to be perfectly content,* that is, 'That a man should be perfectly content is a rare thing.'\n\n\u2020 In such sentences as \"There was a man of the Pharisees, &c.,\" there is not the least necessity for regarding *there* as a temporary substitute for the subject. It is a mere adverb, having its proper (though very weakened) force. It answers to the French *y* in 'il y a' where the subject is *il*. It represents in an indefinite, shadowy way the circumstances in which the predication is made. In the French phrase *il y a*, 'il' = the whole aggregate of circumstances before us, 'y' = in the particular case referred to, 'a' = has or involves so and so. In the Northern dialect *that* or *it* was used, 'It is na man' = 'there is no man'; 'that is na clerke' = 'there is no clerk.'\nPREDICATE.\n\n389. The Predicate of a sentence may be\n\n1. Simple. 2. Complex.\n\nSIMPLE PREDICATE.\n\n390. The predicate of a sentence is simple when the notion to be conveyed is expressed by a single finite verb; as, \"Virtue flourishes.\" \"Time flies.\" \"I love.\"\n\nCOMPLEX PREDICATE.\n\n391. Many verbs do not make complete sense by themselves, but require some other word to be used with them to make the sense complete. Of this kind are the intransitive verbs be, become, grow, seem, can, do, shall, will, &c., and such transitive verbs as make, call, deem, think.\n\nTo say, \"The horse is,\" \"The light becomes,\" \"I can,\" or \"I made the man,\" makes no sense. It is requisite to use some other word or phrase (a substantive, an adjective, or a verb in the infinitive) with the verb; as, \"The horse is black.\" \"The light becomes dim.\" \"I can write.\" \"It made the man mad.\" \"He was made king.\" \"He was elected President.\" \"He was named Henry.\" Verbs of this kind are called Verbs of incomplete Predication, and the words used with them to make the predication complete may be called the complement of the predicate.*\n\nVerbs which are capable of forming simple predicates are often followed by complements, being verbs of incomplete predication so far as the matter in hand is concerned. Thus live is not always and necessarily a verb of incomplete predication, but in the sentence \"He lived happy ever afterwards,\" the predicate is lived happy, and happy forms a (subjective) complement to lived, which, therefore, is, so far, a verb of incomplete predication. So in \"They went along singing,\" singing is the complement of went.\u2020 In \"He made a mistake,\" made is a verb of complete predication; in \"He made his father angry,\" made is a verb of incomplete predication, and requires the (objective) complement angry to make the sense complete.\n\n392. The predicate of a sentence is complex when it consists of a verb of incomplete predication accompanied by its complement.\n\n* Since this use of the term completion or complement of the Predicate was first adopted in this work it has been sanctioned by the authority of M\u00e4tzner and Koch (ii. \u00a7 245), who both employ it in a similar sense.\n\n\u2020 A sentence like \"He went out hunting\" is not exactly like these. Here hunting means 'a hunting' or 'on hunting'; it is an adverbial adjunct of went, denoting the purpose of his going.\n1. Subjective Complement.\n\n393. When a verb of incomplete predication is intransitive or passive, the complement of the predicate stands in the predicative relation to the subject; as, \"He is prudent.\" He became rich.\" \"He is called John.\" \"The wine tastes sour.\"* He feels sick.\" This kind of complement may be termed the Subjective Complement.\u2020\n\nThe Complement may consist of any Attributive Adjunct (\u00a7 362), as \"The earth is the Lord's\"; \"The coat was of many colours\"; but an adverb, or adverbial phrase, never forms the complement of a predicate. A substantive clause may be used as a complement, just like a simple substantive, as \"My advice is that you do not meddle with the matter.\"\n\n394. A verb is an attributive word, and an infinitive mood or infinitive phrase is often used instead of an adjective as a subjective complement, as, \"He seems to have forgotten me.\" The infinitive thus used may itself be followed by a complement. Thus, in \"He appears to be honest,\" to be is the complement of appears, and honest the complement of to be.\n\nThe complement of the predicate in these cases is spoken of the subject, and must therefore agree with the subject in all that they can have in common. Hence the rule that the verbs be, become, feel, be called, &c., take the same case after them as before them. The objective complement with an active verb becomes the subjective complement of the passive, as \"He cut the matter short.\" \"The matter was cut short.\" Similarly a verb forming an indirect predicate of a substantive (\u00a7 397) after an active verb, becomes the complement of the predicate in the passive construction, as \"He was heard to say\"; \"The bear was made to dance.\" The same is the case with a factitive object (\u00a7 369 A), as in \"He was made king\"; \"He was elected consul.\"\n\nIn such sentences as \"It is I,\" we must regard it as the subject, and I as the complement of the predicate; \"it (i.e., 'the person you have in mind,' &c.) is I.\" In Anglo-Saxon this was reversed. We find \"gif hu hyt eart,\" if thou art it (Matt. xiv. 28); \"Ic hyt com,\" I it am (Matt. xiv. 27). (So in modern German \"ich bin es.\") Afterwards we find the it omitted, as, \"gif thou art\" (Matt. xiv. 28); \"I my silf am\" (Luke xxiv. 39). In Chaucer we find \"It am I,\" where \"I\" is the complement of the predicate, but attracts the verb into its own person.\n\n2. Objective Complement.\n\n395. When the verb is transitive, and in the active voice, the complement of the predicate stands in the attributive relation\n\n---\n\n* Some persons have the mistaken idea that they are using better English when they say \"The rose smells sweetly,\" \"His voice sounded harshly,\" &c. In many cases it does not matter which form of expression is used. It comes to much the same thing whether we say \"He arrived safe\" or \"He arrived safely,\" but no one in his senses would say \"he seems honestly\" for \"he seems honest,\" or \"He feels coldly\" for \"he feels cold.\"\n\n\u2020 Of course infinitive moods, participles, and gerunds may have complements attached to them just as well as the finite forms of the verb, as \"He strove to become rich,\" \"feeling sick,\" &c.\nto the object of the verb; as, \"He dyed the cloth red.\" \"She called the man a liar.\" This kind of complement may be termed the Objective Complement.*\n\nThe following are examples of the Objective Complement:\u2014'Hold the reins tight'; 'he took the man prisoner'; 'he left his nephew heir to his estate'; 'attention held them mute'; 'let me alone'; 'set the prisoner free'; 'he painted the house white'; 'they appointed Nelson admiral.' When the complement is a noun, we in fact get two objects, of which the second is a factitive object (\u00a7 369 A). It is, however, properly regarded as a Complement of the Predicate. Its meaning is so bound up with that of the verb, that it cannot be separated from it to become the subject in the passive construction.\u2020 We can say 'The man was taken prisoner,' but we cannot make prisoner the subject of was taken.\n\n3. Infinitive Complement.\n\n398. The third kind of complement is that which follows such verbs as can, will, must, &c., as \"I can write,\" \"He must go.\" This may be termed the infinitive complement, or complementary infinitive. The object of the sentence is often attached to the dependent infinitive.\n\nIn some grammars an infinitive thus used is called a Prolative Infinitive, that is, an Infinitive which carries forward or extends the meaning of the preceding verb. There is no objection to the term. It comes in fact to precisely the same thing. To say that a verb is an extensible verb, and that its meaning is extended or carried forward by the infinitive that follows, is equivalent to saying that it is a verb of incomplete predication, and that its meaning is completed or filled up by the infinitive.\n\n* This sort of Complement requires to be carefully distinguished from the Indirect Predicate (\u00a7 397). At first sight they seem much the same, but a little reflection will show that when we have an indirect predicate attached to a substantive the meaning of the preceding verb is not in any way modified or filled up by what follows it, and what is denoted by the indirect predicate is not in any way the result of the action denoted by the verb. In 'He felt the ground shake,' 'He saw the man hanged,' the verbs 'felt' and 'saw' convey of themselves their full and usual meaning, and describe completely the action that we intend to predicate; and 'shake' and 'hanged' do not denote anything which is the result of the 'feeling' or 'seeing.' But if we say 'He made the man angry,' 'he struck the man dead,' 'he painted the house white,' the verbs 'made,' 'struck,' 'painted' do not of themselves fully describe the action that we intend to predicate, and 'angry,' 'dead,' and 'white,' denote what is the result of the 'making,' 'striking,' and 'painting.' In \"He found the man dead,\" 'dead' is not the complement of 'found,' because the dead state of the man is in no way the result of the finding; but in \"He struck the man dead,\" 'dead' is the complement of 'struck,' because the dead state of the man is the result of the striking. The close connection between the verb and its complement is seen from the position of the words in 'Hold fast the profession of your faith'; 'They make broad their phylacteries' (In A.S. make broad = t\u00f3br\u00e6dan; in Wycliffe = alargen). In some cases the complement has formed a distinct compound with the verb, as 'white-wash,' 'rough-hew.' In German this is quite common, as in gutmachen, volbringen, todschlagen, &c. The matter is not settled by saying that 'he made the man angry' simply means that 'what he made' was 'the man in an angry state.' This sort of explanation is quite inapplicable to the rest of the examples given above. It is possible only in the case of 'make,' and perhaps one or two more verbs.\n\n\u2020 This use of a verb and a complement instead of a single verb results from the analytic tendencies of English. In A.S. we find 'wyrsian' = 'to make worse,' 't\u00f3br\u00e6dan' = 'to make broad,' 'gecl\u00e6nsian' = 'to make clean.'\nOBJECT.\n\n397. The Object of a verb may be\u2014\n\n1. Simple. 2. Compound. 3. Complex.\n\nThese distinctions are the same as in the case of the Subject (\u00a7 384, &c.).\n\nThere is also a peculiar kind of Complex Object, consisting of a Substantive accompanied by an Infinitive Mood or Participle which forms an Indirect Predicate to it, as \"I saw him fall\"; \"He made the bear dance\"; \"Let there be light\"; \"Let us pray\"; \"He commanded the bridge to be lowered\"; \"He knew the man to have been unjustly accused\"; \"We saw the man hanged\"; \"They found the child dying\"; \"He made his power felt\"; \"We found the man honest.\"\n\nThese substantive phrases may also be used as the subjects of verbs (see \u00a7 387 and note), and may come after prepositions, as \"The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland\"; \"They set him free without his ransom paid\"; \"On some brandy being administered, he revived\" (compare the Latin post urbem conditam).\n\nThe question whether a participle or adjective forms an Indirect Predicate, or is merely an attributive adjunct of the Object, may often be settled by the introduction of an Infinitive Mood, as \"They found the child [to be] dying,\" \"He found the man [to be] honest,\" or by substituting a substantive clause, as \"He believed that the man was insane\" for \"He believed the man insane.\"\n\n398. The neuter 'it' often serves as a temporary or provisional representative of a complex object, showing its grammatical relation to a verb or participle, as \"I think it foolish to act so\"; \"The burden which they considered it impossible to remove,\" where 'it' = 'to remove which.' (See \u00a7 387.) The object is also sometimes pleonastically repeated, as \"All other doubts, by time let them be cleared.\"\n\n* This answers to the ordinary Accusative and Infinitive in Latin. In A.S. we find \"Seges hine libban\" = 'They say him live.'\n\n\u2020 The beginner must not confound the indirect predicate with the infinitive denoting purpose or result. If we say \"He held the man to be in the right,\" we have an indirect predicate, because what he held (i.e., believed or maintained) was 'that the man was in the right.' But in \"He held out his hand to be caned,\" we get an infinitive of purpose. So \"He commanded the bridge to be lowered\" = 'he commanded that the bridge should be lowered'; it is obvious that 'bridge' cannot be the direct object of 'commanded'; but in \"He urged me to come,\" \"They entreated us to remain,\" \"We compelled the man to desist,\" we have infinitives denoting purpose (and therefore forming adverbial adjuncts of the verb), denoting that to which the 'urging,' 'entreating,' or 'compelling' was directed. Sometimes the construction is ambiguous, as \"He caused the troops to press onwards\"; \"He ordered the men to advance.\" This last may mean either \"He gave orders to the men to advance,\" or 'he gave orders that the men should advance.'\n\n\u2021 To see how different this construction is from that of a substantive with an ordinary attributive adjunct, compare \"He saw the man hanged\" with \"he saw a man clothed in scarlet.\" The latter means 'He saw a man in the state described by 'clothed in scarlet.' The former does not mean that 'he saw the man in a hanged condition,' but 'he saw the hanging of the man take place.' If 'clothed in scarlet' were an indirect predicate, the sentence would mean that 'he saw the man having the scarlet clothes put on him.'\n399. The object of a verb may have any combination of attributive adjuncts attached to it. It is then said to be enlarged or expanded. (See \u00a7 388.) If the object be an infinitive mood or a gerund, it may have an object or an adverbial adjunct attached to itself (\u00a7 388).\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES.\n\n400. Sentences are of three kinds:\u2014\n\nA. Simple. B. Complex. C. Compound.\n\nWhen a sentence contains only one subject and one finite verb, it is said to be a simple sentence.\n\nWhen a sentence contains not only a complete subject and its verb, but also other dependent or subordinate clauses which have subjects and verbs of their own, the sentence is said to be complex.\n\nWhen a sentence consists of two or more complete and independent sentences connected by co-ordinate conjunctions, it is said to be compound.\n\nComplex Sentences.\n\n401. A Complex Sentence * is one which, besides a principal subject and predicate, contains one or more subordinate clauses, which have subjects and predicates of their own.\n\nSubordinate Clauses are of three kinds:\u2014\n\n1. Substantive Clauses. 2. Adjective Clauses. 3. Adverbial Clauses.\n\nA Substantive Clause is one which, in its relation to the rest of the sentence, is equivalent to a substantive.\n\nAn Adjective Clause is one which, in its relation to the rest of the sentence, is equivalent to an adjective.\n\nAn Adverbial Clause is one which, in its relation to the rest of the sentence, is equivalent to an adverb.\n\n402. A complex sentence is produced whenever the place of a substantive, an adjective, or an adverb is supplied by a substantive clause, an adjective clause, or an adverbial clause.\u2020 The principal sentence is a containing sentence, and the subordinate clause is a contained clause.\n\n* It will obviate much confusion if the term 'Sentence' be restricted to a combination of words forming a complete whole; 'Clause' to a subordinate member of a sentence containing a finite verb; and 'Phrase' to any combination of words which does not contain a finite verb expressed or understood.\n\n\u2020 Learners are sometimes told that a Substantive Clause is the 'expansion' of a Substantive, an Adjective Clause the 'expansion' of an Adjective, and so on. This is a misleading view of the matter. One expression is the expansion of another only when the elements of the latter are still preserved in the former. Thus, \"The lark builds\" is expanded in the sentence; \"The lark, which soars so high and sings so sweetly, builds its nest on the dewy ground.\" But to say that \"I saw that he was confused\" is an expansion of \"I saw his confusion,\" is a misuse of terms. A shoe is not 'expanded' when it is pulled off and replaced by a jack-boot.\nIf we say, \"He announced the arrival of Caesar,\" we get a simple sentence. If we say, \"He announced that Caesar had arrived,\" we get a complex sentence, the substantive clause that Caesar had arrived being substituted for the arrival of Caesar.\n\nIf we say, \"He has lost the book given to him by me,\" we have a simple sentence. If we say, \"He has lost the book which I had given to him,\" we get a complex sentence, the adjective clause which I had given to him, being substituted for given to him by me.\n\nIf we say, \"The boy went out to play on the completion of his task,\" we get a simple sentence. If we say, \"The boy went out to play when he had completed his task,\" we get a complex sentence, the adverbial clause when he had completed his task, being substituted for on the completion of his task.\n\nIt must never be forgotten that a dependent or subordinate clause is an integral part of the principal sentence to which it belongs, just as though it were an ordinary substantive, adjective, or adverb.\n\nTwo or more subordinate clauses may be co-ordinate with each other, as \"We heard that he had lost all his money, and [that he] had gone out of his mind\"; \"This is the book which I spoke of, and which I promised to lend you.\"\n\nSUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES.\n\n403. A Substantive Clause is one which, in its relation to the rest of the sentence, is equivalent to a substantive. It may be either the subject or the object of the verb in the principal clause, or it may be in apposition to some other substantive, or be governed by a preposition.\n\nSubstantive clauses usually begin either with the conjunction that,* or with an interrogative word. The conjunction that, however, is frequently understood; as \"I saw he was tired.\" Sometimes the interrogative 'how' is so weakened in meaning as to be equivalent to 'that,' as \"'Tis told how the good squire gives never less than gold.\"\n\n404. In the sentence \"I know that he did this,\" the clause 'that he did this' is the object of the verb 'know.'\n\nIn \"He asked me how old I was,\" the clause 'how old I was' is the object of the verb 'asked.'\u2020 Similarly in \"He asked me whether I was hungry,\" the clause 'whether I was hungry' is the (second) object of 'asked.' 'If' is often used with a similar interrogative force, as \"He asked me if I was hungry.\"\n\nIn \"When I set out is uncertain,\" the clause 'when I set out' is the subject of the verb 'is.'\u2020\n\n* In vulgar English 'as' is commonly used for 'that,' sometimes along with 'how,' as \"I believe as how your man deals with the devil\" (Smollett). Similarly we find 'how that,' as \"That thou mayst know how that the earth is the Lord's.\"\n\n\u2020 How and when are here interrogative words. In cases of this sort we get what is called a dependent (or indirect) question. Interrogatives are also used with verbs in the infinitive mood to constitute a substantive phrase, as 'I do not know where to go' (\u00a7 387).\n\nM\nIn \"The idea that I shall give my consent is ridiculous,\" the clause 'that I shall give my consent' is in apposition to the noun 'idea.' In \"Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go,\" the clause 'that we have let Israel go' is in apposition to the pronoun 'this.'\n\nIn \"We should have arrived sooner, but that we met with an accident,\" the clause 'that we met with an accident' is governed by the preposition 'but.'* In \"Have they any sense of why they sing,\" the clause 'why they sing' is governed by the preposition 'of.'\n\n405. When a substantive clause is the subject of a verb, it is usually represented temporarily by the pleonastic demonstrative 'it,' as \"It is not true that he died yesterday.\" This is also the case when the clause is the object of a complex predicate (\u00a7 391), as \"He made it clear that the plan was impossible.\"\u2020\n\nA substantive clause may also follow a phrase which, taken as a whole, is equivalent to a transitive verb. Thus: \"He other means doth make, How he may work unto her further smart,\" where 'make means' = 'endeavour,' or try. So 'I am afraid' that he will not succeed' is equivalent to 'I fear that he will not succeed.'\u2021 So in \"Bid her be judge whether Bassanio had not once a friend,\" 'be judge' = 'judge.'\n\n406. It is to verbs that substantives and substantive clauses most commonly stand in the objective relation. This has nothing to do with the predicative force of the verb, but depends upon the fact that the verb denotes an action or feeling directed towards an object. Participles and gerunds take objects after them, and even some nouns which denote a transitive action or feeling may have a substantive clause as an object.\u00a7 Thus, 'There is no proof that he did this'; 'We have no hope that he will recover.'\n\n407. A quotation is not a substantive or dependent clause. Its form is not affected by its relation to the principal verb, as that of a dependent clause is. Compare \"He said 'I am tired'\" with \"He said that he was tired.\"\n\nADJECTIVE CLAUSES.\n\n408. An Adjective Clause is one which, in its relation to the rest of the sentence, is equivalent to an adjective. It\n\n* In such cases the preposition and the substantive clause governed by it constitute together an adverbial adjunct of the predicate, just like a preposition and noun (\u00a7 372, 2). What is sometimes improperly substituted for that, as 'I had no idea but what the story was true'; and that is sometimes omitted, as 'It never rains but it pours' (i.e., 'leaving out the times when it pours, it never rains'); 'But I be deceived, our fine musician growth amorous' (Shaksp. Tam. iii. 1). In these cases the but acquires the function of a conjunction (\u00a7 291).\n\n\u2020 This anticipatory 'it' sometimes brings into prominence some adjunct of the predicate. Thus, \"It was for you that I bought the book,\" i.e. 'my buying the book was for you,' \"It was yesterday that this event happened\" = 'the happening of this event was (i.e., took place) yesterday.'\n\n\u2021 It is also possible to treat the substantive clause in such cases as being analogous to the adverbial accusative, or accusative of closer definition in Latin. Thus, \"I am sorry as regards the fact that you are not well,\" \"I am sorry that you are not well\" is 'I am sorry as regards the fact that you are not well.'\n\nThis is sometimes the only mode of dealing with such a clause, as in \"He was vexed that you did not come\"; \"I am sure that he did it.\"\n\n\u00a7 Mr. Peile (Primer, p. 127) quotes the remarkable construction in Plautus, \"Quid tibi hanc tactio est?\" 'What right-of-touching this woman have you?' Sometimes a noun, owing to its peculiar meaning, has an adverbial clause attached to it, as \"Anxiety lest he should lose his money harassed him.\"\nstands in the attributive relation to a substantive, and is attached to the word which it qualifies by means of a relative pronoun, or a relative adverb which is equivalent to a relative pronoun preceded by a preposition.*\n\nIn the sentence \"Look at the exercise which I have written,\" the clause 'which I have written' qualifies the noun 'exercise,' and is much the same in force as the participial phrase 'written by me.'\n\nIn \"That is the house where I dwell,\" the clause 'where I dwell' qualifies the noun 'house.' Where is equivalent to in which.\n\nAdjective clauses are usually co-ordinate with a demonstrative adjective this, that, &c. Thus in the sentence, \"I never received those books which you sent,\" the adjective 'those' and the adjective clause 'which you sent' are both in the attributive relation to 'books.'\n\n409. The relative is sometimes omitted, as \"Where is the book I gave you?\" for which I gave you; \"I have a mind presages me such thrift,\" &c., for which presages, &c. (\u00a7 164).\n\nSometimes adjective clauses are used substantively, i.e., with no antecedent expressed, as \"Who steals my purse, steals trash.\" This omission of the antecedent is usual when the relative what is used, as \"I heard what he said,\" \"There is no truth in what he said.\"\n\n410 Care must be used to distinguish those clauses in which an indirect question is involved in the use of who, what, when, where, &c., from clauses in which these words are mere relatives. In such sentences as, \"Tell me what I ought to do,\" \"I asked him who said so,\" \"I know why he did it,\" \"He asked me when I had arrived,\" the dependent clauses are indirect questions, and are substantive clauses, having no antecedent expressed or understood to which they relate. They are based upon the direct questions, \"What ought I to do?\" \"Who said so?\" &c. In \"That is what I said,\" \"This is where I live,\" the dependent clauses are adjective clauses. Sometimes there is no ambiguity. In \"He asked me where I lived\" we clearly have an indirect question. In \"I believe what you say\" we have an adjective clause (with suppressed antecedent), 'that which you say.' Sometimes a sentence is ambiguous. Thus, \"I know what you told him\" may mean either \"The fact which you told him is one that I know,\" or \"I know the answer to the question 'What did you tell him?'\" The distinction is analogous to that between clauses beginning with quis or quid in Latin, and clauses beginning with qui or quod. In these the distinction is marked also by the mood of the verb. \"Nescio quid narraveris\" means 'I do not know what story it was that you told,' \"Non credo quod narravisti\" means 'I do not believe the story which you told.'\n\n411. Clauses beginning with as must be regarded as adjective clauses, when they follow such and same. Thus, in \"I do not admire such books as he writes,\" the clause as he writes is an adjective clause qualifying books, and co-ordinate with such, as being a relative pronoun (\u00a7 165).\n\n* Sometimes a relative clause (with a finite verb) is replaced by a relative phrase with an infinitive mood, as \"Where there is then no good for which to strive\"; \"He had not where-withal to buy a loaf.\" Sometimes even the relative is omitted, as \"I have not a pen to write with.\"\n412. An adjective clause (like an ordinary adjective) has usually a definitive or restrictive force. But it often happens that clauses introduced by relatives are, as regards their force and meaning, co-ordinate with the principal clause. Such a clause is continuative rather than definitive. Thus, in \"I wrote to your brother, who replied that you had not arrived,\" the sense of the sentence would be the same if and he were substituted for who. So in \"He heard that the bank had failed, which was a sad blow to him,\" which should be treated as equivalent to and this.\n\nThe continuative relative may even belong in reality to an adverbial clause contained within the entire clause which it introduces. Thus:\u2014\n\n\"Which when Beelzebub perceived . . . . he rose\" (Par. L. ii. 299), equivalent to \"And when Beelzebub perceived this, \u2014\u2014 he rose.\" \"Which though I be not wise enough to frame, Yet as I well it meane, vouchsafe it without blame\" (Spenser, vi. 4, 34), i.e., 'And though I be not wise enough to frame this,' &c. Modern writers rather eschew these constructions.\n\n413. The anticipative or provisional subject it often has an adjective clause as an adjunct. Thus, \"It was John who did that?\" = \"It (the person) who did that was John.\" In such cases, when the relative is the subject of the following verb, that verb usually agrees in number and person with the predicative noun or pronoun instead of the subject it; as, \"It is my parents who forbid that;\" \"It is I who say so.\"\n\nADVERBIAL CLAUSES.\n\n414. An Adverbial Clause is one which, in its relation to the rest of the sentence, is equivalent to an adverb. It stands in the adverbial relation to a verb, an adjective, or another adverb.*\n\nThus, in the sentence, \"He was writing a letter when I arrived,\" the clause \"when I arrived,\" indicates the time at which the action expressed by the verb was writing took place. The clause \"when I arrived\" is therefore in the adverbial relation to the verb was writing. The sense and construction may be represented by a single adverb: \"He was writing a letter; I arrived then.\" So, \"He still lay where he had fallen;\" i.e., \"He had fallen [somewhere]: he still lay there.\" \"I give you this because I love you;\" i.e., \"I love you; therefore I give you this.\"\n\nCLASSIFICATION OF ADVERBIAL CLAUSES.\n\n415. Adverbial Clauses may be arranged in the following classes:\u2014\n\n1.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Time.\n\n416. Clauses of this kind begin either with the connective adverbs which denote time, or with the conjunctions before, after, while, since, etc,\n\n* Adverbs sometimes do duty as nouns, as \"I have heard that before now (= the present time)\"; \"For ever is a long day.\" Adverbial clauses are sometimes used thus, as \"When ye come together into one place, this (i.e. your coming together) is not to eat the Lord's supper.\"\nuntil, &c. As, \"Every one listens when he speaks.\" \"He punished the boy whenever he did wrong.\" \"He never spoke after he fell.\"\n\nWhen relative adverbs introduce adverbial clauses, they not only connect the adverbial clause with the principal clause, but themselves qualify the verb of the clause which they introduce.\n\n2.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Place.\n\n417. Clauses of this kind are introduced by the relative or connective adverbs where, whither, whence, &c. As, \"He is still standing where I left him.\" \"Whither I go ye cannot come.\"\n\n3.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Manner.\n\n418. Adverbial clauses relating to manner are commonly introduced by the relative or connective adverb as. E.g., \"He did as he was told.\" \"It turned out as I expected.\" Clauses beginning with as are generally elliptical. At full length, \"He did as he was told to do.\"\n\n4.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Degree.\n\n419. Clauses of this kind are introduced by the conjunction than, or the connective adverbs the (\u00a7 270) and as. Adverbial clauses denoting degree are always attached to adjectives or adverbs. They are almost always elliptical.\n\nE.g., \"He is not so (or as) tall as I thought\" (i.e., as I thought he was tall). Here the clause \"as I thought [he was tall]\" qualifies (or is in the adverbial relation to) the adjective tall, and is co-ordinate with the demonstrative adverb so; and the relative adverb as at the beginning of the adverbial clause qualifies tall understood. \"He is taller than his brother;\" \"He is taller than his brother [is tall].\" \"I love study more than ever [I loved it much].\" Respecting than \u00a7 291.\n\n\"The more I learn, the more I wish to learn.\" Here the adverbial sentence \"the more I learn\" qualifies the comparative more in the main clause, and is co-ordinate with the demonstrative adverb the which precedes it; the word more in the adverbial clause being itself qualified by the relative adverb the. The first the is relative or subordinative, the second the is demonstrative (\u00a7\u00a7 126, 270).\n\n5.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Cause.\n\n421. These usually begin with the conjunctions because and for. E.g., \"I love him because he is good.\" Here \"because he is good\" is an adverbial clause qualifying the verb love. \"He could not have seen me, for I was not there.\" Here \"for I was not there\" is an adverbial clause qualifying the verb could.\n\n* Adverbial clauses are often co-ordinate with some preceding demonstrative adverb, the vague significance of which they determine, as when then is accompanied by a clause beginning with when, there by a clause beginning with where, &c. (Compare \u00a7 408.)\n\n\u2020 That we must understand the adjective tall as well as the verb is, will easily be seen if it be considered that every clause or subordinate sentence must have a predicate as well as a subject. If we ask what is predicated of his brother, the answer obviously is, being tall.\n\n\u2021 The Latin quam means 'in what degree,' 'by how much.' Dittor est quam ego means in what degree I am rich? he is richer. Quam is therefore a connective adverb in Latin, though in English than has become a mere conjunction. The meaning of the two words is quite distinct. Than originally meant when.\nClauses denoting a cause or reason often begin with 'that,' as \"He does hear me, and that he does I weep\" (Shaksp.). Compare the use of quod in Latin.\n\n6.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Purpose and Consequence.\n\n422. E.g., \"He ran so fast that he was out of breath.\" Here the adverbial clause \"that he was out of breath\" stands in the adverbial relation to fast, and is co-ordinate with so, the indefinite meaning of which it amplifies and defines. In these sentences the older writers often have as for that, as \"I will not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter\" (Shaksp.). In fact as is the more correct word.\n\n423. Adverbial clauses relating to purpose come also under this head. E.g., \"He labours that he may become rich.\" Here the adverbial clause qualifies the verb labours. \"I will not make a noise, lest I should disturb you.\" Here the adverbial clause qualifies will make. The Subjunctive Mood is used in these clauses. It is usually in the compound form, but in the older writers we find the simple subjunctive, as, \"Lest sin surprise thee;\" \"That I be not further tedious unto thee.\"\n\n7.\u2014Adverbial Clauses relating to Condition.*\n\n424. Clauses of this kind begin with the conjunctions if, unless, except, though,\u2020 although, and the compounds however, whoever, whatever, &c.\n\n425. In adverbial clauses of condition, the principal sentence is called the consequent clause (i.e., the clause which expresses the consequence); the subordinate sentence is called the hypothetical clause.\n\n426. Suppositions may be of two kinds.\n\n(A.) Suppositions of the first kind relate to some actual event or state of things, which was, is, or will be real, independently of our thought respecting it. In such suppositions the indicative mood is employed.\n\n427. Examples.\u2014\"If the prisoner committed the crime, he deserves death. If he did not commit it, all the witnesses swore falsely.\" \"If he is at home, I shall see him.\" \"If your letter is finished, bring it to me.\"\n\n428. In like manner concessive clauses beginning with though or although, which relate to what actually is or was the case, have the indicative mood; as, \"Though he was there, I did not see him;\" \"Bad as the accommodation is, we must put up with it.\"\n\n429. In a hypothesis relating to some definite event still future, the future tense of the indicative mood was formerly sometimes used in the hypothetical clause. E.g., \"If we shall say 'from heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did ye not believe him?'\" (Mark i. 31). \"If they shall enter into my rest\" (Heb. v. 5). This construction is now obsolete, and in such cases we now use the present tense.\n\n430. (B) Suppositions of the second kind treat an event or a state of things\n\n* For a fuller discussion of the use of the Indicative and Subjunctive Moods in clauses of this kind, the reader is referred to the Appendix to the author's 'Shorter English Grammar,' or his 'Remarks on the Subjunctive and the so-called Potential Mood' (published separately).\n\n\u2020 Hypothetical clauses sometimes begin with 'though' (\"He looks as though he knew me\"), and concessive clauses sometimes begin with 'if' (\"He was generally respected, if little loved\").\nas a mere conception of the mind. In suppositions of this class, the subjunctive mood is employed.\n\n431. A supposition which is contrary to some fact, present or past, is necessarily a mere conception of the mind, and therefore the subjunctive mood is used, the past indefinite tense* of the subjunctive being used in the hypothetical clause with reference to present time, and the past perfect with reference to past time. In the consequent clause the secondary past indefinite subjunctive (or conditional) is used after a supposition referring to present time, and the secondary form of the past perfect subjunctive (or conditional perfect) after a supposition relating to past time.\n\nExamples.\u2014\"If he were present (which he is not), I would speak to him.\" \"If our horse had not fallen down (which he did), we should not have missed the train.\"\n\n432. In old-fashioned English and in poetry we also find the past perfect subjunctive used in the consequent clause, instead of the secondary form (or conditional perfect); as, \"I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord.\"\n\n433. Clauses expressing a wish contrary to the fact have also the subjunctive mood. Thus, \"I wish that he were here (which he is not).\"\n\n434. When we make a supposition with regard to the future, and state its consequence, as a mere conception of the mind, without reference to determination by the actual issue of still future events, the subjunctive mood must be used in both clauses.\n\nExamples.\u2014\"If he were rewarded he would be encouraged to persevere.\" \"If he went (or should go, or were to go) away without speaking to me, I should be grieved.\" \"If he lost (or should lose, or were to lose) money, he would never be happy again.\" \"He could not (or would not be able to) do it if he tried (or were to try).\" \"I would not believe it unless I saw (or should see) it.\" \"If he were to fail, it would be a great disgrace.\" The use of the indicative in such suppositions (as \"If he was to fail,\" &c.) is a vulgarism.\n\n435. When we make a supposition with regard to the future, there is of course as yet no actual fact to which our supposition can relate. Such a supposition therefore comes naturally to be regarded as dealing with what is matter of conception only, and consequently as being appropriately expressed by the subjunctive mood. Moreover, since the use of the future tense in a hypothesis relating to the future is now obsolete, the use of the subjunctive enables us to distinguish between a supposition relating to possible future fact, and one relating to actual present fact. Compare \"I will come to-morrow if the weather be fine,\" and \"I will speak to him if he is at home now.\" The use of the subjunctive is still more desirable if the supposition expresses a general case, as such a supposition necessarily refers to\n\n---\n\n* It seems anomalous to have a past tense in any mood referring to present time, but the idiom is found in French, German, Latin, and Greek. In French and Greek we even have a past tense of the indicative mood used in sentences of this kind. It seems to have been felt that the past tense used with reference to present time marked better the want of congruity between the supposition and the fact. Thus to express in Greek \"If he were wise he would listen to your advice\" we should have to say what is equivalent to \"If he was wise, he was listening (as a consequence) to your advice.\"\nwhat is not definite matter of fact. Thus, \"If a line be bisected,\" &c. \"If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out.\" A concessive clause relating to the future should always have the subjunctive (as \"Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished\"; \"We will start to-morrow, though it rain cats and dogs\"). \"Though\" with the indicative implies \"The case is (or was) so and so, nevertheless, &c.\"\n\n436. It is still quite legitimate to use the Subjunctive Mood in hypotheses or concessions dealing with actual present or past fact, when a general case is put, because the vagueness of the case put makes it a matter of conception rather than of definite fact. Thus, \"But if he be a robber, if he have eaten upon the mountains, &c., shall he live\"? (Ezek. xviii); \"Oft, though Wisdom wake, Suspicion sleeps at Wisdom's gate.\" Modern usage tends to ignore this distinction.\n\n437. The older writers also frequently extended the use of the subjunctive to hypotheses relating to actual definite fact. Thus, \"If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither\" (Shaksp.); \"If it be thou, bid me come to thee\" (Matt. xiv. 28); \"If it were so, it was a grievous fault\" (Sh. J. C.). This is no longer allowable.\n\n438. An interrogative or imperative sentence is sometimes used in such a way as to be equivalent to a hypothetical clause. E.g., \"Is any afflicted (i.e., if any one is afflicted), let him pray.\" \"Take any form but that, and my firm nerves shall never tremble.\" In this way the double interrogatives whether\u2014or came to be equivalent to either if\u2014or if. (See \u00a7 290, p. 123.)\n\n439. The use of the indefinite pronouns and adverbs compounded with ever (whoever, however, &c.) in concessive clauses may have sprung out of the interrogative use of them. Thus, \"Whoever said so, it is false\" is much the same as \"Who ever said so? It is false.\"\n\n440. Conditional clauses (in the older writers) often begin with so.* E.g., \"I am content so (i.e., on this condition\u2020 namely, that) thou wilt have it so\" (Rom. and J. iii. 5). Just as the demonstrative that became the relative or connective that, the so in conditional clauses became as. E.g., \"As I were a shepherdless, I should be piped and sung to; as a dairy-wench, I would dance at maypoles\" (Ben. Jons. Cynthia, Rev. iv. 1). This elliptical use of as (in the second clause) is still quite common. In Chaucer as is often used for as if; as \"Thanne wolde he speke and crye as he were wood,\" i.e., 'as if he were mad' (Prol. 636). We still have this use of as in the phrase 'as it were.'\n\n441. The force of an adverbial clause is often expressed by a participle. Thus, \"More destroyed than thus (i.e., if we were more destroyed than thus), we should be quite abolished and expire.\" \"Knowing his duplicity (= because I knew, &c.), I was on my guard.\"\u2020 (Compare Horace's \"Dabitur licentia sumpta pudenter.\")\n\n442. The conjunction if is often omitted, as \"Had I known this (= if I had known this), I would not have come.\"\n\n* Si, in Latin, is only sic without the demonstrative particle ce or c.\n\u2020 In Piers Plowman (6721) we find \"By so ye had my silver\"; i.e., 'provided that (or if) ye had my silver.' With that was similarly used by the old writers; 'with that it be so' = 'provided it be so.'\n\u2021 There is not the slightest reason for maintaining that in such cases we have the gerund. The active participle is as legitimate as the passive, about which there is no ambiguity.\n\n443. The force of an adverbial clause is often expressed by a participle. Thus, \"More destroyed than thus (i.e., if we were more destroyed than thus), we should be quite abolished and expire.\" \"Knowing his duplicity (= because I knew, &c.), I was on my guard.\"\u2020 (Compare Horace's \"Dabitur licentia sumpta pudenter.\")\nCOMPOUND SENTENCES.\n\n443. A compound sentence is one which consists of two or more co-ordinate complete sentences, joined together by co-ordinate conjunctions, as \"He is happy, but I am not\"; \"They toil not, neither do they spin.\"\n\nCo-ordinate clauses are grammatically independent of each other, whereas every subordinate clause is a component part of some other clause or sentence.\n\n444. We get a compound sentence whenever two or more sentences which form complete wholes in themselves are joined together by co-ordinate conjunctions. But one or more of these complete sentences which are members of a compound sentence may themselves be complex sentences, as (a) \"I will tell your brother when I see him, but (b) I do not think that he will arrive this week.\"\n\nN.B.\u2014The conjunction itself does not enter into the construction of the clause which it introduces.\n\nCOLLATERAL SENTENCES.\n\n445. We frequently find co-ordinate sentences, which have a connection with each other as regards their sense and use, but have no grammatical link of connection between them. For example: \"I came. I saw. I conquered.\" \"Fear God. Honour the king.\" \"I was robbed of all my money; for that reason I was unable to proceed.\" \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\" Such sentences as those placed side by side in the above examples may be called collateral or asyndetic sentences.\n\n446. We frequently have a series of sentences which are partly collateral and partly compound.\n\nExample:\n\n\"He stay'd not for brake, and he stopp'd not for stone;\nHe swam the Esk river, where ford there was none.\"\n\n447. A proper consideration of the nature of collateral sentences will enable us materially to thin the usual lists of conjunctions. A word is not a conjunction because it refers us to something that precedes. Simple demonstratives do this. Such words as therefore, consequently, likewise, also (i.e., all = just in that manner), nevertheless, notwithstanding, are not conjunctions, but demonstrative adverbs. When we say \"We went the first day to Paris; thence we proceeded to Lyons,\" we get two collateral sentences. When we say \"We went the first day to Paris, whence we proceeded to Lyons,\" we get one sentence, whence having a grammatically connective force. (See \u00a7 292.)\n\n448. For analysis, a series of collateral or asyndetic sentences may be treated as though they formed a compound whole.\nCONTRACTED SENTENCES.\n\n449. When co-ordinate sentences contain either the same subject, the same predicate, the same object, the same complement, or the same adverbial adjunct to the predicate, it often happens that the portion which they have in common is expressed only once. In this case the sentence is said to be contracted.\n\nExamples:\u2014\"Neither I nor you have seen that,\" i.e., \"Neither I [have seen that] nor you have seen that.\" \"He loved not wisely, but too well\"; i.e., \"He loved not wisely, but [he loved] too well.\" Here the predicate is expressed only once.*\n\n\"Religion purifies and ennobles the soul\"; i.e., \"Religion purifies [the soul] and [religion] ennobles the soul.\" Here the subject and the object are expressed only once.\n\n\"He is either drunk or mad\"; i.e., \"Either he is drunk or [he is] mad.\" Here the subject and the verb of incomplete predication is are expressed only once.\n\n\"He advances slowly but surely\"; i.e., \"He advances slowly, but [he advances] surely.\" Here the common subject and predicate are expressed only once.\n\n\"He reads and writes well\"; i.e., \"He reads [well] and [he] writes well.\" Here the common subject and the common adverbial adjunct are expressed only once.\n\n450. Contracted sentences ought always to be so constructed, that when arranged without conjunctions, so that what is common to both or all is placed before or after what is not common, the common and separate portions, when read off continuously, make complete sense. Thus, \"Religion purifies and ennobles the soul,\" may be written\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Religion} & \\quad \\{\\text{purifies}\\} \\quad \\{\\text{the soul}\\}; \\\\\n& \\quad \\{\\text{ennobles}\\} \\quad \\{\\text{the soul}\\};\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nand complete sentences are obtained when the parts that are common, and written once, are read with each of the separate portions in succession. So, \"He gave me not only some good advice, but also a sovereign,\" may be arranged thus\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{He gave me} & \\quad \\{\\text{not only some good advice}\\} \\\\\n& \\quad \\{\\text{also a sovereign}\\}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\n\"He possesses greater talents, but is less esteemed than his brother,\"\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{He} & \\quad \\{\\text{possesses greater talents}\\} \\quad \\{\\text{than his brother}\\}. \\\\\n& \\quad \\{\\text{is less esteemed}\\}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\nIf we take such a sentence as, \"Man never is but always to be blest,\" and subject it to this test, we see in a moment that it is faulty\u2014\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\n\\text{Man} & \\quad \\{\\text{never is}\\} \\quad \\{\\text{blest}\\}, \\\\\n& \\quad \\{\\text{always to be}\\}.\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\n\ncannot be read off both ways.\u2020\n\n451. It has been already remarked (\u00a7387, note) that a sentence is not\n\n---\n\n* The predicate which is expressed must, of course, agree with the nearer of the two subjects. The predicate which is not expressed may have to be modified when supplied to suit its own subject. Thus, \"Neither you nor I am right\"; \"Neither you nor your brother is in fault.\"\n\n\u2020 The following sentences are faulty for a similar reason:\u2014\"Such as none heard before or will again\" (Byron); \"Many have and others must sit there\" (Shaksp.).\nnecessarily a contracted sentence because we find co-ordinate conjunctions used in it. \"John and Charles are brothers,\" is as much one sentence as \"These two boys are brothers.\" One predication may be made of two things taken together. \"The child has a red and white ball,\" does not mean \"The child has a red ball, and the child has a white ball.\" The attributes exist in the same object. So when the same act is directed simultaneously to two or more objects, the verb may have two or more objects after it; but the sentence need not, on that account, be split up into two or more sentences. Thus, \"He mixed yellow and red together\"; \"He confounds right and wrong.\" A similar principle applies to the case of adverbial adjuncts. In \"The path led onward and upward\" it is not necessary to find more than one predication. But \"He came now and then,\" \"I saw one here and there,\" should be treated as contracted sentences. But every verb makes a distinct predication, consequently every verb requires a separate sentence for itself. The conjunction or always involves a complete sentence for each of the words or phrases that it introduces, because the word implies some alternative, so that the idea of simultaneousness is excluded.\n\n452. It follows, from the principle on which co-ordinate and contracted sentences are constructed, that the co-ordinate conjunctions must always join words and clauses which stand in the same relation to the other parts of the sentence. It would make nonsense if we attempted to join an adjective to a noun (unless the latter be used attributively or predicatively), or a subject to an adverb, or a verb in the indicative mood to a verb in the imperative mood, &c.\n\nELLiptical Sentences.\n\n453. Elliptical sentences differ from contracted sentences in the following respect:\u2014In contracted sentences a certain portion which is common to the sentences is expressed only once in one of them, and has to be repeated in the others. In elliptical sentences, the part to be supplied in one clause, although suggested by what is expressed in the other, is not necessarily exactly the same in form. Moreover, contracted sentences or clauses are always co-ordinate; an elliptical clause is usually a subordinate clause, the portion to be supplied being suggested by the principal clause; as, \"He is taller than I,\" i.e., \"than I am tall\"; \"This does not cost so much as that,\" i.e., \"as that costs much.\"\n\nSUMMARY OF THE RULES OF SYNTAX.\n\n454. [Most of these rules, having been already stated in preceding parts of this work, are here only referred to, that the pupil may have the opportunity of studying them afresh in connection with each other.]\n\n* Young letter-writers constantly forget this rule at the close of their epistles, where such combinations as, \"I have no more to say, and believe me yours truly,\" are very frequent.\n\n\u2020 It is not always possible to fill up an elliptical sentence. Some occur of which the original complete form has been forgotten. See the examples of Analysis for a fuller discussion of elliptical sentences.\nCONCORD.\n\n455. In inflected languages (like Latin, German, or English in its earliest stage) concord means the use of those grammatical forms which are congruous with each other.\n\nA verb must have that grammatical form which shows that it is of the same number and person as its subject.\n\nAn adjective must have that grammatical form which shows that it is of the same gender, number, and case as the noun or pronoun to which it belongs.\n\nA relative pronoun must have that grammatical form which shows that it is of the same gender and number as its antecedent.\n\n456. In modern English, grammatical inflexions have been to a great extent dispensed with. We have therefore very little of the above kinds of concord. But as regards concords expressed by form we still have the rule that a verb must agree with its subject in number and person, and that the demonstrative pronoun of the Third Person must agree in gender and number with the noun for which it stands, and that the demonstratives 'this' and 'that' assume the plural forms 'these' and 'those' when they qualify a plural noun. If the term agreement is used for anything beyond this, it can only denote congruity of use, that is, sameness in the grammatical relations which might be represented by form, but are not. To say, for example, that in \"The woman who was hurt has recovered,\" 'who' agrees in gender with 'woman,' means no more than that the pronoun, as used in that sentence, represents a female person.\n\nSYNTAX OF NOUNS.\n\n457. For the definition of the Nominative Case see \u00a7 68.\n\nA noun in the nominative case may be used\u2014\n\n1. As the subject of a sentence (\u00a7 348) or of a subordinate clause of a sentence (\u00a7 401).\n2. In apposition to a noun or pronoun in the nominative case (\u00a7 362, 2).\n3. As the complement of an Intransitive or Passive Verb of Incomplete Predication (\u00a7 391).\n4. As a Nominative Absolute (\u00a7 372, 5).\n5. As a Nominative of Address (\u00a7 70).\n\n458. For the functions of the Possessive Case see \u00a7\u00a7 71\u201473.\n\nA noun in the possessive case is usually attached to some other noun to which it forms an Attributive Adjunct * (\u00a7 362, 3),\n\n* A noun in the possessive case, however, does not cease to be a noun. It does not become an adjective because its form makes it partake of the functions of an adjective. In \"John's father\" \"John's\" is a noun in the possessive case, as in \"Caesaris uxor,\" \"Caesaris\" is a noun in the genitive case. Similarly a noun in the objective case, with or without a preposition, is often an Adverbial Adjunct (like a noun in the dative or ablative in Latin). But it is going too far to say that the noun in the objective, dative, or ablative is an adverb.\nand on which it is sometimes said to depend. This noun is sometimes omitted when it can readily be supplied in thought, as \"I bought this at Smith's [shop],\" \"We went to St. Paul's [church].\"\n\nThe Possessive Case may also be the complement of a Verb of Incomplete Predication (\u00a7 393), as 'The earth is the Lord's.'\n\nWhen something belongs to two or more persons in common, the inflexion of the possessive case is placed only after the last of the nouns that denote the possessors, when they are very closely connected, as 'Smith, Brown, and Robinson's shop'; 'Liddell and Scott's lexicon'; 'In William and Mary's reign.'\n\nA complex name has the possessive inflexion at the end (\u00a7 77).\n\n459. For the functions of the Objective Case see \u00a7\u00a7 79, 80.\n\nA noun in the objective case may be used\u2014\n\n1. As the direct object of a transitive verb, participle, or gerund (\u00a7 368). Some verbs take two objective cases after them (\u00a7 370), one of which is sometimes a factitive object (\u00a7 369, A).\n2. As the indirect object of a transitive verb, whether active or passive (\u00a7 369, B), or as the secondary object after a passive verb, when the active verb governs two objectives (\u00a7 370).\n3. In apposition to a noun or pronoun in the objective case (\u00a7 362, 2).\n4. As the complement of a transitive verb of incomplete predication (\u00a7 395).\n5. With an infinitive mood or participle attached to it as an indirect predicate, forming a substantive phrase, used as the subject or object of a verb, or after a preposition (\u00a7 397).\n6. As an Adverbial Adjunct (\u00a7 371).\n7. As a Cognate Objective (\u00a7 372, 3).\n8. After Prepositions (\u00a7 277).\n\nSome anomalous uses of the objective case in Pronouns are treated of in \u00a7 477.\n\nThe Objective Case is used in exclamations, as 'Ah me!' 'Oh me unhappy!' 'Me to be thus jeered at!'\n\nSYNTAX OF ADJECTIVES.\n\n460. The attributive and the predicative use of Adjectives are explained in \u00a7 87. As regards adjectives used substantively and adjectives which have become substantives, see \u00a7 98.\n\n461. Adjectives (including participles) sometimes relate to the substantive which is implied in a possessive pronoun, as \"The Lord lightenth both their eyes\" (i.e., the eyes of both of them); \"For all our sakes,\" &c. (\u00a7 135, note). Similarly, \"Thus repulsed, our final hope is flat despair\" (Milton).\n\n462. The Indefinite Article an or a should be repeated before each of a series of nouns standing for different things, as \"I saw a horse, a\ncow, and a pig in the stable,\" unless the things are so closely connected with each other as to form a sort of compound group; as \"He built a coachhouse and stable;\" \"Give me a cup and saucer.\" \"A black and white ball\" can only mean 'a ball that is partly black and partly white.' If we mean to speak of two balls of different colours, we must say 'a black and a white ball.'\n\nThe singular demonstrative adjectives 'each' and 'every' may be placed once before two or more nouns, as \"Every man, woman, and child was slaughtered;\" \"Each boy and girl received a present.\"\n\n463. The definitive adjectives 'the,' 'these,' 'those,' 'my,' 'our,' &c., need not be repeated before each of several nouns, though of course they may be so repeated. We commonly say \"The King and Queen;\" \"The tables and chairs were in confusion;\" \"He gathered all the apples and pears;\" \"My uncle, aunt, and cousin came yesterday.\" If a plural noun is in sense distributed among several adjectives, so as to stand for a collection of single things, each of which is described by one of the adjectives, it is proper to use the definitive adjective once, as \"The third and fourth regiments,\" \"The English, French and German languages.\" A plural may also be distributed into two or more plurals, provided no ambiguity results, as \"He placed all the gold and silver coins in one bag, and all the bronze and copper ones in another;\" but in such cases it is always safer to repeat the article. The demonstratives must be repeated if a plural noun is not thus distributed, and is accompanied by two or more adjectives marking qualities which do not belong in common to all the things named by the noun. Thus, \"The clever and industrious boys,\" means 'the boys who are both clever and industrious,' but we cannot speak of \"the idle and industrious boys,\" because the two attributes do not co-exist in the same boys; we must say 'the idle and the industrious boys.'\n\nThis principle, however, is often disregarded, as in, \"The rich and poor meet together\" (Prov. xxii. 2); while the article is sometimes repeated when only one thing is referred to, provided it is clear that only one thing is meant; as \"He returned a sadder and a wiser man;\" \"You will find this road the shortest and the pleasantest.\"\n\n464. The ordinary effect of the repetition of the article (or other definitive word) is to make the noun stand for several distinct groups. \"The wise, the valiant, and the wealthy citizens\" should mean three distinct classes of citizens. \"The wise, valiant, and wealthy citizens\" would denote one class possessing all three qualities.\n\nThe article should not be used before a noun used attributively or predicatively with distinct reference to its signification. Thus, \"He became Chancellor of the Exchequer;\" \"John Smith, captain of the Petrel, next gave evidence.\"\n\nSYNTAX OF PRONOUNS.\n\n465. Pronouns must agree in Gender, Number, and Person with the nouns for which they stand. Their case is determined\nby the construction of the clause in which they occur. Thus: 'I do not like John (obj.) ; 'he (nom.) is an idle boy'; 'I know the man (obj.) whose (poss.) portrait hangs there,' &c. Even if the pronouns happen to coincide in case with the nouns to which they relate, this is not grammatical agreement, it is a mere accident.\n\n466. The nominative and objective cases are constructed as in nouns. The possessive cases have become adjectives (\u00a7 142).\n\n467. The antecedent of a Relative Pronoun is sometimes disguised in the form of a Possessive (adjective) Pronoun, as \"Whose is the crime, the scandal too be theirs.\" (See \u00a7 461.)\n\n468. The relative pronoun is frequently omitted (\u00a7 164) when, if expressed, it would be in the objective case; but it is rarely omitted when, if expressed, it would be in the nominative case. In the older writers, however, we find such expressions, as \"I have a mind presages me such thrift;\" \"They are envious term thee parasite.\" The continuative relative (\u00a7 412) can never be omitted.\n\n469. When a relative refers to a noun which is in the predicative relation to a personal pronoun, the relative is sometimes made to agree in person with that pronoun, rather than with its actual antecedent. Thus: \"I am . . . a plain blunt man, that love my friend\" (Sh. J. C. iii. 2); \"Thou art the God that doest wonders\" (Ps. lxxvii. 14). This is an instance of grammatical attraction. The strict construction is seen in such sentences as \"Art thou he who first broke peace in Heaven?\" (Milton). Milton also uses the other construction, as \"If thou beest he who . . . didst outshine myriads, &c.\" (P. L. I. 84.).\n\n470. Also when a relative clause explains the anticipatory subject 'it,' to which a personal pronoun is joined predicatively, the relative commonly agrees with the personal pronoun and not with its antecedent it. Thus we say \"It is I who am in fault,\" though the sentence really means \"It (the person) who is in fault, is I.\" This also is a case of attraction. Contrariwise the predicative pronoun is sometimes attracted into the case of the relative. It is usual to say \"It is I who did it,\" but \"It is me whom he fears.\"\n\n471. It is not usual now to employ a relative pronoun in a complex adjective clause which contains an adverbial clause, so that the relative shall belong to the adverbial clause (\u00a7 412). In the older writers such sentences were not uncommon, as \"A treasure which if country curates buy, They Junius and Tremellius may defy\"; \"Which when Beelzebub perceived . . . he rose\" (P. L. ii. 299); \"He mentions but few books . . . from which if ever he departs, he is in danger of losing himself\" (Johnson). Respecting the pleonastic demonstrative used in such cases when the relative is in the nominative case, see \u00a7 383.\n\n* In point of fact it is not necessary to regard 'me' as the complement of the predicate. The sentence may be treated as one of those in which the pronoun it is employed to bring into prominence some emphatic element of a sentence, as in \"It was to join that I addressed myself\"; \"It was in Venice that he die...\"\n472. Respecting the pleonastic use of a demonstrative pronoun as a substitute for the inflexion of the relative see \u00a7 152, note. Compare \"good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them (= in which).\"\n\n473. But a relative may be used in a complex adjective clause, so as to belong to a subordinate substantive clause, as \"That is a sort of wine which I know that he likes,\" where 'which' belongs in construction to the clause which begins with 'that.'\n\n474. The pronoun he, she, it, ought to agree in gender and number with the noun to which it refers. But it often happens that it has to be used with reference to the individuals of a class that may consist of both sexes, distributed by means of the singular indefinite pronouns 'each' and 'every,' or to either of two singular nouns differing in gender, and connected by the alternative pronouns 'either\u2014or,' 'neither\u2014nor.' The difficulty that thus arises is sometimes evaded by using the plural, as \"Let each esteem other better than themselves;\" \"If an ox gore a man or a woman so that they die\" (Exod. xxii. 28); \"Not on outward charms alone should man or woman build their pretensions to please\" *(Opie). Some insist that in such cases alternative pronouns should be used, 'so that he or she die,' 'his or her pretensions,' &c. But on the whole, the plural seems preferable, although, of course, it involves a breach of a rule. Such a sentence as \"Each man, woman, and child received his, her, and its share,\" is intolerably awkward.\n\n475. They and them are not now used as antecedents to a relative pronoun. They were commonly so used by the older writers, but as the plural antecedent to a relative those is now employed. The singular pronouns he, him, she, her may be used as antecedents, but not the neuter it.\n\n476. When pronouns, or pronouns and nouns, of different persons are coupled together, their relative position varies according to the number. In the singular the Second Person comes before the First or Third (You and I; You and he; or, You and John), but the Third comes before the First (He and I). In the plural we has the first place, you the second, and they the third. If a pronoun has to represent words of different persons, the Second Person takes precedence of the Third, and the First of either the Second or the Third, as \"You and he must do your work\"; \"John and I lost our way.\"\n\nThe neuter pronoun 'it' is largely employed as the temporary or anticipatory subject or object of a verb (\u00a7\u00a7 387, 398, 405 with the note). It is also used as the formal but superfluous subject of an impersonal verb (\u00a7 382, note), and as the vague representative of a cognate objective (\u00a7 372, 3).\n\n* Similarly, \"Every one of these letters are in my name\" (Shaksp. Twv. N.); \"Nobody knows what it is to lose a friend till they have lost him\" (Fielding). In Latin quisque and uterque are used with a plural verb. It is a construction which is regulated by the sense of the words, rather than by their mere form.\nAnomalous Constructions.\n\n477. A Personal Pronoun used as the complement of a verb of incomplete predication is sometimes put in the objective case instead of the nominative in colloquial language, as \"That's him;\" \"Who is there? Me, sir.\"\n\nExpressions like these are probably formed on the analogy of the French 'c'est moi,' &c., which ousted the old construction (still found in Chaucer) 'It am I.' The change was perhaps facilitated by the fact that objective forms like himself could be used in apposition to nominatives, as 'he himself said.' In dignified language the nominative is preferable, as 'It is I, be not afraid' (Mark vi. 50); \"Lord, is it I?\" (Matt. xxvi. 22).\n\n478. No satisfactory syntactical explanation can be given of the use of the relative whom after than.\u2020 Even the demonstrative is sometimes similarly put in the objective case,\u2021 but this should be avoided.\n\nThe objective case is used in exclamations, as 'Ah me!'; 'Oh me unhappy.' The objective is in fact the natural case in which to put an unattached pronoun. It has been pointed out (\u00a7 219, note) that the nominative forms are of late origin.\n\n479. In such phrases as \"a book of mine\" we probably have merely a repetition of the idea of possession. We may say \"That invention of yours is a useful one\" to a man who had never made more than one (\u00a7 144).\n\n480. Pronouns often represent not some particular noun, but the general fact implied in a preceding sentence, as:\u2014\"When ye come together, this (i.e., your coming together) is not to eat the Lord's Supper;\" \"I did my best, but it (i.e. my doing my best) was of no use;\" \"He gained a prize, which (i.e., his gaining a prize) greatly pleased his friends.\"\n\n* Dr. Murray (Dialect of the S. Counties of Scotland, p. 187) points out that in Lowland Scotch the Personal Pronouns have not only a form which is distinctly and always nominative, and a form which is distinctly and always objective, but a separate form, based upon the old English objective, and used in certain circumstances either as a nominative or as an objective, like moi, toi, lui in French. It occurs in sentences which may be represented in our ordinary idiom by \"Who is there? Me\"; \"That's him\"; \"Them that have\"; \"Me, I cannot go\"; \"Them and us did very well together,\" &c. The use of these objectives is a genuine idiom of our language as it is of French. It is quite a mistake to set it down as bad grammar. At a very early period we find himself and themselves used as nominatives.\n\nIt is to be observed, however, that the early part of the modern English period was marked by a great deal of irregularity and confusion in the use of the cases of the pronouns. In the time of Elizabeth, not only were the objective forms often used as nominatives, but the nominatives were sometimes used as objectives. The interrogative who? is usually in the nominative form, even when it is the object of a verb. The confusion between ye and you (which are always distinct in Chaucer) has resulted in the general use of you for both cases.\n\n\u2020 \"Beelzebub . . . than whom, Satan except, none higher sat\" (Par. L. ii.). The case of an interrogative or relative pronoun ought to be the same as that of the demonstrative pronoun which would answer to it. But \"None sat higher than him\" would be bad grammar. At the same time it is to be observed that, as the sentence stands, it would be impossible to fill up the ellipsis so as to make who the subject of a finite verb. There is not the slightest necessity for regarding than as a preposition, or as doing duty for one. We simply have another illustration of the idiom noticed above.\n\n\u2021 E.g., \"A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both\" (Prov. xxvii. 3).\nSYNTAX OF VERBS.\n\nConcord.\n\n481. The general rule respecting the concord of verbs is, that a verb agrees with its subject in number and person (\u00a7\u00a7 378\u2014383).\n\n482. Words that are plural in form (as mathematics, politics) are sometimes treated as singular in construction (\u00a7 58), and some singular nouns have been mistaken for plurals (\u00a7 59). A plural used as the title of a book, &c., must be treated as a singular, as \"Johnson's Lives of the Poets\" is a work of great interest;\" and generally when a plural denotes a whole of some kind, the verb may be singular, as \"Forty yards is a good distance;\" \"Two-thirds of this is mine by right;\" \"Twice two is four.\" For the usage when the subject is a collective noun, see \u00a7 380, and for the case of a compound subject, or of a noun in the singular to which other nouns are joined by means of with, \u00a7\u00a7 381, 386.\n\n483. When subjects differing in number, or person, or both, are connected by and, the verb must always be in the plural; and in the first person, if one of the subjects is of that person; in the second person, if one of the subjects is of that person, and none of the first, as, 'I and he are of the same age;' 'You and I shall be too late.'\n\n484. Subjects connected by either\u2014or\u2014and neither\u2014nor imply an alternative. Hence a plural verb cannot be attached to two such subjects, if they are in the singular. The sentence is in fact contracted (\u00a7 386), as, \"Either John [is mistaken] or Thomas is mistaken\"; \"Neither John [is mistaken] nor Thomas is mistaken.\"\n\nThis sort of contraction should be avoided if the subjects differ in number or person. Some writers tell us in such cases to make the verb agree with the nearest subject. This is just endurable if the difference is one of number only, and the plural subject comes next the verb, as \"Neither the emperor nor his generals were convinced.\" But such sentences as \"Either he or I am to blame,\" \"Neither we nor John is rich\" are abominable. It is better to say \"Either he is to blame or I am\"; \"We are not rich, nor John either.\"* A singular verb must be used after each, every, either, neither, as \"Every method has been tried.\" \"Neither of them was in fault.\"\n\nUse of the Moods.\n\n485. Rules for the use of the Imperative Mood are superfluous. For its employment as the equivalent of a hypothesis see \u00a7 438.\n\n486. The Indicative Mood is used in all kinds of declarative and interrogative sentences, whether principal or subordinate, in which\n\n* Dr. Latham (Handbook, p. 181) gives as a rule that with a simple disjunctive the verb should agree with the first subject. Thus, \"I or he am in the wrong\"; \"He or I is in the wrong;\" \"Thou or he art in the wrong\"; \"He or thou is in the wrong.\"\nthe Subjunctive is not requisite. It is essentially the Mood of Fact, or of Objective Predication (\u00a7 190).\n\n487. The nature and functions of the Subjunctive Mood are explained in \u00a7 192. It is essentially the Mood of Conception, or of Subjective Predication.\n\nThe Subjunctive Mood is employed\u2014\n\n1. In the direct expression of a wish (\u00a7 192).\n2. To express purpose after *that* and *lest* in an adverbial clause attached to a verb, or in a substantive clause in apposition to a noun denoting a wish, intention, or command (\u00a7\u00a7 192, 428).\n3. In adverbial clauses expressing hypothesis or concession contrary to the actual fact (\u00a7\u00a7 430\u2014433). The older writers used the simple subjunctive in the consequent clause in such cases, as \u201cI had fainted,\u201d unless I had believed,\u201d &c.; \u201cHadst thou but shook thy head . . . deep shame had struck me dumb\u201d (Sh. K. John iv. 3); \u201cWert thou regent of the world, it were a shame to let this land by lease\u201d (Rich. II. ii. 1). The secondary or conditional form is now usual for the consequent clause, \u2018I should have fainted,\u2019 \u2018would have struck,\u2019 \u2018would be,\u2019 &c.\n4. In hypotheses in which a general case is put (\u00a7 436).\n5. In hypothetical (or concessive) clauses relating to the future, when the hypothesis is presented as a mere conception of the mind, without regard to its being brought to the test of actual fact (\u00a7 434).\n6. In hypotheses with respect to the yet uncertain future, even when determination by actual fact is not excluded (\u00a7 435). The subjunctive occurs also after *till* and *when* with reference to the future, as \u201cBlow till thou burst thy wind\u201d (Sh. Temp.). In these cases the subjunctive has been commonly superseded by the indicative.\n7. In concessive clauses relating to the future, or in clauses relating to the present, if a general case be put, or if the concessive clause begin with the verb (\u201cBe he ne\u2019er so vile\u201d; \u201cBe the task as hard as it may,\u201d &c.\n\n488. In poetry and in the older writers we find the *simple* present subjunctive after \u2018that\u2019 and \u2018lest\u2019 to express purpose, as \u201cGive me leave that I may turn the key, that no man enter\u201d (Rich. II. v. 3); \u201cKeep thy heart light, lest it make thee sink\u201d (Shelley). In ordinary prose we now use the compounds of \u2018may\u2019 and \u2018might\u2019 after \u2018that\u2019 (as \u201cHe locks the door that no man may enter\u201d; \u201cHe locked the door that no man might enter\u201d), and the compound of \u2018should\u2019 after \u2018lest,\u2019 whether the preceding verb be in the present or in the past tense (as \u201cGoverm thy appetite, lest sin should surprise thee\u201d; \u201cHe governed his appetite, lest sin should surprise him\u201d).\n\n489. Certain uses of the subjunctive which have now become obsolete are noticed in \u00a7 192, p. 68.\nSequence of Tenses.\n\n490. The tense of the verb in an accessory or dependent clause commonly depends upon that of the verb in the principal clause. A present or future in the principal clause requires a present or future indicative, or a present subjunctive, in the dependent clause. A past tense in the main clause requires a past tense in the dependent clause; e.g., \"He does this that he may please me\"; \"He will do this that he may please me\"; \"He has done this that he may please me\"; \"He did this that he might please me\"; \"He says that he is better\"; \"He said that he was better,\" &c. But if the dependent clause states a universal truth, it is better to keep the present tense. Thus: \"He allowed that all men are liable to error\"; \"He denied that God exists.\"\n\nSome verbs (as ought, must, need) cannot express past or perfect tense. When past time is referred to, it has to be expressed by putting the dependent infinitive into the perfect, as \"You ought to have gone there yesterday\" (= it was your duty to go there yesterday); \"He must have been out of his senses when he did that,\" &c. Even when the principal verb can be put into a past tense, a perfect infinitive is often used, especially to show that the event is no longer possible, as \"I hoped to have been present\"; \"She was to have been married next week.\"\n\n491. English admits of a good deal of freedom in the use of tenses. Thus the same sequence of events may be found expressed in all the following ways*:\n\n\"Before the cock crow twice, thou deniest me thrice\" (Anglo-Saxon).\n\"Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\"\n\"Before the cock has crowed twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\"\n\"Before the cock shall crow twice, thou shalt deny me thrice.\"\n\"Before the cock has crowed twice, thou shalt have denied me thrice.\"\n\"Before the cock shalt have crowed twice, thou shalt have denied me thrice.\"\n\n492. The Infinitive Mood presents itself in three forms:\n\nA. As the Pure or Simple Infinitive without 'to' (\u00a7 194).\nB. As the Gerundial Infinitive, with 'to' before it (\u00a7 196).\nC. As the Strengthened Gerundial Infinitive, preceded by 'for to.' This form is now obsolete, except as an indirect predicate in a somewhat modified form (\u00a7 387, note).\n\nA. The Pure Infinitive is used\u2014\n\n1. As the Subject of a sentence, usually preceded by the temporary subject 'it'; as \"Will it please you hear me?\" (Shaksp. Ant. and Cl.); \"Him booteth not resist\" (Spenser); \"It were best not know myself\" (Shaksp.). This use of it is no longer customary.\n2. As the Object of various verbs of incomplete predication, as do, shall, will, may, must, can, dare, need, ought (in the older writers). It\n\n* See Lounsbury's 'History of the English Language' (a capital little manual by a sound scholar).\nwas formerly used after verbs denoting thinking of some kind, as \"He wende have crope (= he thought to have crept) by his felaw\" (Chaucer).\n\n3. As the Object of the verb have when that verb is one of incomplete predication with the complement liff, rather, better, best, &c., as \"You had better go home\"; \"I had rather die than suffer such disgrace.\"\n\n4. As an Indirect Predicate, attached to a substantive, and forming with it a phrase which may be the object of a verb (\u00a7\u00a7 387, 397).\n\n5. After the preposition 'but,' as 'I cannot but admire his courage.'\n\n6. In the older writers it often forms an adverbial adjunct, as \"I will go seek the king\"; \"Help me curse this bottle-spider.\"\n\nB. The Gerundial or Prepositional Infinitive is used\u2014\n\n1. As the Subject of a sentence (\u00a7\u00a7 195, 196).\n\n2. As the Complement of a verb of Incomplete Predication (\u00a7 394), as \"To be good is to be happy\"; \"He seems to be in trouble.\"\n\n3. As the Object of a verb, as \"He professed to know all about it\"; \"I want to speak to you\"; \"I have to leave directly.\" This is especially common when the object at the same time marks the purpose of the action, as \"He sought to slay him\"; \"I purposed to write to you\" (\u00a7\u00a7 194, 196).\n\n4. As an Indirect Predicate, attached to a substantive, and forming with it a phrase which may be the Subject or Object of a verb, or come after a preposition (\u00a7\u00a7 387, 397).\n\n5. As an Adverbial Adjunct of another verb, or of an adjective, as \"I went to see him\"; \"You are to go home\"; \"That is to say\"; \"Help me to finish my task\"; \"He left the poor man to bleed to death\"; \"It came to pass\"; \"I am ready to faint\"; \"Swift to pursue\"; \"Likely to be successful\"; \"I am happy to hear it\"; \"He was the first to arrive\" (\u00a7\u00a7 196, 372, 4).\n\n6. As an Attributive Adjunct of a substantive, as \"A house to let\"; \"He came on purpose to fetch me (i.e., on or with the purpose of fetching me)\" (\u00a7 362, 4).\n\n7. After a preposition: \"He is about to speak\"; \"There is nothing left but to submit\" (\u00a7 196).\n\nC. The Infinitive with 'for to' commonly expressed purpose, as \"Came to Joseph for to buy corn (Gen. xli. 57). It was also used as the Subject or Object of another verb, as \"Unto a poure ordre for to give is signe,\" &c. (Chaucer); \"Ye leve logik, and lerneth for to loyve\" (Piers Pl. 14424). For the use of this infinitive as an Indirect Predicate see \u00a7 387, note.\n\nThe to of an infinitive mood should never be separated from its verb by an adverb. Such phrases as, 'To rightly use,' 'To really understand' are improper.\n\n493. The origin and construction of the gerund in -ing are explained in \u00a7 200. When a verbal substantive in -ing is preceded by the or followed by of, it must be regarded as the representative of a verbal noun in -ung, as in \"land suitable for the planting of trees\"; \"During the reading of the will,\" &c. When preceded by the, it should be followed by of. When the verbal noun in -ing has an object, like a verb, it is the gerund.\n494. The use of a participle where we ought to have a gerund, is a common error, as in \"I heard of him running away,\" instead of \"I heard of his running away\"; \"It is of no use you saying so,\" for \"It is of no use your saying so\" (i.e., \"It\u2014namely your saying so\u2014is of no use\"). In the case of personal and relative pronouns the gerund and possessive should always be used, as in the preceding sentences. With this, that, each, all, either, neither, the participial construction is proper, as \"You will oblige me by all leaving the room\"; \"I have my doubts as to this being true\"; \"You seem to understand me, by each at once her choppy finger laying upon her skinny lips\" (Macbeth). The best writers also give sentences like the following:\u2014\"The jealousy of his contemporaries prevented justice being done to him during his lifetime\"; \"I am afraid of mischief resulting from this\"; \"On some brandy being administered to him he revived\"; \"There is no record of any payment having been made\"; \"There was a story of money having been buried there\"; \"I then all smarting with my wounds being cold\" (Shaks.). \"Upon Nigel insisting,\" &c. (Scott). These are instances of the use of an Indirect Predicate (\u00a7 397), and are analogous to the Latin post urbem cond tam, &c. On the other hand, most authorities would prefer \"On the boy's confessing his fault I forgave him\"; \"On my father's hearing of this he was amazed.\" It will be observed that in such sentences the noun in the possessive case is commonly repeated in the form of a demonstrative pronoun, 'I forgave him,' 'He was amazed.'\n\n495. Respecting the curious passive sense often given to an active verb or participle see \u00a7 183, and add to the examples there given such as \"The horses are putting to,\" \"I want a button sewing on,\" &c.\n\n496. The extensive use of the Impersonal Verb in early English is noticed in \u00a7 382; as also the change of the impersonal into the personal construction, which gives rise to various anomalous phrases, as 'I dislike' for 'it mislikes me'; 'I please' for 'it pleases me'; 'I were better' for 'it were better for me,' &c.\n\n497. Constructions are sometimes adapted to the general sense of words and phrases rather than to their strictly grammatical force. Thus: \"I am afraid (= I fear) that he will not come\"; \"Bid 't be judge (= judge) whether Bassanio had not once a friend.\" So we say \"There are one or two mistakes here,\" because one or two stands for some small number exceeding one.\n\nWhen a plural denotes a whole of some kind, the verb may be in the singular, as \"Forty yards is a good distance\"; \"Two-thirds of this is mine by right\"; \"Twice two is four.\"* So \"This fourteen years\"; \"A tedious twelve years\"; \"A twelvemonth.\"\n\n498. Great caution must be used in elliptical sentences (especially with as and than) to see that the right cases are used. The best way is to test the sentence by filling up the ellipsis, as \"He loves me\n\n* We say 'twice five is ten,' because 'twice five' is treated as a single sum, though the full phrase of course is \"twice five things are ten things.\" The amount is considered rather than the mode of its formation. When the latter idea is prominent, the plural is better, as \"twice five make ten!\" The use of the plural times does not affect the question, because in \"three times ten is thirty,\" times is not the subject of the sentence. Three times is an adverbial adjunct of the numeral ten, like twice or thrice.\nbetter than [he loves] thee\"; \"He loves me better than thou [lovest me]\"; \"He knows the man as well as I [know the man]\"; \"He knows the man as well as [he knows] me\"; \"I know no wiser man than he [is wise]\" is correct; but \"I have no other saint than thou to pray to\" is wrong, because the construction springs out of \"I have no other saint when [I have] thee.\"\n\n499. A good deal of hypercriticism has been wasted on such phrases as \"The three first verses of the chapter,\" &c. We are told that this is incorrect, because there is only one first verse. On this principle it is equally wrong to talk of \"The first hours of infancy,\" or \"The last days of Pompeii,\" for there is only one first hour, and one last day. Surely if there are several last days, their number may be specified. It would be the height of pedantry to alter \"His two eldest sons went to sea\" into \"His eldest two sons went to sea\"; yet strictly there can be only one eldest son. German writers see nothing wrong in such phrases as \"die drei ersten,\" \"die zwei letzten,\" &c. All these superlatives admit of a little laxity in their application, just as chief and extreme admit of the superlatives chiepest and extremest. 'The three first verses' simply means 'The three verses before which there is no other.' Those who tell us to write 'The first three verses,' and so on, must do so on the hypothesis that the whole number of verses is divided into sets of three, of which sets the first is taken. But what if the chapter contains only five altogether?\n\nANALYSIS OF SENTENCES.\n\nSEPARATION OF LOGICAL SUBJECT AND LOGICAL PREDICATE.\n\n500. The first stage in the analysis of a simple sentence is to separate the grammatical subject with its adjuncts from the predicate verb with whatever is attached to it as object, complement, or adverbial adjunct. The grammatical subject with its attributive adjuncts forms the logical subject of the sentence; the predicate verb, with all that is attached to it, forms the logical predicate of the sentence (\u00a7 355).\n\nExamples.\n\n| Logical Subject. | Logical Predicate. |\n|-----------------|--------------------|\n| (Grammatical Subject with Attributive Adjuncts.) | (Predicate Verb, with Objective and Adverbial Adjuncts.) |\n| Our messenger   | has not arrived.   |\n| We             | will carry all our property with us. |\n| The village preacher's modest mansion | rose there. |\n| The wretched prisoner, overwhelmed by his misfortunes, | was on the point of putting an end to his existence. |\n| A bird in the hand | is worth two in the bush. |\nAnalysis of the Logical Subject.\n\n501. The following example illustrates the separation of the logical subject into the grammatical subject and its attributive adjuncts (\u00a7 388).\n\n\"The soldiers of the tenth legion, wearied by their long march, and exhausted from want of food, were unable to resist the onset of the enemy.\"\n\n| Logical Subject. | Grammatical Subject. | Attributive Adjuncts of Subject. |\n|------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|\n| Soldiers         |                      | 1.

In the following example both the subject and the object of the verb are separated into the substantive and the attributive adjuncts of which they are composed:\u2014\n\"The mournful tidings of the death of his son filled the proud heart of the old man with the keenest anguish.\"\n\n| Subject | Attributive Adjuncts of Subject | Predicate | Object | Attributive Adjuncts of Object | Adverbial Adjuncts of Predicate |\n|---------|---------------------------------|-----------|--------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| tidings | 1.

The following examples show how a complex predicate (\u00a7\u00a7 391\u2014396) may be separated into its components:\n\n\"That hero was deservedly called the saviour of his country.\"\n\n| Subject with Adjuncts | Predicate | Adverbial Adjuncts of Predicate |\n|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|\n| that hero             | was called | the saviour of his country | deservedly |\n\n\"This misfortune will certainly make the poor man miserable for life.\"\n\n| Subject with Adjuncts | Predicate | Adverbial Adjuncts of Predicate |\n|-----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|\n| This misfortune       | will make | miserable the poor man certainly for life |\nComplete Analysis of a Sentence.\n\n504. The thorough analysis of a sentence is to be conducted in the following manner:\n\ni. Set down the subject of the sentence. (See \u00a7 384, &c., for a statement of what the subject may consist of.)\n\nii. Set down the words, phrases, or adjective clauses which may form attributive adjuncts of the subject. (See \u00a7 388 for a list of what these may consist of.)\n\niii. Set down the predicate verb. If the verb is one of incomplete predication, set down the complement of the predicate, and indicate that the verb and its complement make up the entire predicate (\u00a7\u00a7 391\u2013395).\n\niv. If the predicate be a transitive verb, set down the object of the verb (see \u00a7\u00a7 369, 397). If the predicate be a verb of incomplete predication followed by an infinitive mood, set down the object of the dependent infinitive (\u00a7 396).\n\nv. Set down those words, phrases, or adjective clauses which are in the attributive relation to the object of the predicate, or to the object of the complement of the predicate, if the latter be a verb in the infinitive mood (\u00a7 399).\n\nvi. Set down those words, phrases, or adverbial clauses which are in the adverbial relation to the predicate, or to the complement of the predicate. (See \u00a7 372 for a list of what these may consist of.)\n\n505. These various elements of the sentence may be arranged either in the mode adopted in the following examples, or in that indicated in the table at the end of the book.\n\nEXAMPLES OF THE ANALYSIS OF SIMPLE SENTENCES.\n\n506. \"Having ridden up to the spot, the enraged officer struck the unfortunate man dead with a single blow of his sword.\"\n\nSubject, 'officer.'\n\nAttributive adjuncts of subject,\n\n1.

'a' (\u00a7 362, 1).\n2. 'of weak health' (\u00a7 362, 4).\nPredicate,\nVerb of incomplete predication, 'is.'\nComplement of predicate, 'incapable' (\u00a7 393).\nAdverbial adjunct of the complement of the predicate, 'of the thorough enjoyment of life' (\u00a7 372, 4).\n\n516. \"He is believed to have perished.\"\n\nSubject, 'he.'\nPredicate,\nVerb of incomplete predication, 'is believed.'\nComplement of predicate, 'to have perished' (\u00a7 394).\n\n517. \"The bell sounds cracked.\"\n\nHere 'cracked' is the subjective complement of the verb 'sounds,' which (for the purpose in hand) is a verb of incomplete predication (\u00a7 391).\n\n518. \"He struck the man dead with a single blow.\"\n\nHere 'struck' is a verb of incomplete predication, and 'dead' is its (objective) complement. The object of the sentence is not to state that 'a blow was given,' but that 'the blow given was a mortal one' (\u00a7 391).\n\n519. \"They made Claudius emperor.\"\n\nSubject, 'they.'\nPredicate,\nVerb of incomplete predication, 'made.'\nComplement of predicate (factive object), 'emperor.'\nObject, 'Claudius.'\n\n520. \"We felt the ground tremble.\"\n\nSubject, 'we.'\nPredicate verb, 'felt.'\nObject (substantive with indirect predicate), 'the ground tremble.'\n\n521. \"Let us pray.\"\n\nSubject (understood), 'you.'\nPredicate verb, 'let.'\nObject (substantive pronoun with indirect predicate), 'us pray.'\n\n522. \"The duke will never grant this forfeiture to hold.\"\n\nThe object of the predicate 'will grant' is the Infinitive Phrase 'this forfeiture to hold,' made up of a noun 'forfeiture' with an indirect predicate 'to hold.'\n\n523. \"How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds makes ill deeds done.\"\n\nWe may treat the object of 'makes' as being the phrase 'ill deeds done,' where 'done' forms an indirect predicate to 'deeds.' It is also\npossible to make 'done' the complement of 'makes,' treating the latter as a verb of incomplete predication.\n\n524. \"I must not have you question me.\"\n\nHere the predicate is made up of the verb of incomplete predication 'must' and its complement 'have.' The object of the verb is the phrase 'you question me,' made up of 'you' and the indirect predicate 'question me,' attached to 'you' (\u00a7 397). In each of the following sentences the predicate is followed by an object of the same kind:\u2014\n\"I heard the man say so\"; \"Make the bells ring\"; \"Let the cattle be sold.\"\n\n525. \"It is pleasant to feel the sun's warmth.\"\n\nProvisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subject, 'to feel the sun's warmth.'\nPredicate, \\{ Verb of incomplete predication, 'is,' Complement (subjective), 'pleasant,' \\}\n\n526. \"It is time to go.\"\n\nSubject, 'it.'\nPredicate, \\{ Verb of incomplete predication, 'is,' Complement (noun with attributive adjunct. See \u00a7 362, 4), 'time to go' (i.e. 'time for going'). \\}\n\n527. \"It is time for the work to be finished.\"\n\nHere the complement of the predicate is the noun 'time' accompanied by an attributive adjunct made up of a preposition ('for') followed by the substantive phrase 'the work to be finished,' where 'to be finished' is the indirect predicate of 'the work' (\u00a7 317, note).\n\n528. \"It is shameful for such waste to be allowed.\"\n\nThe meaning of the sentence is 'That such waste should be allowed is shameful.' In the language of Chaucer's time this would be expressed by 'Such waste to be allowed is shameful,' or 'Such waste for to be allowed is shameful.' (See quotation from Wycliffe in \u00a7 387, note.) The sentence as it stands is based upon this last form, only the for has got slightly displaced.\n\nProvisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subject (substantive phrase with indirect predicate), 'for such waste to be allowed.'\nPredicate, \\{ Verb of incomplete predication, 'is,' Complement of predicate, 'shameful,' \\}\n\n529. \"I had rather * stay at home.\"\n\nSubject, 'I.'\nPredicate, \\{ Verb of incomplete predication, 'had,' Complement of predicate, 'rather,' \\}\nObject (infinitive phrase), 'stay at home.'\n\n* The explanation of this construction is not easy. It is frequently said that had is a corruption of would. If this were so, the difficulty would vanish; but there is good reason for believing that had is quite correct. The analogous construction with lief is unquestionably genuine. E.g., \"I had as lief not be, as live to be in awe of such a thing as I myself.\"\n530. \"And now, their mightiest quelled, the battle swerved, with many an inroad gored.\"\n\nSubject, 'battle.'\nAttributive adjuncts of subject,\n1. Article, 'the.'\n2. Participial phrase, 'with many an inroad gored.'\nPredicate, 'swerved.'\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate,\n1. Adverb, 'now.'\n2. Noun with attributive adjunct, in the nominative absolute, 'their mightiest quelled' (\u00a7 372, 5).\n\n531. It is often difficult to decide whether an adverbial adjunct should be taken as modifying the predicate, or as modifying some adjective.\n\nThus the sentence \"He is nearly ready\" may mean either \"He wants but little of being ready\" (just as when we say \"He nearly fainted,\" i.e., \"was within a little of fainting\"), or, \"He is in a state which approaches readiness.\" It matters little which explanation is adopted. In \"We were nearly killed,\" it is obviously best to take 'nearly' as modifying the predicate 'were killed.' In \"The work is half finished,\" the adverb 'half,' had better be taken with the adjective 'finished.'\n\n532. \"All but one were killed.\"\n\nHere the adverbial adjunct 'but one' (A.S. b\u016btan \u0101num) may be taken as modifying the adjective 'all' (\u00a7\u00a7 284, 372, 4), just as when we say 'nearly all.' At the same time, if we look at such a sentence as \"All except one were killed,\" we see that 'except one,' i.e., 'one being excepted' forms a nominative absolute which can hardly go with anything but the predicate. Similarly 'but one' might be treated as equivalent to 'leaving out one,' or 'if we leave out one.' It would then be an adverbial adjunct of the verb. Similar remarks apply to such a sentence as \"None but the brave deserves the fair.\" It may mean either\n\n(Shakespear, Julius Caesar, i. 2); as also that with the comparative liefer or liever. Thus we find in Chaucer: \"No never had I thing so lief, ne lieuer\" (Frank, Tace). This last example gives us a good clue to the construction. Liefer and lieuer are adjectives (not adverbs) agreeing with the object of the verb have, which in this construction is a verb of incomplete predication (Gr. 391, 395), so that liefer and lieuer, are its complements. (Compare the phrases lieb haben, and lieber ha. u. in German.) At present the use of the phrase to have liefer is restricted to cases where the object of the verb have is a verb in the infinitive mood, and the adjective liefer is qualified by the adverb as. The use of the comparative liefer or lieuer is obsolete. Now, in c'd English, we find rathe (early or ready); comp. rather, superl. rathest, used as adjectives. Milton speaks of the rathe primrose, and Spenser of the rather (i.e., earlier) lambs. Thus, by taking rather as an adjective (giving the idea of preference, which easily springs out of the radical notion of the word), we get in the phrase to have rather a construction precisely analogous to that in to have liefer (that is, to hold or regard as dear or desirable), or to have lieuer; have being a verb of incomplete predication, rather its complement, and the dependent infinitive the object of have. Let it be observed that I had sooner do so and so is bad English. Sooner is not an adjective. We must say, I would sooner, &c. I would rather is good English, because rather is an adverb as well as an adjective. In the phrase I had rather, the verb had is in the subjunctive mood.\n\nThe phrase 'you had better' cannot be explained in a similar way, because 'had' does not imply 'regarding' or 'considering.' The phrase has probably been assimilated to had rather or had lieuer through a false analogy either from 'you would better,' or 'you were better,' the remarkable personal form which replaced the impersonal construction 'it was better for you' (\u00a7 332, note).\n\"None outside the class brave deserves the fair,\" or \"Leaving out the class brave, none deserves the fair.\"\n\nIn such a sentence as \"Who but a madman would act thus?\" it is simpler to take 'but a madman' as modifying the subject \"who outside the class 'madman,'\" or \"who that is not a madman.\"*\n\n533. \"But being charged, we will be still by land\" (Antony and Cleopatra, iv. ii. i).\n\nHere 'but being charged' is a gerund preceded by the preposition but, and means 'leaving out the case of being charged.' The phrase forms an adverbial adjunct to the predicate verb will be. The sentence means, \"Unless we are attacked, we will make no movement by land.\"\n\n534. \"Whence, but from the author of all ill, could spring so deep a malice?\"\n\nHere an adverbial phrase instead of a substantive seems to follow the preposition but. The use of the gerund after but in the last example, however, suggests that the full phrase should be but springing from the author of all ill, that is, \"Without springing from the author of all ill,\" or, \"If we leave out the case of springing from the author of all ill, whence could so deep a malice spring?\" So, \"Matchless but with the Almighty,\" is \"Matchless but (being matched) with the Almighty.\"\u2020\n\nA similar explanation may be given of such phrases as, \"He never comes but when he is not wanted, i.e., 'but (coming) when he is not wanted;' so 'except when he is not wanted,' may be treated as 'coming when he is not wanted being excepted.' We do however, find adverbs standing for qualified substantives, and preceded by prepositions. Before now is equivalent to before the present time.\n\n535. \"He does everything but attend to his own business.\"\n\nHere the preposition 'but' with the infinitive 'attend' forms a limiting adjunct to 'everything' (\u00a7\u00a7 362, 4). Compare 'all but one,' \u00a7 532.\n\n536. \"He does nothing but play all day long.\"\n\nHere also 'but play' may be taken as a limiting adjunct of 'nothing' (\u00a7\u00a7 362, 4; 284).\n\n537. \"I have but one friend in the world.\"\n\nIn such sentences 'but' is usually treated as an adverb, meaning 'only.' The construction, however, has in fact arisen from the improper omission of a negative (note * p. 124). The sentence at full length would be \"I have not, but that I have (or but having, i.e., leaving out having) one friend, a friend in the world.\"\n\n* It is also possible (see note on \u00a7 291, p. 124), when 'but' comes after a negative, or a question which implies a negative answer, to treat but with the substantive that follows it as the residuum of an elliptical adverbial clause, but being a conjunction and the substantive the subject of a verb understood. Such a clause would, of course, form an adverbial adjunct of the predicate; \"but [that] a madman [would act thus], who would act thus\"? We might also fill up the ellipsis thus:\u2014\"Who, but (= unless) he be a madman, would act thus?\"\n\n\u2020 It will be found that this explanation is the key to a great many troublesome constructions in which 'but' plays a part. Thus, \"He was all but killed\" = \"he was all but (= except) being killed\"; \"He lived but a month\" = \"he lived [not] but [living] a month.\"\n538. \"I can but lament the result.\"\n\nHere also a negative has been improperly omitted. Indeed the sense is much the same if we say 'I cannot but lament the result.' The sentence may be explained in two ways, as being the residuum either of 'I cannot [do anything] but lament the result' (see \u00a7 535), or 'I cannot [do anything] but [that I can] lament the result' (see \u00a7 291 and note * p. 124).\n\nANALYSIS OF COMPLEX SENTENCES.\n\n539. A Substantive Clause (or Noun Sentence, as it is often called *) does the same sort of work in a sentence as a Noun. An Adjective Clause does the same sort of work as an Adjective. An Adverbial Clause does the same sort of work as an Adverb.\n\nIt follows that every subordinate clause is an integral part of the entire sentence, and has the same relation to some constituent part of the sentence as if it were a noun, an adjective, or an adverb.\n\nIn the analysis of a complex sentence this relation must be clearly indicated.\u2020\n\n540. When there are subordinate clauses, the analysis of the entire sentence must first be conducted as if for each subordinate clause we had some single word. When the relation of the several clauses to the main sentence and to each other has thus been clearly marked, the subordinate clauses are to be analysed on the same principles as simple sentences. Mere conjunctions (\u00a7 286) do not enter into the grammatical structure of the clauses which they introduce. No combination of words forms a dependent sentence without a finite verb expressed or understood.\n\n541. It will greatly conduce to the clearness of the analysis, if subordinate clauses are underlined in different ways, so as to indicate their nature. A thick line may denote a substantive clause, a thin line an adjective\n\n* Respecting the use of the terms Sentence and Clause see \u00a7 401, note.\n\u2020 It is a common practice in treatises on Analysis to ignore this. In dealing with such a sentence as \"The manager declared that the alarm which spread through the audience when the noise was heard, was quite groundless,\" we shall commonly find it split up, to begin with, into separate parts, thus:\u2014\n\nA. The manager declared.\nB. That the alarm was quite groundless.\nC. Which spread through the audience.\nD. When the noise was heard.\n\nWe shall then be told that B is \"a noun sentence to A; C is an adjective sentence to B; and D is an adverbial sentence to C.\" This is objectionable. To talk of one sentence, being 'a noun sentence to another' is simply meaningless. Whoever talks of a noun being \"a noun to a sentence.\" A noun has some definite function to fulfil in a sentence. It is a subject or an object, or in apposition to another noun, or governed by a preposition. A Substantive Clause (or noun sentence) has exactly the same function as a noun, and any system of analysis which ignores this, and shirks the trouble of explaining what that function is, is faulty and misleading. In the example given above, it is absolutely incorrect to say that the main sentence is 'The manager declared.' We have not got a complete sentence of any kind till the object of the verb 'declared' has been stated. Moreover, this practice leads beginners to suppose that a subordinate sentence is something which is tacked on to something else which is complete in itself. It certainly saves trouble; but if saving trouble is the main thing to be considered, that object will be most completely realized by leaving Analysis alone altogether.\nclause, and a dotted line an adverbial clause. If a subordinate clause contains others, the line proper to the containing clause must first be drawn under the whole, including what is contained, and then the contained clause must be further underlined in its own way. Then if a number be placed at the beginning of the line by which a subordinate clause is underscored, and the same number be attached by a bracket to the word to which the clause is related, being placed before the word (verb) when the clause is a subject, or after in other cases (thus 2. appears, or heard 3.), the relation of the parts of the sentence will be visible at a glance. Thus:\n\n\"I have heard 1.) that my brother has lost at play the money 2.)\n(1.) which was given 3.) to him that he might pay his debts.\"\n\nThis shows at a glance the degree of subordination of the various clauses, and the way in which they are built into the structure of the entire sentence. This method will be adopted in the examples that follow. Each clause, as it is reached in the analysis, may be denoted for subsequent reference by the number placed before the line under it. This underlining and numbering, however, is not essential to the Analysis.\n\nSENTENCES CONTAINING SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSES,\n\nI. A Substantive Clause as the Subject of a Verb.\n\n542. \"That you have wronged me (I doth appear in this.)\"\n\nSubject (substantive clause), 'that you have wronged me' (1).\nPredicate, 'doth appear.'\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, 'in this.'\n\nAnalysis of (1).\n\nSubject, 'you.'\nPredicate, 'have wronged.'\nObject, 'me.'\n\n543. \"It (2 is not true that he said that.)\"\n\nTemporary or provisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subj.

(1) \"I told him that he was mistaken.\" (2) \"I convinced him that he was mistaken.\"\n\nIn the first sentence him answers to the Latin dative case, and is an adverbial adjunct to the predicate told, the object of which is the sub-\n\n* It is also possible to treat 'so' as a demonstrative pronoun, the object of 'said' (\u00a7 150).\nstative clause \"that he was mistaken.\" In the second sentence him is the direct object of the verb, and the substantive clause (like the Latin Accusative of Limitation) forms an adverbial adjunct of the predicate (\u00a7 407). The first sentence is equivalent to \"He was mistaken. I told him that;\" the second to \"He was mistaken. I convinced him with respect to that.\"\n\nIII. A Substantive Clause in Apposition to a Noun.\n\n550. \"Who can want the thought how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father?\"\n\nAnalysis of Substantive Clause.\n\nProvisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subject, 'to kill their gracious father.'\nPredicate,\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{Verb of incomplete predication, 'was.'} \\\\\n\\text{Subjective complement, 'monstrous.'}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nAdverbial adjuncts,\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n1. \\text{(of verb)\u2014'for Malcolm and Donalbain.'} \\\\\n2. \\text{(of complement)\u2014'how.'}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\nOr the clause may be treated as springing out of the construction of an infinitive clause where Malcolm and Donalbain would be subjects of the indirect predicate 'for to kill' (\u00a7\u00a7 528 and 387, note):\n\nProvisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subject, 'for M. and D. to kill their gracious father.'\nPredicate,\n\\[\n\\begin{cases}\n\\text{Verb of incomplete predication, 'was.'} \\\\\n\\text{Complement, 'how monstrous.'}\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n551. \"The hope that I shall be successful sustains me.\"\n\nThe substantive clause 'that I shall be successful,' may be termed vaguely an enlargement of the subject hope, or it may be called (more exactly) an objective adjunct of the noun.*\n\nSuch sentences as \"There is no proof that he said so,\" \"There was a report that you were dead,\" should be dealt with in a similar manner.\n\nIV. A Substantive Clause after a Preposition.\n\n552. \"Spare me not for that I was his father Edward's son.\"\n\nThe construction is of the same type as 'Spare me not, for this reason,' the substantive after the preposition 'for' being a substantive clause. Consequently 'for that\u2014son' forms an adverbial adjunct (\u00a7 372, 4) to 'spare.'\n\n* An objective case follows a transitive verb, not because the verb is a declarative word, but because it denotes an action directed to some object. Gerunds (i.e. verbal nouns) have objects after them and other nouns implying a transitive action may have a substantive clause after them as an object. Such a clause may be termed an objective adjunct of the noun. (See \u00a7 406.)\n553. \"I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood\" (Matt. xxvii. 4).\n\nThe construction is of the type \"I have sinned in this,\" the place of the substantive pronoun this being taken by the substantive clause \"that I have betrayed,\" &c.\n\n554. \"I should have forgiven him, but 2) that he repeated the offence.\"\n\nHere we have a substantive clause preceded by the preposition but,* the whole phrase forming an adverbial adjunct of the predicate \"should have forgiven\" (\u00a7 372, 4).\n\n555. \"Never dream but that ill must come of ill.\"\n\nThe simplest mode of explaining this is to supply the word 'anything' as the object of 'dream.' \"Never dream [anything] but that ill must come of ill,\" where but with the substantive clause that follows it forms a limiting adjunct of anything conveying the sense \"Never dream anything excluding the case that ill must come of ill.\" Such a sentence as \"Who knows but that my father may consent?\" may be dealt with in the same way.\n\nSENTENCES CONTAINING ADJECTIVE CLAUSES.\n\n556. An Adjective Clause is always in the Attributive Relation to some noun or pronoun in the sentence of which it forms a part (\u00a7 468).\n\n557. \"The cohort 1) which had already crossed the river, quickly came to blows with the enemy.\"\n\nSubject, 'cohort.'\nAttributive adjuncts of subject,\nPredicate, 'came.'\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate,\nAnalysis of (1).\nSubject, 'which.'\nPredicate, 'had crossed.'\nObject, 'river.'\nAttributive adjunct to object, 'the.'\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, 'already.'\n\n* When 'that' is omitted, so that 'but' is left to supply its connective function, it is better to treat but as a conjunction (see \u00a7 291). The clause introduced by the 'but' then becomes adverbial.\n558. \"Give me that large book 2) that you have in your hand.\"\n\nHere the adjective clause, \"that you have in your hand,\" is in the attributive relation to the object 'book.' The relative that is the object of have.\n\n559. \"Give 3) me what you have in your hand.\"\n\nHere the adjective clause, \"what you have in your hand,\" is used substantively, that is, without having its antecedent that expressed. In the analysis we may either introduce the word that, the object of give, and set down the relative adjective clause as an attributive adjunct to it, or we may at once call the adjective clause the object of the verb 'give,' treating it as an adjective used substantively (\u00a7 98). Care must be taken not to confound adjective clauses like the above with substantive clauses beginning with the interrogative what, as \"Tell me what he said\" (\u00a7 410). (Compare \u00a7 548.)\n\n560. \"I return to view where once the cottage stood.\"\n\nHere 'where once the cottage stood' is an adjective clause qualifying the noun place understood, which forms the object of view.\n\n561. \"I have not from your eyes that show 4) of love as I was wont to have.\"\n\nSubject, 'I.'\nPredicate, 'have.'\nObject, 'show.'\nAttributive adjuncts of predicate,\n1. 'that.'\n2. 'of love.'\n3. (Adj. clause) 'As I was wont to have.'\n\nAnalysis of (4).\nSubject, 'I.'\nPredicate, { Verb of incomplete predication, 'was.'\nSubjective complement, 'wont to have.'\nObject, (Relative pronoun, see \u00a7 165) 'as.'\n\n562. \"His conduct is not such as I admire.\"\n\nHere as I admire must be taken as an adjective clause co-ordinate with such, and forming an attributive adjunct to the noun 'conduct' understood, which is the complement of the predicate 'is.' As * is a relative pronoun (\u00a7 165), and is the object of admire (\u00a7 411).\n\nThe Adjective Clause is sometimes weakened to an Adjective Phrase by the use of an infinitive mood instead of a finite verb, as \"There is no good for which to strive.\"\n\n* That as is only the strengthened form of so is shown by the use of swa, swo, or so in the older writers, as \"Grault me soche beryng so fallith to a king\" (Alis, 4624); \"gyld swic ne\u00e1t sw\u00e1 \u00fe\u00e6ron befalle\" (Legg. Aelf., B. 22).\nSENTENCES CONTAINING ADVERBIAL CLAUSES.\n\n563. An Adverbial Clause is always in the Adverbial Relation to a verb, adjective, or adverb in the sentence of which it forms a part.\n\nWhen such a clause begins with a subordinative conjunction, the conjunction does not enter into the construction of the clause. When the clause begins with a connective adverb, that adverb must have its own relation indicated in the analysis.*\n\n564. \"When, in Salamanca's cave,\n(2) Him listed his magic wand to wave,\nThe bells would ring 2) in Notre Dame.\"\n\nSubject (with attributive adjunct), 'the bells.'\nPredicate, 'would ring.'\n\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate.\n1. (Adverbial clause) 'when in Salamanca's\u2014wave' (2).\n2. 'in Notre Dame.\n\nAnalysis of (2).\n\nSubject (infinitive phrase), 'to wave his magic wand.'\nPredicate, 'listed,' i.e., 'pleased.'\nObject, 'him.'\n\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate.\n1. 'When.'\n2. 'in Salamanca's cave.'\n\n565. \"He ran so fast 3) that I could not overtake him.\"\n(3)\n\nSubject, 'he.'\nPredicate, 'ran.'\n\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate.\n1. 'fast,' qualified by\u20141. 'so.'\n2. 'that I could not overtake him' (3).\n\nAnalysis of (3).\n\n(Adverbial clause co-ordinate with 'so.')\nSubject, 'I.'\nPredicate, Verb of incomplete predication, 'could.'\nComplement, 'overtake.'\nObject, 'him.'\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, 'not.'\n\n[It seems natural, at first sight, to regard that in this sentence as the equivalent of the Latin connective adverb ut. But the construction in reality sprang out of the use of a substantive clause used in apposition to a demonstrative pronoun ('to that [degree]'), which was afterwards replaced by the adverb so. The word 'that' therefore is a mere\n\n* After, before, since, ere, till, while, for, &c., are conjunctions (\u00a7 290) when they are not followed by the conjunction 'that.' They introduce adverbial clauses, but have not themselves any adverbial force.\nconjunction, and the clause is co-ordinate with 'so,' and consequently adverbial in force.\n\n506. \"He spoke 4) loud that I might hear him.\"\n\nHere also 'that' is a mere conjunction, and the clause, 'that I might hear him,' which was once a substantive clause (as in the last instance), has become adverbial, modifying 'spoke.'\n\n507. \"Whatever the consequence may be, I shall speak 5) the truth.\"\n\nSubject, 'I.'\nPredicate, 'shall speak.'\nObject (with adjunct), 'the truth.'\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, Adverbial clause of concession, 'whatever the consequence may be' (5).\n\nAnalysis of (5).\nSubject (with attributive adjunct), 'the consequence.'\nPredicate, Verb of incomplete predication, 'may be.'\nSubjective complement, 'whatever.' (See \u00a7 512.)\n\n508. \"He is not so wise as he is witty.\"\n\nSubject, 'he.'\nPredicate, Verb of incomplete predication, 'is.'\nSubjective complement, 'wise.'\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, 'not.'\nCo-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of complement, 1. 'so;'\n2. 'as he is witty' (1).\n\nAnalysis of (1).\n(Adverbial clause qualifying 'wise,' and co-ordinate with 'so.')\nSubject, 'he.'\nPredicate, Verb of incomplete predication, 'is.'\nSubjective complement, 'witty.'\nAdverbial adjunct of complement, 'as.'\n\n509. \"He is as worthy a man as ever lived.\"\n\nHere 'as' and 'as ever lived' are co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'worthy.' The 'as' of the adverbial clause is here a relative pronoun (\u00a7 165), forming the subject of 'lived,' and representing in a compendious form \"a man of which degree of worthiness.\"\n\n570. \"Beware how you meddle with these matters.\"\n\nSubject (understood), 'you.'\nPredicate, Verb of incomplete predication, 'be.'\nComplement of predicate, 'ware.'\nAdverbial adjunct of complement, (Substantive clause used adverbially, \u00a7 549), 'how you meddle with these matters' (A).\n\nAnalysis of (A).\nSubject, 'you.'\nPredicate, 'meddle.'\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate, 1. 'how;'\n2. 'with these matters.'\n571. \"Thieves are not judged, but they are by to hear.\"\n\nWhen 'but' is not followed by the conjunction 'that,' it is better to regard it as being itself a conjunction (see \u00a7 297), so that the clause 'but (= unless) they are by to hear' is an adverbial clause, modifying the predicate 'are judged.'\n\nDeal in a similar way with such sentences as \"It shall go hard, but I will better the instruction\"; \"There's ne'er a villain living in all Denmark, but he's an arrant knave\"; \"There is no one but [he] believes the story,\" &c. (See these sentences discussed in the note p. 124.)\n\n572. Subordinate Clauses contained within clauses which are themselves subordinate.\n\nThe lines drawn under the clauses show at a glance the containing and contained clauses, and indicate to what class they belong.\n\n573. \"He inferred 1) from this that the opinion of the judge was 2) that the prisoner was guilty.\"\n\n(1)\n\nSubject, 'he.'\nPredicate, 'inferred.'\nObject, { Substantive clause, 'That the opinion of the judge was that the prisoner was guilty' (1).\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, 'from this' (\u00a7 370, 2).\n\nAnalysis of (1).\nSubject, 'opinion.'\nAttributive adjuncts { 1.

Its construction is precisely parallel to that of the clause 'you think [that] that man is he'; it contains a secondary substantive clause, the object of 'think,' namely, 'who that man is.' (Compare \u00a7 512.)\n\n575. \"If it were 3) done when 'tis done, then it (1 were 2) well it were done quickly.\"\n\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\nProvisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subject (substantive clause), '[that] it were done quickly' (1).\nPredicate, 'were.'\nANALYSIS OF SENTENCES.\n\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate:\n\n1.

Ordinary sentences of this kind require no special discussion. All that has to be done is to analyse each of the co-ordinate clauses separately, omitting the conjunctions by which they are connected, but inserting not if the conjunctions are neither\u2014nor.\n\n577. There is, however, one class of co-ordinate clauses which require care, namely, those in which the relative pronoun has a continuative force. (See \u00a7 412.)\n\n578. \"At last it chaunced this proud Sarazin\nTo meete me wand'ring; who perforce me led\nWith him away but never yet could win.\"\n\nThis sentence must first be split up into the three co-ordinate sentences.\n(A). \"At last it chaunced this proud Sarazin to meete me wand'ring.\"\n(B). \"Who perforce me led with him away.\"\n(C). \"[Who] never yet could win [me].\n\nAnalysis of (A).\nProvisional subject, 'it.'\nReal subject (infinitive phrase), { 'this proud Sarazin* to meete me wand'ring.'\nPredicate, 'chaunced.'\nAdverbial adjunct of predicate, 'at last.'\n\n* It is also possible to take 'this proud Sarazin' as an indirect object of 'chaunced.' Compare \"me chaunced of a knight encountered be\" (Spenser).\nThe analysis of (B) and (C) presents no difficulty. They are principal clauses co-ordinate with (A); who being continuative in its force.\n\n579. \"This is now our doom, which if we can sustain and bear, our supreme foe in time may much remit his anger.\"\n\nFirst split this into the following:\n\n(A). \"This is now our doom,\"\n(B). \"Which if we can sustain and bear, our supreme foe in time may much remit 1) his anger.\"\n\nAnalysis of (B).\n\nSubject (with adjunct), 'our supreme foe.'\nPredicate, {Verb of incomplete predication, 'may.'\n{Infinitive complement, 'remit.'\nObject (with adjunct), 'his anger.'\nAdverbial adjuncts of predicate,\n1. (Adverbial clause) 'which \u2014\u2014\nand bear' (1).\n2. 'in time.'\n3. 'much.'\n\nAnalysis of (1).\n\nSubject, 'we.'\nPredicate, {Verb of incomplete predication, 'can.'\n{Infinitive complement, 'sustain and bear.'\nObject, 'which.'\n\nSubordinate Compound Clauses.\n\n580. These present no difficulty when they are expressed at full length. Thus: \"He told me that the dyke had burst and that the river was flooding the country.\" Here we simply have a compound object (\u00a7 597). In analysis we should put after the predicate.\n\nObject (compound),\n1. 'That the dyke had burst.'\n2. 'That the river was flooding the country.'\n\n581. But the greater number of sentences with compound subordinate clauses belong to the class of contracted sentences.\n\nCONTRACTED SENTENCES.\n\n582. Before a contracted sentence (\u00a7 449) is analysed, the parts omitted must be expressed at full length.\n\n583. \"We perceive that these things not only did not happen, but could not have happened?\" In full\u2014\n\n[(A) 'We perceive that these things not only did not happen.'\n[(B) 'We perceive that these things could not have happened.'\n584. \"Many instances were related of wise forethought, or firm action, or acute reply on his part, both in the senate and in the forum.\" In full\u2014\n\n[(A) 'Many instances were related of wise forethought on his part in the senate.']\n[(B) 'Many instances were related of wise forethought on his part in the forum.']\n[(C) 'Many instances were related of firm action on his part in the senate.']\n[(D) 'Many instances were related of firm action on his part in the forum.']\n[(E) 'Many instances were related of acute reply on his part in the senate.']\n[(F) 'Many instances were related of acute reply on his part in the forum.']\n\n585. \"Every assertion is either true or false, either wholly or in part.\" In full\u2014\n\n[(A) 'Every assertion is true wholly.']\n[(B) 'Every assertion is true in part.']\n[(C) 'Every assertion is false wholly.']\n[(D) 'Every assertion is false in part.']\n\n586. When co-ordinate sentences or clauses are connected by neither, nor, the simple negative not may be substituted for each conjunction in the analysis, the conjunctive portion of the words being omitted.\n\n\"The man who neither reverences nobleness nor loves goodness is hateful.\" In full\u2014\n\n[(A) 'The man who reverences not nobleness is hateful.']\n[(B) 'The man who loves not goodness is hateful.']\n\n587. \"Whether he succeed or fail, it will not matter to me.\" In full\u2014\n\n[(A) 'If he succeed, it will not matter to me.']\n[(B) 'If he fail, it will not matter to me.']\n\n588. \"Tell me whether this is true or not.\" In full\u2014\n\n[(A) 'Tell me whether this is true.']\n[(B) 'Tell me whether this is not true.']\n\nHere whether is interrogative, introducing a substantive clause, the object of 'tell.'\n\nELLIPTICAL SENTENCES.\n\n589. An elliptical sentence is one in which something is omitted which is essential to the complete construction of the sentence, but which is readily supplied in thought, without being expressed in words.\nIn elliptical sentences that which is omitted is not common to two or more clauses.\n\nRelative pronouns and relative adverbs are sometimes omitted.\n\n590. \"He left the day I arrived.\"\n\nIn full\u2014\"He left the day that (or on which) I arrived.\" In this sentence the day is in the adverbial relation to left; that (or on which) is in the adverbial relation to arrived; and the dependent clause that I arrived is an adjective clause qualifying day.\n\n591. The commonest (and the most troublesome) elliptical sentences are those which begin with as and than. In analysing them care must be taken to ascertain what the predicate really is in the dependent clause, and what word the adverb as qualifies.\n\n592. \"He is as tall as I am.\" * In full\u2014\"He is as tall as I am tall.\"\n\nIf we ask what the predicate in the dependent clause is (or what is predicated of me), the answer is \"being tall;\" and moreover not being tall simply, but being tall in a certain degree, which degree is denoted by the relative adverb as, which qualifies tall (understood) in the adverbial clause, just as the demonstrative adverb as qualifies tall in the main clause.\n\nThe adverbial clause beginning with as is always co-ordinate with the preceding demonstrative as or so, and modifies (adverbially) the same word.\n\nSubject, 'He.'\nPredicate, { Verb of incomplete predication, 'is.'\n{ Subjective complement, 'tall.'\nCo-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of complement of predicate, { 1. 'as.'\n{ 2. 'as I am [tall]' (A).\n\nAnalysis of (A).\nSubject, 'I.'\nPredicate, { Verb of incomplete predication, 'am.'\n{ Complement of predicate, 'tall.'\nAdverbial adjunct of complement, 'as.'\n\n593. We must deal in a similar manner with such sentences as:\u2014\n\n\"He has not written so much 1) as I have [written much].\"\n\n(1)\n\n\"He has lived as many 2) years as you have lived [many] months.\"\n\n(2)\n\n\"He does not write so well 3) as you [write well].\"\n\n(3)\n\n\"I would as soon 4) die as [I would soon] suffer that.\"\n\n(4)\n\n* It may be taken as a general rule that after as we must supply a word of the same kind of meaning as the word qualified by the simple or demonstrative adverb in the main clause.\n\" He looks 5) as [he would] look 6) if he knew me.\"\n\n(5)...........................................................................................................\n\n(6)...........................................................................................................\n\n\"I cannot give you so much 7) as five pounds [are much].\"\n\n(7)...........................................................................................................\n\n\"He cannot [do] so much 8) as [to] read [is much].\"\n\n(8)...........................................................................................................\n\n\"I saw John as well as [I saw] Thomas [well].\"\n\n\"That is as much as [it would be much] to say.\"\n\n594. When 'as' answers to 'such' (as in 'We are such stuff as dreams are made of') it is not an adverb, but the relative pronoun (\u00a7 165). But in such a sentence as:\n\n\"I am not such a fool as [I should be a fool] to believe that,\"\n\nthe clause beginning with 'as' is an adverbial clause, modifying such.\n\n595. \"He is taller 1) than I am.\" In full\u2014\"He is taller than I am tall.\"\n\nHere the adverbial clause modifies the predicate in the main sentence. Than has so completely lost its original sense of 'when,' that it may now be treated as a mere conjunction. The clause beginning with than is always an adverbial adjunct of the word in the comparative degree in the main clause.\n\n596. Deal in a similar manner with such sentences as the following:\u2014\n\n\"He is more 1) industrious than clever.\" In full\u2014 \"He is more industrious than he is clever.\"\n\n\"He has written more 2) letters than you [have written many letters].\"\n\n(2)...........................................................................................................\n\n\"He is richer 3) than you suppose 4) [that he is rich].\"\n\n(3)...........................................................................................................\n\n(4)...........................................................................................................\n\n\"Our habits are costlier than Lucullus wore [costly habits].\"\n\nThat is, \"taking Lucullus's wearing of costly habits as a standard of comparison, our habits are costlier.\"\n\n\"I had rather * die than [I would] suffer that.\"\u2020\n\n597. \"I agree with you in so far as you adopt his opinion.\"\n\nThe sense of this is, 'In how far you adopt his opinion, in so far I agree with you.' 'As' (strictly speaking) qualifies far understood, but its reference to the manner or circumstances of an action may\n\n* See \u00a7 599.\n\u2020 It is unnecessary (though not inaccurate) to supply the positive 'soon' in the adverbial clause.\nbe interpreted in such a general sense, that 'as' may be taken as representing 'as far.' This will render it unnecessary actually to supply the word 'far.' Take 'in so far' and 'as you adopt his opinion' as co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'agree.' Deal similarly with the sentence 'He knows that inasmuch as I have told him.' Take 'inasmuch' and 'as I have told him' as co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'knows.'\n\n598. \"I cannot stay longer than a month [is long].\"\n\nThat is, 'taking the length of a month as the standard of comparison, I cannot stay longer.' Deal in a similar way with \"I cannot give you more than five pounds [are much]\"; \"More than twenty men [are many] were killed.\"\n\n599. \"He would have perished out [it had been] for me.\"\n\nHere but has the sense of 'unless' (\u00a7 293).\n\n\"As [the matter stands] for me, I care nothing about that.\"\n\nIt is also possible to treat this 'as' as a relative pronoun, the subject of some verb understood, so that the phrase answers to the Latin quod ad me attinet.\n\n600. Some ellipses are produced by stopping short in the course of a sentence, as \"To tell you the truth, [I must say] I don't know what to do.\" Sometimes the broken sentence must be left incomplete, as \"Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,\" &c. = 'Were he my brother\u2014I will not (nay) say that,' I will say \"Were he my kingdom's heir,\" &c.\n\nPUNCTUATION.\n\n601. In speaking, the words of a sentence, especially if it be a complex one, are not uttered consecutively without any break. Certain pauses are made to mark more clearly the way in which the words of the sentence are grouped together.\n\nIn writing, these pauses are represented by marks called stops or points. Punctuation (derived from the Latin punctum, a point) means \"the right mode of putting in points or stops.\"\n\nThe stops made use of are\u20141. The Comma (,). 2. The Semicolon (;). 3. The Colon (:). 4. The Full Stop or Period (.).* As it is impossible to lay down perfectly exact rules for the introduction of pauses in speaking, so it will be found that in many cases the best writers are not agreed as to the use of stops in writing. All that can be done is to lay down the most general principles.\n\n602. The Full Stop is used at the end of a complete and independent sentence, but not at the end of a sentence which is followed by another collateral sentence (\u00a7 445).\n\n* These words (properly speaking) are names not of the stops, but of the portions of sentences which they mark off. Comma means a clause; Colon, a limb or member of a sentence; Semicolon, a half Colon; Period, a complete sentence.\n603. The Colon and Semicolon are only placed between sentences which are grammatically complete, not between the various portions of either simple or complex sentences \u00a7400). The colon is placed between sentences which are grammatically independent, but sufficiently connected in sense to make it undesirable that there should be a complete break between them. Thus: \"The Chief must be Colonel; his uncle or his brother must be Major; the tacksmen must be the Captains\" (Macaulay). \"Nothing else could have united her people; nothing else could have endangered or interrupted our commerce\" (Landor). But in similar cases many writers only use the semicolon; no exact rule can be given.\n\nA colon (with or without a dash after it) is often put before a quotation which is not immediately dependent on a verb; as: 'On his tombstone was this inscription:\u2014\"Here lies an honest man.\"'\n\n604. The semicolon is commonly placed between the co-ordinate members of a compound sentence, when they are connected by and, but, or nor; as: \"Time would thus be gained; and the royalists might be able to execute their old project\" (Macaulay). It is also inserted when three or more co-ordinate sentences are united collaterally (\u00a7445), with a conjunction before the last; as: \"A battering-ram was invented, of light construction and powerful effect; it was transported and worked by the hands of forty soldiers; and as the stones were loosened by its repeated strokes, they were torn with long iron hooks from the walls\" (Gibbon). When the co-ordinate sentences are short and closely connected in meaning, commas are placed between them, or such parts of them as remain after contraction (\u00a7449), as: 'I ran after him, but could not catch him.' Sometimes even commas are unnecessary, as: \"He reads and writes incessantly.\" \"He learns neither Latin nor Greek.\" \"He struck and killed his brother.\" \"Either you or I must leave the room.\"\n\n605. In a simple or complex sentence commas should be inserted whenever, in reading or speaking, short pauses would be made to show more clearly the way in which the words are grouped together. It is impossible to lay down hard and fast rules. When no pause is required in reading, no comma is necessary in writing. The following directions may be of service:\n\nIn simple sentences the comma is inserted\u2014\n\n1. Before the main verb, when the subject is accompanied by an attributive adjunct which, with its adjuncts, forms a combination of words of considerable length. As, \"The injustice of the sentence pronounced upon this wise and virtuous man, is evident.\" But if the adjunct is expressed briefly, the comma is not used; as, \"The injustice of the sentence is evident.\"\n\n2. Before and after any participle (not used as a mere qualitative adjective) or participial phrase; as, \"The man, having slipped, fell over the cliff.\" \"The general, having rallied his soldiers, led them forwards.\" \"Undaunted, he still struggled...\"\non.\" \"All night the dreadless angel, unpursued, through heaven's wide champaign winged his glorious way.\"\n\n3. Before and after any attributive adjunct to the subject which consists of an adjective or noun in apposition, when these are accompanied by other words standing to them in the attributive, objective, or adverbial relation. E.g., \"Bacon, the illustrious author of the 'Novum Organum,' declared,\" &c. \"The soldier, afraid of the consequences of his insubordination, deserted.\"\n\n4. Before or after a phrase or quotation which is either the subject or the object of a verb. Thus: \"Nelson's watchword was, 'England expects every man to do his duty.'\" \"He said to His disciples, 'Watch and pray.'\" (See \u00a7 603.)\n\n5. When several substantives, enumerated successively without having the conjunction and placed between them, have the same relation to some other word in the sentence, forming either the compound subject or the compound object of a verb, or coming after a preposition, they must be separated by commas. Thus: \"John, William, James and Henry took a walk together.\" \"He lost lands, money, reputation and friends.\" Adjectives and adverbs co-ordinately related to the same noun, or to the same verb or adjective, and not connected by and, should be separated by commas; as, \"He was a wealthy, prudent, active and philanthropic citizen.\" \"He wrote his exercise neatly, quickly and correctly.\"\n\n6. A comma is inserted after an adverbial phrase consisting of a noun (with its adjuncts) used absolutely, or an infinitive mood (preceded by to) implying purpose, when it precedes the verb or its subject. As, \"To conclude, I will only say,\" &c. \"The man being dead, his heirs took possession of his estate.\"\n\n7. Other complex adverbial phrases also are frequently followed by commas when they precede the subject of the sentence; as, \"By studying diligently for five hours a day, he mastered the language in six months.\" Such phrases should be both preceded and followed by commas when they come between the subject and the verb, and modify not the verb simply, but the entire assertion; as, \"The foolish man, in defiance of all advice, persisted in his project.\" \"This undertaking, therefore, was abandoned.\" But a single adverb or a short adverbial phrase which simply modifies the verb need not be thus marked off; as, \"The man in vain protested his innocence.\" However, when it is the representative of an elliptical clause, must be preceded and followed by commas; as, \"The man, however, escaped.\"\n\n8. Nouns used in the vocative (or nominative of appellation) are separated by commas from the rest of the sentence; as, \"John, shut the door,\" \"I said, Sir, that I had not done that.\"\n\n808. In complex sentences the following rules may be observed:\u2014\n1. A substantive clause used as the subject of a verb should be followed by a comma. Thus: \"That the accused is innocent of the crime imputed to him, admits of demonstration.\" \"How we are ever to get there, is the question.\"\n\nIf such a clause follow the verb, a comma does not usually precede the substantive clause. As, \"It is of great importance that this should be rightly understood.\"\n\nA substantive clause which is the object of a verb is not generally preceded by a comma. Thus: \"He acknowledged that he had done this.\" \"Tell me how you are.\"\n\n2. An adjective clause is not separated by a comma from the noun which it qualifies when it is an essential part of the designation of the thing signified; that is, when the thing or person signified is not sufficiently indicated by the antecedent noun. Thus: \"The man who told me this stands here.\" \"I do not see the objects that you are pointing out.\"\n\nBut if the designation of the person or thing meant is complete without the relative sentence, so that the latter only extends and defines that designation, being continuative, and not restrictive (\u00a7 412), then a comma must be introduced. Thus: \"We are studying the reign of William Rufus, who succeeded his father A.D. 1087.\" \"I will report this to my father, who is waiting to hear the news.\"\n\nAdverbial clauses which precede the verb that they modify should be marked off by commas. Thus: \"When you have finished your work, tell me.\" \"Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\" But an adverbial clause need not be preceded by a comma when it comes after the verb that it modifies; as, \"I will wait till I hear from you\"; \"I did not see him when he called\"; \"He ran away as soon as I saw him.\"\n\n607. Besides the stops, some other signs are employed in writing.\n\n608. A note of interrogation (?) must be placed at the end of all direct questions, but not after indirect questions. Thus: \"Have you written your letter?\" But: \"He asked me whether I had written my letter.\"\n\n609. The note of admiration or exclamation (!) is placed after interjections, exclamations, and after nouns and pronouns used in addresses, when particular stress is to be laid upon them. This mark is also frequently placed at the end of a sentence which contains an invocation.\n\n610. The parenthesis () is used to enclose a clause or part of a clause, which does not enter into the construction of the main sentence, but is merely introduced by the way. Words enclosed within a parenthesis do not require to be separated from the rest of the sentence by any other stop.\n\n611. Double or single inverted commas \u2018\u2014\u2019 or \u201c\u2014\u201d, are used to mark quotations.\nAPPENDIX.\n\nWORDS BELONGING TO THE TEUTONIC STOCK OF ENGLISH.\n\n[Nothing more is attempted here than a brief classification, with a few examples, not too numerous to be retained in the memory.]\n\nA.

These are generally easy to recognize. No one with any knowledge of Latin would suppose for a moment that such words as bind, climb, corn, crop, deaf, dim, east, end, fall, find, full, grim, grind, heap, help, horse, hunt, land, leaf, melt, nest, north, south, oft, ram, sand, send, sing, sit, spill, spring, step, sting, stream, swing, timber, turf, web, word, thing, thorn, were of Latin or Greek origin.\nOn comparing the earlier forms of English words with those now current, the following changes (among others) present themselves:\n\n1. The vowel y of A.S. and early English gives place to i, as dynt dint; hlystan listen; fyran thirst; fyr fire; bryd bride.\n\n2. A.S. \u00e6 appears as ea (r\u00e6dan read); as i (r\u00e6del riddle); as e (were were); or as eo and ea (slepan sleep; speac speech; halan heal).\n\n3. Broken vowel sounds in A.S. tend to become homogeneous in modern English. Thus \u00e9 appears as i (heah high); as e, ee, or ea (e\u00e1c eke, ceace cheek, leaf leaf); as o or ea (bealcian belch, earm arm, feallan fall, fealdan fold): eo or eo appears as e, \u00e9, or o (deofol devil, heofon heaven, heorot hart, heorte heart, feor fur), as le (le\u00f3f lif, feond fiend, th\u00e9of thief), as eo (tre\u00f3 tree; beo bix; deor deer, cre\u00f3pan creep), as I (meolc milk, se\u00f3c sick).\n\n4. A.S. a appears as o or oa (anlic anly, h\u00e1lig holy, b\u00e1n bone, hl\u00e1fs loaf, f\u00e1m foam); as aw (ganian yawm); as \u00f0 (w\u00e1t wot, wedl\u00e1cc wedlock).\n\n5. Long o takes the sound of u (oo), or \u00f0 (t\u00f3 to; d\u00f3n do; m\u00f3na moon; m\u00f3\u00f0 mother, &c.).\n\n6. A.S. e appears as eo (cw\u00e9n queen, s\u00e9can seek, t\u00e9\u00f0 teeth).\n\n7. All sorts of vowel sounds in unaccented syllables get to be represented by \u00e9. (See e.g., the inflexions of the time of Chaucer.) Compare the French poird = perry, soudain = sudden, &c.\n\n8. A.S. c (= k) appears as ch or tch (cild child; ceace cheek; cyrice church; speac speech; bealcian belch; maca companion) match; c\u00e9ap cheap; compa champion; ceorl churl; streccan stretch; pic pitch); but not uniformly (compare drinck and drench, stink and stench, seek and beseech, pick and pitch; and the words cyning king; ceol keel; cyssan kiss, &c.).\n\n9. A.S. cg appears as dge (hrycg ridge; brycg bridge; mycg midge; ecg edge). This softening of the guttural to ch or soft g is due to French influence, but the sounds are not those represented in French by ch and soft g; hence the frequent insertion of l or d.\n\n10. A.S. g or og often disappears, or is replaced by w or y (bycgan buy; secgan say; fleogan fly; d\u00e6g day; morgen morrow; dag\u00e1n dawn; lagu law; gnagan gnaw; hagol hail; nigon nine; feagr fair; m\u00e6gen main; druncenian drown; isgicel ticel); especially at the end of a word (bodig body; dysig dizzy; hunig honey, &c.). Also at the beginning (gear year; gese yes; geond yon; geong young; gildan yield; gelic like; genoh enough; gif if, &c.).\n\n11. The guttural hg or gh became sounded (and sometimes written) as f (pweorg dwarf; leahtor laughter; compare cotgh and clough). In early English we find doftyr (daughter); caufle (caught); thof (though); thruff (through).\n\n12. Guttural h appears as k, g, or gh (cniht knight; Pihtas Picts; leoth light; eahta eight, &c.). Initial h often disappears (as hit it; hwing wing; hnecca neck; hlystan listen, &c.).\n13. A.S. *o* appears as *ah* (scild shield; scr\u00fad shroua; sceal shall; secan shake; esc ash; fl\u00e6sc flesh).\n\n14. *S* has replaced *th* (as ea\u00f0e ease; has for hath, &c.).\n\n15. *D*, *t*, and *th* are often interchanged. Compare deck and thatch; burthen and burden; bud and button (Fr. bouton); drill, tril (nostril) and thrill, &c.\n\n16. *L* sometimes replaces *r*. Compare Hal and Harry; Dolly and Dorothy; Sally and Sarah. (See \u00a7 341.) Sometimes it replaces *n*, as in luncheon for nuncheon.\n\n17. *M* replaces *n* final, as in venom (venin), ransom (ran\u00e7on), &c., or springs out of *n* when followed by *b* or *f*, as Dumbarton (Dun Breton); hamper (hanaper); Pomfret (Pontefract).\n\n18. Letters frequently disappear. Thus:\n\n*L* before a guttural or *s* (\u00e6lc each; hwile which; als as).\n\n*N* has been lost from the words us (German uns), tooth (Gothic tunthus, Lat. dentem), tithe (tenth), eleven (endlufon), goose (gans), other (Goth. anthar), mouth (German mund), could = cu\u00f0e (cunnan), five (German f\u00fcnf, Gr. \u03c0\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5), Thursday (Thunresdag), &c. *N* final has disappeared from my (mine), ago (agone), no (none), &c. Similarly fro = from.\n\n*R* has vanished from several words, as speak (sprecan), pin (A.S. preon, Scotch prin, Old English preen), Fanny (Frances), cockade (cocard), palsy (paralysis).\n\n*T* and *d* and *th* have disappeared from anvil (anfilt), Benedick (Benedict), gospel (godspell), answer (andswarian), best (betst), Essex (East Saxons), Norman (Northman), worship (worthship), &c.\n\n*F* has disappeared from head (h\u00e9afod), woman (wifman), had (h\u00e6fde), lord (hl\u00e1ford), &c.\n\n19. Initial syllables tend to disappear. See \u00a7 341 and compare reeve, gerefa; lone, alone (all one); board, aboard, &c.\n\n20. Internal syllables disappear. Compare lark, laverock; last, latest; since, sithens; Monday, Monandeg; fortnight, fourteennight; damsel, demoiselle; comrade, camarade.\n\n21. The loss of final syllables (especially inflexions) is too common to need special notice.\n\n22. Letters sometimes intrude into words where they are not radical. *B* or *p* and *d* or *t* appear after *m* and *n* respectively, as in thumb, lamb, dumb, limb, number, glimpse (from gleam), sempstress (seam), empty (emtig), embers (\u00e6myrie), &c., thunder (punor), kindred (kinrede), antent (on-efn or on-emn), parchment (parchemin), ancient (ancien from antiquanus), tyrant (tyran), romaunt (roman), fond (fon = a fool), expound (expono), sound (son), lend (lenan), drounded (for drowned), &c. *T* has also crept into glisten (glisian), tapestry (tapissarie), &c., and *d* into alderliefest = allertliefest. In advance (avancer) the *d* is an error.\n\n*G* has intruded into foreign, sovereign, impregnable (prendre).\n\n*T* is often a phonetic offgrowth of *s*, as in against, betwixt, behest (behes), &c.\n\n*S* has appeared at the beginning of various words, as smell, scratch, scrawl,\nsneeze, smash, &c., and has intruded into island (ealand or igland), aisle (aile), demesne (dominium).\n\nN appears at the beginning of some words, as Noll (Oliver), Nancy (Anne), Nell (Ellen), nuncle (uncle), nowche (owche), newt (efte), and has intruded into nightingale (nightegale), messenger, ensample, passenger. (Compare \u00a7 341.)\n\nR has intruded in bridegroom (guma), vagrant (vagare), hoarse (A S. h\u00e1s), &c. (See \u00a7 341.)\n\n23. Two consonants, or a consonant and a vowel, often change places (metathesis). Compare bright and beorht; wright and wyrrhta; brid and bird; thresh and perscan; fresh and fersc, &c.\n\n24. Some words of Teutonic origin have assumed an initial g in passing through French. Compare guile and wile; guard and ward; Guillaume and William.\n\n25. Consonants get assimilated through juxtaposition. Then we get lammas from hlafmesse; gammer from godmother; gaffer from godfather.\n\nB.

Most words of three or more syllables are of classical origin, and a very large number of those of two syllables, the exceptions being mostly words formed by English suffixes from monosyllabic roots. Most monosyllabic words in English are of Teutonic origin, but many are derived from Latin and Greek, the greater part having come to us through French. The following belong to this class:\u2014\n\n| ace (as) | cape (caput) | desk | dish | glaive (gladius) |\n|---------|--------------|------|------|-----------------|\n| age (aetaticum), Old Fr. \u00e9adge | chafe (calefacere) | dose (\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2) | doubt (dubitare) | gourd (cucurbita) |\n| aid (adjutum) | chain (catena) | dress (dirigere) | due (debitum) | grant (credentare) |\n| aim (aestimare) | chair (cathedra) | duke (dux) | fair (feria) | grease (crassus) |\n| alms (\u03b5\u03bb\u03b5\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7) | chalk (calx) | faith (fides) | fay (fata) | grief (gravis) |\n| arch (arcus) | chance (cadentia) | feat (factum) | feign (fingere) | host (hospit-) |\n| aunt (amita) | charm (carmen) | fierce (ferus) | foil (folium) | hulk (\u03ac\u03bb\u03ba\u03b1\u03c2) |\n| balm (balsamum) | chase (captiare) | force (fortis) | forge (fabrica) | inch (uncia) |\n| base (bassus) | chief (caput) | fount (fons) | frown (frons) | jaw (gabata) |\n| beast (bestia) | coin (cuneus) | found (fundere) | fruit (fructus) | jest (gestum) |\n| beef (boves) | cork (cortex) | frail (fragilis) | fry (frigere) | jet (jactum) |\n| blame (blasphemia) | couch (collocare) | frown (frons) | lounge (longus) | join (jungo) |\n| boil (bullire) | count (comes) | force (fortis) | mace (massa) | joy (gaudium) |\n| boon (bonus) | count (computare) | found (fundere) | mail, armour (macula, mesh) | lace (laqueus) |\n| brace (brachium) | cost (constare) | fount (fons) | male (masculus) | lease (laxare) |\n| brief (brevis) | coy (quietus) | frail (fragilis) | lounge (longus) | liege (legius) |\n| bull (bulla) | cue (cauda) | frown (frons) | mace (massa) | lounge (longus) |\n| cage* (cavea) | cull (colligere) | fruit (fructus) | mail, armour (macula, mesh) | mace (massa) |\n| car | dame (domina) | fry (frigere) | mount (mons) |\n\n* Note the curious change of b, p, or v, between vowels into soft g.

In tracing the variations which such words assume, a very remarkable relation between the consonants is found, which is commonly known as 'Grimm's Law.'\n\nIf the same roots or the same words exist (1) in Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, &c., (2) in Gothic or the Low German dialects, and (3) in Old High German, then\n\nI. When the first class have an aspirate the second have the corresponding soft check (i.e. flat or middle mute), the third the corresponding hard check (i.e. sharp or thin mute). II. When the first class have a soft check (flat or middle mute), we find the corresponding hard check (sharp or thin mute) in the second class, and the corresponding aspirate in the third. III. When the first class have a hard consonant (sharp or thin mute), the second have the aspirate, and the third the soft check (flat or middle mute). In this third section of the rule, however, the law holds good for Old High German only as regards the dental series of mutes, the middle (or flat) guttural being generally replaced by h, and the middle (or flat) labial by f.*\n\nThe three branches of the law given above may be easily remembered in the following way:\u2014Take a circular disc of cardboard, and mark on it three radii, inclined each to each at an angle of 120\u00b0. Mark these three radii (1), (2), and (3), corresponding respectively to the three classes of languages above referred to\u2014(1) denoting Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, &c.; (2) denoting Gothic and Low German dialects (including English); and (3) denoting Old High German. Place the disc on a sheet of paper, and write Aspirate opposite the\n\n* The above is the law in its general form. It is subject to special modifications and exceptions.\nend of radius (1), Middle or Flat opposite the end of radius (2), and Thin or Sharp opposite the end of radius (3). The disc may be shifted, so that radius (1), instead of pointing to Aspirate, may point to the other two classes of mutes in succession. In each position of the disc, each radius will point to the class of mutes that may be expected to characterize any word that is common to all three classes of languages, provided that one radius points to the class of mutes which the word in question exhibits in that group of languages which that radius represents.\n\nThe law may also be easily recollected in the following way. It is obvious that the arrangement of three balls in three holes is settled as soon as two balls have been arranged in two holes. Similarly if we know how two of the three classes of mutes are apportioned to two of the three classes of languages, the assignment of the third follows as a matter of course. If we take Latin as representing the Sanskrit\u2014Greek\u2014Latin group, and English as representing the Low German group, the little formula \"duo fratres, two brothers,\" will give us all that we want. The d of duo and the t of two remind us that a flat (or middle) mute in the Latin class corresponds to a sharp (or thin) mute in the English class. The f of fratres and the b of brothers remind us that an aspirate in the Latin class answers to a flat mute in the English class. The t of fratres and the th of brothers remind us that a sharp (or thin) mute in the Latin class answers to an aspirate in the English class. The remaining class of mutes in each case belongs to Old High German. Practically our main concern is with the relations between Greek, Latin, and English roots, and for these the formula is sufficient.\n\nThe following are a few instances of the application of this law:\n\n| Greek | Latin | Sanskrit | English (Ang.

Demonstrative Adjectives, or Adjectives of Relation.\u2014Nature and use of Demonstrative Adjectives (\u00a7 97).\n\nXX. Comparison of Adjectives.\u2014Study \u00a7\u00a7 105\u2014119.\n\nXXI. Parsing of Adjectives.\u2014To parse an Adjective state what sort of adjective it is, in what degree of comparison it is, and to what noun it is attached either attributively or predicatively.\ntively (\u00a7\u00a7 89\u201497, 87, 98). Lastly, state its three degrees of comparison.\n\nXXII. Abstract Nouns.\u2014Nature and formation of Abstract Nouns (\u00a7\u00a7 32, 33, pp. 130, 135).\n\nXXIII. Adverbs.\u2014Nature and use of Adverbs. Parsing of Adverbs (\u00a7\u00a7 261\u2014276, 367, 372).\n\nIn what follows the lessons and exercises of the 'English Grammar Practice' are sometimes merely referred to, as in the preceding cases, when they are of a very elementary character, sometimes introduced in extenso or with some modifications, as exercises appropriate for the learners for whose use the present work is intended.\n\nXXIV. Nouns used Adverbially.\u2014A noun in the objective case with an adjective or some equivalent phrase, or even standing by itself, often does duty for an adverb. The noun should be parsed as being in the Adverbial Objective, modifying (either singly, or when taken with its adjective) some verb or adjective (\u00a7 372, 1\u20143).\n\nParse the nouns in italics in the following sentences:\n\nHe travelled all night. Many a time have I played with him. I have seen him many times. He comes here four times a week. That happened a year ago. I shall see you next week. He slept all night. Day by day we magnify Thee. He comes bothering me day after day. He turned his head another way. This is many degrees better than that. He is a year older than I am. I could not come a day sooner. The town is ten miles distant. We travelled day and night. He came forth bound hand and foot. He arrived post-haste.\n\nXXV. Adjectives used Adverbially.\u2014Many adjectives, especially those of Quantity, are used as substantives, it being impossible to supply any particular noun with them. These (like nouns) are often used with an adverbial force (\u00a7\u00a7 93, 94, 268, 269).\n\nOn the other hand, many adverbs which once ended in -e have lost that inflexion, and become identical in form with adjectives.\n\n\"Much has been revealed, but more remains behind.\" Here 'much' and 'more' are substantives, the subjects of the verbs that follow them.\n\n\"I do not much admire him.\" \"He is not much happier.\" Here 'much' is an adverb, modifying (1) a verb, (2) an adjective.\n\n\"He is no better.\" Here 'no' is an adverb modifying the adverb 'better.'\n\n\"He has not much money; his brother has more.\" Here 'much' is\nan adjective qualifying 'money,' and 'more' is an adjective qualifying 'money' understood.\n\nParse the words in italics in the following sentences, carefully distinguishing the adjectives proper, the substantival adjectives, and the adverbs:\n\nI have enough. I gave him all I had. In general I approve of his proceedings. Much depends upon his answer He knows more than he tells. He told me less than his brother. You know most about it. I will follow you through thick and thin. I did my best. He is the best dressed man in the room. He slept all night. All bloodless lay the untrodden snow. He is all powerful here. We have much cause for thankfulness. Much remains to be done. I am much happier. He is more contented. I could hear no more. He is no* wiser than before. I have no ink. He shows but little gratitude. We expect not a little from him. He is but little better. That is a most lovely prospect. Nobody else\u2020 was there. I have not meat enough.\u2021 I have enough and to spare.\n\nHe is less restless than he was yesterday. He ran all round the park. You know best. Do your best. He cut right through the helmet. Hear the right, O Lord. We have a choice between good and ill. Ill weeds thrive apace. The house is ill built. The earth turns round. He is pretty sure of the prize. He was a very thunderbolt of war. You are very kind. That is the very least you can do. Do not take more trouble. He is more to blame than I am. You are very much in fault. I cannot say more. I will take one more \u00a7 glass. Will you take some|| more wine. I will not take any more. Take no more trouble. I heard all. He sailed all round the world. Enough has been done. He is like\u00b6 my brother. He swore like a trooper. I ne'er shall look upon his like again. I am your equal.\n\nI will accept nothing less.** We heard nothing more of him. Whoever is most diligent will meet with most success. He is not any more diligent than he was before. I cannot write any better. He is a better writer than I am. I have heard a little about that affair, let me hear some more. You must take me for better or worse. The more part knew not wherefore they were come together. The more the merrier (\u00a7 265, 5). The cry did knock against my very heart. I love John best.\n\nXXVI. Prepositions.\u2014Nature and use of Prepositions. Relations which they indicate. Words which they join (\u00a7\u00a7 277, 278).\n\nXXVII. Adverbs and Prepositions.\u2014The same word is often used both as an adverb and as a preposition (\u00a7 279).\n\nParse the words in italics in the following sentences:\n\nHe got up behind. There is a garden behind the house. Do not lag behind.\n\n\u2022 'No,' as an adverb, may be taken as the simple adverb 'na' = never (A.S.).\n\u2020 'Else' is always an adverb.\n\u2021 The inflected adjective geneth is commonly placed after the noun in A.-lo-Saxon.\n\u00a7 'More' is here an adjective, equivalent to additional (p. 39). When more comes after the noun, as in 'one word more,' it should be regarded as an adverb (= 'in addition').\n|| 'Some' is never used as an adverb.\n\u00b6 When 'like' denotes personal resemblance, it is an adjective. When it denotes that one action resembles another, it is an adverb.\n** This word is an adjective qualifying the substantive 'nothing,' 'nothing inferior in amount.' The next example is different: 'more' is equivalent to 'further.'\nHe departed before my arrival. I told you all that before. Run round the table. The earth turns round. I rode inside the omnibus. He rode outside. He ran after me. That comes after. The box was painted within and without. She stayed within the house. Come along. We walked along the road. The storm passed by. I will come by and by. He cut a piece off the loaf. The stick is too long; cut a piece off. \"Three thousand ducats we freely cope your courteous pains withal.\"* \"Nothing comes amiss, so money come withal.\"** \"Her cause and yours I'll perfect him withal.\"\n\nFind a dozen words which may be used either as Adverbs or as Prepositions, and make sentences to illustrate their use.\n\nXXVIII. The Infinitive Mood.\u2014A. Nature and use of the Simple Infinitive (\u00a7\u00a7 194, 195). Shall, will, may, and do as notional and as auxiliary verbs (\u00a7\u00a7 185, 210, 212, 213). Must and can are always notional verbs.\n\nExamples.\n\n\"I will never forget you.\"\n'Forget':\u2014A Transitive Verb in the Active Voice, and in the (simple) Infinitive Mood, depending on (or the object of) the verb 'will.'\n\n\"Thou shalt not steal.\"\n'Steal' is a Transitive Verb, in the Active Voice, and in the (simple) Infinitive Mood, depending on (or governed by) the verb 'shalt.'\n\n\"You may go.\"\n'May' is a defective (notional) verb, in the Active Voice, Indicative Mood, Present Tense; and in the Plural Number, and the Second Person to agree with its subject 'you.'\n\n'Go' is an Intransitive Verb, in the Active Voice, and in the (simple) Infinitive Mood, depending on the verb 'may.'\n\n\"I shall soon depart.\"\nHere 'shall' is an auxiliary (not a notional) verb. The simple infinitive 'depart' depends upon it in the same manner as in the preceding examples.\n\n\"He will come presently.\"\nHere 'will' is a mere auxiliary of the future tense.\n\n\"You do assist the storm.\" \"Did you hear the rain?\"\nIn these examples 'do' and 'did' are mere auxiliaries.\n\n\"He does this that he may vex me.\"\nHere 'may' is a mere auxiliary of the Subjunctive Mood, and is in the Subjunctive Mood itself.\n\nParse all the verbs in the following sentences, and specify in the case of the finite verbs whether they are used as notional or as auxiliary verbs:\n\nWe can dance. You may go. I shall stay. I will go with you. You\n\n* 'Withal,' when used as a preposition, never precedes the word which it governs, but is placed at the end of the sentence.\nmust go directly. He could not reply. He would not come when I called him. He shall not know of it. He will soon return. You need not stay. He durst not go home. I could leap over that wall once. They would keep on making a noise. \"You do * assist the storm.\" The cry did * knock against my very heart. You would not have my help when you might. I cannot do what I will. That boy shall be made to hold his tongue. Does your father know of this? May I come in? Thou shalt not steal. We will never yield to threats. When shall \u2020 you see your brother? I did not call yesterday lest I might seem intrusive. He says that he will not come.\n\nB Nature and use of the gerundial infinitive, or infinitive with 'to' (\u00a7\u00a7 194, 196).\n\n\"It is useless to make the attempt.\"\n\n'It' forms the temporary subject of the verb 'is' (\u00a7 387).\n'To make' forms the real subject of the verb 'is,' and governs 'attempt' in the objective case.\n\n\"He thinks it better not to come.\" Here 'it' is the temporary object of the verb 'thinks,' and the infinitive 'to come' is the real object.\n\n\"He ran to meet me.\" Here 'to meet' is used with the force of an adverb modifying the verb 'ran.'\n\nParse the verbs in italics and the word 'it' in the following sentences:\n\nTo obey is better than sacrifice. It is useless to ask him. We found it advisable to return. He hopes to hear from you soon. He came to pay me some money. He did his best to ruin me. I am delighted to see \u2021 you. He is anxious to do \u2021 his duty. The water is not fit to drink. \u2021 I am happy to find \u2021 you so much better. They are come to stay with us. I shall be sorry to leave. \u2021 He is too clever to make \u2021 such a mistake. The boys had a long task to do. I was not prepared to hear such news. The master called the boy to say his lesson. He was rude enough to contradict \u2021 me. Help me to carry this.\n\nXXIX. Gerunds and Participles.\u2014Study \u00a7\u00a7 197\u2014202.\n\nWrite out the following sentences, and draw one line under the Abstract Nouns in -ing; two lines under the Gerunds; three lines under the imperfect (Active) participles, and then parse all the words in -ing:\n\nSeeing \u00a7 is believing. He went to see the hunting of the snark. I see a man riding on horseback. I like reading history. The excessive reading of novels is injurious. A lying witness ought to be punished. In keeping Thy commandments there is great reward. His conduct is in keeping with his professions. We arrived there first through taking a short cut. We fell in\n\n* When 'do' is a mere auxiliary (whether emphatic or unemphatic) it may be parsed separately, or else taken with the dependent infinitive, and the compound form may be parsed in the same way as the simple tense for which it is a substitute. Thus: 'Did knock' may be treated as equivalent to 'knocked.' See the preceding examples.\n\n\u2020 See \u00a7 211.\n\n\u2021 In these cases the gerundial infinitive does the work of an adverb, and modifies the preceding adjective. Sometimes it expresses the cause of the state denoted by the adjective.\n\n\u00a7 When the verbal noun in -ing does not govern an object it may be treated as a simple abstract noun.\nwith a ship sailing to America. He is delighted at having succeeded* in his design. We were late in consequence of having lost * our way. No good can come of your doing that. Oblige me by all leaving the room. On some opposition being made he withdrew his demand. I lay a thinking.\u2020 Forty and six years was this temple in building. We started before the rising of the sun. Quitting the forest, we advanced into the open plain. There was a great deal of shouting and clapping of hands. My noble partner you greet with great prediction of noble having. By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes. He died in consequence of pricking his hand with a poisoned dagger. He strode up the hall bowing right and left to his guests. \"You do draw my spirits from me with new lamenting \u2021 ancient oversights\" (Shaksp.).\n\nXXX. Parsing of Participles.\u2014Participles proper. Participles used as ordinary Qualitative Adjectives. Participles used absolutely (\u00a7\u00a7 201; 202; 282; 370, 5).\n\nParse the Participles in the following sentences:\n\nHope deferred maketh the heart sick. He bought a deferred annuity. Smiling scornfully, he strode into the circle. Look at that smiling villain. Generally speaking he dines at home. Considering your age, you have done very well. I caught sight of the thief climbing in at the window. Accoutred as I was, I plunged in. Being apprised of our approach, the whole neighbourhood came out to meet their minister, dressed in their fine clothes, and preceded by a pipe and tabor. The general rode in front, mounted on a splendid charger. Barring accidents, we will be with you to-morrow.\n\nStudy \u00a7 216, and separate the following sentences into two groups, one containing those in which the verb be and the perfect participle form a tense of the passive voice,\u00a7 the other containing those in which the participle is a mere qualitative adjective:\n\nThe ship was built by contract. The ship was built of iron. He was stretched upon the rack. The string is stretched too tight. The captives were already slain. They were slain by order of the captain. The poor man is badly hurt. The poor man was hurt. The troops were surprised by the enemy. I was surprised by his behaviour. I am surprised that you do not see that.\n\nXXXI. Interrogative and Negative Sentences.\n\nXXXII. Imperative Sentences.\u2014Study \u00a7 191.\n\n\"Let me see that.\"\n\n'Let' is a transitive verb in the Active Voice, Imperative Mood, and in the second person plural, to agree with its subject 'you' understood.||\n\n* This must be treated as a compound gerund. It is impossible to construct the abstract noun in -ing with a past participle.\n\u2020 Here 'a' is a preposition (= at or in). 'Thinking' had better be taken in such constructions as the Abstract Noun in -ing.\n\u2021 There is here a confusion between the Abstract Noun and the Gerund.\n\u00a7 In these we get a statement of the actual doing of a certain act, in the second class we get a statement of the results of the act.\n|| 'You' is always a grammatical plural.\n'See' is a transitive verb in the Active Voice, and in the (simple) Infinitive Mood, depending on the verb 'let,' and forming an indirect predicate to 'me' (\u00a7 397).\n\n'Me' is in the objective case, governed by 'let,' and forming the subject of the indirect predicate 'see,' the whole phrase 'me see that' being the object of 'let.'\n\nParse all the words in the following sentences:\n\nLet me go. Come hither, boys.* Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar. Let him see it. Let us be spared this annoyance. Let us pray. Let me be cautious in the business. Do be quiet, boys.\n\nXXXII. Relative or Conjunctive Pronouns.\u2014Study \u00a7\u00a7 151\u2014164, 412, 465\u2014470.\n\nThe construction of a relative clause is word for word the same as that of the clause which results when a demonstrative pronoun, or the antecedent noun is substituted for the relative. Thus, 'Whom you met' is like 'you met him.'\n\nParse all the Relative Pronouns in the following sentences, and test the construction by substituting demonstratives for the relatives as in the above examples:\n\nThe man whom you met is my brother. The artist who painted that picture died last year. I never saw the man whom you speak of. Where is the pen which I gave you? I who am poorer than you are, am contented. We who are well off should pity and help the poor. The boys whose work is finished may go out to play. He that is down need fear no fall. You have not brought me the volume that I asked for. He is the very man that I was speaking of. Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God. It is that that grieves me. \"Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes, which art my near'st and dearest enemy?\" \"Whosoever hath, to him shall be given.\" \"Blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in Me.\" He doth sin that doth belie the dead. Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be showed before the whole congregation. They are but faint-hearted whose courage fails in time of danger.\n\nState clearly what 'which' stands for in the following sentences:\n\nHe promised to follow my advice, which was the best thing he could do. We studied hard all the morning, after which we went for a walk. \"And, which is more than all these boasts can be, I am beloved of Hermia.\" \"I see thee still, and on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, which was not so before.\" \"Thou didst smile, which raised in me an undergoing stomach (i.e., courage to endure).\"\n\nSupply (and parse) the relative pronouns which are omitted in the following sentences:\n\nPay me the money you owe me. You have not sent the goods I bought yesterday. Have you received the money I sent you? That is the place I went to. You are the very man I was looking for. \"I have a mind presages me such thrift, that I should questionless be fortunate.\" That is not the way I came. Those are the very words he used. Is the task I set you finished yet? He is not the man I expected.\n\n* Parse 'boys' as a Vocative, or Nominative of Address.\nSupply the antecedents which are understood in the following examples:\n\nWho steals my purse, steals trash. Whom we raise we will make fast. I may neither choose whom I would, nor refuse whom I dislike. Whoever said that, told a falsehood. \"Whosoever sins ye remit, they are remitted.\" I dread what is coming. I hear what you are saying. I cannot consent to what you ask. You have not done what you promised. Have you found who you were looking for? What pleases you will please me.\n\nXXXIV. Relative (or Conjunctive) Adverbs.\u2014Study \u00a7\u00a7 262\u2014265.\n\nConjunctive adverbs modify a verb, adjective, or adverb in the clause which they introduce, and join that clause to the predicate of the principal clause.\n\nParse the conjunctive adverbs in the following sentences:\n\nI was not at home when you called. I shall see you when I return. He still lay where he had fallen. I will follow you whithersoever you go. This is the house where I live. Tell me the reason why you left the room. Go back to the place whence you came. Show me the shop where you bought that. Wherever he lives, he will be happy. I go to see him whenever I can.\n\nXXXV. Conjunctions.\u2014Study the definition and classification of Conjunctions (\u00a7\u00a7 285\u2014292).\n\nParse the conjunctions in the following sentences:\n\nA. He is poor, but he is contented. He neither came nor sent an excuse. He went out quickly and slammed the door. He shot a hare and two rabbits. Both John and Henry came to see me. I will both lay me down in peace and [I will] sleep. Either I am mistaken, or you are. I can neither eat nor [can I] sleep.\n\nB. You will be punished if you do that. If I had seen him, I would have spoken to him. He would not help me, though he knew that I was in need. Though hand join hand in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished. You will lose the prize unless you work harder. Take heed lest you fall. I cannot give you any money, for I have none. My brother is taller than you are. He comes oftener than [he] ever [came].\n\nParse the words in italics in the following sentences:\n\nJohn arrived after his brother. Do not go before I come. We left after the concert was over. Since you say so, I must believe it. He has not smiled since his son died. We have not eaten since yesterday. They will go away before night. I will wait until you return. All except John were present. Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.\n\n* Parse 'what' as a neuter Relative Pronoun relating to a suppressed antecedent; whenever the sense of the sentence remains the same if 'that which' is substituted for 'what.'\n\n\u2020 Mind that this preposition does not govern 'what' (which is the object of to 'ask'), but its suppressed antecedent 'that.'\nParse the word 'that' wherever it occurs in the following sentences. (Look at \u00a7\u00a7 145, 146, 152, 290.)\n\nShow me that picture. He did not say that. He is the very man that I want. He says that we shall never succeed. He does that that he may vex me. They that will be rich fall into temptation. There is not a man here that I can trust. I lent you that book that you might read it. I hear that he has lost that book that I lent him. You ought to know that that 'that' * that you see at the beginning of the clause is a conjunction, because I told you that before.\n\nXXXVI. The Subjunctive Mood.\u2014Nature and use of the Subjunctive Mood (\u00a7\u00a7 192, &c., 422\u2014440, 487).\n\nParse the verbs in italics in the following sentences, carefully distinguishing the moods:\n\nYou may \u2020 go. He says that that he may vex me. The old man might be seen daily sitting in the porch. He came that he might beg money of me. He may \u2020 have been in the house, but I did not see him. He would be angry if he knew of it. I had just finished when you came in. \"Had I but died an hour before this chance, I had lived a blessed time.\" He would not open the door when I knocked. He would open the door if you knocked. He would have opened the door if you had knocked. You should \u00a7 not tell lies. If he did that he deserves to be punished. If he had done it, he would have confessed it. If he did it, he would seriously displease me. If he were to make such a reply it would be very foolish. If he had heard the news, he kept it all to himself. If he had heard the news, he would not have kept it to himself. He could not do that if he tried. He could not do it when he tried. You might have won the prize if you had been more diligent.\n\nXXXVII. Apposition.||\u2014(\u00a7 362, 2).\n\nXXXVIII. Attributive Adjuncts.\u2014(\u00a7\u00a7 362\u2014366).\n\nPoint out the attributive adjuncts in the following examples, and in each case state of what they consist, and to what they are attached:\n\nJohn's coat is seedy. My cousin Henry died last week. I see a man walking in the garden. My brother Tom's pony is lame. A man clothed in a long white robe came up to me. We soon reached the top of the mountain. The prisoner's guilt is manifest. The friends of the prisoner are very rich. Fearing to be caught in the rain, we returned. This is no time for trifling. I saw a house to let further on. Whose hat did you take? I borrowed William's big two-bladed knife. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. He obtained permission to go. Give me now leave to leave thee. His right to the property was disputed.\n\n* See \u00a7 385.\n\u2020 'May,' 'would,' &c., in the indicative mood must be parsed as notional, not as auxiliary verbs. See Section XXVIII.\n\u2021 That is, 'it is possible that he was in the house.'\n\u00a7 This use of 'should' is peculiar. It is past in form, referring to present time, and yet it is indicative. It follows the analogy of 'ought' and the other preterite-present verbs.\n|| One noun in the possessive is never put in apposition to another, but the two nouns are treated as a single compound name. In \"My brother William's dog,\" \"my brother William's\" must be parsed as a compound proper noun, in the possessive case, depending on 'dog.'\nXXXIX. Adverbial Adjuncts.\u2014Nature and classification of Adverbial Adjuncts (\u00a7\u00a7 371, 372).\n\nPoint out the adverbial adjuncts in the following sentences; state of what they consist, and to what verb, adjective or adverb they are attached:\n\nThey will be here to-night. He prayed for a speedy deliverance. I am much displeased with your conduct. He is not like his sister. He accompanied us most of the way. You are to come home directly. He approached me dagger in hand. He built a wall ten feet thick. There is a church a mile distant from the town. I am not disposed to sell the horse. On reaching home we found that the rest had arrived before us. We were all talking of the accident. Wait a bit. We had nothing to do. What is the matter with you? He is too ready to take offence. We are glad to see you. Why did you say that? Where were you on duty last night? My object having been attained, I am satisfied. To reign is worth ambition. The cloth is worth a guinea a yard. He is a year older than I am.\n\nIn the following examples show which of the phrases made up of a preposition and a noun do the work of an adjective (see \u00a7 362, 4), i.e. are attributive adjuncts, and which do the work of an adverb (see \u00a7 372, 4), that is, are adverbial adjuncts; and show to what word each is attached.\n\nWhat is the use of all this fuss about the matter? I am delighted to see you in good health. The advantages of travelling in foreign countries are very great. He is a man of great industry. He accomplished the task by unflagging industry. A man addicted to self-indulgence will not rise to greatness. That is a good stream for angling. I am fond of the pastime of angling. We rely on your promise. Reliance on his promises is useless. Do your duty to him. What is my duty to my neighbour? He adhered to his determination to make the attempt. He is too feeble to make the attempt. He gave him his best wine to drink. The place abounds in good water to drink. The master praised the boy at the top of the class. He shouted to the boys at the top of his voice.\n\nXL. Parsing of Adverbial Adjuncts.\u2014(See \u00a7\u00a7 370\u2014372).\n\nXLI. ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES.\n\nI. Simple Sentences.\u2014Nature of a simple sentence. Difference between the logical Subject and Predicate, and the grammatical Subject and Predicate (\u00a7\u00a7 400, 501, &c.).\n\nDivide the following sentences into the logical subject, and the logical predicate:\n\nThe children, tired with play, came indoors. The friends of that little boy have sent him to sea. A rich old uncle has left him a large estate in Yorkshire. The horse, terrified by the lightning, ran away at full speed.\n\nQuestions may be divided in a similar manner. The construction will sometimes be clearer in the primary division, if the predicate be\nput first. Thus, \"When will your brother return to town?\" may be divided. *Pred.* 'When will return to town?' *Subj.* 'Your brother.'\n\nDivide the following sentences in a similar way:\n\nDoes your uncle the doctor know of this? Went not my spirit with thee? Whence did the author of that book get his materials? Who in the world told you that? Why did you send the poor man away? How many shillings have you in your purse?\n\nTake the following sentences and put with the subject in each the whole of the verb that belongs to it, without the other words:\n\nI shall most likely hear from you to-morrow. I have been all the morning trying to make out this problem. You will by these very simple means stop his proceedings. He is of all enchantingly beloved. He has in the most unfair manner been deprived of his rights.\n\nTake the following sentences* and separate the logical subject in each into the grammatical subject and its adjuncts in the way shown in \u00a7 501:\n\n(My) (poor) (little) brother has hurt himself. (The) (impudent) fellow (not being satisfied with my alms) began to abuse me. (My poor little brother's) (pet) bird was shot. (This) law (the disgrace of our statute book) was repealed. (The) (Chubb's) (patent) lock (to my desk) has been picked. (Disgusted \u2020 by so many acts of baseness) (the man's) friends (all) deserted him.\n\nThe brave soldiers of the garrison died at their posts. A rich old uncle left him his property. A horseman, wrapped in a huge cloak, entered the yard. The handle of the pump in the yard is broken. John's account of the affair alarmed me. Which boy knows his lessons? What poet's works please you most?\n\nMake (or find) a dozen sentences in which the grammatical subject is enlarged (see \u00a7 388), and state in each case what the enlargement consists.\n\nSet down separately the object of the verb in each of the following sentences and the several attributive adjuncts of the object:\n\nHe told us a droll story about his brother. Have you read this author's last work? Whom did you see at the concert? I saw a soldier on horseback.\u2021\n\n* In the first few sentences the words or groups of words forming separate adjuncts are enclosed in brackets.\n\n\u2020 The grammatical form of a sentence often lags behind its logical import. Thus, an independent sentence beginning with a demonstrative often occurs where the sense implies grammatical connection, as \"I believed, therefore have I spoken.\" \"Therefore\" is not a conjunction, but a demonstrative adverb, meaning 'for that reason.' So participles and participial phrases are (grammatically speaking) attributive adjuncts; and yet they often involve an adverbial force; as here, 'because he despaired of success,' and 'because they were disgusted.' Adjectives may be used in the same way, 'Afraid of being betrayed into an ambuscade, the leader halted.' Grammatically you can make nothing of 'afraid' but an adjective, though the same notion of because clings to the expression. So in Milton, \"His meek aspect, silent, yet spake.\" Here 'silent' means 'although it was silent,' but grammatically it is nothing more than an adjective. In analysis and parsing grammatical form is the essential thing. The point in question has nothing to do with any servile imitation of Latin Grammar, or any confusion between participles and verbal nouns.\n\n\u2021 Observe that this phrase does not show where the act of seeing took place. Contrast this sentence with the next.\nI met some gipsies in my ramble. The master praised the boy at the top of the class. The man struck the poor little boy on the head. He sent his hat round to collect contributions. They shook the depths of the desert gloom with their hymns of holy cheer. He had the impudence to tell me to hold my tongue.\n\nGive the complete analysis of the following sentences:\n\nEvery finite verb in a sentence has a subject. My brother Henry told me * that. I saw the occurrence through a gap in the wall. That lazy boy did not go out of doors all the morning. Have \u2020 those little boys finished their Latin exercises during my absence? Crying will not help you out of the difficulty. To do this properly requires time. Whom did you hear at church this morning? Hoping to find an easier road, we left our companions at the bridge. How \u2021 did you find your way? Considering his age he has done pretty well at the examination. How \u00a7 much money will be enough for you? What foolish notion possesses you? A large dog's bark was heard in the distance. An empty bird's nest was found. The tall lady's dress was torn. Some ladies' silk dresses were sold by auction. Here shall be done a deed of dreadful note. We had a purpose to be his purveyor. We have bought a pretty little calf a month old. His wrath may find some worse way to our destruction. What more do you desire? Whose umbrella did you take? Whose exercise has the fewest faults? He fell head foremost into the river. \"Take thee * that too.\" I told you * all that an hour ago.|| He died a happy death.|| There lay Duncan, his silver skin laced with his golden blood. The poor wren will fight, her young ones in her nest, against the owl. Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildly peep. Who ever experienced anything like kindness at his hands? Who but a fool would talk like that? What arrant nonsense that foolish man talks! Which [horse] of these horses is to be sold? He eats his food ** like a hog. He was taught Greek (\u00a7 370) by his uncle. 'Teach me thy statutes.' 'Teach erring man \u2020\u2020 to spurn the rage of gain.'\n\nTake the following pairs of subjects and verbs and build up sentences by putting in objects, where they are wanted, and enlarging the subjects, predicates, and objects, with as many adjuncts, attributive and adverbial, as you can. Thus, from 'Men rob,' you may make 'Men of weak character, led astray by temptation, sometimes rob their unsuspecting friends shamefully.'\n\nBirds build. Ship carries. Boy lost. Loaf was bought. Brother left. Sister came. Children went. Men found. We arrived. Man struck. Horse threw.\n\n* Look at \u00a7\u00a7 369, 372, 2.\n\u2020 In questions the subject is often so placed as to break the predicate (when it is a compound form of the verb) into two parts. To see the construction properly, give the complete answer to the question.\n\u2021 Remember that 'how' is an adverb.\n\u2020 Take care in the analysis not to separate attributive words from the adverbial adjuncts that may be attached to them.\n|| 'Ago' is a shortened form of 'agone.' The phrase originally formed a nominative (or objective) absolute.\n\u2020\u2020 Look at \u00a7 372, 3.\n** 'Like' is here an adverb.\n\u2020\u2020 Here 'man' had better be taken as the direct object, 'teach' having the same kind of sense as 'train' or 'instruct.'\nXLII. Verbs of Incomplete Predication.\u2014Nature and construction of Verbs of Incomplete Predication (\u00a7\u00a7 391\u2014396). Mode of analysing sentences in which they occur (\u00a7\u00a7 509\u2014513, 515\u2014519).\n\nAnalyse the following sentences containing Subjective Complements of verbs of Incomplete Predication:\n\nHe is an honest man. He became very rich in a short time. He was called an enthusiast by his friends. He is considered a pretty good player. We got quite tired. The wine tastes sweet. She looks very pretty. That appears very plausible. He stood silent (see \u00a7 391). The dog ran away howling. He felt tired. The air feels keen. He stood rubbing his eyes. The boys rushed shouting into the playground. I am sure of pleasing you in this. He is believed to be mad. This kind of life is not to be endured.\n\nThe verb *to be* is a verb of incomplete predication when it is employed in making a compound tense of a verb in either the active or the passive voice, as 'He is going'; 'I was saying'; 'He is gone'; 'He was struck.' But when used to form a tense of another verb, it is usually called an Auxiliary Verb. In such cases the compound form denotes the performance, the continuance, or the completion of an action. When the state that is the result of the action is denoted, the participle that follows is merely an adjective of quality. When it is not accompanied by a complement of some sort, *to be* is a verb of complete predication, or (as it is sometimes called) the 'verb of existence.' (N.B.\u2014An adverb or adverbial phrase is not a complement.)\n\nPoint out carefully the various uses of the verb in the following examples:\n\nHe is in the parlour. He is going away. Such things have been. The time has been, that when the brains were out, the man would die. We are ready. I am in doubt about that. The boy was blamed for that. The poor man was starved to death. The children are half starved. He was wounded by an arrow. The poor soldier is badly wounded. I am trying to do it. This delay is trying to our patience. I am delighted to see you. We were delighted by the concert. He is named John. He was called a fool for his pains. Where are you? Where have you been all the morning?\n\nAnalyse the following sentences containing Objective Complements* of verbs of incomplete predication (\u00a7 395):\n\nHe painted the wall white. He made us all merry. They made Henry king. He called the man a liar. You have made your hands dirty. This measure rendered the plot abortive. He set the audience laughing. The people elected Washington president. The king appointed him commander in chief. The thunder has turned the milk sour. The cat has licked the plate clean. Shame has struck him dumb. The retreating tide left the ship high and dry. The architect has constructed the ceilings too low. They dug the trench wider and deeper. They raised the walls higher. The careless boys left the gate wide open.\n\n* This exercise, as it appears in the 'English Grammar Practice,' contains some sentences which should be classed with those dealt with in the next paragraph containing indirect predicates attached to nouns.\nAnalyse the following sentences, in which the subjective complement is a verb in the infinitive mood (\u00a7 394). Show where the complementary infinitive has itself a complement. These secondary complements, as well as the primary ones, are in the predicative relation to the subject. Do not confound the object of a verb with its complement.\n\nHe is believed to have perished. They are supposed to have lost their way. He is thought to have poisoned the man. He is believed to be mad. That step was considered to be very imprudent. He was ordered to sit down. He was bidden to stand aside. This kind of life is not to be endured.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences containing Infinitive Complements. (See \u00a7 396.) Show carefully whether, adverbial adjuncts are to be attached to the verb of incomplete predication, or to its complement. (See \u00a7 502.)\n\nThey can write well. We can sing. They may depart. We must make haste. You shall be rewarded. I will be answered. I must go home. I cannot hear you. They may take the money. I will return shortly. They shall have a good scolding. That cannot be allowed. Nothing could be more unfortunate. You might have found an easier way. I do so long to see him. Indeed I did not say so. He ought to pay me. He ought not to do this. You ought to be more cautious. That may perhaps be true.\n\nXLIII. Complex Objective Phrases.\u2014Study \u00a7 397 and the note to \u00a7 395; \u00a7\u00a7 520\u2014528.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences containing indirect predicates:\n\nHe heard the wind roar through the trees. We saw the thief trying to pick a gentleman's pocket. I wish you to come to-morrow. I believe the man to be innocent. I felt the air fan my cheek. Have you ever known the man confess being in fault? I like a knave to meet with his deserts. I expected the travellers to be here by this time. It is too late for the travellers to arrive to-night. The task was too difficult for him to hope to succeed.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences, carefully distinguishing those cases in which a verb is followed by a complement or an indirect predicate from those in which it is followed by an adverbial adjunct. See whether the word in question denotes the condition of that which is spoken about, or the manner in which an action is done.\n\nThat looks pretty. The bell sounds cracked. He spoke loud. The cry sounded clear and shrill. His voice sounded feebly. Her voice sounded feeble. He has travelled far and wide. They have not made the street wide enough. The people wept sore. It grieved me sore. The stones have made my feet sore. He rubbed his face hard. He rubbed his face sore. Her voice sounds clear. The ship passed clear of the rock. The trees whispered soft and low. The whisper came soft and low to our ears. He made his horse canter. He bade the man wait. He ordered the man to wait. He asked me to come. They urged us to come. He saw the deed done. He heard the bone snap. They may depart. You shall be rewarded. You might have found an easier way. We must go home. He was ordered to sit down.\n\nXLIV. Complex Sentences. Substantive Clauses.\u2014Nature, form, and structure of substantive clauses (\u00a7\u00a7 403\u2014407, 539\u2014555).\n\nAnalyse the following sentences in the mode indicated in \u00a7 539, &c.\nWhen 'it' is employed as a temporary, or provisional subject, set it down as such, and place after it the substantive clause as the real subject. Analyse the substantive clauses separately:\n\nA. (See \u00a7\u00a7 542\u2014545.) That he did the deed is quite certain. Who can have told you that, puzzles me. How long I shall stay here is uncertain. What we are to do next is the question. How I found the matter out is no concern of yours. What signifies what weather we have?\n\nIt is very probable that he will not arrive to-day. It does not matter what he thinks. It is uncertain how long I shall stay. It is uncertain what the result will be. It is not true that he said so.\n\nThence it is that I to your assistance do make love. What does it signify how rich he is? It is a question how far he was justified in that proceeding.\n\nMethinks I know that handwriting. Anon methought the wood began to move. Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him. It was only yesterday that I saw him. Was it on Tuesday that he went away?\n\nB. (See \u00a7\u00a7 546\u2014549.) I knew that he would come. I think I have the honour of addressing Mr. Smith? Tell me how old you are. I want to know when this happened. I thought it strange that he should leave without calling on me. I swear I have no mind of feasting forth to-night. Tell me what you think of all this. Advise if this be worth attempting. I am hopeful that he will soon get better. He is confident that I shall succeed. He made it a condition that I should become security for the payment. He felt it to be a disgrace that he had so utterly failed. Tell me who told you. Tell him I cannot see him to-day. Try if you can decipher that letter. I fear thou play'dst most foully for it. We are resolved that that shall not occur again. Try how far you can jump.\n\nC. (See \u00a7\u00a7 550\u2014555.) The fact that you say so is enough for me. He did this to the end that he might convince me. I undertook the business in the expectation that he would help me. In case you should see him, bring him with you. I came on the chance that I might find you at home. There was a rumour that the army had been defeated. Oh! yet I do repent me of my fury that I did kill them. For that I love your daughter, I must advance the colours of my love. That depends upon how you did it. I would not believe the story but that you avouch it. I hate him for he is a Christian, but more for that in low simplicity he lends out money gratis. Provided this report be confirmed, we shall know what to do. He sent me word that he would come anon. The circumstance that he was present must not be disregarded. In case I am not there, go on without me.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences (see \u00a7 406):\n\nI see no sign that the fever is abating. That is a proof that he knows nothing about the matter. We welcomed these indications that spring was near. He has obtained my consent that he should go to college. There is no fear that he will fail.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences, in which the Substantive Clause forms an Adverbial Adjunct to a verb or adjective (like the Latin accusative of limitation, or closer definition):\n\n* 'It' often does duty as a temporary or provisional object. Deal with it as in the case of the subject; that is, first analyse the sentence without the substantive clause, and then substitute that clause for the 'it'.\n\n\u2020 'If' has here the force of 'whether'.\nI am sorry that you are not well.* We are glad that you have come at last. I am certain that he never said so. He is de-trous that I should return. I am persuaded that that is the wiser course. We are disappointed that you have not brought your brother.\n\nXLV. Adjective Clauses.\u2014Nature, form, and construction of Adjective Clauses (\u00a7\u00a7 408\u2014413; 556\u2014562).\n\nUnderline the adjective clauses in each of the following sentences, then analyse the entire sentence, and lastly, analyse the adjective clause separately:\n\nThe serpent that did sting thy father's life, now wears his crown. I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul. The rest (i.e., 'repose') is labour which is not used for you. Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just. Infected be the air whereon they ride. Thy food shall be husks wherein the acorn cradled. What sad talk was that wherewith my brother held you in the cloister? I know a bank whereon the wild thyme blows. Thou speakest to such a man that is no fleering tell-tale. Unto bad causes swear such creatures as\u2020 men doubt. You will soon find such peace which it is not in the power of the world to give. You are welcome to my heart, such as\u2020 it is. I have not from your eyes that gentleness and show of love as\u2020 I was wont to have. In me thou seest the twilight of such day, as\u2020 after sunset fadeth in the west.\n\nI will show you the shop where I bought these apples. The reason why you cannot succeed is evident. I can remember the time when there were no houses here. The fortress whither the defeated troops had fled was soon captured.\n\nIt was John who said so.\u00a7 It was the owl that shrieked.\u00a7 Who was it that thus cried? Is this a dagger which|| I see before me, the handle towards my hand? Was that your brother who knocked at the door?\n\nAnalyse the following sentences (see \u00a7 410):\n\nYou have only told me what I know already. I know what you said about me. Go, and find out what is the matter. Do what you can in this business. He soon repented of what he had done. He knows well enough what he ought to do. That is precisely what he ought to have done. I cannot make out what you are saying. I do not understand what you are saying.\n\nWhom we raise we will make fast. I could not make out whom he was alluding to. That is where|| I live. Tell me where you live. Tell me why you are so angry. That is why|| I am angry. I do not know when they will arrive. I knew when|| seven justices could not take up a quarrel. I have seen when|| after execution, judgment hath repented o'er his doom. See where|| he looks out of the window. That is how** he always treats me. That is why I did it.\n\n* See \u00a7 549, 2.\n\u2020 See \u00a7 65.\n\u2021 That is, \"It (the person) who said so, was John.\"\n\u00a7 That is, \"It (the creature) that shrieked, was the owl.\"\n|| The adjective clause 'which hand' is attached to 'this.' 'The handle towards my hand' is a nominative absolute belonging to the adjective clause.\n\u00b6 In the analysis supply an antecedent noun.\n** 'How,' as a relative, never has an antecedent expressed.\nAnalyse the following sentences, treating the clauses containing a relative as independent sentences (see \u00a7 412):\n\nI the matter will re-word, which madness would gambol from. We travelled together as far as Paris, where we parted company. This modest stone, what few vain marbles can. May truly say, 'Here lies an honest man.' By this time we had traversed half the distance, when a loud clap of thunder warned us to quicken our steps. Honourable ladies sought my love, which I denying,* they fell sick and died.\n\nXLVI. Adverbial Sentences.\u2014Nature, form, and structure of Adverbial Clauses (\u00a7\u00a7 414\u2014442, 563\u2014571).\n\nAnalyse (and parse) the following sentences, after first underlining the Adverbial Clauses, and then analyse these clauses separately\u2020:\n\nA. (See \u00a7 416.) I will tell you the secret\u2021 when I see you. When you durst do it, then you were a man. I did not know that till you told me. What signifies a-k-ng. when there's not a soul to give you an answer? I'll charm the air to give a sound while you perform your antic round. He arrived after we had left. I shall be gone before you are up. You may come whenever you please.\n\nB (See \u00a7 417.) Where thou dwellest, I will dwell. Wherever you go, I will follow you. There,\u00a7 where a few torn shrubs the place disclose, the village preacher's modest mansion rose.\n\nC. (See \u00a7\u00a7 418, 420.) As the tree falls, so || it will lie. He is as \u00b6 avaricious as his brother is generous. The ** higher you climb, the wider will be the prospect. The more he has, the more he wants. How \u2020\u2020 far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow, so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance. How a bright star shooteth from the sky, so glides he in the night from Venus' eye.\n\nD. (See \u00a7\u00a7 421, 423) I cannot tell you his age for I do not know it. Because Thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of Thy wings will I rejoice. Since you say so, I must believe it. When I am determined I always listen to reason, because then it can do no harm.\n\nHe toils hard that he may get rich. I called on him that I might tell him about that matter. Take care that all be ready. Take heed lest ye fall into temptation.\n\n* We have here a nominative absolute, forming an adverbial adjunct to fell. 'Which is the object of 'denying.'\n\n\u2020 Remember that the conjunction or pronominal adverbs when, where, whither, &c., have an adverbial construction in their own clauses, but that the Conjunctions after, before, till, while, &c., have no such force.\n\n\u2021 In parsing a sentence of this kind, 'when' should be described as a connective adverb, modifying the verb 'see,' and joining the clause 'when I see you' to the predicate 'will tell.'\n\n\u00a7 'There' and the clause 'where\u2014disclose' are co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'rose.'\n\n|| 'So' and the clause 'as the tree falls' are co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'will lie.'\n\n\u00b6 The first 'as' is demonstrative, the second relative. Each modifies the adjective in its clause.\n\n** Here the main clause is the second one. The first 'the' is relative, the second demonstrative. (See \u00a7 420.) The first modifies 'higher,' the second modifies 'wider.' The second 'the' and the adverbial clause are co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'wider,' the clause explaining the indefinite meaning of 'the.'\n\n\u2020\u2020 'How' is a relative or connective adverb modifying 'far,' and joining the adverbial clause (which is co-ordinate with 'so') to the second 'far.'\nI am so * tired that I am ready to drop. He is such a liar that nobody believes him.\n\nE. (See \u00a7\u00a7 424\u2014442.) If you call you will see him. I would have called on you, if I had known your address. You will not succeed unless you try harder. I will not come unless you invite me. Except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish. Though he is rich he is not contented. You will see him though I shall not [see him]. An (= if) I have not ballads made on you all, and sung to filthy tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison. So\u2020 I lose not honour in seeking to augment it, I shall be counselled. I doubt not but to die a fair death for all this, if I escape hanging for killing\u2021 that rogue. Whatever may be the consequence, I will do what I have said. Whatever he may say,\u00a7 I shall not believe him. Say[he] what he will [say] he will never convince me. Do [he] what he can [do], he never pleases the man. Whencesoever the money comes it is welcome. However great his abilities may be, he cannot succeed without industry. Be he ne'er so vile, this day shall gentle his condition. The lady's fortune must not go out of the family; one may find comfort in the money, whatever one does [find] in the wife. Cold|| as it is, I shall go out. Big as he is, I am not afraid of him. Had I known \u00b6 this I should have acted differently. Were you my brother I could not do it for you. I would have finished the work had it been possible.\n\nXLVII. Complex Subordinate Clauses. \u2014 In the following sentences a substantive clause contains a subordinate clause within it. Analyse the sentences, first treating the substantive as a whole, and afterwards analysing it separately (\u00a7\u00a7 572\u2014574). Underline the clauses in the way shown in \u00a7 541:\n\nWho told you that I built the house which you see? He fears that his father will ask him where he has been. But that I told him who did it, he would never have known. Nor failed they to express how much they praised that for the general safety he despised his own. I think he will soon retrieve his misfortunes if he sets to work with good-will. I should like to know how your friend found out where I live. Now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answered. I'll see if I can get my husband's ring, which I did make him swear to keep for ever.\n\nAnalyse on similar principles the following sentences, which contain complex adjective clauses:\n\nThe house where I lived when I was in town has been pulled down. I have only done what I told you I would do. They fear what ** yet they know must follow. I have secret reasons which I forbear to mention because you are not\n\n* The demonstrative 'so' and the adverbial clause are co-ordinate adverbial adjuncts of 'tired.'\n\u2020 See \u00a7 440.\n\u2021 Mind that 'for killing' is not an adverbial adjunct of 'escape,' but an attributive adjunct of the verbal noun 'hanging' (\u00a7 362, 4).\n\u00a7 Do not confound this construction with that of such a sentence as 'I believe whatever he says.' Analyse this.\n|| The construction in this and the following sentences is very peculiar. 'Cold' is in reality the complement of the predicate. The construction is the same as if we had 'however cold it is.'\n\u00b6 'If' is omitted (\u00a7 442).\n** 'What' is in the nominative case, the subject of 'must.' The construction will be best seen by substituting the demonstrative: 'they know [that] that must follow.'\nable to answer those of which I make no secret. The time has been that when the brains were out the man would die. The right valiant Banquo walked too late, whom you may say, if it pleases you, Fleance killed. The eighth appears, who bears a glass which shows me many more.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences which contain complex adverbial clauses:\n\nHe soon left the house when he heard that I was coming. You will be punished if you do not come when you are called. Don't let us make imaginary evils, when we know we have so many real ones to encounter. He seldom drinks wine because he finds that it disagrees with him.\n\nAnalyse the following sentences, each of which contains a subordinate clause containing a second, which in its turn contains a third:\n\nI was grieved when I heard how he had obtained the character which he bore among his neighbours. I know that he would never have spread such a report, if he had not believed what your brother told him. Men who see clearly how they ought to act when they meet with obstacles, are invaluable helpers. It would be well if all men felt how surely ruin awaits those who abuse their gifts and powers. It was so hot in the valley that we could not endure the garments which we had found too thin when we were higher up among the mists. I will give you no more money till I see how you use what you have.\n\nXLVIII. Compound Sentences.\u2014These present no new features. The two or more co-ordinate sentences which make up the compound sentence simply have to be analysed separately (\u00a7 443).\n\nXLIX. Contracted Sentences.\u2014Study carefully \u00a7\u00a7 449\u2014452, 582\u2014588.\n\nTest the accuracy of the following contracted sentences in the manner shown in \u00a7 450; then fill them up* and analyse them separately:\n\nYou must either be quiet or [you must] leave the room. Our purer essence then will overcome the noxious vapour of the raging fires, or [our purer essence,] inured, [will] not feel [the noxious vapour of these raging fires].

A compound sentence consisting of two clauses by means of brackets, in the way of objecting or objecting up by writing vertically instead of horizontally.\n\nADVERBIAL ADJUNCTS.\n\nA.\nThe mode of writing out the Analysis of Sentences which is adopted in the Grammar, \u00a7 372, is perhaps the least troublesome; but if it be preferred, the process may be conducted by writing down at once, in horizontal lines, and at the top of parallel columns, all the possible components of the sentences that may have to be analysed, and then tabulating the results of the analysis, as in the following examples. When the subject or object of the verb is compound, with adjuncts attached to the separate members of it (e.g., 'A white man and a black man were walking together, having been separated for two or more years'), these are indicated in order, horizontally, in each column.\n\n| Sentence to be Analysed | Kind of Sentence | Subject | Attributive Adjuncts of Subject | Predicate |\n|-------------------------|-----------------|---------|--------------------------------|-----------|\n| A. \"A reader unacquainted with the real nature of a classical education, will probably undervalue it when he sees that so large a portion of time is devoted to the study of a few ancient authors whose works seem to have a direct bearing on the studies and duties of our own generation.\" | Complete sentence | Reader | 1. a | will undervalue |\n| B. \"When he sees that so large a portion of time is devoted to \u2014 generation.\" | Adverbial clause, qualifying the predicate | he | 2. unacquainted with the real nature of a classical education | sees |\n| C. \"[That] so large a portion of time is devoted to the study of a few ancient authors, whose works \u2014 generation.\" | Substantive clause, object of verb 'sees.' | portion | 1. so large | is devoted |\n| D. \"Whose works seem to have so direct bearing on the studies and duties of our own generation.\" | Adjective clause, qualifying the noun 'authors.' | works | whose | seem to have |\n| A. \"Blest he, though undistinguished from the crowd by wealth or dignity, who dwells secure, where a, by nature fierce, has laid aside his fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn, the manners and the arts of civil life.\" | Complete sentence | he | Adj. clause \u2014 [who dwells secure where man \u2014 civil life (B.)] | blest |\n| B. \"Who dwells secure where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside his fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn, the manners and the arts of civil life.\" | Adjective clause, qualifying 'he.' | who | dwells secure |\n| C. \"[Though] he be undistinguished from the crowd by wealth or dignity.\" | Compound constricted adverbial clause, qualifying the predicate verb 'is.' | he | be undistinguished |\n| It. \"Where man, by nature fierce, has laid aside his fierceness, having learnt, though slow to learn, the manners and the arts of civil life.\" | Adverbial clause, qualifying the predicate verb 'is.' | man | by nature fierce |\n| E. \"[Though] he is slow to learn.\" | Elliptical adverbial clause, qualifying having learnt. | he | is slow |\n\nIt the mode of denoting subordinate clauses which is given in \u00a7 56 be adopted in the above table, in the second sentence we may substitute (a') for (a), (b') for (b).\nwere walking together\"), the substantives forming the compound subjects may be written one underneath the other, having their proper adjuncts placed over against them in the next column. A compound sentence, consisting of two or more co-ordinate clauses, may be split up into its compound clauses by means of brackets, in the way indicated in one of the examples below. The columns may of course be filled up by writing vertically instead of horizontally, if it be found more convenient.\n\n| Predicate | Object | Attributive Adjuncts of the Complement of the Predicate | Adverbial Adjuncts |\n|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| Complex Verb of Incomplete Predication | Complex Complement | | |\n| | a.
