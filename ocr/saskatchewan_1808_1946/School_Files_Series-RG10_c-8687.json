The water at this place eats out the tubing.\n\nThis boiler was retubed in Regina once before by a firm named Springatein & Davidson, the principal took it in on a truck and got it done in half a day as this firm is equipped to give a rush job. Another time it was done by another firm who sent a man to do the work at the school.\n\nWill you please advise me if the work can be done, and what firm to employ.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDetails of boiler at Gordon School.\n\nMade by Leonard & Sons, London, Ont.\n\n26 x 4'6\"\n#291946\nVertical.\n36 tubes 2\" x 36\"\nPunnichy, Sask.\nMarch 29 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWhen I was at the Gordon Indian Residential School yesterday the principal told me that the septic tank is going out of business, he has been having a lot of trouble keeping it working. The tank was put in years ago before the present building was constructed.\n\nI knew little about septic tanks, and cannot give any estimate of probable cost if we dig into it.\n\nIf you think the engineering branch at Prince Albert, which assists us sometimes regards water systems, could check up this system, I would be obliged if you could ask them to send along one of their men. There is no special rush about this matter, but if our sewage systems get out of order we may run into typhoid trouble.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nApril 3, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo you may arrange for emergency repairs required to the boiler at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. The firm of E. H. Carter of Yorkton may be employed but you should give the work your supervision in order to make certain that no unnecessary expenditure is incurred.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa,\nApril 3, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 29th ultimo with reference to the septic tank at the Gordon's Residential School.\n\nAs you are aware our estimates for the fiscal year 1940-41 have not yet been considered by Parliament and at the present time I am unable to state what amount will be available for repairs, improvements and purchase of new equipment at the Gordon's School. I am hoping that we will be able to secure an amount of $700.00 for this school but cannot say definitely at the present time if this amount will be allowed. In the event of our securing it it will be necessary to charge against this appropriation the amount incurred in repairing the boiler. Consequently you will see that there will not be any large amount for other expenditures and our appropriation during the present fiscal year will be so limited that it will be impossible to expend more than specifically provided for each residential school.\n\nHowever, I am arranging with the Surveys & Engineering Branch to have one of their officers visit the school and report on the septic tank system but both the Principal and yourself should point out to this officer when he reaches the Gordon's School that the funds are extremely limited and that only very necessary repairs to the septic tank system should be considered.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nMr. J.

W. Waddy, resides.\n\nMr. Waddy has just reported that the septic tank at this school is giving considerable trouble and he suggests that one of your officers visit the school and inspect it.\n\nI should appreciate it if you would arrange to have this work done as soon as weather conditions permit and have your officer submit a report for our consideration. It should be pointed out to him that the funds at our disposal this year are extremely limited and consequently only the urgent repairs to the septic tank should be considered.\n\nDirector.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nMarch 29, 1940.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nRe my letter this file dated July 4th last regards stucco exterior of farm house at Gordon School requiring repairs.\n\nI have no answer to this request, but probably funds were low at time you received my letter.

However, I should appreciate it if you would state definitely if, in the event of these pipes being ordered, the use of them would possibly avoid subsequent heavy expenditure in connection with the water system. If so, I am inclined to feel that it would be advisable to secure them. It should be understood, of course, that in the event of the pipe being purchased the cost of it will be taken from the amount that may be provided in the current year's appropriation for repairs and improvements at the Gordon's School.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

The Indian Agent now writes that Mr. Snelson, of the Engineering and Construction Service, Banff, Alberta, recently visited the school. Before he makes any report he requires the following information:\n\nA blue print, or specifications, or both, of the original cess pit or septic tank put in at the Gordon School. It will be part of plan of the school built about 1921. He also would like to have plan of the original drainage from the old school to the pit and also a blue print of the ground floor of the new school built in 1930.\n\nI would appreciate your ascertaining if you can supply him with this information and, if so, it should be sent, by Air Mail, as follows:\n\nW.

If funds for that proposal are not available the repairs under proposal (b) should be undertaken.\n\nWe should be glad to undertake any of the above schemes for you if funds can be made available.\n\nDirector.\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nMr. Wardle.\n\nRe: Inspection of Sewage System at Gordon's Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nYou will recall that you forwarded this office for action a memorandum dated April 3rd, 1940, which you had received from Dr. McGill regarding an inspection required of the sewage disposal system at the above residential school, particularly in regard to the condition of the septic tank. As we had no engineers in this vicinity, it was not possible to have an inspection made until recently when Mr. Snelson visited the Gordon Residential School, and I attach copy of report received from him.\n\nThere does not appear to be much comment required on Mr. Snelson's report as the conditions are similar to those that have been found to exist in other cases, namely, both inexpert attention and maintenance of the original installation and an increase in population served by the installation over and above that for which the original installation was intended.\n\nUnder the circumstances, we have no hesitation in recommending as preferable Mr. Snelson's Proposal A at an estimated total cost of $1,500.00. However, if funds to this amount cannot be made available, there does not seem any alternative than that at least the $700.00 required for Proposal B must be expended in order to at least partially and temporarily eliminate the trouble now being experienced with the old installation.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer\n\nJ.M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa.\nNorway House, Manitoba  \nAugust 14, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Inspection Sewage System at Gordon's Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nAccompanied by the Indian Agent, Mr. J.W. Waddy, and the school principal, Mr. R.W. Freyling, I inspected the sewage disposal plant at the above school on July 10th.\n\nMr. Freyling stated that the odor from the septic tank and from its outlet into a small slough was very bad at all times, that the septic tank had become so filled that three pumpings were necessary to remove the sludge last year and that at times the sewage backs up into the school building due to the tank and outlet tiles becoming plugged. He stated also that they had upon several occasions had to dig up the outlet tiling to remove broken tiles which were obstructing the flow.\n\nI found upon looking into the tank that the bell siphon was not operating. The sewage was escaping through the overflow vent. The concrete insides of the tank appeared to be in bad condition. The soil of this locality and especially that region occupied by the disposal field is a very heavy clay\u2014quite unsuitable for the efficient operation of a disposal field.\n\nUpon examination of the plans of this septic tank received from your office I find that allowing for an accumulation of sludge to a depth of two feet there remains for effluent capacity an area 4' x 6' x 15' = 208 cu.ft. = 1800 gallons. At least a capacity of twenty gallons per capita is necessary in the effluent volume. This old tank when working with an unobstructed disposal field system would be good for 90 persons. Mr. Freyling stated that the maximum population contributing to this sewage system was from 136 to 150. The present tank is not only too small but is working inefficiently due to lack of permeability of the soil of the disposal field and to a stoppage of the flow due to crushed or broken field tile.\n\nI would therefore make the following recommendations. (a) That a new steel tank be purchased and installed. This tank to discharge into the slough through a straight line of 6\" tile. That an inexpensive homemade chlorinator costing about $10.00 be installed to pre-chlorinate the sewage and thus remove all odors and that the old tank be cleaned out and the main tile outlet to the slough be relaid and broken or unsuitable tiling removed. This old system then to be used for laundry waste disposal.\n\n(b) If there is insufficient funds to carry out the above recommendation I would then advise as an alternative that the old system be thoroughly cleaned as to both septic chambers, concrete be repaired where necessary, and all\nmain tile lines be dug up, examined and replaced with new tiles where necessary. To this system should also be added the small home made chlorinator specified above.\n\nThe following is an estimate of cost for the labour and material to carry out the above recommendations.\n\nProposal (a).\nCost of steel Septic Tank S-3000 with siphon and compartment, made by Canadian John Wood Mfg. Co. Ltd., Winnipeg, Man., P.O.B.\nPunnichy, Sask. ........................................... $428.66\n(This was a quotation of May 15, 1940.)\nThis tank is large enough for 200 persons in a School. 70\" diam x 180\" long.\nLabor Excavation & Backfill 25 c.y. @ $1.00 ....... 25.00\nFreight, Punnichy to School .................................. 25.00\n500 lineal feet of 6\" sewer tile delivered to school ......................................................... 250.00\nLabor setting tile, excavating & refilling trench .............................................................. 500.00\nChlorinator ......................................................... 10.00\nEngineering, Contingencies ........................................ 261.24\n\n$1800.00\n\nProposal (b).\nLabor, Cleanout old Septic tank ......................... $ 25.00\nLabor, Take up and relay main tile lines ............... 375.00\nMaterial, New tile 6\" (replacements) .................... 100.00\nChlorinator in place ............................................. 25.00\nEngineering, Contingencies ........................................ 175.00\n\n$ 700.00\n\nPlease advise which of the above proposals will be accepted.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(sgd) W.H.

I am inclined to feel it would be preferable to secure Hall & Cameron of Regina, the firm from whom the battery was purchased in January, 1939.\n\nWhile the report from the Globelite Batteries Limited states that the battery is deteriorating owing to overcharge they do not state any reason for this condition existing.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would advise me at once why the battery is overcharging and in view of the attached report, you should have Hall & Cameron examine the battery immediately. Please advise when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa,\nDecember 17, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a report from the Globelite Batteries Limited in which they advise as follows regarding the battery in the Gordon's Indian Residential School:\n\n\"Due to the operating conditions the battery is subjected to the positive plate material is shedding very rapidly. However we believe it will continue to serve you for some time. It is our suggestion, however, that it would be in your interests to have your lighting unit checked over very thoroughly by Mumford Medland Limited because operating as at present you cannot expect anywhere near the normal life from the battery. We are sure if you had an expert from Mumford Medland Limited to go over the lighting unit you could make the necessary changes to prevent overcharging and thereby greatly add to the life and the efficiency of the battery.\n\n\"Your present battery, which is a Globelite, type W15 - 56 Cell unit was purchased in March, 1939, at a cost of approximately $630.00 and would normally last for 5 years or more. The condition of the battery now would indicate that you cannot expect more than half of this service.\"\n\nI should appreciate your advising me at once the name and qualifications of the engineer at the Gordon's School. What has caused the battery to deteriorate so rapidly? You will note that the Company representative considers that it will not last longer than half its natural life.\n\nMr. R.W. Freyling,\nPrincipal,\nGordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDue to present conditions you must be aware that our appropriation has been reduced and that it will simply be impossible to consider supplying a new set of batteries to the Gordon's School within the time mentioned in the Company's letter. It is absolutely necessary that school Principals and other members of the staff should realize the seriousness of the present situation and exert every possible effort to preserve equipment.\n\nAn immediate reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe letter 121-1-5 of Dec 16th re lighting plant and batteries at Gordon Indian Residential School I beg to say re fourth paragraph of letter noted I already called on Hall & Cameron to examine the batteries of the plant and they sent the expert of Globelite Batteries Limited to check up and his letter of Dec 7th to Mr. Christianson is the result of his checkup, therefore as far as that has gone we can figure the battery report as complete just now.\n\nThe verbal report to me by the expert is that batteries are overcharging. This is caused by use of the two engines when laundry work is proceeding, they make more electricity than the batteries can stand, that is why the expert says check up our plant, and he asks that Mumford Medland do this work as they are the agents for the Lister plant we use. I may say that all sorts of schemes have already been tried, I would not say any of them were any good, the overcharge goes on as usual.\n\nI think the idea of getting Mumford Medland to check up is correct.\n\nNow here is an idea of the principal, we have talked it over lately. Put in a gasoline engine to run the power machines in the laundry and hook it onto the shaft with a belt. It would cost according to size of machine needed and cost of a few changes, not many.\n\nWhy run a big plant to charge batteries to run electric motors to run the laundry when we can run a gas engine and cut out all the frills. I am not an engineer or expert but this idea looks O.K. The expert from Mumford Medland or someone else has to check up the plant to correct the battery overcharge and he could make a small plan for you at the same time of the size of gas engine we would want, cost etc. We would have the noise of a gas engine in the laundry but cannot help that.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Department is not by any means satisfied with the explanations that have already reached us. We are still under the impression that the engineer at this school is not handling the machinery in the proper manner and it is, therefore, hoped that the report of Mumford Medland will definitely clear up this matter.\n\nAs you state there are already two engines at the school and the Department does not see any necessity for purchasing another.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nIndian Department, Ottawa.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe Lister Generating Engine.\n\nAnswering your letter regarding Batteries for above. This same condition has been present since the instalment, and in 1932 Mumford Medland's expert, Mr. Montgomery, was here for I think three days, and if my memory is correct he said that there was not anything that could be done to eliminate the overcharging when the Large Engine is carrying the charge used for the laundry, which is on Mondays and Wednesdays.\n\nThe engineer at present, George Ryan, carries a Second Class Certificate, but this trouble has nothing whatever to do with the Engineer, Staff or anyone else. It is the engine. The Chief Provincial Government Engineer, when I was speaking to him for the services of an engineer said there was not any real need for other than a Fireman's Certificate.\nfor our plant, but I have always had a 1st or 2nd certificated Engineer. The fact that your attention has been drawn to this matter is from my own complaint, as the attached letter explains. Knowing that the cells were warped, I spoke to Mr. Waddy, asking if he had any guarantee on file, as I had only heard it verbally. Eventually the Sales Manager of Globelite came and looked the batteries over, with the same remark, that it was the engine. He did not just drop in on his own accord, but through the complaint made by myself.\n\nI have spent all kinds of money trying to remedy this condition, and have had experts from Regina, Lestock, and many electricians, one of whom said he could right the trouble. On asking how much it would cost, \"Oh, not more than fifty dollars.\" I said I would give him $50.00 on this guarantee if it proved successful. He installed an additional rheostat, but to no purpose. I am not an electrician or an engineer, but from the first I could see no other way to offset this overcharge, (which is the sole trouble) than to disconnect the generator from the engine shaft (if it is possible), whilst using the power for laundry.\n\nTo impress upon you there is not any reason to suppose there is laxity on my own part or on the part of any of the Staff, or that any inference of waste or extravagance is justified, I will mention that in my ten years of service I will have an average of being on duty at this school from 5:45 to 6 o'clock A.M. until 8 o'clock P.M. without rest during the day except on Sundays, -one hour later rising bell.\n\nTo improve the condition of the Batteries in question, and also to prove my interest, I have had an estimate (which is attached) for the installation of a Gas Engine, which would eliminate the Lister Engine entirely from the laundry power, and so overcome the battery trouble,\nso that the life of the battery would then be ten years instead of five years. Knowing that the cost of the septic tank was very much less than it was estimated, and that you had an appropriation for that $700, I thought perhaps the balance could be assigned for this purpose.\n\nIn conclusion I will add that I fully realize that the responsibility rests with myself, not the Staff. If waste of any kind is noticed, it doesn't matter if in Engine Room, Kitchen or with School Supplies, Drugs etc., a check is made, and the fact that I carry a surplus from the Per Capita Grant is proof of there being little waste here.\n\nI forgot to mention that the Globelite Manager told me he was going to take up the matter of the engine with Mumford Medland, of Winnipeg. There is not anything wrong with the engines. They are overhauled twice a year, and the tone of your letter assures me that the report given you by Globelite is somewhat of a get out, but it does not alter the fact that a 5-year guarantee was given, and same should be in force, because the conditions here are the same as they have always been. This reply gives the absolute facts of the case, and the only sane solution is, I think, the proposition attached, which would leave the engines free from the heavy load which now overcharges the Batteries when running.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe principal sentence is not in the School\nOttawa,\nDecember 28, 1940.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant with reference to the batteries at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I wrote to Indian Agent Waddy yesterday and instructed him to have the lighting plant thoroughly checked by Mumford Medland Limited and a report submitted to this Department. It is expected that this report will contain definite information regarding the manner in which the present condition has arisen.\n\nIt is evident from your letter that for some time you have been aware of the overcharging of the batteries. It is difficult to understand why this matter was not brought to our attention previously.\n\nIn connection with the suggestion that another engine be purchased to operate the laundry I do not see the necessity for doing this when there are already two engines at the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

I would thank you to give me all information possible to lengthen the life. The last set of your batteries is less than 5\u00bd years.\n\nThis plant consists of two Lister Automatic Generating Engines viz. one - 6\u00bd, the other 13 H.P. If these are cut off how many lights will the batteries carry?\n\nThe batteries are always overcharging. How can this be avoided?\n\nThe large engine is used twice a week to drive the Laundry machinery. This charges the batteries all the time it is running. Can this be avoided?\n\nAny suggestions or information regarding the care of the batteries will be much appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal,\nGordon's School.\nFeb. 4th\n\nThe Mumford - Medland Co.

If, however, the school management is willing to incur this expenditure we have no objection and, in the event of their engaging him, his report should be submitted for our consideration.\n\nI feel that it should be possible to engage an efficient man to examine the plant at this school and submit an intelligent report. If he cannot be obtained in the vicinity of the school it should be possible to secure someone in Regina. If the school management does not obtain Mumford Medland's expert at their own expense you may make immediate arrangements to secure a man of the type just mentioned.

The entire 8-inch tile line from the tank to the slough was taken up, cleaned, and relaid to a true grade. Broken tiles - 120 feet - were replaced. A small chlorinator was installed in the boiler room and discharges into the sewer line to the septic tank. The tile in the disposal field, which was adequate for 50 or 40 persons only, was completely clogged and as it was laid in a heavy, water-logged, clay soil, it was cut off from the main sewage line as quite useless. At present the chlorinated sewage discharges into a small slough.\n\nIf at some future date the present arrangements prove to be inadequate, a new disposal field will have to be constructed.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ.

Waddy,\nIndian Agent, Punnichy.\n\nDear Mr. Waddy,\n\nOn reference I find Apr. 22/35 Mumford Medland Co. write regarding the Batteries then in use viz. 108 ampere be replaced with 240 ampere hour, which would give greater efficiency and give double the storage amperage.\n\nThe automatic features of our plant now are nil and have been for a considerable time, meaning that the engineer has to go to the engine room late every night to stop the engine, whereas previously it could be set to automatically stop on the batteries becoming fully charged, which it did on the original batteries. At present the engine is running twice as long as it should be, and costing twice as much. Personally I doubt if there would be any question as to replacement on the guarantee.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the original batteries viz. 108 ampere hour (I think they were Delco) lasted five years, and that these last two instalments of 240 ampere hour Globelight are only\naveraging 2 years, with same plant running conditions. This is my own personal opinion, and I don't think that a company of the Globelight reputation would hesitate, or like such an exposure as the comparison given.\n\nI may be getting in wrong for trying to economize, but it has been forcibly pointed out that Principal and Staff should realize present conditions and preserve equipment as much as possible, which is what I have and am trying to do since 1930.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe have your letter of February 15, advising that you have had your Lister Lighting unit checked over and it was found to be in good condition.\n\nIt has always been our opinion that you would not find anything mechanically wrong with the plant. What we were chiefly interested in was to have the plant so that the battery would automatically cut out of the circuit when it became fully charged. The way you are operating now, as we understand it is that you have no automatic control cutting out the battery when it becomes charged. The result that it is cycled everyday whether it needs it or not, and given a particularly heavy charge when it is necessary to operate the laundry.\n\nAn experienced engineer who is thoroughly familiar with operating the plant and the batteries could control this over charging to a large extent, but it would require a certain amount of attention during the time the plant is charging, but your real solution would be automatic control.\n\nThis is one of the chief reasons why we suggested the Mumford Medland Co. Ltd., checking the plant because they could make certain recommendations that would prove beneficial.\n\nIn our letter of December 7, we were willing to acknowledge you would not receive the normal service from this battery, for this reason we proposed an adjustment when it was necessary to replace it. We will supply a new battery for $454.72 f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nWe are quite prepared to work on your suggestion of checking the electrolyte or acid in the battery, and suggest that you send in a 40 ounce bottle. You can use a liquor bottle for this purpose. Take acid from several cells not just a few when filling the bottle.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nSales Manager.\n\nWESTERN CANADA'S LARGEST BATTERY MANUFACTURERS\nMr. J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs requested by you I have today visited the Gordon's Indian Residential School, and have checked over the Lister electric lighting plant and the Globelite batteries. My findings are as follows:\n\n(1) The Lister Lighting plant is in very good condition, both mechanically and electrically, and has the proper facilities to control the output of the generators.\n\n(2) That the 240 ampere hour 50 cell Globelite battery is in very bad condition and un-economical to operate in as much as it will not take the charge. It appears that the positive plates have shed badly, and the negative plates are in a very unusual condition for this type of battery. They are swelled and spongy and have a fungi-like substance protruding from them.\n\nIt appears to me that there is something wrong with the electrolyte in these batteries, and must contain some substance detrimental to the plates, such as Iron or some other soluble mineral. I took the matter of the kind of water\nused to replenish the evaporation; which Mr. Eayling and the Engineer, and find that nothing has been used but supposedly pure distilled water, kept in glass containers and purchased from the bottling works at Yorkton, Sask., which should not contain minerals.\n\nFrom my experience I would say that the batteries do not show signs of serious overcharging for a normal battery, but if there is, as I suspect, minerals in the electrolyte which would close the pores of the plates, they would be unable to take a normal charge.\n\nI am of the opinion that, considering the possible output of the generators, and the amount of current used at the school, that a larger capacity battery should be used. I would recommend that the batteries should be replaced with a 300 Ampere hour capacity size, and that you have the electrolyte analyzed at the time of installation. In this way I am sure you would get much longer service and better satisfaction, for as I have already mentioned, this Lister plant has every facility to give a battery the best of care.\n\nI have adjusted the Governor on the larger unit in order to generate a little lower voltage than it had previously been delivering.\n\nYours truly,\n\nAlex. Shaw.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nFeb 21 1941.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nRe letters file 121-1-5 of Jan 17th and Feb 17th in connection with Gordon Indian Residential School lighting plant.\n\nExcuse me for delay in answering, but I have been working on this affair.\n\nI talked over with the principal the matter of getting someone to examine the plant and we decided that Mr. Alex Shaw of Lestock, Sask., could make the report as he was qualified.\n\nEnclosed find his report, it blames the electrolyte in the batteries for the trouble. When I got the report I wrote to the Globelite Batteries Co. Winnipeg and asked how it would be best to get a test of the electrolyte and they have advised me how to proceed. Their letter is also enclosed and when I get the report it will be sent to you at once, I have shipped them a sample as they requested.\n\nLetters from the principal are also enclosed, I make no comment of them, they just show that he blames the make of battery we supply.\n\nWhen I get the bill for services from Mr. Shaw a voucher in his favor will be sent in.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nFebruary 26, 1941.\n\nEXT.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant with reference to the lighting plant at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is noted that you have forwarded a sample of the electrolyte to Globelite Batteries Limited and as soon as you obtain their report it should be forwarded to this office for consideration.\n\nThe second paragraph of the Principal's letter of February 12 reads in part as follows:\n\"The automatic features of our plant now are nil and have been for a considerable time.\" Please let me know when the automatic control of the batteries was discontinued. Was it due to the fault of the firm installing the batteries or should the matter have received the attention of the school management?\n\nIt is understood that when the set of batteries at present in the school was installed in 1938 the firm supplied a five-year guarantee.

Christianson\n\nDear Sir:\n\nA short time ago we called at the Gordon School near Punnichy to examine the Gobelite Battery purchased the early part of 1939. Mr. Waddy wrote us on October 15, suggesting that we make this call.\n\nDue to the operating conditions the battery is subjected to the positive plate material is shedding very rapidly. However we believe it will continue to serve you for some time. It is our suggestion, however, that it would be in your interests to have your lighting unit checked over very thoroughly by Mumford Medland Limited because operating as at present you cannot expect anywhere near the normal life from the battery. We are sure if you had an expert from Mumford Medland Limited to go over the lighting unit you could make the necessary changes to prevent overcharging and thereby greatly add to the life and the efficiency of the battery.\n\nYour present battery, which is a Gobelite, type W13 - 56 Cell unit was purchased in March, 1939, at a cost of approximately $630.00 and would normally last for 5 years or more. The condition of the battery now would indicate that you cannot expect more than half of this service. However to help you out we are willing to replace this battery when it comes time for replacement with a new one of the same size and capacity for $454.72 f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nThe plant should be gone over very thoroughly before putting in a new battery, otherwise you will be up against the same problem that has existed in the past.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED,\n\nSgd.

Waddy, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe regret there has been a delay in forwarding you an analysis of the Electrolyte that you sent in to us sometime ago. We ourselves have taken an analysis of the water and to be absolutely sure of our own analysis we sent it to Milton Hersey Company Limited of this city to make an analysis to compare with our own findings. Both analyses are almost identical.\n\nWe are enclosing herewith report received from Milton Hersey Company Limited and you will note that there are impurities which are harmful to a battery. Apparently the party that looks after your plant and battery has been using water that is unsuitable for replacing evaporation.\n\nFor your information in cases of this kind we cannot be held responsible for battery failure and an adjustment should not be in order. However although we have every right to withdraw our quotation as outlined in our letter of December 7th we will deviate from our regular procedure and leave our quotation stand.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\n\nRR/EAW\nEnc. 1.\nREPORT\n\n62375 - ELECTROLYTE - PURPORTED CONTAMINATED WITH WATER\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited,\n146 Alexander Avenue,\nWINNIPEG, Manitoba.\n\nAttention of Mr. R.

Hoey Esq.,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDep't. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Globelite Batteries.\n\nYou will have received the result of the analysis of Electrolyte by Milton Hersey Co., Winnipeg through the Globelite Company. I will draw to your attention their notation on the assumption of Globelite that Well Water had been used and presumably the cause of the present condition of the Batteries. I want to point out that they (the Globelite) have not any reason whatsoever to suggest such, and I have the right to think that the foreign matter found was not there when the sample was taken from this School. The Sask. Provincial Laboratories findings of the only water we use here for every purpose does not contain these solids shown by Milton Hersey Co., the copy of which is attached.\n\nSince I received the above report from Mr. Waddy, I forwarded to Provincial Laboratories a sample of acid taken from various Batteries just in the same way as that when taken from the School and forwarded to Globelite, the only difference that the sample I sent was to the Public Provincial analyst and that to Winnipeg to the party interested. I also forwarded a sample of Distilled Water used when the Batteries called for addition, the report of both being attached. This water is purchased from Yorkton Bottling Co.\n\nThe inference by the Globelite Co. that Well Water was used leads me to think that something happened to the\nsample reaching Winnipeg. There is not any water at all near the Batteries here but the Distilled Water mentioned, and I have just as much right (being responsible for everything here) to think there was interference in Winnipeg (and more so) than they have to suggest before the analysis by Milton Hersey that Well Water had been used in this School's Batteries.\n\nHelli and Cameron, Regina, I believe gave the guarantee for the Batteries, but there does not seem to be any word from them, and it is usual for the company supplying to investigate such a complaint of inferior goods and help to satisfy a customer, more especially where such a sum of money is involved.\n\nI don't think for a moment that they, Helli & Cameron ever saw these Batteries, but naturally benefited by the sale, and I would suggest that they also approach the Globelite Co. and use pressure to remedy the complaint, as Helli and Cameron are the firm from whom direct purchase was made.\n\nThe department (and rightly too) are always reminding us of the absolute necessity of strict economy which grants me to suggest that such a matter as this with the most definite proof of Faulty Production, force the replacement of these Batteries in their entirety, or a very substantial concession.\n\nIn conclusion I imagine that even the Globelite Co. could make an error, and the whole trouble could come from the Electrolyte before being put into the Glass Containers.\n\nThis is a lengthy report, but is the only way to give the real honest facts of this serious trouble. The Batteries are in bad shape right now.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal, Gordon School\nGordon's Anglican Indian Residential School\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nPRINCIPAL\nR.W.

Following a special report on the lighting plant at the Gordon's School submitted by Mumford Medland in 1935 a new set of Globelite batteries was placed in the school in September of that year. It was necessary to replace these batteries in January, 1939, and last fall we were again advised that the batteries had to be replaced. I have before me a copy of a letter dated December 7, 1940, and signed by your Sales Manager in which he states that he has examined the batteries at the Gordon's School and that their condition indicated that we could not expect that the batteries would operate for more than half of their normal life.\n\nI think you will agree with me that the above condition is very unsatisfactory. The life of the batteries that we have purchased from your firm is considerably below the length stipulated when purchase was made. A special examination made by an expert called in by the school authorities states:\n\n\"It appears that there is something wrong with the Electrolyte in these batteries.\"\n\nIt was then suggested that an analysis of the Electrolyte be made by Milton Hersey Co. Ltd.\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited,\n147 Pacific Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Man.\nof Winnipeg. You have a copy of this analysis which is as follows:\n\n| ANALYSIS          | % by weight |\n|-------------------|-------------|\n| Iron sulphate     | 0.0082%     |\n| Sodium chloride   | 0.0003%     |\n| Calcium sulphate  | 0.0077%     |\n| Magnesium sulphate| 0.0195%     |\n| Lead sulphate     | 0.0032%     |\n| Sodium sulphate   | 0.0343%     |\n| Nitrates          | none        |\n| Fixed residue     | 0.0732%     |\n\nThe Principal had the school water (which is lake water) analysed by the Department of Public Health, Division of Laboratories, Regina, and their analysis is as follows:\n\n| ANALYSIS          | % by weight |\n|-------------------|-------------|\n| Iron sulphate     | nil         |\n| Sodium chloride   | 1%          |\n| Calcium sulphate  | nil         |\n| Magnesium sulphate| nil         |\n| Lead sulphate     | nil         |\n| Sodium sulphate   | 1%          |\n| Nitrates          | none        |\n\nThe analysis of the water used at the school by the Provincial Department of Public Health shows that if the water available at the school had been used it would not adversely affect the batteries. However, in order that no chance might be taken the Principal assures me that for several years past he has only used distilled water in the batteries. A sample of the distilled water used in the batteries as well as a sample of the Electrolyte was forwarded to the Department of Public Health, Division of Laboratories, Regina. This is their report:\n\n\"The sample of water was too small for any detailed examination, but appeared to have traces of Calcium and Sulphate. These would not be particularly\ndeleterious to the battery, and since there were no heavy metals I think that the source of the difficulty lies elsewhere than in the water, unless this sample of water was taken from a better supply than you usually use.\n\n\"The battery acid contains more iron than it should, otherwise it appears to be about the same as usual when taken from the battery.\n\n\"It would appear that the manufacturers of the Globelite batteries ought to investigate this matter more thoroughly for their own satisfaction as well as yours.\"\n\nIt is quite evident from the above that there is some factor which deteriorates these batteries and makes them very unsatisfactory for our purpose. It is difficult for us to draw definite conclusions but the above reports are quite suggestive.\n\nThis Department feels that at the Gordon's School we have not received the service from the Globelite batteries that we have a right to expect and consequently we believe that the only fair way to deal with the matter is for your company to replace these batteries immediately without charge to this Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nOttawa, April 17, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have for acknowledgment your letter of the 2nd instant, in which you submit a requisition for the paint necessary to paint the barn and other outside buildings at the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nA requisition for the paint will be sent forward to the Purchasing Agent and shipment will be made to the school in due course.\n\nI am not at all sure, however, that we can authorize the purchase of the engine that appears to be necessary to operate the laundry machinery. There is in this year's estimates an item of $250.00 for general repairs at the Gordon School, and this is the only expenditure for which provision has been made, with the exception of an item set apart for the construction of a sewage disposal system. I should like to know if it is your intention to proceed with the construction of the sewage disposal plant at this school during the coming year. If it is not your intention to so proceed, consideration can be given to the purchase of the engine referred to in your communication. It would appear, from the records, however, that the present sewage disposal plant is inadequate for the school and should be reconstructed and enlarged.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A.

Hoey\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: File 121-1-5\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter April 10th with regard to the 56 Cell 110 Volt Globelite Battery in the Gordon Residential School at Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWe agree with you that you have not had anywhere near the guaranteed service of five years from this battery, in fact the actual life received from the battery is approximately 24 months and we are prepared to credit you with three years unused service on the purchase price of a new battery. That is to say, the battery is guaranteed for five years and we will allow 3/5 of this as a credit. The Department will only be asked to pay for the actual service received from the battery and these are the customary terms outlined in our guarantee.\n\nWe feel there are many reasons why this battery didn't stand up and give the service you have a right to expect, and when we say this we are not shirking our responsibility; and the fact we are willing to adjust on the basis of the actual service received from the battery is ample proof of this.\n\nAs we pointed out in a previous letter your plant is connected up in such a way that you are charging and cycling the battery every day whether it needs it or not and on days when you operate the laundry charging is continuous while the laundry is in operation. These combined circumstances have resulted in the battery being constantly overcharged.\n\nWe, of course, have brought this to the attention of Mr. Waddy and the Principal of the school and they are quite aware if they are to establish ideal operating conditions, it is necessary to have an automatic voltage control attached to the lighting unit.\nwhich will automatically cut the battery out of the circuit when it becomes fully charged. You perhaps know the ideal operating conditions of any lighting unit can only be achieved when you have rest periods for four or five days. That is to say, a battery should be large enough to carry the load without charging for a period as stated above and it is only reasonable to expect the longer the battery carries the load without charging, the greater will be the life of the battery.\n\nThe school Principal mentioned to the writer it has been necessary to change engineers frequently and it is very difficult to obtain the service of experienced engineers, more particularly engineers who are familiar with lighting units. This, we believe, in some measure has affected the efficiency of the battery.\n\nWhile the Electrolyte in the battery now appears to contain impurities that are harmful to the battery, we feel certain that these impurities were not in the Electrolyte when the battery was received by the school, consequently it is not a manufacturing fault. We feel definitely sure of this because if there were any impurities it would naturally show up in other batteries manufactured at the same time and we have not experienced any trouble of this nature.\n\nWe draw these various points to your attention Mr. Hoey not because we wish to avoid the issue but so that conditions of this kind can be guarded against occurring in the future.\n\nYour old battery was our type W13, 270 Ampere Hour capacity, and gave you approximately 24 months service. As it was guaranteed five years you are entitled to a credit of 3/5 of the original value on the purchase price of a new battery.\n\nWe would recommend however a larger capacity battery, viz., our type W17, 360 Ampere Hour capacity, value $962.50. We are prepared to supply this battery for $450.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg which represents a discount of roughly $512.50. This is considerably more than 3/5 of the value of your present battery.\n\nIn submitting this adjustment, we have tried to be entirely fair and if you will send your order direct to this office we will have shipment go forward immediately.

Thurston,\nSales Manager.\nOttawa,\nApril 24, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 21st ultimo and previous correspondence in regard to the battery at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. We have communicated with the Globelite Batteries Limited and they are prepared to supply a new battery at approximately 2/5 of the list price. This means that the firm recognizes that the battery at present in the school has not given as much service as could be expected.\n\nThe battery at present in use is Globelite Type W13, 270 ampere hour capacity. Do you consider that a battery of the same size would provide for the electrical requirements at this school? It is understood, of course, that the battery would only be used for lighting purposes and not for the operation of any other machinery. As you are aware, a larger battery would be much more costly and if the same size as that already in the school is sufficient the Department is prepared to proceed with its purchase immediately.\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe letter #121-1-5 of April 17th regards Gordon Indian Residential School I note that the paint will be supplied, thanks for this.\n\nYour third paragraph states that it may not be possible to supply the engine to operate the laundry machinery, the engine is needed and I hope some way can be devised to get the necessary funds.\n\nThe note regards sewage disposal plant not being adequate is something new, the principal says he thinks it was put in proper condition last fall, a lot of work was done by the engineering branch and as for myself I thought it was completed, however, you could take this up with the engineering branch and make certain. If it was a complete job last fall no more expense will be incurred in the near future on that part.\n\nThe battery job is still outstanding, this means a lot of money for someone to pay, you may not figure on the department paying any of the replacement cost, I just mention it as an outstanding matter in connection with this school.\n\nTo-day the principal told me that the tubes put in the vertical tubular boiler by the E.H.Carter firm in April 1938, voucher 103, $125.00, are leaking and another job will be needed there, this matter will be taken up in another letter when I get a written report from the principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nApril 26, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 21st instant regarding the Gordon's Indian Residential School, no decision will be made about the engine until I receive a reply to my letter of the 24th instant regarding the batteries.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Four tubes are now leaking.\n\nThe principal says the tubes may be of lighter make than those used formerly. Mr. Carter tells me the tubes are 12 ga, three inch tubes and are standard.\n\nWill you please tell me if the boiler may be repaired at government expense, the cost might be similar to the 1938 job.

On reviewing the cost of repairing the boiler in 1938 it was found that at that time it was necessary to supply 54 three inch tubes. Consequently as only 4 new tubes are required now the cost should only be a fraction of what it was in 1938.\n\nIf it is a matter of repairing only 4 tubes you may proceed with the work at once. If, however, the expenditure is going to be much larger you should write again giving an estimate of the cost.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.W.

Another matter that might help out is that there is a very competent engineer at the Gordon School now.\n\nIt would therefore appear to be in order to go ahead and replace the present set of batteries with those you mention.

I beg to say that the engineer says he uses about four to five kilowatts per hour at present, that he operates twelve hours or more.\n\nRegards the proposed new set of batteries the principal states that if the engine is supplied for laundry he would only use the batteries for the lighting proper. I know the place well and this is also my view.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nPunnichy, Sask.\nMay 14 1941.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe letter 121-1-5 of April 30th regards repairs for boiler at Gordon School I have taken up this matter and the principal says that the damage to the tubes is in the main part of each tube, if it had been just at the end we could have probably expanded them and carried on. However, as four tubes are gone it would appear that the balance of them are in poor condition, we have no way of knowing until they break down, therefore we may have to get the whole boiler retubed.\n\nThe principal says the boiler is not used very much now as the weather has got warm but that it will have to be put in shape before next fall.\n\nMy view is that we pay Carter of Yorkton to come here some day and investigate and report on this boiler, offer him his cost of transport by car. Your obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nReport on the Gordon School\n\nI wish to inform you that I have just returned from a trip to the Touchwood Agency, and the first place visited was the Gordon School. The last time I visited this school was about twelve years ago.\n\nIn company with the Principal and the Indian Agent I inspected the Institution from top to bottom and also looked over the out-buildings. The school, as a whole, is in first class state of repair and is well kept. I found everything in order and the furniture and equipment well taken care of.\n\nThere was some correspondence last Summer about the primary classroom, which was being operated in the basement, but upon seeing it I have a very much different opinion about it. A partition of V joist was put up to separate the classroom from the playroom, and at the top of the partition there is a transom that can be opened. The floor of the basement is only a foot below ground level so at the front of the classroom the bottom of the window is just about 1\u00bd ft. above the floor, which gives this room ample light and ventilation.\n\nThere were about 101 children present at the time of my visit. The Principal did not know that I was coming, therefore he had no opportunity to make any preparations for my visit. I was there for lunch and went into the dining room and saw the meal being served. In my opinion these children are well fed and well. There was no one sick at the School. They have lots of milk, as they were milking 14 cows when I was there, and have several more to freshen. They have about 50 head of cattle and also keep pigs and chickens. In addition to this they have several good teams of work horses.\n\nThe Principal showed me his books and the financial standing of the School is good. Mr. Frayling is a real good business man and everything is purchased......\neverything is purchased wholesale, taking full advantage of the discounts. A lot of interior repairs have been carried out from year to year by the Principal but the exterior of the School, such as window frames and doors, etc., is weather-beaten and will require painting sooner or later. The outside buildings also need painting. However, whether this can be carried out or not is immaterial. I was informed that the batteries on the lighting plant in the School are being replaced.\n\nI noticed that a lot of work has been done around the grounds, such as fixing up driveways and the road into the School, planting trees and hedges, etc., during the last few years, and in conclusion would say that this is a very well managed establishment.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

It was referred to our Engineering and Construction Service who in turn took it up with Mr. Snelson who was personally familiar with the situation and this has resulted in some delay.\n\nA brief review of the situation indicates that a 56-cell, 252 Ampere-hour Globelite battery guaranteed for five years, was purchased in January, 1939, and after about two year's service was in very poor condition.\n\nThe matter was investigated as thoroughly as possible but from the evidence produced it appears to be impossible to state definitely whether the fault lay in the electrolyte used or in the battery supplied. An analysis of the electrolyte showed that it contained harmful impurities and it was suggested that as calcium and magnesium salts were present, well water had been added to the cells. Principal Grayling, however, states that only distilled water obtained from a bottling company in Yorkton has been used. Analyses of this and the water used for ordinary purposes at the school showed no impurities which would be harmful to the battery.\n\nThe Globelite Company claims also that the failure is the result of continued overcharging while operating the motor-driven laundry equipment, but Mr. A. Shaw,\ninvestigating on behalf of the school, states that the lighting plant is in very good condition both mechanically and electrically, and has every facility to give a battery the best of care. Both Mr. Shaw and the Globelite Company have recommended the use of a battery of larger capacity, 300 to 360 Ampere-hours. We believe that this would ameliorate the situation but might not remedy it, as operating conditions would remain the same.\n\nIn your memorandum of May 21st you advised that the Indian Agent and the Principal of the school suggested that a 5-H.P. gasoline engine be purchased to operate the laundry machinery. This would relieve the batteries of this load, and Mr. Shaw offered to install this complete for $186. If overcharging was the cause of the failure, this would be a remedy, and if the failure was due to other causes the reduction in load would tend to increase the life of the batteries.\n\nMr. Snelson pointed out that since the combined output of the two engines now installed at the school is 20\u00bd H.P., it would not be economical to eliminate the 5 H.P. motor and incur the first cost and operating charges of another gasoline engine. Instead he recommended that the wiring at the switchboard and where necessary in the powerhouse be so arranged as to permit cutting out the battery entirely during the time that the heavy laundry motor is in operation. This could be done by sending the current directly into the distribution system through a line bypassing the battery. By such an arrangement the battery would be at rest during the day, or when most heavy work is done with the motors, and would serve mainly for lighting purposes. Mr. Snelson estimates the cost of such re-wiring with switches, and including labour, at $100.\n\nAfter due consideration the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, has recommended that advantage be taken of the Globelite Company's offer of a credit of three-fifths of the original cost of the battery representing the unused portion of the guaranteed life, and the purchase of another 252 Ampere-hour battery to be used for lighting purposes only, and a gasoline engine, as mentioned above, to operate the laundry equipment. The estimated cost of both would\nbe $596.40, less 60%, or $238.56, together with $186.00 for the gasoline engine installation, making a total cost of $424.56. It might be noted that this is less than the Globelite Company's offer to supply a new 360 Ampere-hour battery at a cost of $450.00 f.o.b. Winnipeg.\n\nWe concur in Mr. Mills' recommendation, though with some reluctance as the installation of another gasoline engine will cost $86.00 more than a re-wiring job and will be another item of mechanical equipment to operate and maintain. However, in view of the fact that the difference in cost is not very great, and after considering past experience and all the circumstances, we consider that this is the best policy.\n\nIn this connection I would recommend that a careful record be kept of the internal condition of the new batteries as to amount of distilled water introduced, charge as determined by suitable hydrometer, deposition of sediment, etc., and that the plant engineer give the battery the exact care specified by its makers. Distilled water should be secured from only most reliable dealers.\n\nJ.M. Wardle,\nDirector.\nOttawa, July 18, 1941.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER.\n\nRe: Lighting Plant, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI desire to refer to Mr. Jackson's memorandum of May 7, in connection with our requisition for a set of batteries for the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt has taken some time to obtain the desired information, one reason for this being that the Surveys and Engineering Branch, to whom the matter was submitted, considered it necessary to have one of their field men visit the school. Advantage was also taken of Mr. Doucet's visit to western Canada to have him go to the Gordon's school and make a careful check of the mechanical plant. For your information I enclose a copy of the report of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nMr. Doucet found that there is no 5 horse power motor at this school. Up to the present the laundry has been operated by means of an overhead shaft from the 14 horse power Lister and not from the batteries, as intimated by Mr. Nelson. This evidently has been causing the overcharging.\n\nOn his return Mr. Doucet discussed the whole matter with officials of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and it is considered that the following action will meet the situation satisfactorily:\n\n1. Take advantage of the Globelite Company's offer of a credit of 3/5 of the original cost of the battery, representing the unused portion of its guaranteed life, and the purchase of another -\nanother 252 ampere-hour battery, to be used for lighting purposes.\n\nWith our requisition of May 5 there was included the Globalite Company's letter of April 14, 1941, in which this offer was made.\n\n2. Operate the laundry equipment from the 6\u00bd horse power Lister instead of from the 14 horse power. This can easily be done by changing the drive pulley from the 14 H.P. Lister to the 6\u00bd H. P. Lister and shortening the drive belt. In addition, the electrical generator should be disconnected from the 6\u00bd H. P. Lister and operated indirectly by means of pulleys and belts.\n\nI might add that the school management has recently engaged a new engineer, whom Mr. Doucet interviewed. It is believed that this engineer is fully competent to handle the equipment. However, specific instructions are being issued to him.\n\nI trust that this memorandum supplies the information desired by Mr. Jackson and that immediate arrangements will be made to supply a new battery on the terms mentioned above.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Director.\nDear Mr. Waddy:\n\nRe: Batteries & Low Pressure Boiler\n\nI have repeatedly drawn attention to the condition of the above, with no results. Last Friday, Wash Day the corrosion on the plates of the Batteries got disturbed, turning the acid quite black. This, I think, is dangerous.\n\nThe Low Pressure Boiler cannot be used again until it is re-tubed. When Mr. Duce was here recently, I drew these to his attention, and I believe he was of the opinion that both were in bad shape and needed immediate attention.\n\nThis is the last time I shall report on these two absolute necessities, as no notice seems to be given them, and am doing so now, only that in the event of serious happenings the blame cannot be put on my shoulders.\n\nYou knowing the conditions will I am sure agree that something should be done.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal, Gordon School\nPunnichy, Sask.\nJuly 12 1941.\n\nDear Sir;-\n\nRegards batteries and low pressure boiler at Gordon Indian Residential School. I have the honor to enclose letter from the principal, both these items should be attended to.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nJuly 29th, 1941.\n\nGentlemen,\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 23rd instant, and tender on battery, we note with regret that you have not, as requested, tendered on a W13 - 270 A.H. 56 cell Globelite Battery, and have not indicated the amount of trade-in allowance on the similar set of Globelite batteries supplied to the Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan, early in January, 1939.\n\nIn view of the fact that the new battery will be used exclusively in connection with the lighting plant, (other arrangements having been made for the operation of laundry equipment), and since we have purchased a considerable number of your batteries for use in Indian Schools and Agencies, we trust that you will be good enough to reconsider the matter and to furnish the desired quotation on a W13 - 270 A.H. battery, with the usual guarantee and with a favourable trade-in allowance on the old battery on the basis of your original offer.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nActing Departmental Purchasing Agent.\n\nGlobelite Batteries Limited,\n147 Pacific Avenue,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nRe: Electric Equipment at Gordon School.\n\nCeiling - 2 supports for shelf. [illegible]\n\nLaundry Equipment\n\nSpecifications:\n1. 37A generator to be moved towards the batteries and raised if necessary.\n2. Pulley at A is the one taken from the 14 H. P. motor; all pulleys are to be of the same size.\n3. Pulley pulley A to be removed and replaced by the one to the laundry equipment when that equipment is to be used.\n\nNew material required: 3 pulleys, 2 belts, one shelf, 2 shelf hangers.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, July 31, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of the 12th instant and previous letters with regard to the batteries and low pressure boiler at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nFor various reasons beyond our control, it has taken some time to decide on the type of battery required at the Gordon's School, but we have now made a decision and the Purchasing Branch is arranging to secure a new set of batteries at the earliest possible date.\n\nThe whole electrical equipment should be re-adjusted. This will necessitate operating the laundry equipment from the 6\u00bd H. P. Lister instead of from the 14 H. P. Lister. This can easily be done by changing the drive pulley from the 14 H. P. Lister to the 6\u00bd H. P. Lister and shortening the drive belt. In addition, the electrical generator should be disconnected from the 6\u00bd H. P. Lister and operated indirectly by means of pulleys and belts. I enclose, for the information of the Principal and yourself, a diagram of the manner in which the electrical equipment should be re-arranged. It will only be necessary to purchase three pulleys, two belts, one shaft and two shaft hangers. This will not involve any large amount and you may arrange for local purchase. It is my intention to write you later -\n\nEncl.\n\nMr. J. W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nyou later regarding the batteries. The Department must insist that the school management give these batteries proper attention, as it is impossible for us to consider replacing batteries at the Gordon's School as often as we have been obliged to do so within recent years.\n\nIn regard to the low pressure steam boiler you may arrange with Mr. Carter of Yorkton, to examine the boiler carefully and submit a detailed statement of the work that is needed to put it in good condition and at the same time give an estimate of the cost for both material and labour.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES\n\nMay 5, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Gordon's Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE: 76 Allotment: 12-422\n\nSHIP TO: Mr. R.W.

See purchase order No. 9390. The set has proved unsatisfactory and this Branch has had considerable correspondence recently with the Globelite Batteries Limited. For your information I enclose letter dated April 15, 1941, received from the company. You will note that the company suggests a larger capacity battery. In regard to this suggestion I wrote to the Indian Agent and enclose a copy of his reply. Under the circumstances I feel that the battery ordered on this requisition is sufficient to meet the needs of the school and according to the promise of the company they will allow a credit of 3/5 of the original value on the purchase price of the new battery.\n\nI hereby certify that I have personal knowledge that all the above articles are required in the Department and for Departmental purposes only.

I should appreciate your advising that the Department's instructions have been put into effect.\n\nYou were recently forwarded a copy of purchase order No. 8506 and you will note that we have purchased a Globalite W13, 270 ampere hour battery. Before this purchase was made very careful consideration was given to the requirements of the Gordon's School and it is felt that the new battery and the new adjustment of the electrical system should give satisfactory service.\n\nIt is of the utmost importance that a careful record be kept of the internal condition of the new battery with regard to the amount of distilled water introduced, charge as determined by suitable hydrometer and deposition of sediment. The plant engineer should give the battery the exact care specified by the manufacturers whose directions should be posted on or near the switchboard. Distilled water should be secured only from most reliable dealers.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nTouchwood Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nSubject: Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWe find it is impossible to purchase any heavier gauge tubes than those originally installed, so I am quoting as follows for the low and high pressure boilers, and hope this meets with the approval of the Department. You will probably note that the cost this time is somewhat higher than the previous job. Over this however I have no control. It would be appreciated if the tender is accepted to phone me, so that the material can be ordered at once, as it is getting more difficult to purchase goods of this nature.\n\nFaithfully yours,\n\nE.H. Carter.\n\nWrite him from Ottawa please.\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nTouchwood Agency,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nSubject: Gordon Indian School.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI am sorry this report has been held up but, nevertheless, we are trying our best to keep up with the various contracts etc. However, with reference to the heating boiler in the above School, there is no doubt it will have to be re-tubed. There is some chemical action on the tubes that cannot all be ascertained until they are taken out. The standard tube as previously installed was 3\".12. Gauge weighing 3.838 lbs. per foot, and according to information I have today we cannot purchase anything heavier. I would also recommend that the High pressure boiler be re-tubed at the same time to save additional expense, as this boiler concerned usually gives out about every two years. In the meantime I am trying to get a guarantee of delivery, also a definite quotation, and, as soon as I receive these, I will send in tenders covering the two jobs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nE.H. CARTER.\nDear Sir:\n\nRe letters 121-1-5 of July 31st and August 14th, Gordon School equipment.\n\nThis matter was held up through absence on holiday of the school principal, I wanted him to be home when we went to work. Here is how things stand.\n\nMr. A. Shaw, electrician and mechanic, is going to procure the pulleys etc for new installation of 6\u00bd H.P. Lister engine according to your plan, and he will do the work for us. He has not done this yet as we were waiting for return of Mr. Frayling.\n\nThe batteries are not here yet, I have heard nothing about them except in your letters, they will no doubt be here shortly. The copy of purchase order #508 did not come to hand, will you let me have another copy please.\n\nE.H. Carter of Yorkton has submitted a tender on the boiler job, all his correspondence is attached. He wants $523.60 for the complete job on the low pressure boiler. Then he writes that when he checked the boiler he also checked the high pressure boiler, he says he would complete this job for $135.00.\n\nThe more we go into this school job the worse it gets, however I trust that when we get it in shape we will be through with that place for some time.\n\nAlthough it has nothing to do with this place I just mention that the principal of the Muscowequan School has just phoned me to go down and see about some boiler job he has trouble with, I am frightfully busy getting off the crops on six reserves but will see into this affair at once.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 27, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your tender for the re-tubing of the two boilers at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, at a total cost of $58.60.\n\nWe would like you to proceed with this job at the earliest possible date, as these boilers will be required at the school some time in September.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.

In any case I have told him about it though he has no instructions from his head office yet.\n\nThe engineer at Gordon School is watching the batteries closely and says they are O.K. so far and have not been overcharged, he watches them continually, I dodge in there every time I am in the vicinity. However, this man is leaving at the end of the month and we will have to break in another chap then I presume.\n\nI have had a lot of difficulty about the new set up as you outlined regards the laundry, it is a quite simple job but the first set of pulleys received were wrong size and the mechanic had to return them, then he found that supply of these items were hard to get.

They don't hold any charge, we are using 30-40 Gals of Gas a day and 355 Electric Globes are blown every day.\n\nAs I told you on Saturday last Mr. Shaw was here on Thursday last, telling the Engineer to run the Engine for 2 days to charge the Batteries, we have been running the for 5 days without result. I would suggest a more competent Electrician be employed as Mr. Shaw does not seem to want the job, but the neglect is very costly to the School. I think immediate attention can be given to this work.\n\nYours Truly,\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Shaw of Lestock, Sask., could do all the needed work on this plant. It appears we were mistaken.\n\nAll summer I have been continually after this man to put in the new system of pulleys and shaft to the laundry, and to get the switch board etc in shape. He comes along and tinkers around but we get no results, and he has not to date supplied the pulleys etc.\n\nThis plant will soon go out of commission if left alone. Will you please arrange with the Mumford Medland Co., Winnipeg, Man., agents for Lister plants to put this plant in shape, and if they cannot send a man at once the Regina might get a Gen. Supt.\n\nIn order to get the Mumford Medland firm at once it will have to be shown them that the job is emergent, they usually take a long time getting busy on a job.\n\nThe delay up to this of course is my listening to unfilled promises made by Mr. Shaw.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nNovember 17, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant I am communicating with Mr. Christianson, General Superintendent of Indian Agencies, requesting him to get in touch with Mumford Medland and have one of their expert mechanics visit the Gordon's School and, if this is not possible, to send a qualified man from Regina at the earliest possible date.\n\nI am also forwarding to the Globelite Battery Company a copy of the Principal's letter which you enclosed.\n\nIn your letter of October 10 you intimated that the engineer at the Gordon's School was watching the batteries closely and that they were in good order to that date.

MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nNovember 17, 1941.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn June last we received a request for a new set of batteries for the Gordon's Indian Residential School. In view of the fact that we had already supplied three sets of batteries within the previous eight years considerable correspondence was necessary before it was decided to purchase a new set this summer. The order was finally placed and on July 31 last we forwarded a letter to Indian Agent Waddy. I enclose copy of this letter for your information. The batteries were delivered to the school about the end of August and we have written one or two letters to Mr. Waddy since with regard to carrying out the instructions contained in official letter of July 31. He has replied to these letters and advised that Mr. A. Shaw, electrician, was taking care of the matter.\n\nToday I am in receipt of a letter dated November 12, a copy of which I enclose.\n\nIt is evident that if the new set of batteries is not to be completely destroyed immediate steps are necessary to have an expert electrician visit this school at the earliest possible date and check all the electrical equipment. Therefore, it would be appreciated if you would arrange with the Mumford Medland Company, Winnipeg, to send an expert to the Gordon's School. If the services of a man cannot be obtained from them at once you can, no doubt, arrange to have someone go from Regina.\n\nWhoever is sent should be requested to take whatever action is necessary to put the electrical\n\nMr. M. Christianson,\nGen. Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nDominion Public Bldg.,\nSearth & Victoria,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir:\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter No. 121-1-5 of the 17th instant received by Air Mail in connection with the battery and electrical equipment at the Gordon's School, Punnichy.\n\nAs soon as I received your letter I wired Mumford Medland Limited and received a wire in reply stating that Mr. Range, of the Globelite Battery Company should be in Punnichy the next day. Also, Mr. Medland now informs me that he got in touch with the Globelite Battery Company immediately and they had received a Night Letter from Punnichy the day before stating that Mr. Range, their traveller, was in Regina. Mr. Medland then telephoned Mr. Range here and asked him to go to Punnichy, which he did. This all happened about two hours before I received your letter, and he arrived back here in the city late last night whereupon he immediately came up to my suite and had a talk with me, as he was taking a train for Winnipeg.\n\nHere are the facts up to date. The battery in question, when at the peak load, should not show a discharge of more than 24 amps., whereas during the peak load it has been showing a discharge of from 35 to 40 amps. In other words Mr. Frayling does not want to run the engines at night and as a consequence, with a peak load on, the batteries get run down every night and then they have to run the engine for from four to five hours to charge up the batteries. I also gathered that there was friction between the Engineer and the Principal because the Engineer told Mr. Range that he would be damned if he was going to work eighteen hours a day and he had put in his resignation.\n\nMr. Medland wired me today that he could send out a Mr. Montgomery, from Winnipeg, and this is the man that Mr. Range, of the Globelite Batteries, told me he would like to see sent out as he is a first class man. The cost will be $15.00 per day but as the diagram and pulleys mentioned in your letter of July 31st, addressed to Mr. Waddy, is not there and the pulleys are not there, there is no use sending Mr. Montgomery out. Therefore I wired Mr. Medland and informed him that I was writing today and he would receive a letter tomorrow morning. However, it has developed since that Mr. Shaw, at Lestock, has the diagram and he is forwarding it by today's mail to Mr. Waddy, at Punnichy. It also has been disclosed that Mr. Shaw ordered 4 pulleys, 1 shaft....\nordered 4 pulleys, 1 shaft, and 1 hanger, from the Vulcan Iron Works, Winnipeg, about a month ago, and they have not been delivered as yet. In my letter to Mumford Medland Limited I asked them to get in touch with the Vulcan Iron Works and endeavour to get them to deliver this equipment immediately. I also asked them to send Mr. Montgomery out as soon as the equipment is delivered, and have him put the plant in first class shape, carrying out the instructions that are contained in your letter of July 31st, addressed to Mr. Waddy. I am sending a copy of that letter to them and asking that they advise me when their man will be leaving.\n\nI have further asked the Mumford Medland Company to have Mr. Montgomery give me a full report on the plant and write out the necessary instructions as to how the plant should be operated, for the Principal. I shall forward a copy of these instructions to the Branch and also to the Indian Agent. I also stated that I would be very glad if he would report on the capability of the engineer who is operating the plant at present.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

Wallace the last paragraph of which reads as follows:\n\n\"In summing up, I should think that the water supply available for the coming winter will be sufficient to meet the needs of the school, and with normal precipitation it will be ample for next summer. However, with the continuance of dry years in this part of the country and with the great loss by evaporation, many lakes have dried up in recent years. Therefore, the situation may become more acute by next winter.\"\n\nIf next year continues dry it is possible that a supply will have to be obtained from Fort Lake as no other source of supply appears to be available and Mr. Wallace was informed at Punnedy that three deep wells, two 300 feet deep and one 540 feet, were drilled there in 1921 without obtaining water.\n\nRegarding the quality of the water now used Mr. Wallace states that at the time of his inspection it was quite palatable and fairly clear after passing through the filter, but the Principal informed him that in summer it had a bad odor and was hardly fit to drink. Bacteriological analyses of both lake and tap water showed a very high bacterial count but with no harmful organisms present.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nChief Engineer.\nDear Sir;-\n\nRe letter 121-1-5 of 17th inst asking for name of engineer at Gordon Indian Residential School, I beg to say a Mr. Ramsey has been on the job during November, he appeared to be satisfactory. However, he will not stop at the school and the principal has employed a Mr. Alex Holfelt from December 1st next. I know this man well and he is a first class mechanic, I think he will be all right.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nDept. of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nAttention: Mr. R. A. Hoey\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith further reference to file 121 - 1 - 5, and at the request of Mr. Christianson, the writer made a special Trip to the Gordon Indian Residential School at Punnichy to examine the battery and equipment that is claimed was giving trouble. This special Trip was made under some very trying conditions as the Highways were all snowbound. However we realize that we have many installations with the Government and our policy has always been to render quick and satisfactory service.\n\nThe report covering this inspection is as follows:\n\nThe battery was found to be in an excellent condition and in our opinion there was no foundation for grounds to complain. The fault was not in the battery or the equipment but rather in the manner in which the electrical system is being operated. In the first place the writer was advised that it was necessary to keep charging the battery for several days to bring the specific gravity of the solution up to 1.275. Our instructions definitely state that the full charged specific gravity is 1.250. The operator of the plant as well as Mr. Frayling, the Principal of the School, were ignorant of the fact that the specific gravity should be 1.250 instead of 1.275.\n\nWhen the writer asked Mr. Frayling and the Engineer to produce the instructions that were sent along with the battery, they could not find same and as an excuse stated that they had not received any. We are definitely sure that these instructions were sent with the new battery. We are forwarding another copy today.\nfact that the engineer tried to bring the specific gravity up to 1.275, resulted in considerable unnecessary running of the plant and regardless of how long the charge was continued the gravity would not come up over the 1.250 mark.\n\nThe plant that is being used at this school consists of Lister automatic equipment. Apparently the operators have not been operating this plant automatically but rather confined same to manual operation. Mr. Freyling stated emphatically that the reason for not operating the plant automatically was due to the fact that the switch-board was not right and the automatic features could not be used. The writer questioned this and had the plant started up on several occasions by turning on a load which automatically started the engines. When this load was shut off the engines stopped automatically. This was done several times and proved to Messrs. Freyling and Waddy that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the automatic operation.\n\nWe further understand that peak loads at night run from 30 to 40 Amperes and on various occasions the engines were not being operated to carry this load which resulted in the entire load being thrown over on the battery.\n\nAgain our instructions definitely state that the engine and plant should be run when loads exceed 22 Amperes for manual operation. From this you will readily understand that the peak loads that run from 35 to 40 Amperes are far in excess of what we recommend for a maximum discharge from this size battery. At this heavy peak load it is impossible for the battery to carry this heavy load for more than 4\u00bd to 5 hours without a very serious voltage drop causing a very noticeable dimness in lights.\n\nIt was pointed out to Mr. Freyling as well as Mr. Waddy that if the school wishes to continue with manual operation, their present battery is too small as their heavy loads when taken from the battery exceed by far that which is recommended.\n\nOur recommendation is that the plant be run automatically for which it was originally designed. We would further recommend that an alteration be made to the equipment whereby the battery will carry larger loads before the engines cut-in to take care of the peak loads. At the present time the equipment is set so that the engines will automatically cut-in as soon as the load exceeds approximately 200 Watts, and the engines will continue to operate until the load again drops to 200 Watts before they stop. We would suggest that the relays be adjusted so that the engine will cut-in at around 500 or 600 Watts and continue to carry loads in excess of this with a surplus for recharging the battery and then cut-out when the load again drops to this point of 500 to 600 Watts.\nIn other words, this would mean that the battery would carry the small loads and the plant would take care of the heavy loads. Then if it is found that this operation will not keep the battery fully charged, an extra charge can be given on days when the laundry is being operated to compensate for any such loss.\n\nIt was also pointed out to the writer that the school is burning out electric light bulbs as fast as they install them. This responsibility rests entirely on the operator of the plant as the plants are equipped with Rheostats to control the voltage. By permitting the voltage to rise up to 145 and 150 Volts which has been the case, it is only reasonable to expect that electric light bulbs will burn out.\n\nMr. Christianson from the Department of Indian Affairs in Regina, Saskatchewan, has requested the writer to get in touch with the Mumford-Medland Company of Winnipeg, who are the people who installed these plants, to send their service man to Punnichy to check over the plants as well as the switch-board and also arrange for alterations on one of the plants for laundry operation, as per sketch sent by your Department.\n\nWe have contacted the Mumford-Medland Company and they are immediately getting in touch with Mr. Christianson but as stated before, to our knowledge the automatic features on this plant are operating quite satisfactorily with the exception that alteration be made whereby the battery carry somewhat heavier loads before the engines cut-in. Of course there are some parts of the switch-board not in the very best of condition, such as the contact fingers on the clapper coils. These are very badly burned and should be replaced. Also the fuses should be replaced because the present ones have all been plugged.\n\nWe trust that we have covered this situation fully and we might suggest that if the plant is not operated as per our recommendations outlined in the foregoing paragraphs, we cannot assume any responsibility for the battery.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGLOBELITE BATTERIES LIMITED.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSuperintendent.\nDear Sir:\n\nAttached hereto please find voucher in triplicate in connection with the inspection of the Vertical boiler (Record No. 12461) and Loco-Stationary boiler (Record No. 12462) located in the Gordon Indian Residential School at Punnichy, Sask., inspected under date of November 18th, 1941 by Government Boiler Inspector Auckland of Regina, Sask.\n\nOn receipt of your cheque for $8.00.

Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnishy, Sask.\nOttawa,\nDecember 4, 1941.\n\nVenerable Sir:\n\nLast June we received a request for a new set of batteries for the Gordon's Indian Residential School. In view of the fact that we had already supplied three sets of batteries within the previous eight years considerable correspondence was necessary before it was decided to purchase a new set this summer. The order was finally placed and the new battery was delivered to the school about the end of August.\n\nIn a letter dated November 12 Indian Agent Waddy forwarded to this Branch a letter which he had received from the Principal of the Gordon's School. I enclose copy of this letter for your information. Immediately on receipt of this letter we communicated with the Globelite Batteries Limited, Winnipeg, and I attach a copy of the report of the Superintendent of that firm.\n\nIt is evident from this report that the school management is either incapable of properly handling these batteries or they have no intention of carrying out the very specific instructions that have been given to them. In either case the result is the same; namely, that the new set of batteries will soon be useless unless the school management complies with the instructions that they have received.\n\nI know you realize that due to present conditions our funds are limited and consequently it is most\n\nVen. J.K. Irwin, M.A., D.D.,\nSecretary of Synod,\nSynod House,\nRegina, Sask.\nimportant that every possible effort be made to conserve equipment at residential schools. I am directing Indian Agent Waddy to take up with the Principal the contents of the letter received from the Globelite Batteries Limited and it would be appreciated if you would also discuss the matter with him and point out that our instructions regarding the care of the batteries must be carried out.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

My complaint regarding light bulbs burning out: Mr. Shaw came up and found that the connecting leads from one battery to another were loose; and he had to tighten nearly all of them, which stopped the trouble to a great extent: the breakage is not now so frequent.\n\nParagraph (13). The remark that parts of the switchboard are faulty and need replacement is again proof that all is not in order.\n\nI wish it clearly understood that from the day Mr. Shaw installed the batteries until the visit of the Globelite representative, this plant was operated under the absolute direction of Mr. Shaw in every detail. The reason for my suggesting that someone else should finish the job was when Mr. Shaw instructed that the engine be run for three days, and when the electrolyte became milky, we kept running until it became brown. I said \"Well, that is when the plates begin to shed\", but his reply was that it would not matter. I then thought it time to again draw Mr. Waddy's attention to the trouble. I feel that it is necessary to explain or reply to the Globelite letter, as many parts of the same are misleading and blame is being placed on the School operator or engineer, and myself; which is absolutely false.\n\nMr. Waddy can verify these statements in every detail I think; as I was continually making complaints of Mr. Shaw's laxity.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

Batteries & Plant.\n\nMr. Waddy has given me copy of the letter written you by the Globelite Batteries Ltd. on Nov. 24th.\n\nParagraph (2). Mr. Alex Shaw of Lestock, electrical engineer engaged by the department for installing the new batteries, and overhauling the Lister Engines is entirely responsible for this stated specific gravity of 1.275. He ordered the school engineer to run the Lister engines for three days until the 1.275 was obtained. It could not be done.\n\nParagraph (3). There were no instructions given with these new batteries unless Mr. Shaw, who unpacked them, took such instructions away with him. With the previous batteries two sets of instructions were given, one of which was in my office, and when the duplicate could not be found in the engine room, I immediately went to the office and gave it to this Mr. Range who told the engineer to tack it on the wall; and there it has been since. Mr. Waddy was present, and Mr. Range said that these instructions were for the 240 ampere batteries; the present ones are 270 ampere.\n\nParagraph (5). The automatic device worked after being tinkered with whilst Mr. Range was here, but at 5 o'clock p.m. it would not respond, and Mr. Shaw could not make it operate.\n\nParagraph (6 & 7). No such statement was made to my knowledge; the engine has been running every night until 10 o'clock p.m., when the engineer shuts off and retires; which, when the automatic system worked properly, shut off itself when lesser lights were in use; the batteries then carrying the load.\n\nParagraph (9). If as previously stated the equipment is in good shape, why the suggestions for an alteration?\nOttawa,\nDecember 10, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo with reference to the battery at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nI was extremely surprised to receive this letter as it is quite evident that you desire to blame the whole situation on Mr. Shaw but you do not admit that there is any responsibility resting on the school management for the proper care of the battery.\n\nWhen it is considered that within the past eight years we have supplied three sets of batteries to the Gordon's Indian Residential School it is quite apparent that the management of the Gordon's Residential School does not recognize their responsibility in caring for equipment supplied by this Department.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Christianson, Esq.,\nGeneral Supt. of Indian Agencies,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the LISTER Fully Automatic Lighting units at the Gordon Anglican Indian Residential School, Punnichy. As you know, the trip was made by the writer to check and report on the condition of these units, as well as the advisability of following out the suggestions of disconnecting the generator from the engine of the smaller unit, and by a series of pulleys and belts, drive the generator disconnected and the engine to be reconnected through a series of pulleys to drive the laundry equipment.\n\nIn dealing with this suggested change as per the Department Engineer's suggestion, we do not agree with it at all in that the automatic features of this particular unit would have to be disposed of. This in turn disrupts the automatic features of the second and third unit. Secondly, the existing load of the school can be carried 90% of the time by the small unit which the Department proposes disturbing, resulting in the larger unit having to be operated. This involves additional gasoline, oil, double the amount of parts, etc., which greatly increases the general upkeep and operation of the plants.\n\nThirdly, it places the school where they have only one unit as a source of electrical supply which, in my estimation is not adequate for this type of an institution, for in the event of failure of the remaining unit, if this plan was carried out, this would result in the lighting supply having to be drawn from the battery, which would only take care of it for a very short period of time, and this would have\na damaging effect on the battery due to the excessive load.\n\nWe now submit our proposal, together with a rough sketch of the installation of same, in the space available: Instead of disconnecting or disturbing the present lighting system in any way from the present, that an additional gas engine be installed to take care of the laundry equipment. This will eliminate the problem of excessive charging of the batteries during the time the laundry equipment is being used. In other words, the laundry equipment will be a self-contained unit and in no way included with the existing lighting system.\n\nOur suggestion is to use a light high speed air cooled motor with a reduction clutch, and why we recommend this type of engine is to minimize the amount of space required by the engine.\n\nWe attach a blueprint as previously mentioned, covering the stand and location of the stand for the above type of engine, and we quote separately on a suitable engine together with stand and fittings.\n\nWith reference to the condition of the electrical equipment as found by the writer. To our knowledge the electrical system (and when we say electrical system we refer to the switchboard and the electrical contacts, etc., on same) has never been adjusted or serviced since around 1933, and we would point out that this in our opinion is wonderfully good service for this type of equipment. We found the various clapper switches and solenoid coils, etc., needed minor adjustments. It also necessitated the replacement of one coil and two carbon brushes. Various contacts were dirty, which were cleaned, and after checking the board over carefully it then functioned very satisfactorily.\n\nThe position the Board was found in was that at times the automatic would work quite satisfactorily but at other times due to the condition of various contact points, etc., would not function as it normally should. Therefore it was getting to the point where it could not be relied on 100% with regard to automatic starting and stopping.\n\nWith reference to the batteries. As you no doubt know, there has been installed a new set of batteries at this school. Suitable instructions have been issued by the Globelite Co., and the writer gave all the information he could on the proper upkeep and care of the batteries to the present operator.\n\nIt would appear to us that one source of the difficulty at the school in regard to the battery failures has been the\nfact that the laundry equipment was driven off the engine of the large electric generating unit. This resulted at times in an overcharge of the batteries which would have its most damaging effects during the summer months, and if our suggestion for driving the laundry equipment is carried out, this would eliminate this difficulty.\n\nWith reference to Mr. Frayling, Principal of the School. We have only this to say, we believe Mr. Frayling is very conscientious and worries considerably about the various equipment in the school, and it is not to be expected that he should be a qualified man in all phases of the school activity. Therefore he has to rely somewhat on his engineers for the care which is given the various equipment. This care it is possible has not at times been 100%, and in this we refer to the batteries only. What we mean is that considerable care is required to properly take care of a battery in regards to charge and discharge, cycling, and over-charge, and is something that has to be taken care of at regular intervals.\n\nHowever, Mr. Frayling was very interested to get all the particulars in regards to this and no doubt will be in a better position to know if his engineers are carrying out his instructions.\n\nWe trust we have covered the existing conditions at the School to your satisfaction and are sorry for the delay, but the writer did not get back to Winnipeg as early as anticipated.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nWJM/ELS\n\nIndian Affairs.

This is not correct as the Globelite Batteries evidently had received a letter from the Principal of the School and since Mr. Range happened to be in Regina they got in touch with him here over the telephone on the same date that I received your letter in connection with the battery. Also, I had a wire on November 19th from Mumford Medland Limited which reads as follows:\n\n\"RETETL MR RANGE OF GLOBELITE BATTERIES SHOULD BE IN PUNNICHIY TOMORROW WILL THIS BE SATISFACTORY OR DO YOU WANT ANOTHER MAN\"\n\nWhen Mr. Range returned to Regina he came up to my suite about 9.00 o'clock that night and took the train for Winnipeg that same night. He was the one who recommended that we get Mr. Montgomery if at all possible, of Mumford Medland Limited, to go to Punnichy because he felt certain he was the best man he knew of for the purpose of putting the equipment in good order. This I did and am now awaiting Mr. Montgomery's report and this will be forwarded to you as soon as I receive it.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nM.

The Department appreciates the prompt action that you took in this matter.\n\nWe have read your report with interest and a great deal of care. It is noted that you suggest the installation of another gasoline engine to take care of the laundry equipment. Owing to lack of funds it is impossible for us to purchase another engine for the Gordon's School at the present time.\n\nThe second paragraph of your letter reads in part as follows:\n\n\"In dealing with the suggested change as per the Department Engineer's suggestion we do not agree with it at all in that the automatic features of this particular unit would have to be disposed of.\"\n\nIt is difficult for us to understand why this should be the case as the unit, while operating indirectly, remains the same at all times except when operating the laundry machinery which is only in use between 12 and 15 hours a week.\n\nOn reconsidering the complete setup would it not be possible to leave the plant as it is at present by installing a switch to disconnect the\n\nMr. W.J.

Would this arrangement have any effect on the generator? What effect would this arrangement have on the units in general? As pointed out in the first paragraph of this letter, we are obliged to avoid purchase of additional units at this time. Consequently, it is desired to have the present plant do the work required.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nRe Letter 121-15\n\nSince writing my letter dated Dec. 13, another addition of reproof has been received.\n\nI have on file letters from you both confidential and general, of seeming approval of my work, so I have become convinced that letters within the last few months are not from your dictation, because the purport of the same are so totally different to those prior, and that through pressure in your department much of the correspondence is passed on to some subordinate, and your personal signature is given, or possibly a rubber stamp used.\n\nThe mentioning of my not caring for the equipment, and wishing to shelve all the responsibility on Mr. Shaw regarding the Lighting Plant here, is in the least to say, most ridiculous, after Mr. Shaw was ordered by the Department (and is a certificated electrician) to do certain work, who else but Mr. Shaw should be responsible? The Department is paying Mr. Shaw and yet from this latest outburst you hold me responsible for his work. This does not seem sane, or at all reasonable.\nMr. Christianson, Chief Supt. of Agencies, and Mr. Waddy, Indian Agent, are right here and can reach this school in very short time. If either of these gentlemen complain of my seeming neglect, or inability to cope with the position which I have held for eleven years I will endeavour to work on a line they suggest. And again considering that supervision of schools is a part of their many duties, they should be better able to know or inform you than one sitting in an office some 1600 miles distant.\n\nIt is not my wish to be personal but when being written to in the strain recently used, and not forgetting that the position of principal demands respect, and that I am going to have irrespective as from what source, and I am sure you would if in my place.\n\nTo-day the whole democratic world is calling for unity in every phase of life throughout the civilized world. That cannot be achieved by bullying, and that is what your recent letters have been, and I will ask that before accusing me again of neglect of duty, you get the proof first from those such as our high Church Officials, or from the forenamed Dept. Officials. I will then admit being neglectful, but not before.\n\nRegretting to have to write so pointedly, and again I feel sure you would have no room or respect for anyone calling himself a man, who would sit down and accept these libelous criticisms without retaliation,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir;\n\nThe Venerable Archdeacon J.K. Irwin has forwarded me your letter to him dated Dec. 4th 1941, with an enclosure of a copy of a letter from Globelight Co. Ltd.\n\nI mailed to you via \"Air Mail\", a letter answering the Globelight letter of November 28th, which should have reached you not later than the 30th, four days before your letter to the Archdeacon. My letter of explanation is such, that a copy might have accompanied the Globelight letter, which would perhaps have conveyed a not so neglectful impression. I mention this instance as it seems to me that any other opinion or suggestion is accepted but mine. I am on the spot all the time and know what is what; the other man comes along and runs off a line of stuff that is taken for fact instead of with suspicion; he sells the goods, I point out the defects, and get nothing but grief for doing what I am supposed to do i.e. look after the interests of the school and study economy.\n\nReverting to the question of economy; it is through my interest and suggestion of allowance that the Department saved $378.00 on the present batteries: the former batteries cost $630.00 and the present ones $252.00. A mistake is also made regarding batteries supplied to the school: those recently installed make the third set in eleven years, and on the guarantee with these it should be 1946 before renewing.\n\nMr. Montgomery (Mumford & Medland expert) recently here, in his report recommends the use of an additional unit for laundry service: this was suggested by myself (tho' not an engineer) years ago; which is somewhat a proof that I am not entirely ignorant of the condition, or so lax in my duty and interest as might be\nFor considerable time it seems that an absolute effort has been on foot from some source to do nothing else but find fault with this school and myself, and from various correspondence, that this school costs the department far more than any other Residential School. One cost far in excess of anything here is the recent new roof on the Muscowequan R.C. School; entailing I would imagine, some $1,500.00 to $1,600.00; and this on a more recent structure. (Our roof has leaked and been repaired without mention). It makes me wonder if the Principal of this R.C. school is censored to the same degree as myself when renovations are needed.\n\nEvery instruction given by the Department as to this school has been carried out; economy is enforced in every detail. Take the water question of some two years ago; I had an estimate from Smith Bros. & Wilson for a contract not to exceed $1,700.00: you will know what it cost; I believe nearly three times this figure! Where is economy? The Buildings here, School, Barns, Root House, etc., etc., are second to none in the Dominion so far as upkeep; and the yearly interior decorations have never cost the Department one cent.\n\nI appreciate your having written the Venerable Archdeacon; he being a past principal of this school knows much of the difficulties that arise, but not to the same extent as myself, as funds during his term were more plentiful than since 1930.\n\nMay I conclude with the request that past correspondence be well perused before sentence is passed; as I firmly believe any Judge of the British Courts would exonerate me from all blame in this matter after the evidence on the Department files since 1933 was examined. It makes me think that if one sat in the office all day and let things take their ordinary course it would be more agreeable: But when one has a sense of honor for ones duty it is a difficult matter to just sit still and be satisfied. It is most hurtful to know that someone is always having a dig at you for some unknown reason, and doubly so when there is no foundation for such, as in this lighting plant complaint.\n\nIn duty bound I am compelled to write this letter that the Lord Bishop of Qu'Appelle, and the Venerable Archdeacon should fully know the strained conditions under which I am working, and your misconception of my endeavour to carry out the duties of a Principal.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

A. Hooey, Supt.\nWelfare and Training.\n\nWith reference to yours of the 13th inst. in connection with the Lister Automatic Lighting Units at the Gordon Indian Anglican Residential School. To familiarize you somewhat with the automatic equipment at this school, the operation of the units is as follows:\n\nThe small unit will start up at a certain wattage and the setting as to the amount of wattage can be varied. After the small unit has reached its total capacity the large unit starts up. The little unit then stops. The large unit carries the load until such time as it becomes fully loaded. Then the small unit starts up and they both run together on the peak loads. As the load starts to reduce the first plant to stop is the little one. As a further reduction in the load takes place the big unit stops and the little one starts, and the little unit continues to operate until such time as the load drops below the wattage setting of the relays.\n\nWith this information you will readily see that disturbing any portion of the connections of one or other unit disturbs both units as they are inter-connected. This is why we are opposed to the plan of disturbing the existing set-up in any way from present.\n\nWith reference to your suggestion of a switch on the batteries so that they can be discontinued when the large unit is operating the laundry equipment. This again disturbs the automatic relays, etc., for you must have a nominal charge going through into the batteries and the voltage of the unit...\nrunning must be sufficiently high to also operate the various automatic coils, so that to add a switch to disconnect the batteries cannot be done.\n\nThe only alternative that we can offer is that during the days that they are washing that the rheostat on the large unit be turned back to the lowest point possible at which the automatic relays, etc. will still continue to function. This would possibly mean that at this lowest point there would still be approximately 5 amp. of a charge into the batteries. If the school can arrange the special charging of their batteries so that during this period of washing this charge, or even a greater charge can be utilized without damaging the batteries, then they could possibly get about 80% satisfaction from these arrangements. We believe that this is possible and that they would get about 60% satisfaction. During the writer's visit he outlined this possibility to the present engineer.\n\nWe trust the above covers the questions raised in your letter.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\n\nWJM/ELS\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No.\n\nDecember 27 1941 181-1-5\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Gordon's Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 18-422\n\nSHIP TO Mr. R.W.

However, I desire to bring the following to your attention:\n\n1. The new batteries were obtained at a reduced cost due to the action taken by our Purchasing Branch;\n\n2. A recent report from Mumford Medland Limited indicates that the present installation is capable of doing the work that is required;\n\n3. It is actually no concern of yours what repairs are made to any other Indian residential school;\n\n4. It is true that you obtained a quotation of $1800.00 for the water system but subsequent investigation by our engineers showed definitely that the plan Mr. Swan had suggested would be unsatisfactory. Besides, the original cost was increased owing to quicksand. In spite of these difficulties the cost was approximately $3000.00 and not the figure suggested in your letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. R.W.

In view of the contents of this letter no change should be made in the setup of the machinery in the Gordon's Residential School. You will remember that we previously suggested the re-arrangement of the machinery.\n\nWhile the school continues under the present management I have very little hope of the machinery receiving the care and attention that it requires. However, we are obtaining prices on the additional engine which Mumford Medland considers would overcome many difficulties encountered in the past. If this engine can be secured at a reasonable figure it will be supplied.

The main deviation suggested by the Department failed when the cribbing gave way, which left it with the gravel trench to filter through, from the lake to the intake reservoir. This will be verified by the credit being given for the galvanized piping left unused, and which was returned as it could not be connected on account of the crib breaking, leaving the project in the exact manner as that outlined by Mr. Swan.\n\nI would like to impress upon you the fact that I put in fourteen hours a day, from 5:45 or 6:00 A.M. till 8 o'clock P.M., and it is solely in the interests of the school and its various branches that I consider is a day's work, and I can conscientiously state that I study economy in every possible way.\n\nMay I conclude with the words you did to me last year, viz., that I do dislike criticisms that are based on misunderstandings.\nWith the hope that the New Year may have in store for all of us better times and more encouraging prospects,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

The Principal apparently considers that the improvements to the water supply system were too costly and criticizes the action that was taken by this Department. In this regard I quote the following extracts from letters received from the Principal:\n\n1. Letter dated January 3, 1948\n\n\"For your enlightenment I will tell you that the supposed rejected system of Mr. Swan's and mine is being, and has been used all the time. The main deviation suggested by the Department failed when the cribbing gave way, which left it with the gravel trench to filter through from the lake to the intake reservoir. This will be verified by the credit being given for the galvanized piping left unused, and which was returned as it could not be connected on account of the crib breaking, leaving the project in the exact manner as that outlined by Mr. Swan.\"\n2. Letter dated January 5, 1942\n\n\"There is one item in my reply, viz., water question, which plainly shows that the real facts are not known to you, the Department Project was an absolute failure, which perhaps is no concern of mine, but that the one of Mr. Swan's is working, which, had it been accepted, would have cut down the costs very considerably.\"\n\nWith regard to the improvements to the water system at the Gordon's School I would refer you to your memorandum of October 30, 1936, and previous correspondence regarding this matter. This Branch understood that your engineers did not approve of Mr. Swan's suggestions with which the Principal of the Gordon's School concurred. On the other hand a review of the correspondence with your Branch leaves us with the impression that your engineers decided upon a different plan which eventually cost considerably more than the one suggested by Mr. Swan.\n\nIn view of our understanding of the matter, and the very definite statement now made by the Principal of the Gordon's School, I should appreciate your reviewing the whole matter and commenting on the Principal's recent statements.\n\nDirector.\nDEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES\n\nREQUISITION FOR SUPPLIES File No. 121-1-5\n\nDecember 27, 1941\n\nTo The Departmental Purchasing Agent, Ottawa,\n\nPLEASE FURNISH THE FOLLOWING SUPPLIES FOR USE OF Gordon's Indian Residential School\n\nVOTE 76 Allotment 18-423\n\nSHIP TO Mr. R.W.

It would therefore be wise to try and locate water at some future time.\n\n\"I have taken this precaution in the event of trouble arising, and have also drawn attention to this all important commodity.\"\n\nThe statement made in the above letter can be investigated at the same time that action is being taken regarding the contents of my memorandum of January 28.\n\nDirector.\nJanuary 29, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Wardle,\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential Schools.\n\nIn reference to your memorandum of the 27th instant transmitting a copy of a memorandum from Dr. McGill regarding Principal Frayling's criticism of Departmental action in installing the intake for the water supply, I might say that the Principal's statement that the Departmental project was an absolute failure is not understood by our officers. If the Principal is referring to the original Departmental proposal then same cannot be said to have been a failure because it was never carried out in its entirety. If the Principal is referring to the work as constructed by the Department then his statement is not understood by our officers as the system, as installed, has functioned satisfactorily up to the date of inspection by Mr. Wallace last fall and the extract from the Principal's letter to the Director of the Indian Affairs Branch does not make any statement regarding any unsatisfactory functioning of the system at the present time.\n\nReviewing this project briefly, as you are aware from previous memoranda, Mr. Swan's proposal was to construct a concrete well with perforated wall and lead the water to it through a trench filled with gravel and sand to act as a filter. His estimated cost for this was $1,700.00. Mr. Dempster's proposal was similar but had the added feature of a five-inch pipe line laid in the bottom of the trench under the gravel fill. This proposal was preferred because it provided the advantage of a more assured supply. There is said to be considerable silt in the water which might in time interfere with the flow through the gravel bed. The estimated cost of this scheme was $2,850.00. If from this figure the estimated cost of the pipe installed, amounting to $400.00 as given in Engineer Dempster's estimate, is deducted, then $2,250.00 is obtained as Mr. Dempster's estimate for the same scheme as Mr. Swan estimated at $1,700.00.\n\nWith reference to the Principal's statement that if Mr. Swan's scheme had been accepted it \"would have cut down the costs very considerably\" it is obvious that this could only be the case on the assumption that the work could have been carried out for Mr. Swan's original estimate. In this connection Mr. Swan's information was evidently erroneous as Engineer Dempster in his report dated October 7th, 1938, states as follows:\n\n\"With reference to the water supply for the above school, the area of the lake from which the water is taken is approximately twenty-four acres as compared to thirty-five acres mentioned by Mr. Swan. The enlarged plan shows the survey of the lake and also the profile of the lake bottom taken by Mr. Lasoroka. You will note that Mr. Swan states that a depth of twelve feet is found at forty or fifty feet from the shore line. From Mr. Lasoroka's soundings it can be seen that a depth of twelve feet is reached at a distance of one hundred feet from the shore.\"\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RC 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nAs reported in our memorandum to you dated January 16, 1939, when the excavation for the trench was about completed and when only three inches or 15 feet of the Universal pipe had been laid the cofferdam failed and its supports gave way. On January 29, 1939, you approved our recommendation that an Engineer Dempster had reported the flow of water through the filtration gallery was adequate to meet the school's requirement that the completion of the laying of the intake pipe be abandoned.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\nFebruary 11th, 1942.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nFurther to my memorandum of January 27th, I may say that the criticisms of the school Principal quoted in your memorandum of January 22nd, have been referred to our Engineering and Construction Service, and for your information I enclose copy of a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, Mr. Mills, dated the 29th ultimo, dealing with these criticisms.\n\nWe concur in the opinions expressed by Mr. Mills.\n\nIt should particularly be noted that there is no fundamental difference between the project proposed by Mr. Swan and what was actually installed by the Department, as Mr. Mills has explained, and this installation appears to be functioning satisfactorily.\n\nWith regard to the Principal's statement that Mr. Swan's scheme \"would have cut down the costs very considerably\", Mr. Mills has explained in some detail the erroneous information on which Mr. Swan presumably made his original estimate. It is reasonable to assume that Mr. Swan's estimate based on this mis-information, would be inaccurate.\n\nDirector.\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. McGill\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nFebruary 11th, 1942.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your memorandum of January 30th, quoting the opinion of the Principal of the school that the water supply available and fit for consumption will be exhausted in about 1\u00bd years.\n\nThis matter has been discussed with officers of our Dominion Water and Power Bureau, but they are unable as yet to predict any definite improvement in water runoff conditions in the area concerned, for the immediate future, although they are hopeful that such will take place.\n\nAs far as any other possible water supply is concerned, your attention is drawn to my memorandum of August 23rd 1938, transmitting a memorandum from the Chief Engineer, and a copy of a report prepared by Mr. Dempster. Mr. Dempster considered it practicable to bring water from Fort Lake, a distance of about 3\u00bd miles, at an estimated cost of about $10,000.00, through a 2-inch pipe laid on the surface of the ground.\n\nThe estimated cost of this pipe alone was $6,600.00, which might be insufficient at present prices. Even if $10,000.00 or more could be secured for such a project, it would appear doubtful if authority could be secured for the purchase of so much steel for this purpose under present conditions.\n\nIt would therefore seem that the only course is to leave the matter in abeyance for the present, in the hope that increasing rainfall will take care of the school's needs.\n\nDirector.\nMUMFORD, MEDLAND, LIMITED,\nMACHINERY - BELTING - RAILWAY APPLIANCES\nGASOLINE AND DIESEL ENGINES\n\n576 Wall Street\nWINNIPEG, MAN.\n\nSOLD TO\nTHE DEPARTMENT OF MINES AND RESOURCES,\nOTTAWA, ONTARIO.\n\nMR.

The tank now in use is galvanized and has been repaired repeatedly so that in the Agent's estimation it will not stand any more patches.\n\nThe cost of a new tank is well over $100.00 and is hard to get. To install a cement one the price would be considerably higher. However, Mr. Waddy secured a quotation from a man who is in charge of the lumber company at Semans. This man puts in cement linings in all old tanks and they stand up well. The Agent quotes that he knows of one such repair which lasted for nine years and is still as good as ever. This lumber company offers to do the work for $27.25. I am attaching a tender which has been secured from this Company. I do not know whether these repairs should come under the jurisdiction of the school or if the Department have to attend to this.\n\nIf there are no objections to repairing the tank I would recommend that this be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM.

Please discuss the matter with the Principal and advise me what amount you consider should be expended at this school this year.\n\nWith reference to any material required, detailed information should be supplied, in order that purchase may be made through our Purchasing Branch. You are aware of present conditions and consequently the sooner the orders are placed the better for all parties concerned.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nMr. J.W. Waddy,\nIndian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nPUNNICHY, SASK. July 17th 1942\n\nR. A. Hoey, Esq.,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Lighting Plant\n\nI thought it would be of interest to you to know that the recently installed gas engine for laundry service is proving successful, the cost of same being $165.00 bought from the Mumford Medland Co. This system I suggested in 1932 since which time three sets of Globalight Batteries have been replaced costing some $2000.00. The saving in gas alone is 135 gallons per month, and I imagine the batteries will now give the life of the guarantee viz. 5 years and an apparent saving of 1600 gallons of gas per year.\n\nThe reason for my giving the above statement is that it is a proof that there are times when the man on the spot's views should be given some consideration (this means the principal). The same applies to the water system. I don't wish to imply that I am an engineer or an authority in any way, but I do wish to emphasize the fact that economy and interest is taken in everything pertaining to this school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nR.W. FRAYLING\n\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir:\n\nYou will recall I reported to you some time ago that the Venerable Archdeacon Irwin called at this office after visiting the schools in the Qu'Appelle Diocese. He reported on certain matters that were not satisfactory to the Indian committee, and amongst these was the water situation at the Gordon school.\n\nLast Thursday afternoon I visited this institution with the new agent, Mr. R.S. Davis, who was transferred from Carlton to Touchwood, and while there we went over the water situation at the school.\n\nTo go back a few years, when the first institution was abandoned and a new school was going to be built, which later burnt down, we drilled several wells. This is only from memory but I know on several occasions I was at the well site where they were drilling and we spent a great deal of money on dry holes, finally arriving at the conclusion that it was impossible to find water by drilling. Therefore the present site between two small lakes was chosen.\n\nThere is no need for me to go into a long-winded report as you have the blue prints of the water situation at the school on file in Ottawa. The lake is approximately 300' from the school and an intake has been built in the lake where the water flows through gravel and is pumped up to a large underground tank beside the school. From there the water is pumped on to a large pressure tank in the basement and this pressure tank supplies the building with water. At one end of the pressure tank there is a filtration tank and from there the water flows through the pipes into the building. Therefore you will see by this that everything has been done to safeguard the water. The Principal admits that once in a while there is a little odour from the water but he has had samples analyzed by the Provincial Government here in Regina and the water has been found to be satisfactory for human consumption.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nSince the school was built the lake....\nSince the school was built the lake has gone down a great deal, in fact several feet. This is due to the extremely dry weather we experienced for over ten years. Last Summer, however, the lake was continually rising and is now 19\" from low level. If we have a quantity of snow this Winter no doubt it will continue to rise. This lake is probably one mile to one mile and a quarter in circumference and hills surround it on practically all sides sloping gradually towards the lake. Therefore you will understand when there is a heavy rain or snowfall the water from these hills runs into the lake. No cattle or horses are watered in the above lake as there is another small lake on the opposite side of the school that furnishes the water for the livestock that are kept at this institution.\n\nI think our Branch has done everything in its power to safeguard the water supply and have taken the only means possible to supply the school with water. If the lake in question went dry or the water became polluted, it would be a question of closing the school because, as I have said before, it was found impossible to locate water by drilling in the vicinity of the location of the school. However, as the water is 19\" higher than it was last year, with extremely heavy rains similar to those we had during the past summer and probably some heavy snowfalls, it should not be many years until the lake again reaches its high level.\n\nTherefore, in my opinion, Providence will very likely take care of the water situation at the Gordon School for many more years to come, particularly since the rainy seasons seem to be on again. This last Summer was the wettest we have experienced for years.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. Christianson,\nGeneral Superintendent of Indian Agencies.\n\nThe Secretary.\nApril 30th, 1943.\n\nRev. Frayling,\nGorden's Anglican Indian School,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to the Lister generator which you sent in to us for repair recently and also our Mr. W. J. Montgomery's subsequent trip to Punnichy to correct the trouble experienced after the generator was re-installed. We have pleasure in giving you a report on this plant as follows:\n\nWhen the generator arrived in here, we found that the starting winding on top of the main field coils had been very badly heated and, in our estimation, the cause of this was due to the insulation being old and then finally, during a starting period, the insulation broke down, causing excessive current to be carried in the wiring, thus burning any insulation that was of any value.\n\nWe carried out this repair and also repaired the main winding in places where this had been damaged by the heat from the starting winding.\n\nWhen Mr. Montgomery arrived, he checked over the connections and these had been replaced correctly between the generator and the switchboard when the former had been re-installed. The automatic equipment on the switchboard, however, had apparently suffered some abuse when the winding in the generator field burned out. In consequence, correct sequence of operation of this fully automatic equipment could not be obtained.\n\nYou will appreciate from the foregoing that the main cause of the trouble was deterioration of the equipment,\n\nIndian Affairs.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to inform you that I visited the Gordon's School this last week and it was brought to my attention that the flues in the boiler had been leaking. Four of them were leaking so badly that they had to be plugged. There are sixty-four flues in the boiler and they are in two sections. There are thirty-four flues in the bottom section and until they are gone over by a boiler maker I do not know whether the sixty-four flues will have to be removed or just the bottom thirty-four.\n\nI have been in touch with a boiler maker in the city here, namely the Northwestern Iron Works and they tell me they can do the work. They may have the necessary flues on hand but if they have not it often takes two or three months to do this. Therefore I would ask for authority to go on with this work as soon as the school closes for the Summer holidays.\n\nIt is understood that if it is only necessary to put in the lower section this is all that will be done at the present time but we want to be prepared so that if it is found necessary to put in the upper section also this can be done at the same time.\n\nM.

The attached sketch will enable the Department Surveyors to gauge how long the supply will last.\n\nIn January 1942, no. 4, paragraph of my letter respecting the water question, and the failure of the project under the contract given to one Mr. McDiarmid, Regina, when the \"CRIBBING\" broke, is shown in the sketch, the intake pipe that was supposed to aid the system is now in dry gravel, and the cement well has six feet of water, that being our whole supply. Your reply to my report was that you had forwarded the information to the Water Department, to date nothing has happened.\n\nIn case of FIRE, we have little protection, apart from the daily needs. I am bringing this again to your notice, to cover myself in case of happenings.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nMarch 23, 1944.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have your letter of the 21st instant, with reference to the water supply at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.

(RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\nPunnichy, Sask., Aug 14, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Voucher #251 in favor of Mumford, Medland Ltd, Winnipeg, for repairs to generator etc at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, I beg to state that this was an emergency and could not wait.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nTOUCHWOOD AGENCY -\n\nGordon Reserve -\n\nGordon's School - is in excellent condition and well managed. The barns, machine sheds, stables, are in the best possible condition - nicely painted and the barnyards, spotlessly clean. There is a very fine root-house - large and in good condition. About 500 bags of potatoes still available, but there is no market for them, as there is a surplus in the district. Mr. H.W. Frayling deserves a great deal of credit for what has been accomplished. Trees have been planted, which makes the whole appearance attractive. He engages senior Indian boys at $35.00 a month to work during the holidays and by constant supervision gets a great deal of work done.\n\nOne of the large storage water-tanks - approximate capacity 2500 gallons - has sprung a leak. As at many other schools they are placed in positions without thought of future repairs that might have to be done. Agent Davis forwarded a request to Mr. Christianson to have the tank repaired during the summer holidays. Mr. Christianson wrote back that after consulting with repair houses in Regina the tank must be dismantled and sent to Regina. He instructed Mr. Davis to have Mr. Frayling take the tank out of the building. To do this - first a tank, similar size, mounted above, would have to be moved - then the cement foundation of the school - about 2 ft. thick - would have to be torn away, almost big enough for a team of horses to pass through. How ridiculous! I asked Mr. Davis to make enquiries of men in the district suggesting that most likely the tank could be opened from the inside and sealed up again without dismantling. After he obtains this information he will submit his request direct to Ottawa, as it is imperative that this work be done before school opens.\n\nWater - at the school may be a problem in the next few years. The small lake from which the water is obtained is gradually receding.\n\nDr. Simes introduced me to Mr. G.M. Bushel, who is a member of the school diocesan committee of the Anglican Church. He told me that there was an agitation started to remove Mr. Frayling. It seems that the Anglican Priest at the school got the Indians to sign a petition, or rather an ultimatum, that Mr. Frayling be removed. If not, they would not send their children to school and would ask the Roman Catholics to take over the school. Indian problems and a rebellious Priest make a good combination.\n\nJ.K.

(RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am attaching a requisition in duplicate for two compressed air water tanks size 11' 8\" x 4' for the Gordon Indian Residential School.\n\nMr. Davis, when submitting these requisitions, informs me that a leak sprung in the tank and it was welded but when the pressure was put on it again a couple more leaks showed up and the man doing the welding checked the tanks and advised they are not going to hold up very long. Consequently they will have to be replaced, and new tanks are recommended to be purchased as soon as possible.\n\nThe expense of putting in these tanks will be considerable as a portion of the wall will have to be removed and it is therefore hard to estimate what it will cost. Mr. Davis is anxious that these tanks be replaced because something serious might happen while the pupils are in school and he is therefore bringing this to the Department's attention.\n\nA request is also made for tanks with manholes in them so that they can be cleaned out every so often.\n\nM.

Gow\n\nRe:- Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nOn October 16th last the writer visited the above school to gain further information regarding its water supply. The following conditions were noted:\n\nThe water level in both the lake and well stood at elevation 90.0 feet indicating a drop of 1.2 feet since April 20th of this year. A pumping test was made similar to that carried out last spring. It took approximately one hour to lower the water from elev. 90.0 to elev. 85.5 (i.e., bottom of outlet pipe) in Chamber \"A\" and to elev. 86.5 in Chamber \"B\". As was the case this spring, all inflow to the well occurred through the lowest row of holes at elevation 85.7; this row of holes runs full and with considerable force. It was discovered that the upper rows of holes below water level were not plugged within the wall of the well so it would appear that the filter gallery is clogged above the lowest row of holes.\n\nIt was learned from the engineer of the school that during this fall, for average consumption of water, it was necessary to pump the well twice daily to maintain the school reservoir full. This spring one pumping operation was sufficient. An attempt was made to see if the 6\" G.I. inlet pipe could be utilized to draw water from a greater depth. The wooden plug covering the end of this pipe within the well was removed but no flow occurred, indicating either a plug at the other end of the pipe or the pipe clogged with earth or some other material. To make use of this pipe it would appear necessary to excavate part of the filter gallery in order to remove any plug or clean the pipe, as the case may be. This would entail excavating possibly 60 cubic yards of gravel, some sheet pile work, and dewatering a portion of the gallery. There is at present about 5 feet of water over this pipe. The above operation apart from being expensive, would only draw water from a greater depth of 0.9'. It is feared that should the above work be done in cold weather the filter bed would freeze during operations and thus cut off the supply completely.\n\n(Sgd.) O. J. Storsater.\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n332 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nNovember 7, 1944.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nAttached is a copy of a report, in duplicate, dated November 3rd by Mr. O. J. Storsater, a member of the staff of the Water Power Bureau in Winnipeg, relating to the water supply at the above school.\n\nIn a covering letter, dated November 3rd, Mr. Gow states as follows:\n\n\"You will note from this memorandum that the elevation of the lake has dropped 1.2 feet since April 20th of this year and that the water supply situation has accordingly deteriorated considerably throughout the year. It would appear, however, that there is ample water supply at the present time and that the lack of flow through the upper rows of holes into the well was not caused by frost penetration. We are hopeful, therefore, that a continuous water supply will be available for the Institution throughout the coming winter. However, no assurance can be given that failure of the water supply will not occur.\"\n\nIt is now apparent that the filtration gallery is choked with silt, except for a seam which supplies water to the lowest row of holes in the well. When this seam finally silts up, no water will reach the well.\n\nAs the pressure of water entering through the lowest row of holes is relatively high and as the ice will tend to keep the silt from being stirred up, total failure of the water supply is unlikely to occur this winter although, of course, no definite assurance can be given in this connection. However, unless there is a heavy fall of snow this winter and rainfall next year, there is a possibility of failure next year due to the low water level in the lake, combined with windy weather, which might result in the complete silting of the gallery, or the formation of so much ice that the amount of available water might be considerably reduced during the winter and early spring.\n\nEnc.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.

Storsater, dated November 3rd, which are self-explanatory.\n\nWith the lateness of the season in mind, it would not appear advisable to undertake any measures with a view to improvement to the water supply this season. Next spring, however, it will probably be well to remove at least a portion of the gravel from the gallery, and either clean or replace it.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | SERVICE                                                                 | AMOUNT |\n|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Nov 9 | To trucking boiler from Gordon's Reserve to Regina                      | 5.00   |\n|      | Vote #78, Allot #04-352                                                |        |\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

Yesterday the telephone was off for several hours, and on investigation we found a post down, rotted away and there are several other posts in a similar condition, and it is very evident that the line will very shortly be altogether out of order, for this and several other defects. The telephone is a convenience and necessity for the School as well as for the Indians on the Reserve who constantly use it, especially in the case of sickness. I shall be very grateful if you will take this matter up with the Department of Indian Affairs. The financial position of the School will not permit us to repair this line ourselves, which will cost, probably from $300.00 to $400.00\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI enclose herewith letter received from Mr. Dance, Principal of Gordon's Indian Residential School regarding the telephone line to the school.\n\nI have been speaking to the local telephone man and he informs me that most of the posts could be lowered but we would need a few new ones for the roadway.\n\nThe Department is responsible for the repair of the line from the Reserve in, a distance of some three miles.\n\nThe cost of making the necessary repairs would be about $200.00 and if authority is given I will see that the work is done.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent,\nOttawa, May 10, 1945.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 28th ultimo, with reference to the telephone line to the Gordon's Residential School. I have reviewed our file but cannot find any recent correspondence concerning this matter.\n\nThe Principal states in his letter that to repair the line would cost between $300.00 and $400. You state $200.00 would be sufficient. Do you consider the Principal over-estimated the cost of the repairs? Is this telephone line exclusively for the use of the Gordon School, or is it used by some of the other agency offices?\n\nIf this particular telephone line is used by any of the other officials of this Department, you should let me know in what proportion you consider the cost should be divided.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| April 25 | To paid W.R.

The Department will depend on you to keep the cost as low as possible.\n\nI do not understand the reference in the last paragraph to \"The Local Architect\".

Since he has taken over he has improved conditions as far as farming goes as he has put in more crop and done some summerfallow, and if given half a chance will no doubt make a success of it as he is very interested in his work and is very energetic. However it is very hard for a man of 57 to make over a position like this without previous experience, and in my opinion is a job for a younger man.\n\nThe education of the children is the same as it was before, absolutely no improvement has been made. This was one of the things I understood the Department was anxious to get rid of Mr. Frayling for. However, in my opinion, the children of this school have been, and are now receiving, as good an education as children in any other boarding school.\n\nConsiderable repairs are needed and will have to be done in the near future. However this school is in wonderful condition for the amount of money spent on it by the Department in the last 12 years. Anything that was done up to the present has been paid for mostly out of school grant. The new water tanks are on hand and will be installed as soon as I can get men to do the work.\n\nR.S.

B. Gee\n\nRe: WATER SUPPLY, GORDON'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nAT FUNNIHAY, SASKATCHEWAN\n\nAn inspection of the water supply system at the above-mentioned institution was made on June 20th and 21st by the writer.\n\nPresent Water Supply System:\n\n1. The present lake level was at 80.2 on June 20th - 0.2 ft higher than on Oct. 16, 1944. A chart showing the lake levels since 1932, based upon the data available, is attached hereto. There is apparently sufficient water available to supply the school another year and possibly longer. It is probable that so long as the lake level is at elevation 88 or higher there will be an adequate supply of water.\n\n2. The chief complaint against the present supply is that during certain seasons the taste and odour of the water are offensive, due to stagnation of the water in the lake. Analyses of the water have been obtained from time to time and have never found it unfit for use. On June 21st the water was quite good with no appreciable taste or odour. Recent heavy rains probably were responsible for its comparatively good quality.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe construction plans dated Jan. 31, 1939, show the gravel bed extending down to 6' above the bottom of the intake well or elevation 84.7, while the lowest row of holes according to Mr. O.J. Stenner's plan of April, 1944, is at elevation 84.7. We should therefore suggest drilling an additional row of holes at elevation 84.7. If this does not result in a substantial increase in the rate of inflow, the 20 ft. length of C.I. pipe could be made use of as an additional intake pipe. I would suggest rupturing the end of this pipe furtherest from the well with a light charge of dynamite, well tempered. This pipe is of no use at present so it may as well be broken if it is of advantage to do so. The explosive charge could be inserted from the well end of the pipe with a flexible leading stick. The cost of this work depends on the skill of the labour, but with even the most experienced should not be more than $50.00 for material and labour, plus the cost of engineering supervision if this is considered necessary.\n\nAlternative Water Supplies\n\nSpring - 1/2 miles south - There is a spring or well located about 1/2 miles south of the school. This was visited and found to be an unribbed well about 4 feet deep in very stony ground. The well was partially bailed out and the rate of inflow measured as 1900 gals per day. This rate is probably higher than could be maintained without lowering the water table. There is no visible flow of water or seeps go away from the area containing this well, although the ground is about ten feet lower 500 ft. to the north west. This well has been used by several Indian families for the past two or three years, summer and winter, without lowering the water level. A stadia traverse, using vertical angles for elevations, was run from the intake well by the Lake. The spring was found to be 3100 ft. south and 1200 ft. east of the intake well at the lake and to be at elevation 127, using same datum as for the lake levels. The intervening country is rolling and a location survey would have to be run before an estimate could be made of the costs of trenching and laying pipes for a gravity line.\n\nIndian Affairs.

The tank was pumped out and the outlet cleaned, but after a short time the same thing occurred again.

There was an elbow in the original installation but it has been corroded and dropped off. The concrete walls of the tank are also showing the effects of long exposure to the septic sewage. I estimate that 50% of the concrete is gone (that is, disintegrated) in the section exposed to view.\n\nRecommendation\n\nInstallation of a new elbow by inserting a pipe of smaller size into the outlet pipe for a distance of approximately 2 feet, with an elbow and 12\" length of pipe attached to the other end to hang down into the tank.\n\nA new tank will probably have to be built before many years have passed, and I do not consider it economical to incur much expense on repairs to the existing tank.

This was visited and found to be an unrobbed well about 4 feet deep in very hard ground. The well was partially bailed out and the rate of inflow measured as 1900 gals per day. This rate is probably higher than could be maintained without lowering the water table. There is no visible flow of water or seepage away from the area containing this well although the ground is about ten feet lower 500 ft. to the north west. This well has been used by several Indian families for the past two or three years, summer and winter, without lowering the water level. A stadia traverse, using vertical angles for elevations, was run back to the intake well by the Lake. The spring was found to be 6100 ft. south and 1200 ft. east of the intake well at the lake and to be at elevation 127, using same datum as for the lake levels. The intervening country is rolling and a location survey would have to be run before an estimate could be made of the costs of trenching and laying pipes for a gravity line.\nFort Lake - Was investigated some years ago and turned down as a source of supply. The water level in this lake is said to be some feet lower now than at the time of that survey so I did not visit the lake on this trip.\n\nThere are other shallow wells in the vicinity of the school which might be able to furnish enough water for a drinking water supply. None of them have been investigated however by the writer.\n\nAccording to the memorandum by Mr. W.H. Wallace of this staff, dated Nov. 15, 1943, three deep wells were drilled in the vicinity of the school in 1931 without success.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe supply of water in the lake is sufficient in quantity to supply the school for a year if the proposed alterations to the well intake are carried out. There is little hope that the diminishing trend of the present source of water supply will not continue and eventually another supply will have to be found.\n\nMore complaints from the school will probably be received about the quality of the present supply during the late summer, fall and winter. It is very desirable that a more satisfactory supply adequate for drinking and cooking purposes at least be developed. As a new supply for all purposes will probably be necessary eventually, it is doubtful if developing a separate supply for drinking can be justified economically unless done at a nominal cost.\n\nThe spring 1-1/2 miles south of the school referred to above, is certainly not large enough to supply all requirements. The cost of piping this water to the school for drinking purposes alone could not be justified.\n\nSerious consideration will have to be given to deep well drilling as a source of water if the present downward trend in the lake continues.\n\n(sgd) G.

The various points brought out in your communication were referred to our Mr. G.M. Lyon for his consideration and he has prepared a memorandum to the writer relating to the same and a copy is enclosed herewith.\n\nIt is not anticipated that trouble will be experienced at this school during the coming winter from any shortage of water. However, as will be observed from Mr. Lyon's memorandum, a water shortage must occur eventually unless some measures are taken to either develop additional water supply or to eliminate the extensive loss in the small lake from evaporation. With the lowering of the elevation of the small lake and consequent lessening of area, the growth of vegetation tends to cause deterioration in the quality of water and this is a situation that must be given consideration. It is considered that the suggestions outlined in Mr. Lyon's memorandum of July 17th should be carried out this year; both with respect to the water supply intake and the septic tank.\n\n(Bgd.) D. B. GOW\n\nD. B. Gow,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nEnc.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nIn further reference to the above subject concerning the questions brought forward in Mr. Mills' letter to you of August 1st:\n\nShallow wells might be developed in the locality by intensive exploration and testing with an auger but it is my opinion that several of these would be necessary to supply the school. Each would probably have to be located in a separate drainage basin to insure continuity of supply so it is not likely that one pipe line would serve more than one well. I do not think open ditches for carrying the small quantities of water involved would be practicable as most of the water would be lost by absorption into the soil. The topography in this locality is rolling with poorly developed natural drainage. In running the survey from the well, 1\u00bd miles south, four undrained depressions were crossed varying in elevation from 95 to 114, and five intervening summits varying from 139 to 146 in elevation; which is fairly representative of the country south of this school. The school itself is on high ground and I do not believe any well water could be found which would run to the school by gravity. In any scheme using shallow wells, I would suggest conducting the water to the concrete well in preference to the lake as sufficient water to raise the lake level materially is not likely to be found.\n\nIn considering the water supply lake again, I have come to the conclusion that the reason for the continuous decrease in water level is that the school's requirements plus evaporation, exceed the inflow from runoff plus precipitation. This excess has caused a decrease in water level averaging about 6 inches per year since the erection of the school.\n\nAn estimate of the annual inflow from runoff can be made as follows:\n\nAnnual evaporation, at least ........................................... 30 inches\nSchool use, annually @ 6,000 gallons per day = 8 acre feet\nfrom 30 acre lake or .................................................. 4 inches\n(less annual precipitation (long term mean, Regina, Yorkton, Alask) ........................................... .14 inches\n\nWith no inflow lake would drop .................................... 20 inches\nAverage annual drop in W. L. ........................................ 6 inches\n\nHence average inflow per year is ..................................... 14 inches\n\nThe present area of the lake is about 20 acres, an inflow of 25 acre-feet is indicated for the average year, which is about 3 times the consumption at the school.\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nAt present the depth of water in the lake is about ten feet and algae and weed growth cause an objectionable deterioration in the quality of the supply during certain periods of the year. The problem then is to confine the lake or a portion of it to an area sufficiently small that the evaporation loss will not be serious and sufficiently deep that weed and algae growth will not be a nuisance. One method of doing this would be to construct a dugout or reservoir at the side of the lake. A reservoir 40 feet wide and 290 feet long at the bottom, at elevation 60, with 3 to 1 earth slopes extending upward to elevation 100, would hold about 700,000 cubic feet or 15 acre-feet of water below elevation 80, the level of the lake bottom. About 60,000 cubic yards of material would have to be removed from the lake shore and bottom and deposited in the form of levees about 250 feet off shore to construct the reservoir. The surface area of the water in the reservoir at elevation 80 would be about 1.5 acres, so that the evaporation loss would be about 4 acre-feet per year in the reservoir.\n\nIf this reservoir were constructed, I would not anticipate that it would hold all the water in the lake and the two would be at about the same level, connected by either a culvert with a control gate or by a porous gravel gallery through the earth fill. The advantage of the reservoir would be its greater depth, comparative ease of controlling weeds and algae, and consequently better quality of water. It also seems probable that it would offer a permanent solution to the water supply problem, although it would be costly. No field information was obtained for this proposal. If it is considered, information on soil conditions, cross sections of the lake shore, sounding, etc., will be necessary.\n\nRe the filter gallery. Although the gravel feeding the upper rows of holes is partly clogged with silt, the water is entering the well from the lake with sufficient ease to supply the school without difficulty. I suggested drilling extra holes lower down in the well to increase the flow from the lake and also to safeguard the supply against the action of frost during the winter as it is probable that the W.L. will be lower next winter than it has ever been in the past. Replacement of the gravel or cleaning it would be expensive as it would have to be done below the present water level. It does not seem economical to do so at present when the source of water supply is in doubt.\n\nI have no information on the gate which was designed to cut off the flow into the well. I did not see it in the well. In any case the flow could be stopped if it is necessary to do so, by driving wooden plugs partially into the holes. The plugs could be pulled out afterwards.\n\nG. M. Lyon,\n\n(Sgd.) G. M. Lyon\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nRe: Water Supply and Septic Tank, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nReferring to your memorandum of May 1st, we are now in receipt of a report from Mr. Gow on the subject of the water supply for the above school. Attached in duplicate are copies of the following:\n\n(1) Report by Mr. G.M. Lyon dated July 17th dealing with the water supply.\n\n(2) Report by Mr. G.M. Lyon dated July 17th, dealing with the septic tank.\n\n(3) Chart showing water levels of water supply lake over a period of years.\n\n(4) Letter of transmittal from Mr. Gow dated July 17th, 1945.\n\n(5) Further report from Mr. Lyon dated August 4th with covering letter from Mr. Gow of same date.\n\nIt is recommended that an additional row of holes be drilled at elevation 84-0\" in the concrete well, that is, at a depth of one foot below the level of the lowest row of holes at present. Care should be taken not to drill them too low as it is unlikely that water would be drawn off if they are drilled much below the level of the invert of the 6\" cast iron pipe. This work should be done this fall by the local agency officials.\n\nAs the level of the lake is still receding, steps should be taken as soon as possible to provide additional water for this school.\n\nRepairs to the septic tank will cost $20.00.\n\nT.S. Mills\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, August 16th, 1945.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Water Supply and Septic Tank, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nEnclosed, for your information, are copies of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated August 9th and of the correspondence referred to therein, relative to the above, which are self-explanatory.\n\nMr. Mills' and Mr. Gow's recommendations regarding the drilling of an additional row of holes in the concrete well as a temporary expedient and the repairs to the septic tank are concurred in.\n\nIt would appear, however, that the problem of a permanent satisfactory water supply for this school is one in which early consideration will have to be given and the prospects for securing such a supply at moderate cost are not good.\n\nMr. Lyon and Mr. Gow in their letters, dated July 17th last, seem to consider that deep well drilling will have to be undertaken. Mr. Lyon also refers, however, to three deep wells having been drilled in the vicinity of the school in 1921 without success. If deep well drilling is resorted to, a number of dry holes or wells with very small supply may be all that will be secured.\n\n(over)\nIt will also be recalled that in 1938 Mr. Dempster made a report upon a project to bring water from Fort Lake; the estimated installation cost at that time being $10,000.00. Copy of that report was sent you with our memorandum of August 23rd, 1938. The cost of that project would undoubtedly be considerably greater now. Although it will be noted that Mr. Lyon reports that the level of Fort Lake is several feet lower than it was a few years ago, nevertheless to augment the present supply from Fort Lake appears to be the only dependable source of obtaining a water supply for the school.\n\nIt would appear that consideration will have to be given as to whether a very large expenditure is justified to secure a permanent water supply for this school.\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeneral Executive Assistant.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to report that while the plumbers were at the Gordon Indian Residential School installing the new tanks, I had them go over the sewerage system there and clean out the pipes.\n\nAt the time the whole system was plugged and in very bad shape and I was afraid of an epidemic unless this was fixed at once.\n\nI trust this action will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nR.S.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nI am in receipt of a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch regarding the water supply and septic tank at the Gordon Indian Residential School. The following recommendations have been made by the Surveys and Engineering Branch:\n\n(a) Water Supply\n\nThe construction plans dated Jan. 31, 1939, show the gravel bed extending down to 6\" above the bottom of the intake well or elevation 84.7, while the lowest row of holes according to Mr. O.J. Storsater's plan of April, 1944, is at elevation 85.7. I would therefore suggest drilling an additional row of holes at elevation 84.7. If this does not result in a substantial increase in the rate of inflow, the 20 ft. length of C.I. pipe could be made use of as an additional intake pipe. I would suggest rupturing the end of this pipe furthest from the well with a light charge of dynamite, well tamped. This pipe is of no use at present so it may as well be broken if it is of advantage to do so. The explosive charge could be inserted from the well end of the pipe with a flexible loading stick. The cost of this work depends on the skill of the labour, but with even the most experienced should not be more than $50.00 for material and labour, plus the cost of engineering supervision if this is considered necessary.\n\n(b) Septic Tank\n\nThe septic tank was found to be operating satisfactorily at the time of inspection, but during the late winter the outlet pipe became clogged to such an extent that there was no discharge from the system.\n\n...... The tank\nThe tank was pumped out and the outlet cleaned, but after a short time the same thing occurred again. The cause of the trouble is apparently due to the absence of a submerged outlet from the tank to the discharge pipe. There was an elbow in the original installation but it has been corroded and dropped off. The concrete walls of the tank are also showing the effects of long exposure to the septic sewage. I estimate that 50% of the concrete is gone (that is, disintegrated) in the section exposed to view.\n\nRecommendation\n\nInstallation of a new elbow by inserting a pipe of smaller size into the outlet pipe for a distance of approximately 2 feet, with an elbow and 12\" length of pipe attached to the other end to hang down into the tank.\n\nA new tank will probably have to be built before many years have passed, and I do not consider it economical to incur much expense on repairs to the existing tank. I would suggest that $20.00 be made available for this repair work.\n\nThe Department approves an expenditure of $70.00 for carrying out the above mentioned recommendations.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nYE230 29 COLLECT DL= PUNNICHY SASK 29 1135A\n\nINDIAN AFFAIRS BRANCH=\n\nDEPT MINES AND RESOURCES OTTAWA ONT=\n\nBATTERIES AT GORDON SCHOOL USED UP AND THERE FROM MUSCOUEQUAN SCHOOL URGENTLY NEEDED HAS SPINNER MUSCOUEQUAN SCHOOL BEEN PURCHASED SO THAT BATTERIES MAY BE TRANSFERRED TO GORDON SCHOOL=\n\nR S DAVIS INDIAN AGENT.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Davis, Indian Agent, Touchwood Agency, and I find the water situation there is bad. In 1936 a system of a coffer dam and sand and gravel filter was installed at the lake near the Gordon's School. The water from the lake filters by gravity through the gravel and sand to a well on the bank of the lake. The depth of the water at the lake has gradually receded to the point where there is only a very small quantity of water filtering into the well. So far as I am aware the only solution is to deepen the well, remove the present gravel, and sand, deepen the excavation 2 or 3 feet, and refill with clean new gravel. The probable cost of new gravel would be in the neighborhood of $200.00. The necessary work would be in the neighborhood of $200.00. This would provide water for washing and bathing purposes if chlorinated. As the water in the lake has not been replenished this year it has lost much depth by evaporation and is very stagnant. It also has quite an unpleasant odor. The staff of the school are complaining that it is making them ill and they refuse to drink it.\n\nAbout 2 miles away from the school there is a spring which could be dug out, properly cobbled, and covered, thus providing a supply of drinking water. The drinking water from the spring could be hauled to the school in a tank but the school has no tank available for hauling the water.\n\nI would recommend that authority be granted immediately for the expenditure of $200.00 to have a tank constructed for hauling the drinking water. The matter of wash water is also urgent and if funds are available authority should be granted for the work which I have proposed at the earliest possible date as it will have to be done before freeze-up. Mr. Dance and Mr. Davis are preparing requisitions in connection with this and forwarding them direct to Ottawa. This letter, therefore, is only in support of the requisitions which you have received or will receive within a day or so.\n\nI would like to point out that this expenditure which I am recommending is a temporary, urgent measure to meet the present situation but if the lake continues to recede it is quite probable that a further heavy expenditure will be required to solve the water question at the Gordon's School within the next two or three years. In the meantime we can only hope that the snowfall which we can reasonably expect to have this winter will replenish the lake considerably and thereby overcome the loss of water which it has suffered this year. The Gordon's School cost a great deal of money and it is not many years since it was opened. In my opinion it was not erected in the right place in the beginning because small lakes in this country are not dependable as a water supply and this is a very small lake. I had a raft constructed yesterday in order to go out on the lake and ascertain the greatest depth. The greatest depth which I could find was about 8'. I understand that when the school was built the depth of the water was about 14' but 14' in a small lake is not a great deal of water.\n\nI found that both Lister engines at the school are in very bad condition. One is completely out of working order while awaiting some small repairs. The other is working but there is a decided knock in it. This engine may be out of condition at almost any moment. The newly appointed engineer at the school is a man of probably 70 years of age and has had experience in steam engines only. I do not believe he knows as much about the Lister engines as I do. Mr. Davis is writing for authority to have a man by the name of Montgomery come from Winnipeg to overhaul the two engines. Mr. Montgomery is recommended to us as a Lister engine expert and I am informed that he will be able to do all the necessary work.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\nable to do all the necessary work to put both engines in good repair after he has found exactly what is wrong.\n\nThree cows have recently calved at the school. One of them is not a milk cow at all, the other two are very poor milk cows. The only hope for a milk supply this winter is in the purchase of a number of new milk cows, I would say 8 or 10, which have recently calved or will soon calve. Almost no hay was raised on the school farm this year and Mr. Dance had to buy feed for the cows which he hopes to get, and the horses which he now has. Only 4 of these horses are of much use and more work horses are needed. The farm implements of the school are old and almost useless and will have to be replaced before the farm work can be carried out satisfactorily next year. I do not know whether the Department is prepared to assist the school in the purchase of needed animals and machinery either by grant or loan against school grant to be paid later but assistance of some kind is badly needed to put the school in proper working shape.\n\nIt has been customary to grow a supply of vegetables in the school gardens for use at the school. The crop of garden vegetables is almost a complete failure and vegetables will have to be purchased.\n\nReverend Mr. Dance, the present Principal, took over this school early this year with practically no staff and very little to work with. My impression of Mr. Dance is that he is an able and learned man but no Principal can do a good job in a residential school with as little to work with as Mr. Dance has had. I examined the supply of clothing recently purchased for the children and I find it almost adequate for the coming term. The school staff is complete except the exception of a matron and a cook. There is a Boy's Supervisor but I do not think a very satisfactory one. I am also not satisfied with the present engineer. He should be replaced with a younger man with the necessary qualifications to attend to daily repairs of machinery and other equipment. Most of the flush toilets are not working satisfactorily but all that is needed is cleaning out by a man who understands them.\n\nJ.F.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, 11th September, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR OF SURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH\n\nRe: Water Supply - Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nIn your memorandum of August 16th, 1945, you forwarded me a report regarding the above and the recommendations contained in your report were forwarded to Mr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI enclose for your information an extract from a letter received from J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies, Regina, Sask., who visited the above mentioned school on September 7th, 1945.\n\nI would appreciate it if you would have one of your engineers visit this school again in the immediate future with a view to determining if the work suggested by our Inspector would serve temporarily to increase the water supply. As the season is advancing, the work should be done immediately.\n\nIf your engineer concurs in the suggestions of our Inspector, you should instruct him to proceed at once.\n\nWe are forwarding to Mr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask., $530.00 so that funds will be available on the site.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, llth September, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nYour letter of September 8th with reference to the Gordon's Indian Residential School was discussed with the Director this afternoon. The Surveys and Engineering Branch is being requested to have one of their engineers visit the Gordon's School at the earliest possible date. If the engineer concurs in your recommendations, he is being authorized to proceed with the work immediately and in order that it will not be delayed through lack of funds, an accountable cheque for $530.00 is being forwarded to Indian Agent Davis.\n\nI note that arrangements have also been made by the Agent to have the Lister engines repaired. Your action in this regard is approved.\n\nIt is not our present policy to supply horses, cattle or farm machinery to a Residential School. If the school management finds it necessary to purchase additional cows at the present time, we might be able to assist by giving him an advance on the per capita grant but such an advance would have to be repaid before the end of the present fiscal year which occurs on March 31st, 1946. When feed is scarce I presume that the Principal will not purchase additional horses this fall.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter which concerns the general management of the school, I will write to you later.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nInformation Copy sent to: Mr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\nOttawa, 14th September, 1945.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nNo doubt you have received the copy of my letter of the 11th instant to Indian Inspector Ostrander with reference to the water supply at Gordon's Residential School.\n\nAuthority is granted for the expenditure of $80.00 for the construction of a tank to haul drinking water to the school.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept., Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to advise that the engines in the Gordon's Indian Residential School are in very bad shape, not doubt due to wear and tear.\n\nMost of the schools haven't a qualified man to run the engines and in my opinion the schools should be compelled to engage a man of this calibre, as it is not fair to the Department to have valuable equipment installed and then having incompetent men running it. This is mostly due to low wages paid.\n\nI would be glad if the Department would authorize the engaging of a man from the Lister Company in Winnipeg to thoroughly overhaul these engines. I understand they have a Mr. Montgomery who goes out and does this kind of work and I would like very much to have him overhaul the engines in Gordon's School.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 15th September, 1945.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nThe Department finds it necessary to return your voucher No. 334. On this account is an item of $168.00 for labour. The account should show the number of days and rate per day or the number of hours and rate per hour. The exact date on which work was performed should also be shown on the account.\n\nWe will also have to have an explanation for the item $14.70 for train fare. This should show the points between which travel was made and the person making the trip. A receipt will have to be forwarded from the Freight Company for the item $5.19 for freight.\n\nNo action is being taken with reference to two requisitions which you forwarded as the requests made on these requisitions have already been covered by my letters of September 11th and 14th.\n\nI also have your letter of the 11th instant stating that the engines at the Gordon's School are in bad condition. If you cannot obtain the services of a competent man closer than Winnipeg, the Department approves the engagement of the person mentioned in the last paragraph of your letter. However, it is hoped you will keep the expenditure in this regard as low as possible as we have already spent on Gordon's School more money than was specifically provided in the current year's appropriation and consequently we have had to draw on allotted items in our vote.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nRe: Water Supply - Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nThis will acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with enclosed copy of extract from a report by Mr. Ostrander relating to the above mentioned subject. The proposals outlined in Mr. Ostrander's report have been discussed with Mr. Lyon and other members of this staff and we do not consider that a visit to the site by an engineer from this staff at this time would add to the data already available.\n\nBlueprints Nos. 11-27-1, 11-27-2 and 11-27-3 enclosed with your letter of April 4, 1944 shows the proposed design of intake and filtration gallery as constructed in 1938-39. I understand $5,000 was expended on the project before work ceased due to failure of the coffer dam. Mr. Ostrander proposes to excavate the filtration gallery two or three feet deeper and refill with gravel and also deepen the well. He estimates the cost of gravel at $250.00 and labor at $200.00. There is now in excess of 5 feet of water in the gallery and if the excavation were to be carried 3 feet deeper, that would mean 8 feet of water to contend with. It is quite obvious that $200.00 would not go far on a job of that nature where coffer-damming and unwatering is such a major factor to be considered.\n\nWe would again suggest that the recommendations outlined in Mr. Lyon's report be carried out. We would also approve of Mr. Ostrander's suggestion concerning the provision for drinking water. It will be advisable to have a sample of the drinking water sent to the Public Health authorities at Regina to ascertain whether or not the water would be pure enough for drinking without chlorination.\n\nSgd. \"D.B. Gow,\"\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nT. S. Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of the 11th instant I am enclosing a copy of a letter from Mr. Gow, District Chief Engineer, dated September 17th. You will note that Mr. Gow does not think an inspection by an engineer at this time will be of any advantage.\n\nAfter reviewing the reports and correspondence the following action is suggested:\n\n(a) Your Indian Agent to undertake the inexpensive work described under the heading \"Recommendation\" in Engineer Lyon's report of July 17th 1945 (a copy of which was forwarded you on August 16th last). Additional holes to be drilled in the intake well would take advantage of any increase in the Lake level.\n\n(b) The undertaking of the work suggested by Mr. Ostrander, which includes deepening the well and the excavation and refilling with clean new gravel. In view of the difficulty formerly experienced in work on the intake, it is the view that it will cost more than $450 to carry out Mr. Ostrander's plan. The Indian Agent could be authorized, however, to spend $450 on this particular phase of the work, and then report to you by wire whether the progress made warrants any further expenditure along the lines suggested by Mr. Ostrander.\n\n(over)\nOttawa, September 26, 1945.\n\nMr. R. S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nI desire to refer to my letter of August 30 with reference to certain recommendations made by the Surveys and Engineering Branch in connection with the water supply and septic tank at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I trust that the work authorized in that letter has been completed.\n\nSubsequent to my communication, we received another letter from Inspector Ostrander, and his letter was also referred to the Surveys and Engineering Branch. I wrote you in regard to this matter on September 14.\n\nPart of Mr. Ostrander's letter of September 11 read as follows:\n\n\"In 1938 a system of a coffer dam and sand and gravel filter was installed at the lake near the Gordon's School. The water from the lake filters by gravity through the gravel and sand to a well on the bank of the lake. The depth of the water at the lake has gradually receded to the point where there is only a very small quantity of water filtering into the well. So far as I am aware the only solution is to deepen the well, renew the present gravel, and sand, deepen the excavation 2 or 3 ft., and refill with clean new gravel. The probable cost of new gravel would be in the neighbourhood of $250.00. The other necessary work would be in the neighbourhood of $200.00. This would provide water for washing and bathing purposes if chlorinated. As the water in the lake has not been replenished this year it has lost much depth by evaporation and is very stagnant. It also has quite an...\"\nunpleasant odor. The staff of the school are complaining that it is making them ill and they refuse to drink it.\"\n\nWith reference to Mr. Ostrander's suggestion, the Surveys and Engineering Branch advise that they approve of the work being carried out along the lines the Inspector suggests. However, they feel that the cost might exceed $450.00. Consequently, you are authorized to expend an amount not exceeding $450.00 on this particular phase of the work, and, if it is not completed by the time this amount is expended, you should wire whether the progress made warrants any further expenditure along the lines suggested by Mr. Ostrander. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to the Inspector. I have already forwarded to you an accountable advance of $550.00.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, September 26, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDIRECTOR,\nSURVEYS AND ENGINEERING BRANCH.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nI am in receipt of your memorandum of September 24, with reference to the above.\n\nRegarding your recommendation \"a\", the Indian Agent was written on August 30 and directed to carry out the \"Recommendation\" contained in Engineer Lyon's report of July 17, 1945, which was forwarded to this office under cover of your memorandum of August 16.\n\nThe Indian Agent is being written today and instructed to carry out your recommendation \"b\".\n\nActing Director.\nGordon's Indian Residential School\n\nin account with\n\nW.

(RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Ottawa\n\nI am enclosing herewith requisition for materials and labour required for overhauling the heating system and flush toilets throughout the building at the Gordon's Indian Residential School, Touchwood Agency. This consists of $218.70 for materials and $250.00 for labour on the heating plant, also an estimated $50.00 for labour on the mechanism of the toilets.\n\nMuch of the equipment in this building is getting out of repair. This requisition is concerned with heating pipes which have become corroded with the result that new leaks are appearing every few days in different parts of the building. In addition to leaks in the pipes some sections of the radiators have started leaking, two of them very definitely the result of leaving a window open in the winter time and the heat turned off, resulting in freezing. I think the majority of the leaks are the result of deterioration by age and rusting. It will be necessary to replace all of the pipes which are weak and there are probably sufficient pipes on hand for this purpose. The $250.00 shown as labour is for a plumber who will have to be brought from Saskatoon, the nearest available plumber, and it would require considerable time to perform all the necessary work.\n\nI have been reporting from time to time on this school and I can only add to previous reports in connection with the staff of the school that there is very little improvement. Reverend Mr. Dance, who has been the Principal since last January, has resigned, and the position is being filled by a Reverend Mr. Parry, regarding whom some correspondence has gone to the Department from the Bishop of the Diocese. I am not prepared to say whether he will be an improvement on Mr. Dance or not but I am prepared to say that the Department will be continually paying for new equipment and repairs to old equipment until the school authorities are able to secure the services of a properly qualified engineer and I do not think they will secure one at the amount of $35.00 a month and full maintenance which they are now offering. I have discussed this with the officials of the Diocese on several occasions. They have made a change recently but the man newly appointed will not stay.\n\nI have received a confidential report to the effect that several of the children have lice and several others have Impetigo. The source of my information is authentic and I have no reason to doubt its truth, but I have not visited the school since receiving the report.\n\nIn my report of the 6th...........\nIn my report of the 8th ultimo on this school I mentioned in the last paragraph thereof that the supply of clothing for the winter was almost adequate. When I said almost adequate I had in mind the question of footwear as only a small amount of footwear had been received and Mr. Dance assured me that the remainder of the requirements had been ordered and were expected every day. This footwear has not yet arrived and Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent, tells me that a number of the children are practically without shoes.\n\nIn the same report I mentioned that I was not satisfied with either the engineer or boys' supervisor. Both of these have been replaced but with no apparent improvement. The school is still without the services of a suitable kitchen matron and I have been in receipt of complaints from the Indians about the food. Certainly the children are not getting sufficient meat or variety in their food.\n\nWith regard to the water situation, which has been the subject of considerable correspondence, and which was referred to in Department letter of the 25th ultimo, No. 121-1-5 addressed to Mr. Davis, the Indian Agent, I am now quite aware that the estimate which I made of $450.00 in that connection was far too low. At the time I made the estimate I had no definite information as to the construction of the filter. I now find that there was a depth of 13' of gravel in this filter which looked to me like probably 4' or 5'. Such a construction would be a large excavation job which can only be done by a dragline because it has to be performed in water and mud. It would cost from $200.00 to $500.00 to get the services of a dragline at the site because there is not one anywhere in that vicinity and the ones which are available in the province are very busy at other work. The excavation would probably cost another $200.00 to $300.00 and the necessary gravel to fill the new excavation plus the cost of re-arranging the pipe to the present well would no doubt be close to $1,000.00.\n\nInstead of attempting to carry out such a project this fall when we are nearly into the winter, Mr. Davis is going to dynamite the gravel in the present filter in order to stir it up sufficiently to let an adequate water supply through for the winter. This will not be nearly as expensive as a new filter system and will probably meet the present urgent need. The Department will be advised further in connection with this phase of the matter as soon as the dynamiting has been done.\n\nJ.F.B.

The expenditure required by this requisition is strictly unavoidable and the public interest will suffer if it is not made.\n\nSIGNED\u2014\n\nAPPROVED\u2014\n\nDirector\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6311, file 654-5, part 10)\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, October 19, 1945.\n\nMr. J.P.B. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 16th instant, with reference to the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe requisition for materials has been forwarded today to the Purchasing Branch, and I am requesting the Departmental Purchasing Agent to give the matter his immediate consideration.\n\nWhen purchase of the materials is approved, you may incur an expenditure of $250.00 for labour on the heating plant and an estimated $50.00 for labour on the mechanism of the toilets.\n\nI regret to note in the sixth paragraph of your letter that neither the new engineer nor the boys' supervisor is up to standard.\n\nIn connection with your statements regarding lack of clothing and quality and quantity of food, I enclose, for your information, copy of a letter dated October 5, addressed to Indian Agent Davis, to which no reply has yet been received.\n\nI have just discussed your letter with the Director and it is felt that you should make a very complete inspection of the Gordon's Residential School at the earliest possible date. If you ascertain that the complaints you have heard are correct, you should\ninterview Right Reverend E. H. Knowles, Bishop of Qu'Appelle, and the members of his committee who supervise the operation of the Gordon's School.\n\nFollowing your inspection of the school and your discussion with the gentlemen mentioned in the preceding paragraph, you should submit a complete report to this office.\n\nThe action that Mr. Davis and yourself propose taking with regard to the water situation is approved.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEncl.\ndeal to the school and solve a big problem for the Department.\n\nI am personally of the opinion that the chances are good to strike water, but of course one never knows for sure. While we might get some water in the well, we might not get a large enough supply, but as there are springs within a mile west of this, I think the chances are good.\n\nIf the Department sees fit to have me try this, I would be glad if authority by wire could be sent me to go on with the work, as the season is getting late.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to Departmental letter #121-1-5 dated September 11, 1945, I beg to advise that I had men drill holes in the bottom of the cement well and had the pipe blown which extends 20 ft from the well towards the lake, and which was plugged, and the water is coming in fairly good. I feel the school should have enough water now to keep them going.\n\nBefore blowing this pipe and cutting the holes only enough water came in to allow them to pump for 20 minutes, but now enough water comes in, in 2\u00bd hours to allow them to pump for 40 minutes. This is about double the supply they had before.\n\nI have spent very little of the accountable cheque for $530.00 forwarded me for this work, there is approximately $400.00 left.\n\nWhen the well digger was out blowing the pipes, I had him look over the land and see if there was any possibility of locating a well for drinking water. He seems to think I can get water about 80 ft down, and close to the school, which if it could be obtained, would give us a source of drinking water right at the door and the water from the lake would be used for washing and other purposes.\n\nWhile we have a spring dugout about a mile away and can haul the water, we will have to build a tank inside the school to hold the water. This is all right as a temporary measure, but I would like very much to be allowed to use some of the money on hand to dig a well, and if we didn't get water the loss would not be much, and if we did, it would mean a great\ndeal to the school and solve a big problem for the Department.\n\nI am personally of the opinion that the chances are good to strike water, but of course one never knows for sure. While we might get some water in the well, we might not get a large enough supply, but as there are springs within a mile west of this, I think the chances are good.\n\nIf the Department sees fit to have me try this, I would be glad if authority by wire could be sent me to go on with the work, as the season is getting late.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nGORDON'S SCHOOL\n\nMr. Dance the Principal of the school resigned and the new principal is Mr. Perry. He has only just arrived and I am hoping for some improvement.\n\nThe Principals appointed since Mr. Frayling left may be good preachers but they know nothing about running a boarding school and the school lacks organization and leadership. In my opinion the school has deteriorated about 70% since a layman was taken away as Principal. If things keep going as they have in the past, the Department will have to take strong action to see that this school is brought up to a higher level.\n\nThe general care of the children is nothing like it was when Mr. Frayling was principal.\n\nThe new pressure tanks have been installed and engines overhauled. The mechanic from Munford Medland Co. of Winnipeg who overhauled them advised me they were in worse condition than any engines he had overhauled in a boarding school. These have been fixed up to run until next summer, but will have to be shipped to Winnipeg and completely rebuilt.\n\nWhile in Winnipeg I took up the matter of water supply with the engineering branch of the Dept. Mines & Resources and have since drilled holes in the bottom of the tanks and have obtained a better supply of water than before. It took 3 hours for the tanks to fill up so as they could pump 20 minutes. Now it takes 4 hours for the tanks to fill up and they can pump 40 minutes. As soon as I can get the supplies I will dynamite a pipe which is plugged in the drainage pit and when this is done I expect we will have enough water without digging out all the gravel, as was suggested.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 30th October, 1945.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nI have your letter of the 24th instant with reference to the well at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. It is noted that you have money on hand from accountable cheque which we forwarded to you some weeks ago and you may expend some of the money to dig a new well as recommended in the latter part of your letter. Of course, it is understood that you will keep expenditures as low as possible.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, Regina, October 27th, 1945\n\nAs instructed in Department letter of the 19th instant, No. 121-1-5, I visited the Gordon's School on the 23rd instant, meeting Dr. A.B. Simes, Medical Superintendent, there by arrangement and without advising the school authorities that we were going. The delay in reporting to the Department was because Bishop Knowles had some delay in calling together his committee to discuss the question with me. I now have to report as follows:\n\nExamination of the children in the classrooms disclosed the following: 42 had lice in their hair (most of these were girls); 17 had Impetigo; and 2 had Scabies. 36 children were without underwear; 77 had either no stockings or stockings which were not fit to wear; and 43 were wearing shoes which were not fit to wear for one reason or another. Some of these shoes were running shoes, some were laced rubbers, but for the greater part they were leather shoes worn out or nearly worn out.\n\nExamination of the children revealed also that much of the clothing which they were wearing was very dirty and I am certain that the children are not getting regular baths.\n\nIn the sewing room there was a great quantity of underwear and stockings waiting to be mended mostly consisting of clothing carried over from last term and partly worn. However, it required only mending in order to render it satisfactory for use. Two good purposes would be served by the mending, first in teaching such work to the girls, and secondly by the teaching of thrift and the care of clothing which Indians badly need.\n\nIn order to furnish the Department with some concrete figures as to the clothing needs we visited the store-room where the new clothing is kept. Because the clothing is stored in a small room where it is impossible to sort it in sizes or even in varieties, it was impossible to get a good check of it. I am reasonably certain, however, that much of the boys' underwear is in the larger sizes and there are about 30 small boys without underwear. As well as we were able to ascertain clothing has been bought for the children with little regard to sizes. With many staff changes, as this school has been having, it naturally follows that the new staff member taking over a particular part of the work has no guide other than his or her own powers of observation. Neither the Principal nor the Matron of this school has been there long enough during the last nine months to have learned what variety of clothing is needed. When little boys have learned they have not been successful in passing on to others. For this reason I informed the Matron that she should at once insist upon having a larger room for the storage of the clothing and get it sorted in such a manner that she could tell very quickly the various stocks which were getting low. There is a room adjoining the boys' playroom which is not being used for anything at the present time and which would be quite suitable for this purpose. In previous reports I have mentioned the shortage of footwear at this school. When making enquiries about the footwear twice in the past I was informed by Reverend Mr. Dance, the Principal of the School, that footwear was expected any time and was on order. Now no one seems to be very sure whether this footwear is coming or not. In any case they need both boys' and girls' shoes in all sizes, rubbers for the girls and some kind of waterproofs for the boys to wear when playing and when working around the stables and outbuildings. As stated I examined all the children who were in the classrooms but there were a number of the children at other places who were examined later. A number of these were boys who came from the stables and outbuildings where they had been working. There had been a recent fall of snow and considerable moisture around, and the boys were working in old leather boots.\n\nAll had wet feet and there is...........\nAll had wet feet and there is certainly no waterproof footwear in the school stock. The present Matron had been at the school only one week but was in charge on the day of our visit because the Principal was away. One would naturally expect that with experience of only one week the Matron would know little about the school and should also expect that she would know something about her duties. She did not seem to know what duties, responsibilities, or authority she had and I feel certain that the Principal had not taken the trouble to furnish her with the information. She seemed very willing to learn and anxious to succeed. I believe her previous experience has fitted her for the work but the Principal should not have left the school until the Matron was at least aware of her duties and responsibilities. She did not seem to know that she had a right to tell others what to do and a responsibility to see that her orders were carried out.\n\nAs a result of the complete disorganization of this school the children's meals are not managed in a proper manner. There seems to have been no planning whatever in the handling of the food. There has been no kitchen matron permanently in charge since the school opened this term. The result has been that the temporary cook prepared meals from time to time with what happened to be on hand. I tried to ascertain from conversation with the Matron whether the children are actually getting a balanced diet or not. She did not know what the children had been receiving for their meals during the past week but she had prepared the noon meal of that day. It consisted of baked beans, bread, buttermilk, and jam. I intended to be at the school in time to see this meal served but bad roads and delay in leaving the office in the morning resulted in my arriving shortly after noon. However, Dr. Simes and I were present when the evening meal was served to the children. It consisted of the following:\n\n- A very small slice of bologna; potatoes; and bread with a small quantity of lard and a very meager quantity of skimmed milk. This was about one third of a cup each. The Matron told me that the children's supper consists mostly of bread and jam when they have jam. I had criticised this strongly which was probably the reason why they had potatoes and no bologna at this meal. The salt cellar on the boys' table was a 1 lb. jam tin with some holes in the top. I would expect to find this in an Indian house but not in a school where the Indian children are supposed to be taught how these things should be done. There is room in the children's dining-room for another table but instead of installing another table the boys were crowded together at one long table in such a manner that they could hardly move. It is a certainty that the children of this school are not getting enough meat, only a small quantity of skim milk from the separator. No effort whatever is made toward furnishing them with anything in the nature of a balanced diet and the meals are not planned. In addition to a planned weekly menu some effort should be made to make the meal a little bit more attractive and this will not be done until the school has the services of a reasonably well qualified kitchen Matron and the food is purchased systematically. Dr. Simes is going to prepare an inexpensive weekly menu for the school and I informed the Matron that the Department would expect the school authorities to follow this as near as possible.\n\nThe bakery and the shelves where the bread is kept were very unclean. I do not know how long it is since these shelves were properly cleaned but I feel quite certain that they have not been cleaned since I saw them the first week that school was opened. The junior classroom is on the third floor of the building. On my previous visit to the school I had noticed that the fire escape door of this room was locked with a padlock. I instructed Mr. Dance, the Principal, to place the key to this padlock in charge of the teacher in order that she could easily remove the children from the classroom in case of an emergency. This has still not been done. As previously stated, the new Principal, Mr. Parry, was away at the time of my visit and nobody present knew where the key to this padlock was. In case of fire or other emergency these small children would have had to go down a narrow stairway three flights to get out of the building.\n\nOn the day of my visit the gravel filter which supplies the wash water from the lake was dynamited. This stirred up the gravel sufficiently that an ample quantity of water is going through the filter now for washing purposes for the rest of the winter unless the ice forms so thick on the lake that it will interfere, which is not at all probable.\n\nNothing has yet been done about drinking water, with the exception that a dam is being constructed to be used for hauling drinking water from the spring. The water question was referred to in my report of the 16th of October and also of the 8th of...\nand also of the 6th of September, on this school, and I need not add anything thereto. Mr. Davis is making a request to the Department for authority to make an effort to obtain a sufficient supply of drinking water from a well in the school yard. The man who was present, on the day of my visit, to dynamite the gravel filter, is also an experienced well man and he is of the opinion that a supply of drinking water can be secured at a depth not exceeding 50' and within the school yard.\n\nIn accordance with authority contained in your letter of the 18th instant the necessary action will be taken in connection with the heating plant and the mechanism of the toilets as soon as the services of a plumber can be secured.\n\nWith regard to the fifth paragraph of your letter referred to the Department will have received Mr. Davis' report in this connection dated October 17th.\n\nWith reference to the meeting which was held yesterday with the committee of the Anglican Church, I am sure the committee were quite aware of the need for immediate improvement at the Gordon's School. The engineer has been changed twice recently and is being changed again. A new man is coming at the end of this month and I am not prepared to say whether he will be satisfactory or not because I do not know him. The school authorities have been endeavouring for some considerable time to secure a satisfactory kitchen matron but without success. The Chairman of the committee informed me yesterday that the Selective Service office here in Regina has many similar positions to be filled and few applicants, therefore they have little hope of immediately filling the position with a suitable person. The present Boys' Supervisor is a Mr. S.A. Dodds who was farming instructor at the school and later farming instructor on one of our reserves; and not very satisfactory in either appointments. I have much doubt that he will prove satisfactory as Boys' Supervisor. I think there is a possibility that the new Matron will be satisfactory when she has been properly instructed in her duties. I took much time on the date of my visit to instruct her. This should have been done by the Principal, of course, but apparently he had not done so. However, I believe she now knows what her duties are.\n\nThe newly appointed Principal, Reverend Mr. Parry, had been at the school for three weeks at the time of my visit and I cannot see that he has done anything whatever in the way of improvement although I had some hope that he would when he was appointed. If he knows anything about the management of an institution of that size and the direction of the work of his staff in an efficient manner he certainly has not shown it. As he was absent on the date of my visit I did not have a chance to discuss the affairs of the school with him but I discussed them very thoroughly with the Matron and asked her to take notes of everything which I said and to take them up with the Principal as soon as he returned. The committee are also writing the Principal pointing out the various unsatisfactory conditions which I discussed with them. If he does not make an effort to immediately correct most of these unsatisfactory conditions he should not be allowed to remain. I had an interview with Mr. Parry before he was appointed and my discussion with him lead me to believe that he would make a real effort to improve conditions. He certainly seemed to know what was wrong. However, knowing what the faults of the past administration of the school were and having the ability to correct them himself are entirely different things and my present impression is that he lacks this ability.\n\nI believe that a letter from the Department to the Bishop of Qu'Appelle to the effect that present conditions at the Gordon's School cannot be tolerated and that immediate improvement was expected otherwise the school will have to be closed, would be the best course at this time. Mr. Davis and I have both spent much more time in connection with this school than we should have and the work which we have been doing is the work which is regularly done by an efficient school. No matter how much time we put in the school will not be properly operated until they get an efficient Principal.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, October 31, 1945.\n\nMy dear Bishop Knowles:\n\nThe department is in receipt of a report dated October 27, 1945, sent forward by Inspector Ostrander immediately following an investigation by him of conditions at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is my understanding that conditions at this institution were discussed by Mr. Ostrander with the members of the committee responsible for the selection of the principal and the employment of the school staff.\n\nIt is hardly necessary to state that I have found the subject matter of Mr. Ostrander's report very disturbing. It would be to me and I feel sure it would be to Your Grace very unfortunate if conditions at this particular school became a subject of public discussion, but I am disposed to think in view of the representations that have been made to me on behalf of the pupils in attendance that such a discussion is likely to take place unless we can have an assurance from you and from the members of the committee that this school will be placed immediately in charge of thoroughly qualified and competent officials.\n\nIt has occurred to me in view of all the circumstances that it might be advisable to have a thorough educational survey undertaken of the reserve or reserves on which pupils for this school are recruited. As a number of Indian parents seem reluctant to send their children to residential schools, would it be possible to come to an agreement whereby a certain number of the pupils living in close proximity to the school would attend as day pupils? In any event, I feel confident the Minister will want an assurance from me that conditions\n\n.....have been\nhave been investigated, not only by the Inspector of Indian Agencies, Mr. Ostrander, but also by an educationist qualified to make recommendations with respect to the educational needs of the Indian pupils. Such a survey might well be undertaken by the public school inspector for the district. I am sending forward a copy of this letter to Mr. Ostrander and asking him to discuss the matter with you again. After this discussion takes place, I shall be glad to have from you any comments or recommendations you may care to send forward.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRight Reverend E. H. Knowles, LL.D., D.D.,\nBishop of Qu'Appelle,\nSynod Office,\nREGINA, Saskatchewan.\nOttawa, 7th November, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nAttached is account amounting to $269.73 covering cost of emergency repairs at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. Inspector Ostrander visited this school early in September and reported as follows:\n\n\"I found that both Lister engines at the school are in very bad condition. One is completely out of working order while awaiting some small repairs. The other is working but there is a decided knock in it. This engine may be out of condition at almost any moment. Mr. Montgomery is recommended to us as a Lister engine expert and I am informed that he will be able to do all the necessary work to put both engines in good repair after he has found exactly what is wrong.\"\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would issue a Purchase Order so the account may be paid.

Oct. 1, 1945.\n\nDate: September 25th to 29th, 1945.\n\nEngines were found to be in very poor mechanical working condition, as the cylinder blocks showed water had been present in combustion area of cylinder heads. The valve seats and valves had been badly burned, also quite an area of the blocks in and around the valves had been burned, and there were small cracks showing.\n\nAs new cylinder blocks were not available it was necessary to cut valve seats to a maximum, and only a temporary repair can be expected.\n\nThe above condition applies to two of the cylinders, with one cylinder only slightly burned. Believe this condition due to engines running at an excessive heat causing head gaskets to leak.\n\nThe single cylinder engine crankshaft bearing surfaces were found scored and shaft out of round; one bearing housing was badly cut away, believed caused by bearing failure at some time allowing the crankshaft to rest on housing casting cutting away oil return, causing oil loss at this point. This condition is still present.\n\nOne automatic valve release coil requires shop repairs, and same was brought in to Winnipeg to have the work done.\n\nOther repairs made were complete overhaul of both magnetos, fuel pumps and oil pumps.\n\nWe recommend the following parts be ordered at once for these units, so that at a later date they could be installed:\n\n3 - Cylinder Blocks complete\n3 - Cylinder Heads\n3 - Pistons with pins and rings\n1 - Crankshaft for single cylinder engine\n6 - Valve Tappets and Tappet Guides\nNecessary Bearings and Gaskets\n\nMUMFORD MEDLAND LIMITED\nN.

C. Davis Company, of Winnipeg, offer to supply in 30 days \"Heal\" steel cabinet radiators at $148.59 net, f. o. b. Punnichy, Sask. If you consider these would be suitable, we can place the order for the number that are needed. If you do not favour this type of radiator, please endeavour to purchase, locally, the radiators that are needed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nThere are a number of elements and covers at the Gordon Indian Residential School for which the Globalite Batteries Limited of Winnipeg, Man has offered 50\u00a2 per jar.\n\nI was wondering if the Department would care to have me ship these and get a credit slip to apply on new batteries when required, or would it be necessary to obtain a salvage order to dispose of them.\n\nIn any case we might as well dispose of them as they are not in use.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, November 20th, 1945.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT.\n\nAttention: Mr. Vincent.\n\nEnclosed please find a copy of a letter received from Indian Agent R.S. Davis.\n\nFifty-six batteries from the Muscowequan School were transferred to the Gordon's School. You will recall that the Muscowequan School is served by the Saskatchewan Power Commission, hence, the batteries were surplus.\n\nApparently, the Indian Agent refers to the old batteries which were replaced by the batteries from the Muscowequan School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nEnclosure:\nAgents for \"C A C T I Z O N A\" Boiler and Domestic Water Treatment\n\nSASKATOON, SASK.

Davis at Touchwood Agency\nand recorded in the Official Cash Book. Folio 10.\n\nAmount $41.10\n\nAgency Receipt No. 47997 dated March 15th, 1946,\nPayer on account of unexpended balance for\nwell Gordon's School - 121-76-10-998. (Cheque 33868).\n\nFor Treasury Branch.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI am enclosing herewith voucher for the amount of $2692.49 in favour of M. McNeil, Plumbing and Heating, Saskatoon, for overhauling the heating and water and sewage at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe cost of this work was far in excess of the estimate because the plumbers found that nearly everything had to be replaced. The account for materials alone amounted to $1040.30 plus freight and carriage.\n\nWith regard to the time of the plumbers in this work there was so much trouble with the water system while the plumbers were at work and the weather was so extremely cold that a great deal of their time was taken in thawing out pipes and trying to keep from damaging the school equipment, the heating plant of which had completely broken down. When the plumbers started work it was necessary to continue, to avoid suffering by the children and school staff as much as possible. During some of the time there was an inexperienced engineer on the school staff who was of little assistance to the plumbers. This also caused some confusion and loss of time.\n\nI am enclosing a letter addressed to me from Mr. McNeil in explanation of the unexpected large expenditure and making an estimate of another $170.00 which will need to be spent as soon as the weather is warm enough and the ground is thawed. Also enclosed is a letter addressed to Indian Agent R.S. Davis by Mr. McNeil in which he makes an estimate of approximately $700.00 of the labour cost in the enclosed voucher as being not directly connected with the work for which he was originally engaged. This refers particularly to time spent thawing pipes and performing other temporary plumbing work in his endeavour to keep the building habitable, during some very cold weather.\n\nI regret the delay in forwarding this account. Some time elapsed from the time most of the work was completed until Mr. McNeil was able to visit the school and make a personal examination of the work. The completed accounts reached me only today after much unnecessary delay by all of those concerned.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nMar. 30th, 1946\n\nMr. Davis,\nDept of Indian Affairs,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon Indian Res. School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nEnclosed please find our account in regard to our work done to-date at the above school.\n\nAs regards the labor account, it was impossible to keep a separate time sheet on work done in other matters at the school that was not part of this job; however, we would estimate the labor costs on this work to be approximately $700.00.\n\nYours truly,\n\nM. McNeil Plumbing & Heating.\nMar. 30th, 1946\n\nMr. Ostrander,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon Res. Indian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nEnclosed please find invoices in regard to work completed at the above.\n\nWe would state that when we first checked this job in January we believed that all that would be necessary would be to increase return mains where necessary and replace some parts of defective return mains, install any necessary defective ballasts in rad traps, install condensation pump, make necessary repairs to closets and clear toilets, install gate valves in each one of the four steam main circuits where they leave the trunk main.\n\nHowever, the first obstacle we ran into on the plumbing was that there wasn't a valve that would shut off the water and had to resort to shutting off the water at the main valve and take time to repair all the other valves. Then, the closet tanks proved to be in terrible condition, needing considerable repair work.\n\nOn working on the heating we found that the mains had actually rotted away in most cases and had to be practically renewed entirely with the exception of a two-inch main through the kitchen which had already been renewed.\n\nAt this time the water supply failed and as the engineer could not repair same or determine what was wrong we had to do what we could with it to enable us to continue with our work. After checking the pump and the pipe in the cistern we found that the underground pipe was defective and as we could not then renew this pipe because of frost etc. we installed an overhead line for a temporary hook up which took considerable attention owing to weather conditions etc. This underground line will have to be replaced when the frost is out of the ground and we would recommend that it be replaced with cast iron pipe with universal joints. We continued to have considerable trouble with the water supply as the engineer was unable to get any more than fifteen inches of water in his tanks although he made several trips every day to pump the water. We attempted to clear the line with our steel tape to no avail and considerable time was\nlost at this work.\n\nThe work on the heating is not quite completed as the ballasts in some of the rad traps have not been checked, and the boiler needs washing out in the proper manner.\n\nOne closet bowl has to be installed and one closet must be repaired, and three more floor grates are necessary. This necessary work will cost approximately $170.00. This will place both plumbing and heating in first class working order with the exception of the filter between the tank and supply pipes. This filter needs re-charging and we understand that this is already being arranged for by the engineer.\n\nWe remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nM.

Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies,\n414 Federal Building, Regina, Saskatchewan.\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of April 14, enclosing account of Mr. McNeil with regard to work done by his firm at the Gordon's School.\n\nI have discussed this letter on two occasions with the Director, and it is difficult for us to understand why such a heavy expenditure was incurred without complete authority. The total account is $2,692.49 and such expenditure can only be authorized by the Minister. It will be extremely difficult to have this account passed, as the Minister should have been consulted before the expenditure was incurred.\n\nThe explanation given by Mr. McNeil is reasonably complete, but in your letter I cannot find any reference to your having been consulted or that the Indian Agent was consulted.\n\nI also note on the voucher, which is signed by Reverend Mr. Parry and Indian Agent Davis, that they quote letters of October 19 and November 19 as authority for the expenditure. While, no doubt, you have these letters on your file, I attach copies of them and would point out that in my letter of October 19 an expenditure of $300.00 was authorized. This was the amount requested in your letter of October 18. In my letter of November 19 no expenditure was authorized; but you were simply supplied with information received from the Purchasing Branch in connection with securing radiators.\n\nThe account includes materials amounting to over $1,100.00. You are fully aware of the purchasing regulations\n\n........... and\nand, certainly, before any such expenditure was incurred, requisition should have been forwarded and authority received.\n\nThe account is therefore being returned, in order that the Principal, Mr. Davis and yourself may explain fully why such a large expenditure was incurred without authority from this office.\n\nBefore re-submitting the account, the voucher should be changed and should show distinctly that only $300.00 expenditure was authorized in official letter of October 19.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nSASKATOON, SASK., Mar. 30th, 1946\n\nM.

As stated in my letter of the 14th instant Mr. McNeil was asked to keep a record of the time which was put in on work which should have actually been the work of the school engineer and which was not directly connected with the repairing and replacements for which he was hired. He did not keep a record of this but made an estimate of $700.00 as the approximate amount. A third of the pairs proceeded one part after another was found to be in very bad shape needing immediate replacement. It will be noticed in Mr. McNeil's account that he sent many telephone messages in connection with additions to the original order for material. These were all emergency requirements found necessary as the work progressed and there was no point during the course of the work where a correct estimate could have been made to find out exactly what the expenditure had been up to that point or what would be needed for the future. I was therefore placed in the awkward position of having to tell them to continue until the immediately urgent work was completed and the school could be heated sufficiently to prevent further damage.\n\nI realize that this was a very large account to submit with only a part of it authorized but I would like to assure the Department that Mr. Davis and I were in continual touch with the work and while neither of us was anxious to see the cost mounting as it did we were in the position that if we had stopped the work at any point much more damage might have resulted for which we might have been blamed, both damage to the school building and equipment and danger to the lives of those living in the building.\n\nMy letter of October 16th asking authority for the expenditure of $300.00, and which was authorized in your letter of October 19th, referred to the need for overhauling the heating and sewage system in a few places. On this authority efforts were made for months to try to locate a plumber who would go to the school and eventually Mr. McNeil, of Saskatoon, made the trip to the school in January. His examination proved that there was much more repair needed than had been originally estimated and Mr. Davis' telegram of the 28th of January, and the Department's reply of the 29th, resulted from Mr. McNeil's estimate of that time.\n\nIt was impossible to submit a requisition for the purchase of the material required for this work as no one had any idea of what would be required until the work was well underway and then one.......\nwork was well underway and then one breakage after another needed immediate replacement to keep the system working to prevent freezing and damage in other places, and while the purchasing regulations permitted me to spend in emergency work only up to $300.00 I am sure that reference to the invoice will indicate that the majority of the material purchased was purchased as found necessary and could not have been requisitioned and purchased in the usual manner through the Purchasing Agent. I considered that this was in order in view of the last sentence of the Department's telegram dated the 29th of January addressed to Mr. Davis.\n\nI have discussed this today with Mr. Davis and he has read this report and agrees with it in substance. If any further information is required from Mr. Davis I am sure he would be pleased to furnish it.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Statements and receipted accounts which were attached to the voucher have been kept on our file.\n\nIn a letter dated October 16, 1945, Inspector Ostrander recommended an expenditure of $300.00 for labour in connection with the heating plant and the sewage system at the Gordons School. This amount was authorized by official letter of October 19, 1945.\n\nOn January 28, 1946, we received a telegram from Indian Agent Davis. A copy of this is attached with a copy of our reply.\n\nI also enclose a copy of Mr. Ostrander's letter of April 14, 1946, which was forwarded with the attached account.\n\nIn view of the excess expenditure over the amount authorized, we wrote to Mr. Ostrander on May 3 and requested him to supply more information. A copy of his reply dated May 6, 1946, is attached.\n\nThe Gordons Residential School is located near Punnichy, Saskatchewan, in the Touchwood Indian Agency. It is operated under the auspices of the Church of England but does not come under the jurisdiction of the Missionary Society of the Church of England in Canada.

McNeil, Plumbing and Heating Saskatoon, for overhauling the heating and water and sewage at the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe cost of this work was far in excess of the estimate because the plumbers found that nearly everything had to be replaced. The account for materials alone amounted to $1040.30 plus freight and cartage.\n\nWith regard to the time of the plumbers in this work there was so much trouble with the water system while the plumbers were at work and the weather was so extremely cold that a great deal of their time was taken in thawing out pipes and trying to keep from damaging the school equipment, the heating plant of which had completely broken down. When the plumbers started work it was necessary to continue, to avoid suffering by the children and school staff as much as possible. During some of the time there was an inexperienced engineer on the school staff who was of little assistance to the plumbers. This also caused some confusion and loss of time.\n\nI am enclosing a letter addressed to me from Mr. McNeil in explanation of the unexpected large expenditure and making an estimate of another $170.00 which will need to be spent as soon as the weather is warm enough and the ground is thawed. Also enclosed is a letter addressed to Indian Agent R.S. Davis by Mr. McNeil in which he makes an estimate of approximately $700.00 of the labour cost in the enclosed voucher as being not directly connected with the work for which he was originally engaged. This refers particularly to time spent thawing pipes and performing other temporary plumbing work in his endeavour to keep the building habitable, during some very cold weather.\n\nI regret the delay in forwarding this account. Some time elapsed from the time most of the work was completed until Mr. McNeil was able to visit the school and make a personal examination of the work. The completed accounts reached me only today after much unnecessary delay by all of those concerned.\n\n(Sgd) J.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nMarch 30th, 1946.\n\nMr. Ostrander,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon Res. Indian School, Punnichy, Sask.,\n\nEnclosed please find invoices in regard to work completed at the above.\n\nWe would state that when we first checked this job in January we believed that all that would be necessary would be to increase return mains where necessary and replace some parts of defective return mains, install any necessary defective ballasts in rad traps, install condensation pump, make necessary repairs to closets and clear toilets, install gate valves in each one of the four steam main circuits where they leave the trunk main.\n\nHowever, the first obstacle we ran into on the plumbing was that there wasn't a valve that would shut off the water and had to resort to shutting off the water at the main valve and take time to repair all the other valves. Then, the closet tanks proved to be in terrible condition, needing considerable repair work.\n\nOn working on the heating we found that the mains had actually wrotted away in most cases and had to be practically renewed entirely with the exception of a two-inch main through the kitchen which had already been renewed.\n\nAt this time the water supply failed and as the engineer could not repair same or determine what was wrong we had to do what we could with it to enable us to continue with our work. After checking the pump and the pipe in the cistern we found that the underground pipe was defective and as we could not then renew this pipe because of the frost etc., we installed an overhead line for a temporary hook up which took considerable attention owing to weather conditions etc. This underground line will have to be replaced when the frost is out of the\n\n(Over)\nground and we would recommend that it be replaced with cast iron pipe with universal joints. We continued to have considerable trouble with the water supply as the engineer was unable to get any more than fifteen inches of water in his tanks although he made several trips every day to pump the water. We attempted to clear the line with our steel tape to no avail and considerable time was lost at this work.\n\nThe work on the heating is not quite completed as the ballasts in some of the rad traps have not been checked and the boiler needs washing out in the proper manner.\n\nOne closet bowl has to be installed and one closet must be replaced and three more floor grates are necessary. This necessary work will cost approximately $170.00. This will place both plumbing and heating in first class working order with the exception of the filter between the tank and supply pipes. This filter needs re-charging and we understand that this is already being arranged for by the engineer.\n\nWe remain,\n\nRespectfully yours,\n\nM. McNeil,\nPlumbing and Heating.\n\nEncl:\nInvoices.\nMarch 30, 1946.\n\nMr. Davis,\nDept' of Indian Affairs,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRe: Gordon Indian Res. School, Punnichy, Sask.,\n\nEnclosed please find our account in regard to our work done to-date at the above school.\n\nAs regards the labor account, it was impossible to keep a separate time sheet on work done in other matters at the school that was not part of this job; however, we would estimate the labor costs on this work to be approximately $700.00\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd) M. McNeil,\nPlumbing and Heating.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to Department letter of the 3rd instant, No. 121-1-5, in connection with the account of Mr. McNeill, Plumbing and Heating, 305-3rd Avenue South, Saskatoon, which I am returning herewith for reconsideration, I failed to mention in my letter that Mr. Davis had received authority by telegram dated January 28th, which read as follows:\n\n\"APPROVE EXPENDITURE NOT EXCEEDING ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR MATERIAL AND LABOUR REPAIRING HEATING SYSTEM GORDON'S RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL PROVIDED INSPECTOR OSTRANDER AGREES THAT THIS EXPENDITURE IS WARRANTED STOP MR OSTRANDER CAN PURCHASE MATERIALS REQUIRED\"\n\nFollowing receipt of this telegram Mr. Davis discussed the matter with me and it was decided to proceed as we had waited from the previous October while trying to find a plumber to do the work and in the meantime the heating plant and sewage at the Gordon's School had become in such bad shape that the whole matter was very urgent.\n\nIt was realized, of course, that the cost of labour was gradually mounting but one repair led to another and all were so urgent because of the cold weather and the suffering of the pupils and staff that there could be no delay in completing the work at least to the point of immediate necessity for comfort and sanitation. As stated in my letter of the 14th instant Mr. McNeill had agreed to keep a record of the time which was put in on work which he had actually been doing the work of the school engineer and which was not directly connected with the repairing and replacements for which he had hired him did not keep a record of this but made an estimate of $700.00 as an approximate amount. As the work of repairs proceeded one part after another was found to be in very bad shape needing immediate replacement. It will be noticed in Mr. McNeill's account that he sent many telephone messages in connection with additions to the original order for material. These were all emergency requirements found necessary as the work progressed and there was no point during the course of the work where a correct estimate could have been made to find out exactly what the expenditure had been up to that point or what would be needed for the future. I was therefore placed in the awkward position of having to tell them to continue until the immediately urgent work was completed and the school could be heated sufficiently to prevent further damage.\n\nI realize that this was a very large amount to submit with only a part of it authorized but I would like to assure the Department that Mr. Davis and I were in continual touch with the work and while neither of us was anxious to see the cost mounting as it did we were in the position that if we had stopped the work at any point much more damage might have resulted for which we might have been blamed, both damage to the school building and equipment and danger to the lives of those living in the building.\n\nMy letter of October 16th asking authority for the expenditure of $300.00, and which was authorized in your letter of October 19th, referred to the need for overhauling the heating and sewage systems in a few places. On this authority efforts were made for months to try to locate a plumber who would go to the school and eventually Mr. McNeill, of Saskatoon, made the trip to the school in January. His examination proved that there was much more repair needed than had been originally estimated in Mr. Davis' telegram of the 28th of January, and the Department's reply of the 28th, resulted from Mr. McNeill's estimate of that time.\n\nIt was impossible to submit a requisition for the purchase of the material required for this work as no one had any idea of what would be required until the work was well underway and then one...\nwork was well underway and thus one breakage after another needed immediate replacement to keep the system working to prevent freezing and damage in other places; and while the purchasing regulations permitted me to spend in emergency work only up to $200.00 I am sure that reference to the invoice will indicate that the majority of the material purchased was purchased as found necessary and could not have been requisitioned and purchased in the usual manner through the Purchasing Agent. I considered that this was in order in view of the last sentence of the Department's telegram dated the 25th of January addressed to Mr. Davis.\n\nI have discussed this today with Mr. Davis and he has read this report and agrees with it in substance. If any further information is required from Mr. Davis I am sure he would be pleased to furnish it.\n\nJ.F.B.

Havers,\nAgency Clerk.\nPunnichy, Sask., April 4, 1946.\n\nMARCH QUARTER REPORT ON TOUCHWOOD AGENCY.\n\nGORDON SCHOOL\n\nThis school, as you are quite aware, is quite a headache. The whole matter was taken up with you in a separate report some time ago, so I feel it is no use again explaining the matter here. I still get a lot of complaints from the Indians about this school, some of them have advised me that until there is a change they will not let their children go back next year.\n\nThe plumbers have been working at the school much longer than they should have been as a lot of the time they were doing work which should have been done by the school engineer.\n\nWe struck water about three hundred yards from the school. The well digger advises me there is 4 feet of water in it. The well is 56 ft. deep, and there is a good stream flowing into the well and doesn't think it could be pumped dry with a 1\u00bd\" pipe. The water is good and should overcome any problems for drinking water at this school.\n\nI have asked the Principal to put a pail and rope on it and use the water for drinking purposes, but at the time of writing they have not taken a pail of water out.\n\nThe children are still drinking water out of the taps from water from the lake, and they get water from a spring for the staff. I am getting a pump and jack from Mr. Simpson, File Hills Agency, and have an engine, and as soon as this arrives I will put it in the well and pump the well out and see what flow we have. I will also have the water tested.\n\nThe lighting plant engines will all have to be rebuilt this summer. However, before we do this, I believe we should take the matter up with the Saskatchewan Power Commission to see what it would cost to run the power line to the school, a distance of eight miles. If the cost of this would not be too much, I believe it would be the solution to all our lighting problems out there.\n\nR. S.

Attached in duplicate is a letter from Mr. Gow dated May 29th with copy of enclosed report by Mr. Lyon of same date.\n\nYou will observe that the water situation at this school has now reached the point where immediate action is necessary so that sufficient water can be secured from other sources than the present lake before next winter.\n\nAttention is called to Mr. Lyon's remarks under shallow wells. From the information furnished it would seem that Indian Affairs Branch should instruct their agent to immediately arrange for cleaning out and drilling deeper the well which he had put down, 1000 feet northwest of the school. If this well gives a regular supply of water, another shallow well in the same general area should also be drilled by the agent. The work of well drilling seems urgent and should be expedited as much as possible.\n\nThe survey of the general surface water situation including the proposal to obtain water from Fort Lake should be undertaken as soon as the party for this work can be organized. You will observe Mr. Gow's remarks regarding the request to his head office for the engagement of two University Students for the summer months, and that if same is authorized, he will detail an engineer and assistant for the survey. This survey should be undertaken as soon as possible and we are advising Mr. Gow accordingly.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nWe are enclosing herewith a memorandum by Mr. G. M. Lyon of this staff relating to the water supply situation at the above mentioned institution. This memorandum was prepared following an inspection of the conditions and in accordance with the data requested in your letter of April 26th last.\n\nIt would appear from Mr. Lyon's memorandum that the water supply situation at this institution has now become rather serious and unless some solution is arrived at shortly, the conditions next winter will be critical. It does not appear as if water supply from Fort Lakes would be a permanent solution of an adequate water supply; and as pointed out in the final paragraph of Mr. Lyon's memorandum, some alternative scheme should be considered and information gathered for estimating the cost of such schemes. It would seem desirable to carry out Mr. Lyon's suggestion that a shallow well be developed and pumped to the school in order to supply a source of drinking water for all members of the institution and that a new pipe line be laid out into Gordon's Lake in order to supply a water supply for other purposes at the institution. Data that should be acquired, according to Mr. Lyon's memorandum, relate to the improvement of the water supply at Gordon's Lake by cleaning out some of the natural water courses leading into it.\n\nIt is desirable that the survey work, as covered by Mr. Lyon's estimate, be proceeded with in any event and that the investigation should include data upon which estimates can be made covering the laying of a new line into Gordon's Lake and improving the water courses leading into this lake. We have asked our Ottawa Office to authorize the engagement of two University students for the summer months, and should our request be acceded to, we will be able to detail an engineer and an assistant to this work.\n\n(Sgd.)

Mills, Esq.,\nChief Engineer,\nEngineering and Construction Service,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. D. B. Gow\n\nRe: Water Supply System, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Saskatchewan.\n\nAn inspection was made by the writer at the above school on May 17th.\n\nPresent Condition of Water Supply:\n\nThe water level in the water supply lake at the school was 89.0 on May 17th, compared to a water level of 90.2 on June 20, 1945 - a drop of 1.2 feet. It is likely that it was still lower during the past winter but no definite information in this regard could be obtained.\n\nLast fall, alterations to the intake system into the well were carried out according to information received from the Indian Agent, Mr. Davis. Holes were drilled through the concrete at elevation 84.7, 12 inches below the bottom row but no flow of water was encountered, indicating that the gravel did not extend to this depth as shown on the plan. Then the 6\" pipe intake, which was laid near the bottom of the filter gallery at elev. 85.3, was broken by a charge of dynamite. This resulted in a considerably increased flow of water into the well for sometime.\n\nHowever, during the late winter the inflow into the well decreased considerably and great difficulty was experienced in obtaining sufficient water for school requirements. Mr. Davis said this was due to the school authorities leaving the well without sufficient protection from frost. He had new winter covers made to protect it against frost but some of them were never put in place. The well and the intake system eventually failed due either to frost or plugging up with silt and the school was without water, apparently for about three days. Another intake was laid directly into the lake and the pump moved down to the end of the crib, both entirely open to the weather and consequently had to be drained after every pumping operation. This system successfully operated for the balance of the winter and is still operating, but it is obvious that unless measures are taken to materially raise the lake level before next winter, the well intake will not operate without freezing up and the present uncovered line will not be satisfactory.\n\nThe writer endeavoured to have the concrete well pumped out at the time of inspection but the only pump available for this was a hand-operated sludge pump which was inadequate to dewater the well. The water was lowered a foot, however, and returned to lake level in one half hour so that the intake system cannot be plugged up and must have only been frozen last winter.\n\nAccording to Mr. Davis, only the school staff has been obtaining drinking water from the spring 1\u00bd miles to the south of the school, but the Principal states that the Indian children were also obtaining water from this source.\n\nFuture Prospects of Present Supply:\n\nThe present water supply will fail completely next winter unless remedial measures are taken. The water level in the lake has receded to elev. 89.0 and will probably be 88.0 by next fall, at which level the concrete well and intake system will be useless in cold weather.\n\n--See Next Page.\nAlternative Supplies:\n\n1. Shallow Wells:\n\nDuring the past winter, Mr. Davis caused two shallow wells, 24 inches in diameter, to be drilled in the vicinity of the school. One in the playground behind the school was put down about 140 feet through clay and encountered no water. The other, about 1,000 feet northwest of the school, encountered water in gravel at 43 feet and was drilled to 65 feet. Subsequently, a boulder fell in and blocked the hole at about 46 feet depth and the 24 inch casing only goes to that depth. On May 17th, there was about 3 feet of water in the hole but the inflow was not sufficient under pumping to furnish even a drinking water supply. The well driller stated, however, that before the hole was blocked by the boulder, he could not bail the well dry with his bailing bucket of about 8 gallon capacity, bailing at the rate of about one bucket in 1\u00bd minutes. I would suggest that this well be cleaned out and drilled to a greater depth in the gravel, if possible, with an 18 inch auger. A perforated pipe or screen should be sunk as a casing for the portion of the hole in the gravel. It seems probable that this well will give a sufficient supply of water for drinking at least. If this well gives a regular supply of water, it is possible that other shallow wells could be drilled and water located which would be sufficient to supply the school's requirements from sources in the vicinity.\n\n2. Fort Lake:\n\nMr. Dempster's report on replenishing Gordon Lake with water from Fort Lake, which report was prepared in 1928, is self-explanatory but conditions have changed. The writer, accompanied by the Fera Instructor from the school, visited this lake on May 17th, and found not one but two lakes, separated by a height of land about 8 feet above the present water level in the north portion of Fort Lake. This height of land is located where the cutoff, shown as dotted lines, appears on the sketch plan of November, 1937. Whether this cutoff was above water level in 1937 is not clear from the plan but in any case the two lakes, formerly known as Fort Lake, are now about two-thirds their former size - the larger third being the north lake. The sloughs between Fort Lake and Gordon Lake are now all dry land, except slough \"A\". The old creek bed, connecting this pair of sloughs, is now four to eight feet above the bottom of these dry sloughs so that no runoff is reaching Gordon Lake from its former drainage area further east than slough \"G\". The Fera Instructor, who is a native of the reserve, told me that this creek ran full every spring in the early 1920's but has not done so for many years.\n\nThe estimated cost of making a survey between Fort Lake and the school, taking soundings and etc., is as follows:\n\n| Description                                      | Cost   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Clearing lines (possibly two) - preliminary traverse and location line, 20 man-days @ $3.00 | $60.00 |\n| Transit survey, assistant - 4 days @ $5.00       | 20.00  |\n| Level survey, assistant - 7 days @ $5.00         | 35.00  |\n| Soundings (Fort Lakes and Gordon Lake) - 3 days @ $5.00 | 15.00  |\n| Rental and transportation for boat               | 25.00  |\n| Maintenance - Departmental Engineer - 14 days @ $3.50 | 49.00  |\n\nTOTAL...........................................$204.00\n\nThe country to be traversed is all well treed with thick undergrowth except for the sloughs which are open. In midsummer the\nfoliage is much heavier than in the autumn or spring so that more cutting will have to be done to get a line through. Apparently the engineer will have no skilled assistance whatever so that the surveying itself will be very slow. The above estimate is liberal for these reasons.\n\n3. Shallow Well and Gordon Lake:\n\nOne shallow well should be developed and pumped to the school through an underground pipe line. This would involve the continued use of Gordon Lake for a general water supply with a new intake pipe into the lake without filtration. In connection with this scheme, it is probable that the drainage into Gordon Lake from the surrounding country would have to be improved by deepening the old creek channels and possibly ditching across some of the sloughs. There might also be required a dugout at some future date to concentrate the water resources in a small area, if the water level in Gordon Lake continued to recede.\n\nAs there may not be sufficient water remaining in the two Fort Lakes to make the pipe line a desirable solution to the water supply problem, I would suggest that alternative schemes should be considered and information gathered for estimating purposes at this time.\n\n(Sgd.) G.M. Lyon.\nMemorandum:\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nReferring to your notation on a copy of a memorandum from Indian Affairs dated April 26th, we informed Mr. Gow of the necessity for an inspection at the Gordon's School and forwarded him what information was available regarding a proposed scheme to obtain additional water from Fort Lake and we are now in receipt of the following reply:\n\n\"We have for attention your letter of April 26th with enclosures with further reference to the water supply at the Gordon's Indian Residential School near Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\n\"Late in September last, Mr. Davis, Indian Agent at Punnichy, called at our office and was loaned the plans showing details of the present intake and temporary measures for improving the water supply were outlined to him. Mr. Davis agreed to have these measures carried out and we now have your confirmation that the water supply had improved as a result. However, such improvement will probably be only temporary.\n\n\"Mr. G. M. Lyon of this staff is leaving Monday, May 13th, to visit our hydrometric stations in the Assiniboine and Qu'Appelle River Valleys and will visit the Gordon's Indian Residential School. Mr. Lyon has visited the school previously and last year prepared a report outlining a scheme for development of an adequate source of water at the present site. This report was forwarded you under date of August 4th last. Mr. Lyon will check on the present elevation of the pond at the school and the present water supply situation. He will also check on Fort Lake and insofar as possible, by observation, will note the possibilities of utilizing water from this lake to augment the present source of supply.\n\n\"A preliminary study of the proposals to pump water from Fort Lake to the Gordon's Indian Residential School tends to show that a 5\" pipe line will be necessary; that the initial cost will be at least $18,500., that the annual operation costs will be $2,000. and that depletion of Fort Lake will eventually occur.\n\n\"Mr. Lyon will also arrange to visit the Lebret Indian Residential School and note the condition of the sewage disposal bed at that place. Upon his return to the office, after his 10-day or 2-weeks trip, Mr. Lyon will prepare a memorandum outlining his observations and a copy of the same, together with recommendations will be forwarded you.\"\n\nWe are prepared to agree with Mr. Gow that the original estimate of $10,000.00 to install an auxiliary line from Fort Lake might have to be considerably increased if the work is done under present conditions. The possibility of eventual depletion of the water in Fort Lake must be considered and that is a matter needing investigation.\n\nYou will be advised when a report of the contemplated inspection is available.\n\nJ.

While we have no figures on the cost of the well already drilled 58 feet, it is thought the cost of a well 70 feet deep, might be in the order of $400.00.\nIf these two wells prove to be able to supply a fair quantity of water after they have been in use a few months, the question of pumps and a pipeline to the school can be taken up.\n\nJ.M.

The work is very heavy on account of stones.\n\nThe men are down 17 feet, the hole being 4 ft by 4 ft. We have 3 ft of water which is coming in fairly fast. I am hoping, if we can get the well down around 30 ft, and it continues to come in as it is at present, we will have a good supply.\n\nAt the present time I have a balance on hand of $200.00 from the $400.00 forwarded by the Department this month.\n\nI estimate the balance of cost on the present well will be around $500.00. Therefore I hope to be under the present authority granted in your night letter telegram on the 19th inst.\n\nR.S.

The water comes in at the rate of 3 ft an hour.\n\nThe well is 4 ft by 4 ft and there is 10 ft of water in it.\n\nIn my opinion there is enough water to keep the school going if an electric automatic pump is installed so that all the water will not be drained out of the well at one time. This would mean running electric wires from the school to the well, a distance of 800 ft.\n\nThe new well is 250 ft from the present water line from the school to the lake, therefore it will be necessary to dig a ditch from this line over to the well, and put in new pipes.\n\nIf an electric pump is installed in the well and the well covered for the winter with insulation, it will not be necessary to build a pumphouse.\n\nWhen Mr. Lyons from the District Engineer's Office, Dept.

M. Lyon, our engineer, with respect to the situation that prevailed at the time of his departure from the site on July 17th.\n\nUnder date of July 26th, Mr. R. S. Davis, the Indian Agent, reports as follows:\n\n\"The well near the lake we started while Mr. Lyon was at the school is now down about 16 feet. It has 5 feet of water, which seems to be coming in fast.\n\nI have put in a wooden pump to keep the water out, but have had trouble with pump which delayed us a little.\n\nThe formation in the well is changing from straight stone and gravel to stone, clay and gravel. Prospects of a supply of water looks promising.\"\n\nYou will note from Mr. Davis's latest report that he considers prospects of a supply of water to be promising. However, the inflow into the well may not be sufficient to provide an adequate supply for all needs of the school, but we must await further reports as to the definite nature of the results of the well drilling.\n\nI also wish to draw your attention to the statement of Mr. Lyon that Indian Agent Davis will require additional funds in order to complete this well, which he is supervising at our request. An additional advance of $150.00 at least will be required by him. I might also point out that if the supply of water in this well is found to be adequate that an additional $1000.00 will be required to connect the well with the school. You will be advised further with respect to this matter.\"\n\nDuplicate copies of the report of Mr. Lyon of July 26th accompanied by copies of his sketch of the area in the vicinity of the school are also attached herewith.\n\nIt seems that a satisfactory water supply might be obtained from Hole No. 4.\n\nChief Engineer,\n\nJ.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-5, part II)\nMemorandum -\nTo Mr. D. B. Cowe\n\nRe: Water Supply for Gordon's Indian Residential Schools.\n\nDuring the period July 1st to 17th, 1946, the writer examined the area around Gordon's School with a view of finding a supply of water to replace the existing supply which filters through a gravel-filled gallery from the water supply lake into a concrete reservoir. This supply failed last winter when the gravel froze to the bottom due to the low water levels prevailing at that time.\n\nVarious possibilities have been mentioned in the past for supplementary or alternative supplies, but none have been developed.\n\nTwo shallow wells drilled last winter under the direction of Mr. R. S. Davis, the Indian Agent, are shown on the plan.\n\nHole #1 at elevation 119.8 was drilled 140 feet deep 120 feet west of the school. The drilling was all in clay and no water was found.\n\nHole #2 at elevation 91.5, 700 feet northwest of the school was drilled to a depth of 68 feet. Four feet of water-bearing gravel was obtained in this hole from 48 - 52 feet. This hole was cleaned out to a depth of 50 feet and the inflow tested during the writer's presence. After standing overnight there was only 1/3 foot of water in the well. This was lowered to 2 feet after bailing out about 20 gallons in half an hour, indicating a low rate of inflow. While this well could supply some drinking water for the school, it is not likely that there would be enough water to supply the whole demand for that purpose.\n\nThe writer took soundings in the larger of the two Fort Lakes, the sounding party working from a raft which was located by angle and stadia distance from the shore. A sketch showing the Fort Lakes soundings is attached to this memorandum. The maximum depth of water was found to be 3.6 feet, but the average depth over the area of about 50 acres was only about 2.5 feet, a supply which I considered insufficient to justify any large expenditure of money. No survey was made between Fort Lake and the school.\n\nWATER SUPPLY LAKE.\n\nSoundings were taken in the water supply lake near the school and it was found that the greater part of this lake was about 6 feet with a maximum depth of 9 feet. This is\nshown by contours on the accompanying map. As this is the only lake with an appreciable depth of water remaining in the area around the school I was inclined to the belief that there must be a groundwater supply feeding it. Outcrops of gravel and small boulders were noticed on the lake shore in two places, one on the north side and the other on the south side, the latter being only 200 feet from the recently used intake gallery and well. This gravel outcrop was tested with a 4-inch auger to a depth of 2 feet at the lake shore and to 4 feet 75 feet from the lake, it being impracticable to test any lower because of water in one case and stones in the second.\n\nAs Indian Agent Davis had some money available it was decided to test cut this area with a well-drilling outfit, using a 24-inch auger. Hole No. 5 was started 200 feet back from the lake at elevation 112.8 (22.6 feet above lake level). The log of the hole is as follows:\n\n- 0 - 14 feet = Yellow clay.\n- 14-22 feet = Water-bearing sand containing some clay.\n- 22-39 feet = Grey-blue clay with occasional seams of sand.\n\nI estimated the inflow of water into this hole as being about 200 gallons per day, which would be sufficient for purely drinking purposes, but little else. We were endeavoring to deepen the hole in the hope of striking the gravel, but the sand caved in and no further drilling could be done without cribbing so the hole was abandoned, temporarily at least, and the drill was moved down closer to the lake.\n\nHole No. 4 was started at elevation 102.1 (18.6 feet above lake level), 125 feet back from the shore line. The log of this hole was as follows:\n\n- 0 - 8 feet = Coarse gravel with small boulders.\n- 8-15.3 feet = Boulders, gravel and occasional clay patches.\n- 15.3 feet = Water horizon.\n- 15.3-16 feet = Large boulder embedded in walls of well on 3 sides, with gravel on other sides.\n\nThe inflow of the water was about 60 gallons per hour in this hole after the excavation had reached 15 feet below lake level. The work all had to be done by hand after the first 8 feet, so it was very slow. The writer attempted to blast the big boulder at least ten times with some old fuse caps and dynamite which Mr. Davis located in the locality. Only one explosion was obtained, due to the defective fuse and the boulder was broken on one end only.\n\nIt was decided then that it was worth while to move over enough to miss this boulder and put down a 4' 6\" square cribbed well to a total depth of about 30 feet, which would be about 8 feet below the bottom of the lake. If the gravel continues to go down to that depth, this well should provide a reasonably good supply of water sufficient for the whole school's requirements for a good many years.\nThere is apparently some inflow of water from the ground to the south, because on July 17th the water level in the well was 68.57 compared to 95.38 in the lake. This water level was taken half an hour after pumping the water out of the well.\n\nI drank some of this water and there was no objectionable taste or odor in it. Whether the quality will remain good after constant use I am not prepared to say, as there may be a much higher percentage come from the lake under these conditions. However, this well seems to offer the best possibilities for a water supply at a reasonable cost yet disclosed.\n\nThe sinking of the new well started on July 17th when I left the school and will continue under the direction of Mr. Davis. I don't believe he has sufficient funds to complete this well, which is estimated to cost:\n\n| Item                                      | Cost   |\n|-------------------------------------------|--------|\n| Labor, excavation in boulders and water    | $50.00 |\n| Well cribbing 1500 F.B.M. - 2\" plank      | $100.00|\n| Wooden pump for demisting                  | $50.00 |\n| Contingencies - 10%                        | $45.00 |\n\nTotal: $475.00\n\nProvided this well is successful an additional expenditure will be necessary to connect it up to the pipe line at the present pump house, a distance of 250 feet, install a pump, new pump-house, etc.\n\nMr. Davis said he would report to this office on the progress of the well sinking, and a more detailed supplementary estimate will be supplied to you later, along with a more detailed plan of the site. Mr. Davis will need the $475.00 estimated above, however, to complete the present program.\n\nSigned: O.M. Lyon.\nMr. Hoey\n\nFor your information,\nplease.\n\n13/8/46.

Regina.\n\nThere is also the question of installing an electric pump as mentioned in my letter of the 10th.\n\nUnless the re-opening of the school is postponed, the pupils will be back very soon, and it will be impossible to have them in residence unless a supply of water is assured.\n\nWill you please advise me by return airmail what the Department intends to do in this matter, and also if I may purchase the pipe from Cranes Limited. The supply on hand may be sold at any time, and it's hard to say when they will be receiving a further supply.\n\nRequisition for the pipe is enclosed herewith.\n\nP.S.\nI have around $300.00 on hand after finishing the well will I use this on the pipe line.\n\nR.S.D.\n\nR.S.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-5, part II)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nAs you are aware the Gordon Eskimo Residential school has been taken over by the Indian Eskimo Residential School commission and as you are no doubt aware this building and school has been getting worse for the last three years until the whole place is in a dirty deplorable condition.\n\nThe plaster is broken floors need repairs woodwork and mostly all the school need redecorating.\n\nIn my opinion this should be done at once before the children are allowed to come back so that we start off on a new standard altogether.\n\nThe school has quits an amount of paint on hand, therefore I have only asked for what I feel is absolutely essential. Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the Commission and Mr. Daucette Mr. Ostrander and myself had a meeting and the matter of cleaning up the school was brought up.\n\nThis school has been taken over at a time when the school should be opened shortly and as the pumps for the well and the decorating hasn't been done or the pumps ordered so that we may be sure of a supply of water, I would personally recommend that this school not be opened until November 1st as it will be at least 3 weeks before I can get men to work, if it is the intention of the Department to undertake this work, as help is very scarce.\n\nThe requisitions for the necessary materials etc are enclosed. This is a lot of money and most of this has been caused by absolute carelessness by the past Principal, which you see by the requisition for glass alone. The storm windows which were taken off were left laying around the yard until all the glass was\nbroken and easily taken up a few days before Mr. Doucette visited the school.\n\nIf this work is to be undertaken I wish you would let me know at once in order that I could get in a few Indians to scrub the walls getting it ready so that it would take the kalsomine.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL.\n\nOttawa, August 27, 1946.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 22nd instant, the Department approves an expenditure of $68.45 to cover the cost of replacing the glass in the windows at the Gordons Indian Residential School.\n\nI note your remarks regarding the condition of this school and Mr. Boucet has reported along the same lines. However, we have had many extraordinary demands on our appropriation this year, therefore, it is simply impossible at the present time to authorize the large amount which you request and which I have no doubt would be necessary to place the building in first class condition. Under these circumstances we can only authorize part of the work that is required.\n\nWith the above in mind and in order not to delay the work local purchase of the following items is approved:\n\n- 10 gal. Plain varnish\n- 10 boxes Solve Ease for washing walls,\n- 10 ft. Conductor pipe for vent\n- 2 Door knobs heavy brass,\n- 2 Outside heavy door locks,\n- 6 Yale locks,\n- 8 doz.

Asbestos cement for boiler\n- 50 \" sheeting for pipes\n- 50 ft. Brass tape for holding asbestos on pipe\nSome of the work can, no doubt, be handled by the school staff but in addition we will allow an amount of $100.00 for Indian labour.\n\nBernard F.

Rose of Mr. Gow's staff in Winnipeg, under date of August 21st:\n\n\"In view of the early approach of the time for school reopening, the attached memo prepared by Mr. Lyon is forwarded immediately on its completion. Mr. Gow may see fit to further comment on the subject when he returns to the office.\n\nIt is considered the \"Immediate emergency supply\" described on the last page could best be put into effect in a short time as the supply pumped from the lake directly will most likely be at its worst during the next couple of months. This temporary provision could serve while the permanent extension was being installed. After a thorough test period would be enough to show in a week's time, whether the well would supply adequately to fill the school's needs. In that time the chemical state of the water flowing in would be stabilized and an analysis would be typical of a regular supply. Both these points would provide for a final decision whether to proceed with the more permanent installation.\n\nUnder present conditions of shortage in material supply, it is best to order for the permanent extension as soon as possible.\"\n\nA copy of Mr. Lyon's report of August 20th is attached in duplicate along with single copies of the plan, profile and section through the holes.\n\nMr. Lyon suggests that the gasoline pump be set up temporarily close to the new No.4 well and to be used to test out the supply of water with the aid of some 2\" pipe laid on the surface of the ground. It is also proposed to move the electric pump from the school down to the well and set it 9 feet below the ground level to operate the permanent water supply automatically to the pressure tank by means of the present pressure switch. This will entail the construction of a power line for about 800 feet which is a long distance to transmit direct current.\n\nIf the gasoline pump can be made to work satisfactorily in the temporary position, we feel that it should be used permanently if possible and thus leave the electric pump to operate in its present location to pump from the concrete storage tanks. We realize that the gasoline pump would operate temporarily at close to its maximum suction head and if it were sunk further in the ground to the 9 foot depth suggested for the electric pump, there might be ventilation difficulties.\n\nEnclos.\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-5, part II)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nIf the water in the well comes mostly from the lake, which seems likely, there is a possibility that the water level in the well will eventually recede unless precipitation should increase and the cycle of dry weather come to an end. A temporary installation seems to be indicated until further observation of the water level can be made.\n\nAs 4000 gallons of water are required each day during about 12 or 14 hours the usual consumption will require delivery of practically every gallon which flows into the well during that period and an automatic electric pump which comes into operation intermittently could not be adjusted to provide the peak delivery required at certain specific times without drawing water from a storage tank which could be filled at night when there is no water consumption.\n\nThe controlling factor will be the flow into the well and an automatic pump governed by the consumption might not always operate when water is available in the well.\n\nIt will thus be evident that two pumps are required, one to pump to the storage tank and the other to pump from the storage tank to the pressure tank when water is required for consumption or to restore the pressure in the pressure tank. A pump started by manual operation might be more satisfactory to handle the water from the well and deliver it to the concrete storage tank.\n\nWe will take the above matters up with Mr. Gow and would like to have your reaction to this memorandum.\n\nIn the meantime will you please arrange for the transfer of $1200.00 to our Service to cover the recommendations of Mr. Lyon and so that we shall have money to go ahead with this water supply installation as soon as we decide definitely on the installation to adopt.\n\nT.S. Mills\nChief Engineer.\nMemorandum\n\nMr. D. B. Gow\n\nRe:- Water Supply at the Gordon's Indian Residential School - Saskatchewan.\n\nSince my last memorandum on this subject was submitted, a cribbed well has been sunk alongside auger hole No.4, under the direction of Mr. R. S. Davis, the Indian Agent.\n\nOn August 10th, Mr. Davis reports in part as follows:\n\n\"I pumped (this well) for half an hour with a centrifugal pump with a 2\" stream and brought the water down 4 ft. The water comes in at the rate of 3 ft. an hour. The well is 4 ft. by 4 ft. and there is 10 ft. of water in it\".\n\nUsing this information, the calculated rate of inflow is 300 gals. per hour or 7200 gals. per day, which is apparently more than sufficient to supply the school's estimated requirements of 4,000 gals. per day. The school has a population of about 15 adults and 110 children during the winter season. No pipes are laid from the school supply to the barn or gardens.\n\nI left instructions to make the well cribbing 4\u00bd ft. by 4\u00bd ft. at the bottom, tapering slightly to the top so that it would be easier to sink the cribbing through the gravel as excavation progressed. If this was done, the above figures will be conservative.\n\nThe well is apparently only 23 feet deep if there is only 10 feet of water in it. Mr. Davis did not state and may not know if the bottom of the well is still in the gravel formation. Since the flow of water was apparently increasing as the excavation deepened, it is probable that the formation at the bottom was porous.\n\nIt seems safe to assume that a dependable source of water supply has been found which will continue to furnish a supply as long as the lake level remains within two or three feet of its present elevation. If the lake drops more than that, it is likely that the present well will have to be deepened and possibly enlarged as well, before sufficient inflow and storage capacity is obtained. As this may be done more economically when the lake is at a lower level, this operation may be postponed, temporarily at least.\n\nEnclosed is a plan, profile, and section showing the location and details of the proposed works necessary to supply water from the new well to the school.\n\nExtension to existing 3\" Pipe Line:\n\nA pipe line, 250 feet long, is necessary to connect the new well to the existing 3 inch line. This connection should be made seven or eight feet from the old pump house and run straight from there to the\n\nD. B. Gow, Esq.,\nDistrict Chief Engineer,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\n532 Dominion Public Building,\nWinnipeg, Manitoba.\nIt is proposed to provide 7 feet of cover over the pipe by trenching to the gradient shown on the profile; extra backfilling up to 1\u00bd ft. thick is required for a portion of this distance. The estimated cost is as follows:\n\nTrenching and backfilling, 230 feet @ $1.00 per lin. ft. ... $230.00\n\n250 ft. galvanized 3\" standard pipe @ $.86\u00a2 ............... 215.00\n\nLabor - Laying pipe and connecting to old line ............ 30.00\n(requiring approx. 65\u00b0 bend at old pump house)\n\nTotal: ........................................... $475.00\n\nNew Underground Pump Chamber:\n\nIt is proposed to enlarge the excavation at the well and construct a pump room below the surface about 5 feet wide, 9 feet long, and 9 feet below the surface. The well crib itself will form one end of this room with a manhole through the roof over the well. The walls should be built with 2 inch plank and covered with a roof 2 feet thick filled with sawdust for insulation. The cost is estimated as follows:\n\nWalls - 20 - 2\" x 6\" x 10' studs = 200 FBM\n\nWalls - 252 sq. ft. 2\" plank = 550 FBM\n\nFloor and ceiling - 90 sq. ft. 2\" plank = 200 FBM\n\nFloor Joists - 5 - 2\" x 6\" x 5' = 30 FBM\n\nCeiling - 10 - 2\" x 4\" x 6' = 40 FBM\n\nUpper roof - 60 sq. ft. 1\" boards = 70 FBM\n\nTotal: .................. 1090 FBM @ $5.00\n\n$70.00\n\nRoofing: 60 sq. ft. galv. iron,\n4 sheets 30\" x 72\" x 20 gauge .......... 13.00\n\nLabor - Excavation, 11 cu. yds. @ $2.00 .... 22.00\n\nConstructing pump room, carpenter and helper, 2 days @ $15.00 ............. 30.00\n\nTotal: .................. $135.00\n\nPower line from school to well:\n\nPower at the school is obtained from a diesel engine and generator installation which charges a series of storage batteries which supply power at 110 volts, direct current. To operate an electrically driven pump at the well it will be necessary to run a pole line down to the well from the school, a distance of 750 feet. The estimated cost is as follows:\n\nClearing line, 200' - 2 man-days @ $5.00 ..... $10.00\n\n7 poles spaced at 125 ft. centres .............. 35.00\n\nErecting poles and wiring ......................... 100.00\n\n1800 ft. wire and insulators, etc. .............. 75.00\n\nTotal: ........... $215.00\nPump\n\nAt present there is an electrically driven pump installed at the school, pumping from the concrete reservoir into the school's pressure tank. This pump is a Fairbanks-Morse self-oiling, speed 270 r.p.m., pressure 100 lb. per square inch, capacity 1,000 gal. per hour. The power of the motor is probably 1\u00bd H.P. and is supplied at 110 volts, d.c.\n\nIt is proposed to move this pumping unit down to the well and install it there to pump direct into the school's pressure tank, using the present pressure switch in the engine room to control its operation. The cost of moving and connecting up is estimated at $50.00.\n\nBypass around concrete reservoir:\n\nWith the proposed pump at the well it will be necessary to bypass the concrete reservoir at the school and pump directly into the pressure tank in the engine room. Provision should be made, however, for filling this reservoir and using it as a standby supply in case of fire.\n\nThe pipe lines in this area are all buried and I have no information as to their exact location. However, a new line is needed from the 3\" water line, before it enters the reservoir, to the pressure tank. The cost is estimated as follows:\n\n- Excavating trench from existing line to school:\n  - 40 ft. at $1.00 per lin. ft. ........................................... $40.00\n  - 50 ft. - 3\" pipe at $.86 per ft. ...................................... 43.00\n- Pipe fitting, valves and elbows ........................................ 25.00\n\nTotal: ........ $108.00\n\nSummary of Costs:\n\n- Extension to existing 3\" line ........................................... 475.00\n- New underground pump chamber ....................................... 136.00\n- Power line to well ......................................................... 318.00\n- Pump installation ............................................................ 50.00\n- Bypass around concrete reservoir ..................................... 108.00\n\n$987.00\n\nContingencies 10% ............................................................ 99.00\n\nTOTAL: .................. $1086.00\nImmediate emergency supply:\n\nTo obtain immediate service from the new well, I would suggest that the present gasoline driven pump of 1,000 gals. per hour capacity be installed about 20 feet from the well in an excavation about 4 feet below the ground level. A two inch surface pipe line from the well to the school supply line at the old pump house, would supply water until the permanent installation could be made. This would leave sufficient space around the well to excavate for and build the pump chamber. It would also provide a service test on the well to determine its capacity.\n\nApproximately 150 feet of 2 inch pipe are already at the school, being used in the surface line from the lake to the old pump house. An additional 100 feet of two inch pipe would be all that is necessary for this temporary installation; the cost of which is estimated as follows:\n\n100 ft. 2 inch black pipe ...........................................$35.00\n\nExcavating for pump and intake, along line of per- (13 cu.yds. @ $2.00).................. /permanent pipe line. 26.00\n\nConnecting pipe and installing gasoline driven pump ...... 25.00\n\nTotal:.................................$86.00\n\nEvery endeavor should be made, however, to have the permanent installation completed before freeze-up, which usually occurs about November first.\n\n(Sgd.)

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-5, part 11)\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to acknowledge receipt of Department letter of the 30th ultimo, File No. 121-1-N T, in connection with the Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Department will have received a telegram from Indian Agent R.S. Davis to the effect that the small Lister engine, which had been repaired by the Mumford Medland Company of Winnipeg, and returned promptly to the school to be available for the opening of school, was, in some manner, put out of working order almost immediately after being put in operation.\n\nIt may be found that only slight damage has been done to the engine and if the Department gave Mr. Davis authority, promptly, to engage an electrician, and he was able to find one, the small engine, and thereby the lighting system, may be put in working order again in a very short time.\n\nThere are several other matters at the school to which Mr. Davis is giving all of his attention. At the end of August the school engineer ceased work and the present principal, who has been informed that he is going to be replaced, does not appear to have much interest in the future of the school. This has added considerable difficulty to Mr. Davis' position in the matter.\n\nThe order has been placed for the necessary pipes for the pipe line and as soon as the pipes are received the necessary excavating will be done, if men are available, to install the pipe line. Harvest operations are under way and casual labour is very much in demand at higher rates, therefore it will not be easy to get the excavating done. We are not wishing to commence the excavating until the pipes are on hand so far that they can be laid as the excavating is done. The ground is generally loose and the walls of excavation will not hold up for any length of time without cribbing. They will fall immediately after being dug which is Mr. Davis' reason for wanting to lay the pipes as soon as the digging is completed. It is true there is a temporary arrangement for supplying water to the school but this can be operated only as long as it is not freezing. They are laid on the ground, consequently they will be put out of working order by freezing as soon as the weather turns cold. If the permanent water supply is not completed by that time there will be no way of getting water to the school.\n\nIt will be seen that it is practically impossible to operate the school until we can be certain that both the lighting plant and the water supply are permanently repaired and safe against the elements.\n\nMr. Davis has engaged 15 Indian women to clean the school and has arranged for the decorators to come in next week for repairing the plaster and doing the redecorating. The chimneys have been neglected and arrangements are being made to have them cleaned. The kitchen stoves were in very bad condition. They have been cleaned and are now in working order. Whether the school opens at once, or not, a school engineer should be appointed and put to work at once as there are many matters around the school needing his attention even before the school is open.\n\nI fully realize the complications which will arise if the school is not opened immediately, but I do not think that they are as difficult to meet as would the complications be, if the children were returned to the school and it was then found that we had...\nOttawa, September 9, 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThis is passed to keep you in the picture on the delayed opening date at Gordon's Residential School.\n\nBernard F.

On inspection by an electrician from Saskatoon it was discovered two of the field coils in the armature were burnt out. This was not the fault of the engineer at the school or the overhaul on the plant at Winnipeg. Yesterday an electrician from Saskatoon was given authority to repair the generator at an approximate cost of $80.00 to $100.00.\n\nAs the same time he wished to install a new set of batteries as the plates in the ones at the school now are badly oxidized and the level of sediment in the jars is up to the plate, consequently many of these batteries have internal shorts and will not take the voltage delivered by the generator. This brings up a resistance which overheats the generator and after these repairs are made it is doubtful if the generator will last very long if we continue to use these old batteries.\n\nCould we please have immediate action.\n\nJ.P.B.

The capacity is 52 A.H.\n\n\"Regarding my statement that old cells can be sold for $2.00 each, I always understood that this is the standard price allowed for old cells if turned in when purchasing a new battery.\"\n\nThis information was given to the Purchasing Agent and he has replied as follows:\n\n\"To assist this office in arranging to supply a suitable battery, will you please furnish details of the kind and capacity of the batteries transferred from the Muscowequan School, and the year in which they were purchased.\n\n\"Please also check the number of plates per cell and the A.H. capacity of the new set of batteries to be ordered, as our catalogues do not show any 56 cell batteries having...\"\nhaving such a low amperage as indicated on your requisition.\"\n\nPlease let me have the information he requires and I will submit it to the Purchasing Agent and urge immediate placing of the order.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nWith reference to your Air Mail letter of the 12th instant, File No. 121-1-5 (W T 1), in connection with new batteries needed for the Gordon's Indian Residential School, the following is the information you require in connection with the old batteries: They are Hart Batteries purchased in August, 1941, H.F. 13 Plate with an Amp. capacity of 262, Serial Number 7557.\n\nI have not a copy of Mr. Davis' requisition for the batteries and he is away in Winnipeg selling his cattle. The information now on hand was supplied to me by Indian Agency Clerk G.A. Havers, and was obtained from the Muscowequan's School, where the batteries were first installed.\n\nI trust this matter is now in order and that new batteries will be purchased at the earliest possible date as the matter is very urgent.\n\nI might add Mr. Havers informs me that Mr. Davis wrote a letter about a week ago describing the batteries and the letter was addressed direct to the Purchasing Agent.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\nOttawa, 16 September 1946.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPARTMENTAL PURCHASING AGENT\n\nRe: Battery for Gordon's Residential School - Your File No. 67248-15-16\n\nWith reference to your memorandum of August 22nd in connection with the above, a battery which has been in use at Gordon's School was transferred there from the Muscowequan School. They are Hart Batteries purchased in 1941. H.F. 13 Plate with an Amp. capacity of 252, Serial Number 7557. It appears from the above that in his requesting a batter of 52 A.H., the Indian Agent was mistaken and the new batteries should have a capacity of 252 A.H.\n\nWe are further advised that Indian Agent Davis wrote a letter direct to your office regarding these batteries.\n\nWe have had considerable trouble with this school and we are extremely anxious to get new batteries at the earliest possible date. Your kind co-operation in this regard will be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nGOVERNMENT OF THE PROVINCE OF SASKATCHEWAN\n\nDEPARTMENT OF LABOUR\n\nSteam Boilers Branch\n\nRefer to File 13506\n\nEX'D.\n\nRegina, September 18, 1946.\n\nTO INSPECTION OF THE Vertical Boiler Record No. 12461, 2 Pass.\n\nBoiler Record No. 12462\n\nLocated in the Indian School - Punnichy, Saskatchewan\n\nOwned by: Department of Indian Affairs - Ottawa, Canada\n\nand inspected by Government Boiler Inspector N.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI have just received a report from the Provincial Department of Public Health, Regina, on the water from the new well recently dug at Gordon's Indian Residential School.\n\nThe report states that the mineral salt content of this water is excessively high and it cannot be recommended for drinking or domestic purposes.\n\nThis report comes as a surprise to me as the stream runs through gravel and has been feeding the lake where the school has been getting their water for years.\n\nWhile there was always a lot of kicking about the water, when a sample was sent in for testing, the report always came back that it was O.K.\n\nThe only thing I can see is to get a punching machine and dig a deep well, as we have to do something. We have a valuable school there which should not be wasted.\n\nRight now the school is using soft water for drinking and cooking purposes, but this supply will not last long.\n\nR.S.

W. Parsons,\nBookkeeper.\n\nEWP:EA\n\nEX'D.\nMEMORANDUM\n\nNovember 7th, 1946\n\nRe: WATER SUPPLY - GORDON'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL - SASKATCHEWAN\n\nReferring to your memorandum of September 13th, we have now received a report from Mr. Martin dated October 18th, duplicate copies of which are attached herewith, as well as of the plans accompanying same.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Martin found a spare motor at the school and used it in place of the gas engine to run the pump at the well. This motor is operated manually from the boiler room. The gas engine was not in good repair, and by using electric power for the pump, ventilation difficulties were surmounted.\n\nMr. Martin suggests that a permanent concrete well be installed after the water delivery from the present well has been proved during twelve months' use. We presume he means that the well should be enlarged and lined with concrete so that one full day's supply could be stored in it.\n\nThe work that has been done is apparently of a permanent rather than a temporary nature, but the necessity for completion in a short time before winter sets in, and the generally poor supply situation, necessitated the use of certain materials which will probably have a short life.\n\nThe Indian Agent should be instructed to keep a permanent monthly record of the water level in the water supply tanks, and also a permanent log of pumping operation so that information will be available at any moment, which will indicate the trend of the water supply and whether further work is needed.\n\nThe cost of the work done this Fall amounts to $1269.55.\n\nYou will note the suggestion that an experienced man be put in charge of the mechanical equipment at the school.\n\nT.

Walker, Esq.,\nSupervising Engineer.\n\nGordon Indian School Water Supply.\n\nI arrived at the Gordon School on September 24th and met Mr. Davis, Indian Agent. Mr. Davis had been getting a temporary water supply for the school by placing a centrifugal pump eleven feet down in the new well. The well was driven by belt drive from a gas engine on the surface. The water was being pumped overland to the 3\" pipeline near the old pump-house. The excavation for this pipeline had just been completed and a supply of 2\" pipe was on hand. I completed the laying of this 230 feet of 2\" galvanized iron pipe into the well.\n\nOn investigation I found that:\n\n(1) The water in the lake is unfit for use on account of stagnation.\n\n(2) The water supplying the new well comes from the opposite direction to the lake and is the water supplying the lake. The water runs into the well 13 feet from the surface near the bottom of the gravel seam. The flow into the well is 300 gallons per hour. The well should be pumped for a year before supply is proved.\n\n(3) The 3\" suction line from the reservoir to the boiler-room in the school was so badly corroded it had to be abandoned. Mr. Davis had set up the pump with a gas engine on account of the power being off and laid a suction line overland to the reservoir. The pump itself was in bad repair.\n\n(4) The reservoir at the school is 15' x 15' by 10 feet high. The intake and outlet are 6 feet from the floor. Dead mice and bugs were found in the reservoir.\n\n(5) The old concrete well near the lake which had been in use, was full of lizards.\n\n(6) The gas engine running the centrifugal pump at the well was worn out and it was not practical to run the pump so far from the engine.\n\n(7) It was not possible to buy pumps in Regina or Saskatoon.\n\n(8) The 3\" pipeline from the old pump house to the reservoir is badly corroded but can serve for the time being.\n\n(9) The system of pumping from the well to the reservoir and from the reservoir to the pressure tanks is a good one.\n\nOn account .............\nOn account of the scarcity of pumps I had the existing ones rebuilt. The 2\" suction 1/2\" discharge centrifugal pump at the well was mounted on a base with a 3 H.P. Motor which was at the school and placed 1/2 feet above water level in the well. New lining was put in the cylinders of the pump at the school and it was mounted on a base with the motor which had previously driven it. A power line was constructed to the well. The pump at the well is operated by closing the switch manually in the Power room at the school. The pump in the school works with a pressure control switch with relay. The pumps were rebuilt by H. Lambert Electric Company, Saskatoon.\n\nThe wiring work on the pole line and the inside wiring in conduit in the boiler-room was done by S.H. Brown electrician of Punnichy. The power line from the well to the school is approximately 800 feet long. It was necessary to use poplar poles. The poles were peeled and creosoted on the butts. No.2 wire was used as No.4 was not obtainable.\n\nThe well was roofed over 6 feet above the pump and again at the surface. Trap doors were installed and a 3 inch vent pipe installed from the pump chamber to the surface. The two coverings over the pump chambers are insulated against freezing. A building 8' x 9' was moved from the Agency to the well. It will serve to keep snow off the entrance and prevent the installation being tampered with. It is not necessary to heat the building, an electric light was placed in the pump chamber.\n\nA new 2\" suction line was laid from the reservoir to the pump in the school.\n\nA relief valve was placed on the present tanks in the boiler room.\n\nThere is a gas compressor to build up the air pressure for the storage tanks.\n\nWhen the pump in the well was started after being idle two days it pumped 2000 gallons in two hours. I suspect water had backed up around the well. Later the water was lowered six feet in pumping forty-five minutes. This equals the first performance of seventeen gallons per minute. The well should not be pumped for more than forty-five minutes at a time, and the water allowed to come back for two hours. Mr. Davis is posting a time table for pumping which allows for thirty minutes pumping in any two hours. In this way the requirements of the school will be met.\n\nWhen the supply of water in the well has been proved after a year's pumping, which I think it will, I suggest a permanent concrete well be installed holding at least a day's supply of water. Water would then be pumped once a day and could also be available for the stables and as a reserve in case of fire.\n\nThe pipe line from the well to the reservoir will have to be renewed before long and this work should be done at the same time the permanent well is constructed.\n\nDomestic Hot Water\n\nThere is a 350 gallon hot water tank in the boiler room connected to the steam heating boiler. It is also connected to a hot water heater. A small vertical type boiler supplies steam to the laundry.\n\nHeating ..................\nHeating\n\nThe school is heated by a horizontal Tube E Leonard and Sons steam boiler. The boiler leaks around the base. Mr. Davis is endeavouring to get a portable electric welding outfit to fix it. He is also having the hard water in the boiler replaced by soft water. The pipes throughout the school are badly corroded. The boiler has been kept too full and water driven into the pipes and radiators; the water hammer causing leaks in the corroded pipes. This plant has been run by inexperienced help. No maintenance work has been kept up on it.\n\nIt is important that an experienced man be put in the boiler room immediately to run the boiler pumps and lighting plant. He would have months of work ahead of him cleaning valves, stopping leaks, etc.\n\nLighting Plant.\n\nWhen I arrived at the school there was no electric power. Both gas plants had been sent to Winnipeg for repairs. The batteries were run down. Before I left the small plant a Lister V.110, A.35 R.P.M. 600 generator had been repaired and installed by H. Lambert Electric Company. New batteries were purchased. Mr. Lambert installed a relay to prevent the batteries burning out the generator.\n\nTo me the plant is antiquated. I suggest that two Diesel plants be installed and the batteries done away with as soon as these plants can be purchased, alternating current generators, of course, being used.\n\nThe direct current motors run from the plant are the two 2 H.P. Motors on the water pumps and a 1 H.P. on the bread mixer.\n\nMr. Davis had considerable cleaning up and painting done at the school this fall.\n\nNow that the power and light are on at the school most of their difficulties can be solved by a good man in the boiler room.\n\nI am enclosing a plan of the building area and a detail plan showing boiler and engine room layout. I am also attaching a breakdown of the cost of the work done by this Service.\n\nR. M.

If he is successful in this, the power difficulty will be overcome providing an engineer is secured at once.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Fawke were sent to the school from Edmonton by the Indian and Eskimo Commission. Mr. Fawke was to be a manual training instructor and Mrs. Fawke a class-room teacher. Mr. Fawke is entirely unfit for this work according to his own statement; he has had very little experience in manual training instruction and seems to know little other than leather work. Leather work might be considered as one phase of manual training instruction but there are many things which should be taught other than leather work, and a suitable manual training instructor could, in the course of his instruction, assist the engineer to some extent to look after minor repairs. Mr. Fawke is almost a total cripple, and has to get around with crutches. He told me he has done no work since 1926 when he was stricken with Encephalomyelitis. I cannot see how he will ever be active enough to be a useful member of a residential school staff, and I so informed him. He now states that he intends to leave and his wife has already submitted her resignation as class-room teacher.\n\nMrs. Mayo has been teaching one of the classrooms but she intends to leave at the end of this month when her husband leaves. The result of this will be that there will be only one class-room teacher, Miss MacDonald, and there are about 100 children in the school. I believe that Miss MacDonald will prove a satisfactory teacher but she certainly cannot teach three class-rooms.\n\nThe only sewing instruction which the girls are receiving is the usual mending of old worn-out clothing. I informed the Principal that he should secure some material with which the girls should be taught to make garments and other useful things which would give them some interest in sewing. An Indian girl will never become very interested in sewing if the only sewing she ever does is the sewing of one patch on top of another. This is the only kind of sewing I have ever seen at the Gordon's School.\n\nThe Farming Instructor has very little initiative and it is necessary for Mr. Ferguson to instruct him in his work from day to day. He should be replaced by a man with a thorough knowledge of grain growing, gardening, and the care of livestock and machinery. Without a man of this kind there is little hope that the Indian boys will leave the school with a knowledge which will fit them for farming and livestock raising on their reserve.\n\nI found the building much cleaner and more tidy than I have ever found it before. Most of the interior decoration has been completed and the interior of the building is no longer a disgrace to the Department.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that I have twice ordered the removal of locks from the fire escape doors I again found two of them locked, and a third door with a lock on it, but this one was not locked. Apparently it is locked at times, otherwise the padlock would not be there. I informed Mr. Ferguson that this cannot be permitted.\n\nTwo of the dormitories have not direct access to a fire escape and it would be necessary for the children from those two dormitories to cross a hall and enter another dormitory in order to get to a fire escape. This is not desirable for two reasons. First that the halls of the building, in case of a fire, will be the most dangerous part of the building, and will probably be full of smoke and fumes. Second that having to cross the hall and enter another dormitory to a fire escape is almost sure to result in confusion in case of a fire. I have not previously criticised this when reporting on the Gordon's School as there have been so many other things to criticise and the building is reasonably safe from fire. However, I believe that a separate fire escape should be installed in order that the children from the two dormitories in question could get directly to the fresh air at the outside of the building without having to pass through a hall. Indian Agent Davis is going to submit a requisition for a fire escape which will service both of these dormitories and I would recommend that it be authorized when the requisition is received.\n\nThere is considerable improve...\nThere is considerable improvement in the variety and quantity of food being supplied to the children. There is no improvement in the fresh milk situation as they have been unable to buy good rich cream. However, the children do have some milk which is saved by the use of powdered milk. There are no vegetables other than potatoes as the garden was almost a complete failure due to miscellaneous. It is hoped that a supply of vegetables will be obtained from the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at Prince Albert. If this is not possible the school will certainly have to buy a quantity of vegetables.\n\nJ.F.R. Ostendar,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nP.S.\n\nSince dictating this letter I have been in contact with Mr. Martin, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and he informs me that he has been unable to locate a motor for the school. He now recommends that the power at the school be changed to install a new power plant consisting of two Diesel Generating Units, 110 Volt A.C. 5 K.V.A., if these can be procured from the War Assets Corporation. We have been in touch with the Saskatchewan Branch and they have none available but they suggest that they might be procured from the Montreal Branch. I would be glad if this could be investigated.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to report that I visited the Gordon's Indian Residential School on the 15th instant. This is the first opportunity I have had to visit the school since Reverend Thomas M. Ferguson was placed in charge as Acting Principal.\n\nIndian Agent Mr. R.S. Davis reported by telegram to the Department that the quantity of water in the new well had lessened considerably and also that the mineral content of the water was so heavy, according to the report of the Provincial Analyst, that the water was not fit for human consumption. Subsequently Mr. Davis sent a sample of the water to the Department at Ottawa for analysis and has not received a report of the finding resulting from that analysis.\n\nOn the day that I visited the school Mr. Martin, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, arrived at the school, and I had a discussion with him at the school. He informed me that he intends to recommend, as a temporary measure, setting up an auxiliary pump from the lake to the well in order to provide an adequate supply of water. This brings us back to our original difficulty with the water supply, that the water will have a bad smell and will need chlorination to be safe for use.\n\nI understand from Mr. Martin that he intends to recommend that an effort be made to sink a deep well to serve this school. This, of course, would be a drilled well, and it might be necessary to go to considerable depth to get an adequate supply of water. However, I believe this is the only hope that we have of getting a supply which will be safe and sufficient for school requirements. If sufficient water cannot be obtained in this manner I do not see how it would be possible to continue to operate the school.\n\nMr. Ferguson has no special training to fit him for Principal of a large institution but I believe he is energetic and conscientious, and will do his best. He is very short of staff at the present time, and the Indian and Eskimo Commission of the Church of England should make every effort to secure suitable staff for him at the earliest possible date. The chief emergency, so far as the staff is concerned, is the need for a real engineer. There does not appear to have been a suitable man in charge of machinery and equipment for several years, and this is the reason for a lot of the damage and neglect to the machinery, the cost of which has to be met by the Department from time to time, and it is not right that this should continue.\n\nMr. Mayo, who was acting as Principal, and is remaining at the school until the end of this month, is a fair mechanic and most of his time was spent on work which should be the work of an engineer. When he leaves there will be no one at the school who knows anything whatever about the care of machinery. The small Lister engine, which was repaired in Winnipeg and is now taking care of the whole of the power requirements of the school, is not nearly sufficient for the work expected of it, and may break down at any moment. If this happens before another engine is secured the school will have to be closed. The new Lister engine, which has been in Winnipeg for some months for repairs, is still not repaired and information has been received from the company in Winnipeg to the effect that they probably will be unable to get repairs for it for several months. This was discussed with Mr. Martin and he is endeavouring to find another engine.

This is not desirable for two reasons. First that the halls of the building, in case of a fire, will be the most dangerous part of the building, and will probably be full of smoke and fumes. Second that having to cross the hall and enter another dormitory to a fire escape is almost sure to result in confusion in case of a fire. I have not previously criticised this when reporting on the Gordon's School as there have been so many other things to criticise and the building is reasonably safe from fire. However, I believe that a separate fire escape should be installed in order that the children from the two dormitories in question could get directly to the fresh air at the outside of the building without having to pass through a hall. Indian Agent Davis is going to submit a requisition for a fire escape which will service both of these dormitories and I would recommend that it be authorized when the requisition is received.\n\nThere is considerable improve...\nThere is considerable improvement in the variety and quantity of food being supplied to the children. There is no improvement in the fresh milk situation as they have been unable to buy good milk cows. However, the children do have some milk which is made by the use of powdered milk. There are no vegetables other than potatoes as the garden was almost a complete failure due to mismanagement. It is hoped that a supply of vegetables will be obtained from the Saskatchewan Penitentiary at Prince Albert. If this is not possible the school will certainly have to buy a quantity of vegetables.\n\nJ.P.B. Ostrander,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nSaskatchewan.\n\nP.S.\nSince dictating this letter I have been in contact with Mr. Martin, of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, and he informs me that he has been unable to locate a motor for the school. He now recommends that the power at the school be changed to install a new power plant consisting of two Diesel Generating Units, 110 Volt A.C., 5 K.V.A.; if these can be procured from the War Assets Corporation. We have been in touch with the Saskatchewan Branch and they have none available but they suggest that they might be procured from the Montreal Branch. I would be glad if this could be investigated.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nI wish to report that I visited the Gordon's Indian Residential School on the 15th instant. This is the first opportunity I have had to visit the school since Reverend Thomas M. Ferguson was placed in charge as Acting Principal.\n\nIndian Agent Mr. R.G. Davis reported by telegram to the Department that the quantity of water in the new well had lessened considerably and also that the mineral content of the water was so heavy, according to the report of the Provincial Analyst, that the water was not fit for human consumption. Subsequently Mr. Davis sent a sample of the water to the Department at Ottawa for analysis and has not received a report of the finding resulting from that analysis.\n\nOn the day that I visited the school Mr. Martin, of the Survey and Engineering Branch, arrived at the school, and I had a discussion with him at the school. He informed me that he intends to recommend, as a temporary measure, setting up an auxiliary pump from the lake to the well in order to provide an adequate supply of water. This brings us back to our original difficulty with the water supply, that the water will have a bad smell and will need chlorination to be safe for use.\n\nI understand from Mr. Martin that he intends to recommend that an effort be made to sink a deep well to serve this school. This, of course, would be a drilled well, and it might be necessary to go to considerable depth to get an adequate supply of water. However, I believe this is the only hope that we have of getting a supply which will be safe and sufficient for school requirements. If sufficient water cannot be obtained in this manner I do not see how it would be possible to continue to operate the school.\n\nMr. Ferguson has no special training to fit him for Principal of a large institution but I believe he is energetic and conscientious, and will do his best. He is very short of staff at the present time, and the Indian and Eskimo Commission of the Church of England should make every effort to secure suitable staff for him at the earliest possible date. The chief emergency, so far as the staff is concerned, is the need for a real engineer. There does not appear to have been a suitable man in charge of machinery and equipment for several years, and this is the reason for a lot of the damage and neglect to the machinery, the cost of which has to be met by the Department from time to time, and it is not right that this should continue.\n\nMr. Mayo, who was acting as Principal, and is remaining at the school until the end of this month, is a fair mechanic and most of his time was spent on work which should be the work of an engineer. When he leaves there will be no one at the school who knows anything whatever about the care of machinery. The small Lister engine, which was repaired in Winnipeg and is now taking care of the whole of the power requirements of the school, is not nearly sufficient for the work expected of it, and may break down at any moment. If this happens before another engine is secured the school will have to be closed. The large Lister engine, which has been in Winnipeg for some months for repairs, is still not repaired and information has been received from the company in Winnipeg to the effect that they probably will be unable to get repairs for it for several months. This was discussed with Mr. Martin and he is endeavouring to find another engine. If he is...\nengine. If he is successful in this, the power difficulty will be overcome providing an engineer is secured at once.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Fawke were sent to the school from Edmonton by the Indian and Eskimo Commission. Mr. Fawke was to be a manual training instructor and Mrs. Fawke a class-room teacher. Mr. Fawke is entirely unfit for this work. According to his own admission he has had very little experience in manual training instruction and seems to know little other than leather work. Leather work might be considered as one phase of manual training instruction but there are many things which should be taught other than leather work, and a suitable manual training instructor could, in the course of his instruction, assist the engineer to some extent to look after minor repairs. Mr. Fawke is almost a total cripple, and has to get around with crutches. He told me he has done no work since 1936 when he was stricken with Encephalomyelitis. I cannot see how he will ever be active enough to be a useful member of a residential school staff, and I so informed him. He now states that he intends to leave and his wife has already submitted her resignation as class-room teacher.\n\nMrs. Mayo has been teaching one of the classrooms but she intends to leave at the end of this month when her husband leaves. The result of this will be that there will be only one class-room teacher, Miss MacDonald, and there are about 100 children in the school. I believe that Miss MacDonald will prove a satisfactory teacher but she certainly cannot teach three class-rooms.\n\nThe only sewing instruction which the girls are receiving is the usual mending of old worn-out clothing. I informed the Principal that he should secure some material with which the girls should be taught to make garments and other useful things which would give them some interest in sewing. An Indian girl will never become very interested in sewing if the only sewing she ever does is the sewing of one patch on top of another. This is the only kind of sewing I have ever seen at the Gordon's School.\n\nThe Farming Instructor has very little initiative and it is necessary for Mr. Ferguson to instruct him in his work from day to day. He should be replaced by a man with a thorough knowledge of grain growing, gardening, and the care of livestock and machinery. Without a man of this kind there is little hope that the Indian boys will leave the school with a knowledge which will fit them for farming and livestock raising on their reserve.\n\nI found the building much cleaner and more tidy than I have ever found it before. Most of the interior decoration has been completed and the interior of the building is no longer a disgrace to the Department.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that I have twice ordered the removal of locks from the fire escape doors I again found two of them locked, and a third door with a lock on it; but this one was not locked. Apparently it is locked at times, otherwise the padlock would not be there.

Both these engines are Listers, manufactured in the United Kingdom. Naturally the supply of replacement parts during the last seven years has been almost nil. As a result, both these machines failed this summer and they were shipped to Humford-Medland's in Winnipeg for repair.\n\nThe smaller machine has been repaired and returned to the school and is now carrying the load. It is a 3\u00bd K.W. engine trying to replace the larger 7\u00bd K.W. engine and of course operating at high speeds, for 16 hours a day, is in need of constant attention. Inspector Ostrander reports: \"It may break down at any moment. If this happens before another engine is secured the school may have to be closed\".\n\nUpon receipt of the above information by long distance phone from Indian Agent Davis and by the above mentioned letter from Inspector Ostrander, we tried the following sources of supply:\n\n(a) Har Assets Corporation - To our wire the answer received was: \"Regret no Diesel or gasoline engines anywhere near the required horse power available\".\n\n(b) Humford-Medland - To our wire they replied that it would be four or five months before they could replace the unit. In six weeks they could provide a re-assembled unit.\n\n...... They suggested\nThey suggested shipping the present plant and then when new parts were received from England they could ship to the school for installation. If there were a capable engineer at the school, we would not hesitate to do this. As it is, however, we feel that this temporary installation would be but a constant source of grief - just as the engine was before being shipped to Winnipeg.\n\nTherefore we recommend the purchase of a new engine. With this in mind we contacted Fairbanks-Morse, who informed us they were unable to provide immediate delivery on anything but a 4\u00bd K.W. engine. We finally located an engine through Mainguy's, Limited, in Montreal. They can give immediate delivery on a Witte Diesel from Kansas City. The Surveys and Engineering officials approve this type of machine. A similar plant is already in use at the Moose Factory Residential School and is giving entire satisfaction.\n\nIt is therefore recommended, in view of this emergency, that an order for the engine as detailed herewith be placed with Mainguy's, Limited, of Montreal.\n\nDirector.\n| DATE | SERVICE | AMOUNT |\n|------|---------|--------|\n| Oct 9 | To repair to Generator, Gordon Indian Residential school, as A/c attached | $136.28 |\n| 29   | To work on electric light system at Gordon Indian Residential School as A/c attached | $134.70 |\n\nTotal: $270.98\n\nI hereby certify that this Voucher is correct, that the material has been supplied, the work performed and that the charges are fair and just, also that the expenditure has been incurred legitimately and that each item of the same is a fair and just charge against the Government of Canada.

This is not sufficient water to supply the School.\n\nTo meet the emergency I am installing the pump on the lake for the winter. Tests have not been made as yet, but this will be done. Even if drinking water has to be hauled it is the only thing to do. By chlorinating the water in the lake it might be possible to use it for drinking purposes as well.\n\nI will contact Clark Company, Well Drillers of Welsey, Sask., and get a quotation on drilling a well. The Agent has good water in the well at the Agency. The well is 180 feet deep.\n\nBoth water and light are dependent on the one generating plant at the Schools, the larger plant being still under repairs which cannot be obtained for some time.\n\nI estimate the setting up of the temporary pumping system on the lake with chlorination will cost $500.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"R.

FORWARD\nOTTAWA ONTARIO\n\nRE OUR TELEGRAM 20th NOW PLEASED TO ADVISE ARRIVAL\nSPARES IN WINNIPEG stop WE ARE ARRANGING START\nASSEMBLING ENGINE AS SOON AS SPARES RELEASED FROM\nCUSTOMS stop IF ANY INSTRUCTIONS TO THE CONTRARY\nPLEASE WIRE\n\nMUMFORD MEDLAND LIMITED\n\nConfirmation\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to our recent phone conversation with Mr. Phelan and also with Mr. Dacet, who is at the Gordon School, I have just received the results of the tests of water taken from the hole in the ice on the lake, and from the well. Copies of these tests are enclosed.\n\nYou will see that the solid contents are much less in the well than in the lake. For years the staff of this school and the pupils have been drinking this water without any ill results, but of course it was chlorinated, which was not the case in the samples tested. I do not know if the chlorinating will help the mineral content or not, but we have sent in a sample after mixing chloride of lime and putting it into the tank. In this district and the town of Punnichy, all the water has a certain amount of salts. Our well at the Agency is a deep well in the neighbourhood of 300 feet deep and the tests show we have total solids of 1920 parts per million. By digging a deep well no doubt we will get away from some mineral content, but not all. I think this should be done as soon as possible. The cost of this would be approximately $5000.00.\n\nMr. Martin the Engineer, is still here and we have a pump working from the lake to the school and we are also using the water from the well.\n\nAs this pipe runs from the lake to the well on the outside and is then connected to the pipe line into the school, we will have difficulty with freezing and it is a one man's job to look after it, and as you cannot depend on the people around the school to properly care for this, I have taken the liberty to hire George Pratt, an Indian who is fairly reliable and has had experience with pumping both from the lake and well as he worked at the school for a number of years, to do all the pumping and keep the tanks at the school full, and the pipes free from ice. I have purchased a barrel of fuel oil for him with which to make torches to warm the pipes up before he starts and keep any ice that congregates...\nin the pipe, thawed out, as this ice only congregates when we stop\nthe pump to drain the pipes.\n\npromised Pratt $50.00 a month for one month with the understand-\ning he would stay on for the winter and do this work, if it meets wi-\nwith your approval. Please let me know if this will be\nsatisfactory to you or not.\n\nThe school staff is at present drinking and cooking with soft\nwater. This is stored in a tank outside the school, underground.\nI am not quite sure how long this water will last, and last week\ntook the matter up with the Superintendent of the C.N.R. to get a\ntank of water shipped in from Nakomis, where the water is very good.\nHe informed me that he could not ship us any as all their tanks\nwere in use. If I see that I am going to be right up against it\nfor drinking water, I will advise you at once by phone or wire,\nand probably you could make arrangements with the C.N.R. at\nMontreal to have a tank shipped to us and I would have it hauled\nto the school with tanks and trucks, and put in the cistern.\n\nI explained to Mr. Ducet that we would have to get an electric\npump to take this water out of the cistern and pipe it into the\nkitchen, as at present there is only an old hand pump that some-\ntimes works and sometimes doesn't, so they have to take the lid\nfrom the top of the cistern and bail it out, which is most un-\nsanitary.\n\nMr. Ducet knows just what we want and is taking the matter up in\nWinnipeg regarding price etc., and promised to do what he could to\nsee that you placed the order. I also talked over with him the\nmatter of getting a chlorinator at once, one which was large\nenough to chlorinate about 5000 gallons per day. These two things\nare urgently needed, and the sooner you can get them here, the\nbetter.\n\nThe D.C. plant is still going but has to be run so long the engine\nis worked to death trying to keep the thing going and no doubt you\nyou will have this matter straightened up shortly. It will cost\nin the neighbourhood of $300.00 to switch over from D.C. to A.C.\nWe only have four motors to change and there would be the two\nmotors we would get, one with the chlorinator and one with the\ncistern pump.\n\nThe D.C. motors are worth more than the A.C. motors and I believe\nthat I can take the D.C. motors to Saskatoon and trade them for\nA.C. with very little extra cost. Of course the price of $300.00\nwill not include the cost of installing the new lighting plant,\nas I am unable to give you a price on this.\n\nThere will be considerable equipment needed at this school, such\nas digging a well, boiler etc., which will have to be installed\nnext summer. The whole plumbing system in the school will have\nto be overhauled, and most of it replaced. My difficulty is that when forwarding my request to you, to get the cost of these replacements, etc. Would it be satisfactory to you if I send you a list of what is needed and you get the prices and the costs, from some of the technical men in the engineering branch, so as to take the whole matter up before the Minister.\n\nPlease wire me if this will be satisfactory and I will go over the whole thing with Mr. Martin before he leaves here, and send you a report by airmail.\n\nR.S.

Davis, Indian Agent,\nPUNNICHY, Sask.\n\nWe have received your letter, G-11-Ang., of Nov. 27th and have given careful consideration to its contents. We are bringing to the attention of the Surveys and Engineering Branch, your comments concerning the necessity of a deep well at this school. They are expecting a complete report on the water situation from Mr. Martin.\n\nThe Department authorizes the hiring of Mr. George Pratt at $50.00 a month to do all the pumping, keeping the tanks at the school full, and keeping the pipes free from ice. We also approve the purchase of such fuel oil as is necessary to keep these pipes thawed out. We have noted your comments concerning the soft water and will be prepared to take such action as you suggest with the C.N.R. if the soft water supply fails.\n\nWe expect to hear further concerning the electric pump to take this water from the cistern upon Mr. Doucet's return to Ottawa. We have discussed with the Surveys and Engineering Branch, the possibility of switching the system from A.C. to D.C. as you recommend. However, we have been able to locate for immediate delivery from Kansas City, a new 12 H.P. 8 Kilowatt, stationary diesel engine. This engine is manufactured by the Witte Diesel Company, the largest manufacturers of small diesel engines in the United States. We have used them in our other schools and have found them very satisfactory. We were very fortunate in locating this engine through the efforts of Mainguy's Limited of Montreal, their Canadian agents. This Company has received all details...\nconcerning the system at Gordon's and are wiring the plant accordingly.\n\nWe have also been informed by Mumford Medland Limited that the Lister engine they are repairing, should be ready to leave Winnipeg about Dec. 4th. It is suggested that this plant be taken to the school and held there in the event of a breakdown in the present small engine. The new engine from Kansas City should arrive about the middle of December and can then be installed.\n\nIt is our attention to use the old 6 Kilowatt Lister at another residential school in the north which requires such a motor for electric generation. It will be quite satisfactory for you to go ahead as suggested in the final two paragraphs of your letter and we will expect to hear further from you in this regard.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nP.S. With reference to your telephone conversation of Nov. 30th with this office, we concur in your suggestion that the Lister engine from Mumford Medland be held in the Agency's office in the event of an emergency rather than take it to the school as mentioned previously.\n\nWe would appreciate hearing from you in further detail concerning the engine you located in Saskatoon.\n\nB.F.N.\n| ITEM | CAT. | QUANTITY | DESCRIPTION                                                                 | BASIC PRICE |\n|------|------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|\n| 1    | AU   | 2        | **CHLORINATORS:** Manual Control, each having a maximum capacity of 400# of chlorine per 24 hours, equipped with all usual accessories and spare parts.<br>**CHLORINATORS MAKE:** Wallace & Tieman Ltd., Toronto, Ontario.<br>Complete with two-2000# portable platform scales #56 equipped with drop lever, wheels & steel plates.<br>Make: Gurney Scales Co.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter #121-1-5 (W.T.) dated December 2, 1946, and with reference to the engine I located in Saskatoon, would advise that this is a Lister 5 H.P. E.T.O. engine for a lighting plant, but it hasn't a generator. If this is purchased it will cost in the neighborhood of $800.00 to make the switch. The engine will cost $630.00 but will have to be mounted with the generator we have on hand, and the total cost would be about $800.00.\n\nIt is not clear from your letter if the diesel engine ordered from Kansas City is D.C. or A.C., but if it is A.C., the engine in Saskatoon could still be used by installing a switch. The Kansas City engine could be used during the day to run all the meters and then at say eleven o'clock at night it could be switched to the D.C. In any event the engine on the small unit which we are now using, is practically on its last legs and if this plant is wanted for another place, my opinion is it would be the cheapest to have this fixed up in this way. In the meantime, if thought needed, it could stay in the school as a standby.\n\nAs you are quite aware, something like this is needed in any case and if at a later date we are sending to some place else, we will have something to send them.\n\nIf you wish to purchase the engine in Saskatoon, please advise me at once as these things are picked up very fast these days and when I saw it, I thought it would be good business to buy it.\n\nRegarding the new stationary diesel engine purchased, will you please have the Witte Diesel Company forward me the blue prints of the engine base so as I can have everything ready to install the plant. No doubt the plant will have to be set on a cement base, therefore, if this is done before the Electricians arrive...\nto install the meter, it will reduce the cost considerably.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, 9 December 1946.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPUNNICHY, Sask.\n\nGordon's Residential School\n\nReference your S-11 Ang. of Dec. 4th.\n\nThe diesel engine ordered from Kansas City is a D.C. model. Therefore it will not be necessary to switch the wiring etc. to A.C.\n\nIt is intended to leave the small unit at present generating power for Gordon's, at the school. It is the larger unit under repair at Mumford Medland's which we would like later for another school.\n\nThis will leave Gordon's with two D.C. units:\n\n(a) The new Witte diesel\n(b) The small Lister at present in use.\n\nIf you feel that engine (b) above is too badly worn, then we might retain the heavier Lister also at Gordon's and discard the plan of sending it North.\n\nIn any event, it is doubted if we would require the engine which you went to so much trouble to locate in Saskatoon. We can purchase new $4\\frac{1}{2}$ and $5\\frac{1}{2}$ H.P. motors in Canada but the larger ones we have to buy in the United States. However, in view of the above information, you may have a further recommendation to make concerning this engine.\n\nWe have arranged with Mainguy's Limited to send you details of the engine base as requested in the last paragraph of your letter.\n\nBernard F.

On his recent trip to Western Canada, Mr. Doucet visited this school and met both the Indian Agent, Mr. Davis and Inspector Gatrander as well as the representative of the Surveys and Engineering Branch who agreed that a chlorinator was essential to protect the health of the pupils and staff. On his return trip Mr. Doucet saw a suitable chlorinator which is for sale by War Assets Corporation in Winnipeg. We have wired Mr. C.L. Campbell, War Assets Corporation, Military District #22, Somerset Building, Portage Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba, requesting that this chlorinator be held for us. It would be appreciated if you would issue a Purchase Order immediately and forward by air mail.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\nDepartment of\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE\n\nREPORT ON\nA SANITARY SURVEY OF THE WATER SUPPLY\nAT GORDON'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL,\nPUNNICHY, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nExamined - December 1 - 2, 1946.\n\nExamined and Reported by:\nN.J. Goode,\nSenior Sanitary Engineer,\nPublic Health Engineering Division.\nREPORT ON A SANITARY SURVEY OF THE WATER SUPPLY AT\nGORDON'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL AT PUNNICHY, SASKATCHEWAN\n\nExamined - December 1-2, 1946.\n\nGordon's Indian Residential School is situated seven miles south of the railway station at Punnichy, Saskatchewan. At the time of the examination there were approximately 120 persons, including 100 pupils and 20 staff members, residing at the school.\n\nPrincipal - Mr. Mayo.\nActing Principal - Rev. Ferguson.\nIndian Agent - Mr. R.S. Davis.\n\nThe present water supply includes two systems. The main source of supply is obtained from a well, and a lake. The secondary source of supply is obtained from snow, and rain water falling on the roof of the building.\n\nThe Main Water Supply\n\nThe well, which was constructed in 1946, was originally intended to supply the normal demands of the school. It is 700 feet from the school and 100 feet inshore from the lake. The well shaft is 4 feet square and approximately 30 feet deep. Water is drawn from the well by a 2\" dia. intake pipe, fitted with a coarse screen and foot valve, attached to an electrically-driven pump (Fairbanks-Morse Motor, Type D, Serial No. X55298; 2 HP, D.C. 115v, 16.8a, 1,750 RPM, attached to a centrifugal pump with an 8\" dia. impeller). On leaving the pump, the water is forced through a 2\" dia. discharge pipe to a 10,000 gallon cistern adjacent to the school building.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nThe lake could be termed a pond as the water surface is only 100,000 square yards in extent, and the drainage area is less than \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) square mile. An intake, through the ice on the lake surface, was recently constructed to supplement the limited volume of water obtainable from the well. This intake was placed in a temporary housing 100 feet from the lake shore. Water, from this emergency source of supply, is drawn through a 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" dia. intake pipe to a gasoline-driven pump (London, self-priming centrifugal pump; Serial No. 465636, Model LW; Manufactured by Lawson Co., New Holstein, Wisconsin). This pump forces the water through a 1\\(\\frac{3}{4}\\)\" dia. discharge pipe, supported on blocks above ground, to the 2\" dia. pipe leading from the well to the cistern. By a suitable valving arrangement, water can be pumped to the school from either the lake or the well.\n\nThe equipment, installed in the school building for the distribution of the water, includes a pump and motor, two pressure tanks, a pressure filter, and appurtenances. The motor, attached to the pump, is equipped with an automatic start-stop arrangement adjusted to maintain the water pressure between 25 and 45 pounds per square inch. Water is drawn from the cistern by an electrically-driven pump (Fairbanks-Morse Pump rated at 1,000 gallons per hour, 270 RPM is driven by Fairbanks-Morse Motor, Serial No. X52154, Type DH, 8 HP, 1,750 RPM; D.C. 115v, 16.3a) which forces it through the pressure tanks to the outlets in the building.\n\nThe Secondary Water Supply\n\nThe secondary source of supply is\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nobtained by collecting melted snow, and rain water, from the roof of the school. This water is stored in a second 10,000 gallon concrete cistern beside the building. The sole outlet to this cistern is a handpump located in the basement of the school. This supply is necessarily limited and, consequently, is used only for laundry and cooking purposes.\n\nWater Treatment\n\nThere has been no systematic treatment of the water during the present school term. The pressure filter, installed in the basement, (Water Softener and Filtration Plant, supplied by the International Filter Co.) has been disconnected and out of use for a number of years. However, following the receipt of unfavourable bacteriological analyses from the Saskatchewan Department of Public Health, there have been attempts to chlorinate water from the main supply. As far as can be ascertained, these attempts were haphazard as the required procedure was not known.\n\nResults of Bacteriological Analyses of Water Samples submitted to the Saskatchewan, Dept. of Public Health.\n\n| Date       | Source          | Total | Coliform Organisms | Indicated Quality |\n|------------|-----------------|-------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Nov. 1946  | Lake            | 3,112 ppm | Present in 1.0 cc | BAD              |\n| \"          | Well            | 2,532  | Present in 0.1 cc | VERY BAD         |\n| Dec. 2     | Tap, School Bldg| 3,268  | Present in 1.0 cc | BAD              |\n| \"          | Tap, Main Floor | 2,932  | Present in 0.1 cc | VERY BAD         |\n| \"          | Tap, Kitchen    | 3,116  | Present in 10 cc   | Doubtful         |\n| \"          | Well            | 2,590  | Present in 1.0 cc | BAD              |\n| \"          | Lake            | 3,112  | Negative           | Good             |\n\nNote - The samples dated Dec. 2, 1946 were collected during the examination.\nView of Lake.

Emergency Lake Intake Housing in the background.\n\nView of the Well Shaft, showing Pump and Piping. Note: Shaft, below Pump, is open to the Water Level.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nThe Sewerage System\n\nSewage is discharged into a septic tank 100 feet from the school building. The effluent from this tank runs into a slough 400 feet from the school. This slough is in the opposite direction from the lake, and separated from it by the high ground on which the school stands.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThere are numerous potential, and actual sources of pollution in this system.\n\nThe drainage area of the lake is unrestricted. This area includes part of the school grounds, farm land, and wooded country. Consequently, there are a number of persons in close proximity to the lake who could contaminate it.\n\nThe lake is used for watering cattle. Two watering holes in the ice were noted during the examination. It was evident that these had been cut for cattle as their droppings were noticed nearby. One of these holes was within 150 feet of the emergency intake. Such an arrangement is an obvious source of pollution.\n\nThe emergency intake pipe, from the lake, is supported on blocks above ground. After pumping, it is necessary to disconnect and drain this pipe to prevent it from freezing. While this pipe is being connected and disconnected, and during the time it is left open to drain, there is ample opportunity for the pipe to become contaminated.\n\nThe well shaft is not water-tight as it is made of wood. Thus it is possible for contaminated surface water to enter the well shaft.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nOriginally the pump, installed in the well shaft, was supported by a wooden floor. However, during repairs, this floor was removed and the pump was supported by two planks. Since that time this flooring has not been replaced. Thus there is a danger of polluting substances falling from the pump level to the water surface. This is an ever present danger as the operator descends the shaft several times a day to start and stop the pump.\n\nThe entrance to the main water supply cistern is above ground. This entrance was originally well protected by a fitted, dome-shaped, cast iron lid. However, a hole has been cut in this lid. This hole was made to allow a wooden pole, adapted as a float gauge, to fluctuate freely. It serves this purpose, but it also allows contaminating substances to enter the cistern.\n\nAn open pipe line connects an upper level of the cistern to a sump in the basement of the school. This pipe line allows water to enter the sump when the water level of the cistern is above the level of the sump. If, subsequently, water is drawn from the cistern before water in the sump is pumped to waste, there is a danger of contamination entering the cistern in the backflow from the sump.\n\nThe results of the bacteriological analyses, of samples taken from this water supply system, show a marked degree of contamination. It is evident from these results that the water, in its raw state, is not safe for human consumption. It should also be noted that the mineral salt content, although not dangerous, is objectionably high.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nThe slough, created by the septic tank effluent, is separated from the lake by the high ground on which the school stands. Consequently, it is extremely improbable that the septic tank effluent could contaminate the main water supply. This effluent, however, creates a nuisance and a health hazard, as it gives off an unpleasant odour and forms a breeding place for flies.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIt will be recognised by the foregoing paragraphs, that the sanitary conditions throughout the water supply system at Gordon's Indian Residential School are extremely unsatisfactory. In order to eliminate some of the worst aspects of the present installation it is recommended that the following steps be taken.\n\n1. It is impractical to enforce restrictions to the drainage area of the lake, as it includes part of the school grounds and a farm. However, persons frequenting the immediate vicinity of the lake should be warned against fouling the water.\n\n2. Cattle should not be watered directly from the lake, especially, not from the immediate vicinity of the intake.\n\n3. Great care should be exercised in handling the emergency pipe line when it is being connected and disconnected. To eliminate the possibility of contamination, and to provide a more practical means of draining the pipe, a drainage valve should be installed adjacent to the pump.\n\n4. The flooring beneath the pump, in the well shaft, should be replaced.\n\n5. The hole in the cover of the main water supply cistern should be sealed. This would\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nnecessitate the installation of a different type of depth gauge.\n\n6. The pipe line connecting the cistern to the sump, should be permanently sealed.\n\n7. Both water supplies should be chlorinated. This is the most urgent, immediate recommendation.\n\n8. A supply of orthotolidin, and a comparator should be supplied to ensure that an adequate chlorine residual is present.\n\n9. An automatic hypochlorinator should be installed in the main water supply system. The ideal location for this equipment would be on the pipe line leading to the cistern from the well. A sufficient contact period would be assured with such an arrangement.\n\nAt the time of the examination it was recognised that chlorination of these supplies was necessary. Therefore typewritten instructions, detailing manual emergency chlorination procedure, were prepared and left with officials of the school. If carried out, these instructions will provide a dosage of 3 ppm available chlorine for the main water supply, and 2 ppm for the secondary supply.\n\n10. Water from the main supply source should not be used for drinking, as it is not very palatable, and as it has a large mineral salt content which is the probable source of a laxative effect. To utilize the secondary supply for drinking, it will be necessary to provide a suitable means of distribution as, at present, there is only one inefficient outlet.\n\nA suggested means of effecting this distribution, is to provide six 5-gallon water bottles, similar to those used in office buildings, to dispense the drinking water.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nThese water bottles would be placed in readily accessible positions about the school building after being filled with chlorinated water from the secondary supply.\n\nIt is to be emphasised that the foregoing recommendations are suggested as a means of improving the worst features of a very unsatisfactory supply. These recommendations are not intended to produce a wholesome safe supply, but are emergency measures to improve the quality of the water until a more satisfactory source is obtained.\n\nThe following two recommendations are believed to be both necessary and practical. They will effect a more permanent solution to the water supply problems encountered at the Indian School.\n\n11. A deep well should be drilled, as it has been proven that shallow wells in this vicinity do not maintain a sufficient yield to satisfy the water demand of the school. In support of this statement, there is considerable correspondence, on file in the Indian Agent's Office, dealing with trouble encountered with shallow well supplies in recent years. It is admitted that there is no guarantee of a deep well furnishing an adequate water supply. However, in view of the foregoing facts and the present situation, it should prove to be more practical and economical than continued reliance on inadequate surface, or shallow well supplies.\n\nIf a deep well is to be drilled, the present manual chlorination could be continued until it is in service. Subsequent tests on the deep well water may show that it doesn't require chlorination. Thus, it may be possible to save the expense of a hypochlorinator.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\n12. An experienced, practical man should be placed in charge of the electrical and mechanical equipment of the school. Besides the heating units, this equipment includes two electrically-driven pumps, one gasoline-driven pump, and a gasoline-driven electric generator, which operate the water supply system. Lately, the men placed in charge of this machinery have had only a rudimentary knowledge of its operation and maintenance. Such men, although not necessarily negligent, cannot be expected to maintain machinery at operating efficiency. Because of their lack of training, minor defects go unattended until they result in a major breakdown, with a consequent partial or total failure of the water supply. Therefore, it is felt that a competent maintenance man is the best insurance against recurrent failures of machinery, and disruption of the water supply system.\n\nN.J.

J. Goode,\nSenior Sanitary Engineer,\nPublic Health Engineering Division.\nDEPARTMENT OF\nNATIONAL HEALTH AND WELFARE.\n\nPublic Health Engineering Div.\nP. O. Box 487,\nRegina, Sask.,\nJanuary 15th, 1947.\n\nSUPPLEMENT TO REPORT ON A SANITARY SURVEY OF THE\nWATER SUPPLY AT GORDON'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\nAT PUNNICHY, SASKATCHEWAN.\n\nExamined December 1 - 2, 1946.\n\nThe report on the water supply of Gordon's Indian Residential School was originally submitted before the results of the chemical analysis of the water were known. This was possible as it was realized that data obtained from such an analysis could not appreciably change the opinion on such an obviously unsatisfactory supply. If such a course had not been taken the report would have been delayed for a month as chemical analyses are often time-consuming, especially when the laboratory has limited space available, as is the case of the laboratory in Regina. Thus, by forwarding the report before the analysis was completed, it was possible for remedial action to be instituted at an earlier date.\n\nAs was anticipated, the results of the chemical analysis bear out the original observation that water from the present supply sources is not fit for human consumption. There are excess amounts of the following items in the water:\n\nMagnesium .................................. 311.3 p.p.m.\n- should not exceed 125 p.p.m.#\n\nSulphate .................................... 1166.8 p.p.m.\n- should not exceed 250 p.p.m.#\n\nTotal dissolved solids ..................... 3002 p.p.m.\n- should not exceed 1000 p.p.m.#\n\nThis partial chemical analysis emphasizes the inferior quality of the water.\nIndian School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nIt is possible to improve the bacteriological quality by chlorination, but to improve the chemical quality satisfactorily it would be necessary to install a complete water treatment plant. This expedient is out of the question as it has already been foreseen that the present sources of supply are not adequate for the needs of the school. Therefore the only reasonable conclusion obtained from the foregoing data supports the recommendation in the report that another source of supply should be obtained by drilling a deep well.\n\nM. J.

It was not possible to secure an estimate of the cost previous to shipping the machines. As you are aware, the Mumford, Medland Company is the agent for the Lister machine in Western Canada.\n\nWe would appreciate it if you would issue purchase order so the account may be paid. The coding is as follows: 654-76-09-622.\n\nDirector.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, February 14th, 1947.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Sask.\n\nAttached is account from War Assets Corporation covering the cost of the chlorinator supplied to the Gordon's Residential School.\n\nIf the chlorinator has been received you should certify the account and return for payment.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nMr. Hoey\n\nFor your information, please.\n\nYour memorandum of Feb. 7th has been referred to our Engineering and Construction Service for attention.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Water Supply - Gordon's Indian Residential School - Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nReferring to your memorandum of December 10th on the subject of water supply at the above school, we have received a further report from Mr. Martin dated January 31st, copies of which are attached herewith in duplicate.\n\nReplying in detail to questions (a) and (b) of your memorandum of December 10th, we would advise as follows:\n\n(a) There appears to be nothing more to be done to ensure a safe temporary source of water supply. The Sanitary Engineer, Mr. Goode, left instructions at the school re temporary water treatment and the Director of Indian Affairs advises under date of January 10th that a chlorinator is being provided so that the water will be purified from bacteriological pollution. However, the mineral content of the well and lake water is too high and Mr. Goode recommends that it be not used for drinking and seems to suggest that the soft water supply from the roof could be used for drinking. We understand that ice has been hauled in during the winter for a drinking supply.\n\n(b) In the present school location the only proposal remaining to be tried is that of drilling a deep well, although there can be no guarantee of a satisfactory supply from this source. Water might not easily be found and if found, might be of poor quality.\n\nMr. Martin, on November 25th, reported the rates for drilling. From these figures two wells could each be drilled to 200 feet depth and cased with 5-5/8\" pipe for a cost of about $8,000.00 or one well could be drilled and cased to a depth of about 400 feet for the same amount. The cost of pumping equipment and housing might approximate $1,000.00 for one well so that $4,000.00 should be made available.\n\nThe following is an extract from a report of the Geological Survey on \"Ground-Water Resources of the Rural Municipality of Touchwood\" contained in Water Supply Paper No. 99:\n\n\"Water would doubtless be encountered in places in the bedrock if wells were drilled into it, but, because of the expense involved and the uncertainty of obtaining water that is not highly mineralized, deep drilling in this municipality is not warranted.\"\n\nJ. M. Wardle, Esq.,\nDirector,\nSurveys and Engineering Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA.\n\nEnc.\nHowever in spite of this report, the Indian Agent at Punnichy has apparently secured good water at a depth of 180 feet.\n\nWe shall be pleased to be advised if any further action is necessary by this Service in regard to the drilling of a deep well.\n\nChief Engineer.\nBunff, Alberta,\nJanuary 31st, 1947.\n\nMEMORANDUM:\n\nTo - C. M. Walker, Esq.,\nDistrict Engineer.\n\nRe: Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nIn regard to this water supply I beg to draw your attention to different recommendations that I have made in memoranda to you and in letters to Mr. T.S. Mills, while I was at Punnichy.\n\nIn my memorandum of October 15th I pointed out that the supply of water in the new well should be tested out over a period of time before going to the expense of installing permanent well cribbing, pump-house and pipeline repairs. In November the supply decreased to 110 gals. per hour, due to a drop of one foot in the water level. I augmented this water supply by fitting a temporary line to the lake, and recommended:\n\n(1) That a hypo-chlorinator be placed immediately in the boiler room on the discharge side of the pump. There are two 1000 gal pressure tanks on the discharge line. In my opinion the hypo-chlorinator would be required, regardless of source of water supply.\n\n(2) That the building area be drilled for a water supply.\n\nIn my letter of November 29th to Mr. Mills I estimated the cost of the above undertakings to be $3,000. to $6,000, according to results from drilling. If the results from drilling are not satisfactory I believe it possible to excavate a reservoir at the present new well which would supply sufficient water. If a hypochlorinator were installed at the present time it would be determined whether the water would be fit for use or not.\n\nI see no great difference between Mr. Goode's recommendation and my own as far as a permanent solution goes, which is that the area be drilled for water.\n\nMr. Davis, Indian Agent, told me he could have ice hauled for drinking purposes during the winter. The cistern referred to in Mr. Goode's report holds the drainage water from the roof of the school.\n\nIn my memorandum of October 15th I advised having a skilled man in the boiler-room to take care of boilers, generators, and pumps. I believe that this has not been done.\n\nWith regard to water analysis, Mr. Davis sent two samples to the University of Saskatchewan. He was to send a copy to this office with the original to Ottawa. The tests made by the Department of Health showed more contamination in the well than in the lake. This was no doubt due to the well being open below the ladder.\n\nIn my opinion the first move to make in this matter is to drill for water. Clark Drilling Co., at Estrous and the International Water Supply Company, Regina, are drillers in this area.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSenior Assistant Engineer.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It may be necessary to drill a companion gauge hole, similarly cased and screened in which to measure the drawdown and recovery, or if hole is not too deep, a pipe of small diameter can be set alongside the 2\" pipe and measurements taken in it.\n\nThe International Water Supply Limited state that they can go to a depth of 400 feet with this equipment.

We are of opinion that this type of well is more likely to provide an adequate water supply than can be secured by simple well drilling and casing.\n\nWith the installation of a Layne Gravel Wall type of well the International Water Supply Company would guarantee the development of a definite quantity of water for a set sum of money but this guarantee would be based on the results of preliminary test borings.\n\nThe International Water Supply Company recommends that a small test boring be sunk first to determine if any water-bearing formations exist at the school. Proper pumping tests at small capacity would determine the amount of water the formation would safely yield to a permanent well and samples of the water would determine if it were of potable quality. In drilling this preliminary test exploration boring they would use a small powered hydraulic rotary machine which drills a hole approximately 4\" in diameter. No casing is required unless a potential water-bearing formation is encountered. In this case, the hole is cased with 2\" diameter pipe and screen and a pumping test conducted to determine the specific capacity of the...\nof the formation. It may be necessary to drill a companion gauge hole, similarly cased and screened in which to measure the drawdown and recovery, or if hole is not too deep, a pipe of small diameter can be set alongside the 2\" pipe and measurements taken in it.\n\nThe International Water Supply Limited state that they can go to a depth of 400 feet with this equipment. They further state that the bed-rock marine shale series would be encountered above 600 feet in this area. Once the top of this shale series is reached it is useless to drill deeper in search of water since if any is encountered it would be too highly mineralized for use.\n\nThe International Water Supply Limited estimates the total cost of a 400 ft. test hole would be as follows:\n\nDrilling 400' @ $2.00 per ft. ......................... $800.00\nSetting casing, screen and test pump ............... 75.00\nDevelop and pump test well .......................... 150.00\nRemoval of casing & screen ........................... 50.00\nTransportation ........................................ 150.00\n\n$1,225.00\n\nAdditional test pumping if more than one water-bearing formation checked .................... 375.00\n\nAfter the results of the preliminary test boring are known the International Water Supply Limited would submit an estimate of the cost of a permanent gravel wall well.\n\nIt is recommended that we be authorized to engage the International Water Supply Limited to undertake one or more test borings as required on the terms outlined above and if sufficient water is available and quality suitable to have them quote on a Layne Gravel Wall well equipped with a Layne Deep Well Turbine pump.\n\nWill you kindly advise of your wishes in this matter.\n\nDirector.\n\nIndian Affairs.

M. Walker, District Engineer at Banff, Alta., when we are ready to start this work. Due to the very severe winter and wet spring that we have experienced out here, we have been delayed in some of our work. At present a test drilling machine is being moved to Radville, Sask., to do some test drilling for that Town. As soon as this work at Radville is completed we will start your work. This should be by the middle of May. If conditions at Radville should be such that it is difficult to move in that area, we will start your work within a week. In any event we will advise your Mr. Walker. Thanking you, we remain,\n\nYours truly,\n\nINTERNATIONAL WATER SUPPLY, LTD.\n\nBy: (Sgd) H.M. Hainstock,\nDistrict Manager.\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-5, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nThe Indian Agent reported that the Dominion and Provincial Analysts had condemned the water as being unfit for human consumption.\n\nIn order to correct the services inspected, major operations will be necessary along the following lines:\n\n1. Provide 2 new low pressure steam steel heating boilers, portable type with necessary protective devices to regulate water levels.\n2. Remove all steam and returns in basement and replace same with new material.\n3. Disconnect every radiator and if after a careful inspection any undue signs of sludge or scale are present replace.\n4. Remove all traps from mains and replace with proper type.\n5. Remove all traps from radiators and replace with new ones.\n6. Remove all boiler room piping.\n7. Remove and replace all Domestic hot water equipment including all piping.\n\nAll the above work should be executed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by this Service, and before same is undertaken, a sample of water should be submitted for analysis to enable us to determine the type and capacity of water softening equipment.\n\nThe above work has been roughly estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $21,500.00.\n\nBefore this work is undertaken, the existing difficulty of securing an adequate supply of water should be overcome. It is imperative that an uninterrupted supply of reasonably good water from a non-failing source, must be made available, otherwise the same trouble would eventually recur.\n\nIf any attempt were made to use questionable items of existing equipment in an effort to reduce the cost, the new work would be affected immediately and the initial saving from such action would soon be lost.\n\nWe concur with our Heating Engineer that all the above operations should be carried out at one time.\n\n[Signature]\n\nChief Engineer.\nOttawa, April 21st, 1947.\n\nMr. Hoey\n\nRe: Heating, Plumbing and Domestic Water Supply, Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nEnclosed for your information is a copy of a memorandum from Mr. Mills, dated April 10th, relative to the above, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIt will be noted that a rough estimate of the cost of the replacements recommended in this connection is $21,500.00. Mr. Mills states that before such work is undertaken there should be assurance of a non-failing supply of satisfactory water. This view is concurred in.\n\nYou will note from a copy of Mr. Mills' memorandum of April 18th that the International Water Supply Limited expect to start a test well at an early date.\n\nEncl.\n\nDirector.\nDiscussed 121-1-5 (WT 1) with Mr. Hargreaves & Mr. Phelan, May.

Do you consider that it is necessary to have this work done during the summer of 1947? If so, it will be necessary for us to request permission of the Minister to include the amount mentioned in the supplementary estimates, as we did not make provision for such a large expenditure for this school in our 1947-48 appropriation.\n\nI might add that we have just received a report from Mr. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies for the Province of Saskatchewan, and he reports that the school management obtained the impression from Mr. Hargreaves that unless repairs were done immediately, the school would have to be closed at the end of June. From your memorandum of April 21st we did not receive the impression that conditions were so serious.\n\nDirector.\n\nPP/HMD\nPUNNICHY, Sask.,\nApril 9, 1947.\n\nGORDON SCHOOL\n\nThis school caused me a lot of trouble the first two months of the quarter, but the last month things have been a little smoother and it has been unnecessary for me to visit it so often. Some time ago I forwarded a complete report on conditions in the school, but can't say if things have improved or not, but they look better on the surface. They have a manual training teacher at the school but he has not been able to do much along this line owing to the fact that they haven't very many tools to work with.\n\nThis school is certainly lacking in organized sports. However one of Principals, informed he was starting to do something along these lines.\n\nA lot of work will have to be done at this school or in my opinion it will be impossible to re-open it after the summer vacation. I would not like to take the responsibility to recommend that the equipment there go through another winter. If the heating system is put in first class shape for the September term, we should demand that an Engineer be put in charge, otherwise we will have to do this work over again within a year or so.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\n\nCopied:\nCS\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.\n\nWith reference to the man I hired to look after the water pipes at the Gordon school, Mr. H. Straker, I do not consider that his services will be required after the end of this month as there is no danger from frost now.\n\nR.S. Davis,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, May 5th, 1947.\n\nMr. R.S. Davis, Indian Agent,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, you may dispense with the services of Mr. H. Straker from the Gordon's Residential School when you consider such action advisable.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nOttawa, May 9th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDEPUTY MINISTER\n\nRe: Gordon's Indian Residential School, Touchwood Indian Agency, Province of Saskatchewan.\n\nAttached is a copy of a report from the Surveys and Engineering Branch with reference to extensive repairs required at the above mentioned school.\n\nThis morning the Superintendent of Welfare and Training had an interview with Dr. Alderwood, Secretary of the M.S.C.C., Mr. Ostrander, Inspector of Indian Agencies for Saskatchewan, and Mr. Hargreaves of the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nDuring the course of the discussion, Mr. Hargreaves pointed out the absolute necessity for making the changes suggested in the attached report at an approximate cost of $21,500.\n\nIn addition to the expenditure mentioned, Mr. Hargreaves and Inspector Ostrander agreed that it would be advisable to put eaves trough on the school and build a special tank to hold soft water which would only be used in operating the heating system.\n\nIn addition, it was also agreed that it would be advisable to install two boilers instead of one. With these additional improvements, the total expenditure will probably reach $35,000.\nThe situation is a very serious one, and in order to have this school in proper condition to reopen in the Fall, it is absolutely essential that the improvements mentioned above be carried out during the next four months.\n\nFunds for the above purpose were not specifically provided in the main appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, but I hope that the Minister will approve the expenditure and I intend to include the amount of $35,000. for the purpose in the supplementary estimates for the current fiscal year. Gordon's is a Government-owned school.\n\nPP/MEB\n\nDirector,\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-5, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMay 9th, 1947.\n\nMemorandum\n\nRe: Heating, Plumbing & Domestic Water Supply\nGordon's Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nIn connection with Mr. Hoey's memorandum of April 28th, 1947, bearing your notation of May 3rd with reference to the above, we comment as follows:\n\nThere is no doubt in our minds that the work outlined in our memorandum of April 10th, 1947 should be carried out this summer, but only on the condition that a reliable source of water is provided. The boiler could fail at any time, and if it were decided to risk operating this unit another winter, there is no standby boiler to take over, and there is no room to install one.\n\nThe International Water Supply Ltd., has been engaged to drill test holes and the work is to be undertaken as soon as possible. Failure to discover a satisfactory source of water coupled with a decision to attempt to carry on with the present heating equipment, could only result in the automatic closing of the School. This was the thought brought to the attention of the School Authorities by our Mr. Hargreaves on his recent visit.\n\nNot only is the boiler in a precarious state, but most of the piping and radiation is badly plugged with scale, sludge and other foreign matter, and we feel that nothing but trouble would result from an attempt to continue operations under these adverse circumstances.\n\nIt is again pointed out that the work involved in connection with the heating system would take 3 to 4 months to carry out, under favourable circumstances, and if the School is to be opened usual in September, this fact should not be lost sight of.\n\nOur officer was present at a meeting held in Mr. Neary's office on May 1st at which a full discussion took place, and all the salient facts were pointed out.\n\nChief Engineer.\n\nJ.M.

The best we could do would be to get a man from Winnipeg, and this would be costly.\n\nI understand the Department is putting in two boilers when the school is closed for the summer holidays and it is possible the steam fitters who will do this work, could install the chlorinator.\n\nThere is only about six weeks left in the school year and it is possible the soft water will hold out until that time.\n\nR.S.

This boiler leaks in numerous places and though attempts have been made to weld the cracks, it has not been possible to make a satisfactory job, and the leaks are becoming progressively worse. Regular blow-downs to remove scale and dirt cannot be carried out as the boiler is burnt thin in many places and is in danger of a complete collapse.\n\nThe piping system in the Basement is badly corroded and is full of scale, dirt and sludge. As a consequence, its area has been reduced so much that even when a pressure of 10 pounds per square inch is raised, the steam does not reach the ends of the mains and branches.\n\nMany radiators have been cracked and repairs have been attempted. Such repairs have not proved to be satisfactory. Radiators which have been removed were examined and found to be full of scale, dirt and sludge, and they cannot be cleaned. It naturally follows that most of the traps will be in such condition as to make them useless.\n\nThe domestic hot and cold water system was not too well designed originally. The storage tank and heating coil are too small and the heater is nearly burnt out. The piping in this system is also scaled and corroded, and the flow of water is retarded to such an extent as to make the system almost totally inadequate to serve the fixtures.\n\nExcessively hard water has been a major cause in these failures. Equally, the utter lack of even semi-skilled operating staff has contributed much to the failures. There is no evidence to show that even the most elementary maintenance had been carried out. The staff turnover has been frequent and it has been hard for the School Authorities to attract men with the minimum qualifications to take on this important post.\n\nMany other points were noted, and sufficient technical data was gathered to enable this Service to prepare plans and specifications to cover the necessary revisions.\nThe Indian Agent reported that the Dominion and Provincial Analysts had condemned the water as being unfit for human consumption.\n\nIn order to correct the services inspected, major operations will be necessary along the following lines:\n\n1. Provide 2 new low pressure steam steel heating boilers, portable type with necessary protective devices to regulate water levels.\n2. Remove all steam and returns in Basement and replace same with new material.\n3. Disconnect every radiator and if after a careful inspection any undue signs of sludge or scale are present replace same.\n4. Remove all traps from mains and replace with proper type.\n5. Remove all traps from radiators and replace with new ones.\n6. Remove all boiler room piping.\n7. Remove and replace all Domestic hot water equipment including all piping.\n\nAll the above work should be executed in accordance with plans and specifications prepared by this Service, and before same is undertaken, a sample of water should be submitted for analysis to enable us to determine the type and capacity of water softening equipment.\n\nThe above work has been roughly estimated to cost in the neighborhood of $21,500.00.\n\nIf any attempt were made to use questionable items of existing equipment in an effort to reduce the cost, the new work would be affected immediately and the initial saving from such action would soon be lost.\n\nWe concur with our Heating Engineer that all the above operations should be carried out at one time.\n\n(Signed) T.S.

With these additional improvements, the total expenditure will probably reach $35,000.\nThe situation is a very serious one, and in order to have this school in proper condition to reopen in the Fall, it is absolutely essential that the improvements mentioned above be carried out during the next four months.\n\nFunds for the above purpose were not specifically provided in the main appropriation for the fiscal year 1947-48, but I hope that the Minister will approve the expenditure and I intend to include the amount of $35,000. for the purpose in the supplementary estimates for the current fiscal year.

Ostrander, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nRegina, Sask.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 16th instant, file 913-312-11 ACE, and enquiring concerning the possibilities of obtaining heating boilers on transfer, will you please advise the size of boilers you had in mind.\n\nFor your information, we have periodically declared surplus heating units, including boilers, in both hangars and link trainer buildings. The boilers are usually of the same sizes in all hangars and the same applies with respect to link trainer buildings. Therefore, you might be able to ascertain whether or not these two sizes would be suitable for your purposes, and we, in turn, could advise you prior to our recommendation they be declared surplus to our requirements.\n\nYours truly,\n\nSgd. E. Hickson)\nDistrict Inspector, Central Airways.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines & Resources, OTTAWA.\n\nIf the boiler has not yet been purchased for the Gordon's Indian Residential School I would suggest writing to Mr. E. Hickson, District Inspector, Central Airways, 808 Confederation Life Building, Winnipeg.\n\nEnclosed herewith is copy of a letter which I have received from him in reply to an enquiry of mine. Something should be done very soon about the installation of the boiler and renewal of the radiators and connections at the Gordon's Indian Residential School. Also, a definite decision should be made as to the development of the spring, regarding which Mr. Mitchell has reported to his Branch, that is the Surveys and Engineering Branch.\n\nIt was my recommendation that a deep well be sunk near the school to whatever depth is necessary to secure an adequate supply of water. The Surveys and Engineering Branch received information that a well had been sunk in that vicinity to a depth of 385 ft., I believe, and they were informed that no water had been struck, and there was very little indication that water would be found before reaching bedrock, which might be 700 or 800 ft. In view of this information they decided it was inadvisable to proceed with the sinking of the well. Mr. Mitchell therefore explored the possibility of developing a spring which is about 1\u00bd miles from the school. This may be found to be a satisfactory solution and a suggestion to this effect was made by me about two years ago but it was not taken very seriously by anyone.\n\nIf the Surveys and Engineering Branch spend the rest of the summer trying to decide which should be done nothing will be done and the school cannot be opened for the next term.\n\nJ.P.B.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMy dear Sir,\n\nMr. Attwood, the Principal of Ponoka Indian Board School, in the Leduc County, informed me the other day that it was possible that new plans might be considered, making an entirely new building, instead of adding to the old one. I told him that the present site was selected against my wish, as I did not approve of the school being in an Indian Reserve, and that I wanted it built in the reserve land that the Agency Buildings are on at Kainai, which is besides being at a distance from any Reserve, the most central site in the Leduc County. He asked me to do everything possible in order that my suggestion might be carried out, as it would cost both him and his staff, work in two if it could be done. I have written to Mr. Bishop of the Appellate, and now to you. In favor of my suggestion I may perhaps be excused if I point out some of the advantages of the change, especially, as you, I believe, have no personal knowledge of this Agency. In the first place, as you are perhaps aware, one of the principal burdens of the staff is; that they have to be in guard, night and day, trying to prevent immorality, and generally even then generally more or less unsuccessfully. If the school was where I suggest it could be fenced with a good fence, and certain rules without the consent of elders.\n\nAugust 24th 1915\n\nJ.

(Which I believe most unnecessary until the buildings are worse than at present, and also inadvisable as taking Indians near town, where they go there too often for their own good already.) The Principal would be able to appeal to the Agent ad nauseam, in a breach of discipline case, if he dealt with while the facts were fresh in the Indians' mind. Thirdly, I understand that it is contemplated to build new Punnichy Reserve. Although the present School would be larger than required, the cost of new buildings could be saved by using it. As I am at present the only Member of the School Committee in office, I thought it advisable to write direct and bring you with the facts, etc., and am,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

It is now proposed to exchange the two quarter sections which the Church of England owns for two quarter sections adjacent to the school to be used as farm lands. It seems to me that this is a good proposition, but the two quarter sections to be surrendered by the Indians should include the site of the boarding school building. You will note on plan which was received under cover of letter of January 10th, 1911, the location of the boarding school. The new boarding school will be on the same site as the old.

For the purpose of carrying out the exchange mentioned in your memorandum of the 23rd May 1914 a surrender was obtained from the Indians of the E.1/2, Sec.3, Tp.27, R.17, W.2.M., in the Gordon Indian reserve. The school buildings are situated near the East side of this half section.\n\nThis land has never been surveyed; the request is to have the half-section regularly laid out and posted and it appears from the letter from the Secretary of the Synod, 14th Oct. 1916, that a portion of this half-section on which the school buildings stand is to be excluded from the proposed exchange. Mr. Orr's letter to Agent W.

By astronomical observations this was found to be two minutes out in azimuth. We found on retracing the east boundary of Sec.4 of this Tp. that it was mounded and we accepted them as correct.\n\nThe School land begins at a point 10 chains north and 5 chains west of the quarter section corner on the east boundary of section 3, thence west (3 & 1/3) eight and one third chains, thence north (\"12\") twelve chains, thence east (8 1/3) eight and one third chains, thence south (\"12\") twelve chains to the place of beginning containing by measurement \"10\" ten acres more or less.\n\nOur meridian lines are all run due north but the azimuths are referred to the central meridian as 0 or 360 degrees in accordance with the Dominion Lands System of survey.\n\nI enclose herewith a sketch of the said properties showing Road allowance running between the two quarters, but the Reverend Sup't Atwater expressed no disapproval of the same as the regularly travelled and graded road runs a short distance west of the School property.\n\nI have the honour to be, Sir,\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nD.L.S.\n\nIndian Affairs.

You may note that the instructions sent you dated 26th June last, state that the area of the school property should not be less than ten acres; if necessary, this area may be exceeded to a moderate extent in order to give the property a frontage on the highway. It may also be possible to make the length of the property from North to South less than twelve chains. Be good enough to give this matter your attention with the view of affording this property the desired frontage.\n\nYour obedient servant,\nT.D. Green Esq., D.L.S.,\nRegina Beach,\nSask.\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\nSir,\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 7th of August last. I imagined I had replied to that long ago but I have just discovered my reply here among other papers on the Gordon Res. file, dated 20th Augt. 1918, as follows:\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of yours of the 7th inst. in re Road frontage of School property on Gordon's Ind. Res.\n\nIn the survey of this School property I was guided by:\n1. An area of ten (10) acres,\n2. No boundary to be nearer than 66 feet to any building,\n3. The Rev. Sup't Atwalai's wish to include a high and dry building site, as he expects to erect or have erected a new School building in the near future.\n\nAt present by courtesy, the travelled road passes through this School land and immediately in front of the School building, but the graded road as (I am informed by Agent Munson) guaranteed by the Indians passes some 20 chains to the west of the School.\nI did not locate and survey a road to and from the school as I was under the impression that the Church and School property were practically one and the same\u2014merely under different Committees; and the East boundary of the School land is only five (5) chains from the road allowance between sections two (2) and three (3) and the production thereof northward in accordance with the surrender.\n\nOn consultation with Agent Morrison, it was decided a mere waste of time to \"lay out\" and post the road allowances mentioned in the surrender because it is an impractical road location; and moreover, as previously mentioned, the guaranteed road through the Church property.\n\nIt is impossible to give the section land a road frontage and conform with the three foregoing conditions.\n\nIf such a road, as you suggest, is necessary for the school, I beg to recommend that the Church and School Committees of the Church of England be requested to decide on a road or lane location for the School. I have the honour to be, sir,\n\nyour obedient servant\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is only a question now of getting the land surveyed so that it can be described for title.

When the school was built\u2014situated on the old site\u2014we had land broken and cropped on quarters belonging to the Synod immediately adjoining the buildings, but now that we are on the new site, which is over a mile from the old situation, it is too far for us to carry on this work effectively.\n\nThe new site is eminently fitted for clearing and breaking a considerable acreage for garden and farming purposes, and it is important that such work should be undertaken as early as possible in the spring of the year so that the land may be cleared, broken and backset within the one season. If this can be done and the work commenced as early as possible in the coming spring, the ground would be in good condition for garden crops the following year.\n\nWe shall be very grateful if you will kindly give consideration to this matter as the garden produce is a most important factor in the\nmaintenance of the school.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Edwin H. Knowles\"\n\nSecretary of Synod.\nSir,\n\nI beg to enclose, herewith, a copy of a letter, dated the 14th inst., addressed to me by the Venerable E. H. Knowles, in which a request is made that at least fifty acres be cleared and broken for garden and farming purposes at the new Gordon's Indian Boarding School at Punnichy, Sask., which institution was built on its present site owing to the fact that water was not obtainable in the immediate vicinity of the old site. I shall be glad to have the instructions of the Department.\n\nI am not sure what the cost of clearing the land would be, but if the matter is left in my hands, should the request be granted, I will have the work done as quickly and economically as possible.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.

Graham\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOnt.\nOttawa, March 27, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 312-11 of the 19th instant, enclosing a copy of a communication from the Archdeacon of the Church of England, Diocese of Qu'Appelle, requesting that the Department make a grant for the purpose of clearing 50 acres at the Gordon's Indian Boarding School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that our funds are so limited that I hesitate to incur any expense in this connection. The farm used in the past at the Gordon's School will have to be utilized for garden purposes, until such time as the school authorities can arrange to clear a new plot.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nOttawa, April 16, 1923.\n\nSir:\n\nIn March, last, Mr. Commissioner Graham forwarded a request from Archdeacon Knowles, Regina, for a grant to clear and break at least 50 acres at the new site of the Gordon's Indian Boarding School. At that time our funds were limited, and we informed the Commissioner that we hesitated to incur any expense in this connection and that the farm used in the past at this school would have to be utilized this season for garden purposes.\n\nHis Lordship the Bishop of Qu'Appelle visited the Department today and requested that we undertake the expense of having the above acreage cleared and broken near the site of the new school.\n\nI have to request that you will furnish a report of the work that would be required to place this land in a state fit for cultivation, as well as the approximate cost of the labour. Kindly give this matter your prompt attention and inform the Department as soon as possible, in order that, if funds can be provided, we can authorize having the work done in time for this season's crop.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

I have the honour to report that the Gordon School stands in a clearing of approximately 20 acres, the balance of the 50 acres in immediate vicinity is heavy poplar of 4'-8' diameter.\n\nTo plow up & get into a fit state of cultivation the land immediately around the School, i.e., the 20 acres would cost $120.00. If scrubbing & clearing is to be undertaken of the bush it would cost in the neighbourhood of $30.00 an acre.\n\nIt is too late to get any of the land ready for this year crop, but the 20 acres referred to could be put under cultivation ready for next year.\n\nI may say that the School has 63 acres in crop this coming year on Church property about one mile from the present site.\n\nI have the honour to be\n\nSir\n\nYour Obedient Servant\n\nThe Secretary\nDept of Indian Affairs\nOttawa Ont\n\nIndian Affairs.

I am convinced that some land near the buildings should be cleared this fall and I should be pleased if you would arrange to clear and plough five acres without delay. Please make the most economical arrangements you can in this connection.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nW. M.

I do not think it wise to do anything more than this stumping until Spring, and this work can well be done by the school, as they have their own oxen, and I understood from the Principal that he was going to have the work done.\n\nI hope no promise has been made to the Bishop that work will be done this Fall.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nW.

We note your recommendation that no further clearing be done until the land already cleared is stumped and plowed, and that the work of stumping can be done by the school and the plowing performed in the spring.

There are approximately 75 or 80 acres clear and possibly a further 20 acres of small scrub that could be easily cleared. Of the clear land 50 acres have been cultivated in the past, but have now gone back as nothing has been done on it for 8 or 9 years. This land is claimed by the Pratt family, but they have more land in another part of the reserve which will keep them busy for a long time to come.

I wish to refer to your letter of September 24, 1926, the Department's letter of the 29th idem and your answering communication of the 6th of October. Are you in a position, now, to recommend that steps be taken to have the East \u00bc of Section 10 and all of Section 11 surrendered for school purposes?\n\nI understand that the church has title to the N. E. \u00bc of Section 3 and the N. W. \u00bc of Section 2. You might ascertain if it is their intention to use these parcels, also, for school purposes.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA.

Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of Department letter 121-1-9 of the 27th ultimo, with reference to additional land required by the Gordon's School. This school is the property of the Department and it does not appear to me that title to the lands in question should be conveyed to the school. All that is required is that the land be set aside for their use, and in this connection I may say that it is their intention to use the land already held by them, for school purposes, in addition to that which they are now asking for. I understand that a surveyor will be in this vicinity this summer, and I would be glad if the Department would instruct him, before leaving Ottawa, to proceed to Gordon's School and define the area of the lands which they desire, as this land has not yet been surveyed. I do not think there is any urgency about this.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, April 16, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A C.E. of the 10th instant, with reference to the land to be set aside for the use of the Gordon's Indian Residential School. It was not the intention to convey land to the school but to get a surrender of the Band for school purposes. With reference to a survey of the property, I am not sure that the departmental surveyor, who is in the West this year, will have time for this work. The matter will not be overlooked, however.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nNovember 7, 1930.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Buskard,\n\nWith reference to your verbal inquiry, I beg to say that Mr. William Swan, Architect, of Punnichy, Sask., a returned soldier, was appointed as Inspector of Construction for the Gordon's Indian school, in the Touchwood Agency, Sask., when it was built in 1921, his appointment being made by the Civil Service Commission. The school was burned and rebuilt in 1929. When the contract was let and the work to be gone on with we wrote to the Civil Service Commission, advising them that we would require an Inspector of Construction and that, if possible, we would like to have Mr. William Swan appointed, as he was employed during the building of the original school and his services were very satisfactory; they issued a temporary certificate in his favour for six months, from October 27, 1929, at a salary of $6.00 a day. This was renewed for a further period of six months, as the work on the Gordon's school had not yet been completed.\n\nIn June, 1930, a contract was let for the Muscowequan Indian residential school and, as Mr. Swan's certificate was still current and the Gordon's school almost completed, we decided to utilise his services in connection with the Muscowequan's school and he was so advised on June 23, 1930. When his certificate expired on October 27 we requested the Civil Service Commission to renew it for a further period of six months, which they have done, but they requested that we obtain the authority of His Excellency the Governor General in Council for the continuance of the position as a temporary one. Under Section 40 of the Civil Service Regulations this is necessary if the employment covers a longer period than twelve months.\n\nThe Muscowequan's school and the Gordon's school are both in the Touchwood Indian agency and in the electoral district of Last Mountain.\n\nIndian Affairs.

In addition, the grounds have been well laid\nout under a well prepared plan so that the frontage\nnow bears an entirely different appearance. The cost\nof this work has necessarily been heavy and the\nCommissioner has advised me that he is applying to\nthe Department for a special grant of $475.00 to assist\nthe Diocese in the many improvements made which may be\nvalued at least $2000.00.

The Principal has entirely changed the appearance and surroundings by providing gravel roads, planting trees, &c., &c., and by so doing has made the whole property a credit to both the Indian Department and the Church in the Diocese.\n\nThese substantial improvements in the grounds have been brought about at an expenditure of between at least $1400 and $1500. At the time these changes were being made the Indian Commissioner promised substantial financial assistance, and I feel I can justly ask for at least half the sum expended in payment of the costs. When I was last in Ottawa I ventured to bring this appeal to the notice of Mr. Ferrier, and the Department may rest assured the Bishop would not ask for this assistance if it were not merited and needed.\n\nI enclose a photograph of the children of Gordon's Indian Residential School assembled outside the old Church of St. Luke on the Reserve.\n\nI am,\n\nSincerely yours,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

And that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Department.\n\nSigned on behalf of the Executive Committee:\n\n[Signature]\n\nBishop\n\nE. H. Knowles\n\nSecretary of Synod.\nSeptember 2nd, 1932.\n\nDear Bishop Harding,\n\nI have Your Lordship's Letter of the 25th ultimo, embodying a resolution of the Executive Committee of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle regarding the work undertaken by the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School in constructing a road at the entrance to the school, and requesting that this Department provide the sum of $750.00 towards the cost of this work.\n\nIn reply I have to say that we have no funds available in this year's Appropriation for this purpose. A note will, however, be made to include the amount in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year for submission to Parliament at its next regular session.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n[Signature]\nActing Deputy Superintendent General.\n\nRt. Rev. M. T. McA. Harding, D.D.,\nBishop of Qu'Appelle,\nSynod House, Bishop's Court,\nRegina, Sask.\nDear Sir;-\n\nIn reference to the deserted day school building formerly known as the Gordon School, located approximately about the centre of property marked as C.of E. property on the enclosed blue print, I have the honor to say that I am in receipt of a letter from His Lordship, the Bishop of Qu'Appelle, stating that he considers it would be of the best interest of the Indians and their children if this place is converted into a Mission Hall. There are many reasons why this building should be so used, and I know of no reason why it should not be.\n\nBishop Harding thinks the Diocese might grant $300.00 towards rebuilding this old place to make it habitable, but this sum would be insufficient, and he requests that the Department make a grant of $250.00 extra which would go towards the demolition of the stone part of the old school building and for material required in the fitting up of the frame part of the old school.\n\nThe old building is a source of danger as it is.\n\nSumming up I would be obliged if the Department will consider giving the old building to the Diocese, obtain a grant as requested, and transfer title from any small plot of land there to the Diocese.\n\nKindly let me have the blue print back with any information regards any land which surrounds the school, I hear we own 10 acres of it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Agent,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, 3rd April 1935\n\nMemorandum\n\nHerewith is a blueprint of school lot surveyed by T.D.

E. \u00bc of Section 3 and the N. W. \u00bc of Section 2 were patented to the Diocese of Qu'Appelle some years ago, with the exception of approximately ten acres on which the former Gordon's Residential School was located. Enclosed is a tracing of this plot, also the plan which you forwarded.\n\nI note that the Diocese is prepared to expend $300 towards converting the old building into a Mission Hall providing the Department allows an amount of $250. I regret that, as our funds for the current fiscal year have been considerably reduced, it will not be possible for the Department to grant the amount requested.\n\nPlease let me know the size and condition of each building located on the ten acre plot mentioned above. You should, also, state what you consider this land is worth. On receipt of this information, the Department may be prepared to favourably consider relinquishing this lot to the Diocese of Qu'Appelle but, as stated above, we have no funds available for the rebuilding of the old school.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This site consists of the east half of Section 10 and all of Section 11; T. 27; R. 17; W. 2nd.\n\nIn replying to that letter on July 22nd, 1921, Mr. Graham stated that he had not the slightest doubt that the Indians would hand over the land to the Department gratis, but he suggested that the matter be allowed to stand for the time being. No further action was taken in this matter until 1926 and, on September 24th of that year, Mr. Graham again wrote the Department stating that no formal surrender had so far been taken and requesting instructions.\n\nIn official letter of September 29th, 1926, he was requested to supply a statement showing the exact site of the building and to make a recommendation as to what section should be set aside for the use of the school. He replied by letter dated October 6th, 1926, which reads, in part, as follows:\n\n\"I would ask the Department to let this matter stand in abeyance until I next visit the school, when I will go thoroughly over the ground and again submit a recommendation to you. I do not anticipate any difficulty from the Indians insofar as obtaining their consent to take over all the pasture land which will be required for school purposes.\"\n\nIn a letter dated April 10th, 1928, Mr. Graham requested that one of the Department's surveyors be instructed to survey the\n\nW.

The frame part is in fair shape, it consists of two rooms, upper and lower with a stairway.\n\nFarm land in the vicinity is assessed at from $9.00 to $12.00 per acre. There have been no recent sales of land in this district so no present value can be more than a guess, probably $10.00 an acre if required badly would cover it, though as the place is very stony it has no value for farming purposes and nominal value of $10.00 for the whole place might be named if it were just being transferred.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe north east 1/4 Sec. 3 p. 27 R. 17 W 2 m. in Gordon Reserve was surrendered on 4th July 1914.\n\nThe school site, containing ten acres and a road for access thereto from the east boundary of Section 3, containing five tenths of an acre, were kept in the patent to the Synod of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle.\n\nThese parcels could now be transferred to the Church without a further surrender from the band!\n\nDecember 1st July 1914 consent\n\nthe whole E/2 sec 3 without accepting the parcel which the H.S. reserved in issuing Patent\n\nH.R. 22/4/33\nOttawa, April 24th, 1933.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to refer you to official letter of the 6th instant, with which was enclosed a copy of the Department's letter to Mr. Agent Waddy.

The matter was taken up very fully. There were forty-two voting members of the Band present at the meeting, and fifteen absentees.\n\nAfter discussing the matter fully and carefully, the Indians unanimously agreed to set aside the North East Quarter of Section Two, the South East Quarter of Section Ten, the South Half of Section Eleven, and Eighty acres, being the South Half of the North East Quarter of Section Eleven, all in Township 27, Range 17, West of the 2nd Principal Meridian.\n\nThe only conditions asked by the Band were that any Indian whose residence may be upon the said released lands should receive compensation to enable him to remove his buildings, and that they should be compensated for any improvements which they had made thereon, at a fair valuation, to be arrived at by mutual agreement, and further, that a road from Francis Cyr's house, which runs through the South East quarter of Section Ten to the main highway running through the said quarter section, shall be preserved for the use of the Indians of the Band. This is their main outlet from the West side of the reserve.\n\nI looked over the ground, and as near as I could judge where the lines ran, find that the only resident on that quarter section was George Pratt, whose buildings could be removed, I estimate, at a cost of about $100.00.\n\nThere are eighteen acres under cultivation on this quarter, which is being used, and has been for some time, by the school. There appeared to be some doubt as to who should receive compensation for this, but this is a matter which can be inquired into more fully by the Agent.\n\nThe Secretary\n\nDept. of Indian Affairs\n\nOttawa.\nThe School had asked in the first instance that all of Section Eleven be set aside for school purposes. Upon inquiring into the matter, one of the Indians stated that his hay grounds were situated on the North East Quarter of Section Eleven. I therefore did not take that quarter into consideration, but they were quite willing to set aside the North East Quarter of Section Two, which I know has more open land suitable for cultivation than the North East Quarter of Eleven.\n\nI also found objections to releasing the North Half of the North West Quarter of Section Eleven. The Indians stated, and correctly so, that their main road from the West and South sides of the Reserve, to the East and North sides, had for years passed through this quarter section, and if it were closed to them it would cause them great inconvenience.\n\nThey also complained that the School had been cultivating an old field which belonged to the deceased Josiah Pratt, whose son is residing on this piece of land, and who should rightfully have the benefit of this field.\n\nAfter discussing the matter fully with the Indians, I had a conversation with the Venerable Archdeacon Knowles, and informed him regarding the lands the Indians were in favour of releasing for school purposes. Archdeacon Knowles expressed his satisfaction, and stated that in his opinion the Indians had been very generous to the School. I therefore had the Indians vote on the question, and I am submitting herewith surrender forms, in duplicate, duly completed, together with a declaration of myself, the Chief and the councillors, and a list showing the voting members of the Band, and the result of the vote. The Indians did not ask for any compensation for these lands. The only matter they wished to be assured about was that the land would be used for the benefit of the School only, and should the department at any time discontinue the Residential School on their reserve, that the land would not be used for other purposes, but would revert to them.\n\nI am enclosing the Township Plan, with the released lands marked thereon.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison,\nInspector\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\nSir:\n\nReferring to your letter No. 121-1-9, dated the 24th ultimo, in connection with the old Gordon's School plot, comprising ten acres in the N.E.\u00bc of Section 2, Tp. 27-Rge. 17, W. 2nd Meridian in the Gordon's Reserve, I have to report that this quarter section, together with the N.W.\u00bc of Section 2-27-17, were surrendered on July 4th, 1914, in exchange for the East Half of Section 4-27-17, which had been patented to the Church of England.\n\nI took the matter up with the Indians of the Gordon's Band on the 17th instant, and they unanimously voted in favour of transferring the ten acres, comprising the old school plot, to the Church. They stated that they had received a full half-section from the Church, and it was only but fair that the Church should receive an equal amount of land.\n\nAlthough the Department did not say it was necessary, I obtained a surrender of this ten acres, which I am forwarding herewith in duplicate, duly completed, with the usual declaration, and list of voters attached, and trust you will find all in order.\n\nWith reference to the buildings on this plot, the old stone school is still standing. The roof is in a badly dilapidated and dangerous condition, and I arranged with the Indians to have this taken down without expense, and informed them that they could have whatever lumber they were able to salvage from the roof. The windows, interior floors, joists, in fact everything in the shape of lumber within the school has been removed, and as the roof stands at present it is a menace, and I, therefore, ordered it removed.\n\nThe frame addition referred to is only in fair condition. The windows have all been removed, and Agent Waddy informed me that he has them on hand. This might be handed over for Church purposes without charge.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. Murison\nInspector\nSaskatchewan Inspectorate.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\nMemo.\n\nMr. MacInnes,\n\nPlease prepare memorandum to Council accepting surrender hereunder, in duplicate, given by the Gordon Band of Indians, in the Touchwood Agency, of certain lands in the Reserve to be set aside for the use and benefit of the Gordon's Indian Residential School. The lands surrendered for this purpose are as follows:\n\nThe N. E. \u00bc of Sec. 2, the S. E. \u00bc of Sec. 10, the S. \u00bc of Sec. 11 and the S. W. \u00bc of Sec. 11, all in Tp. 27, Rge. 17, W. 2 M.\n\nThese lands have been surrendered by the Band for the use of the Residential School, and subject only to the condition that nominal compensation shall be arranged and paid in due course to any member of the Band having improvements in cultivation or in buildings on any of the lands surrendered. This phase of the situation will be attended to later on.\n\nDirector.\nOttawa, May 31, 1933.\n\n181-1-9\n\nHis Excellency\n\nThe Governor General in Council.\n\nThe undersigned has the honour to submit herewith surrender, in duplicate, together with voters' lists and affidavits, given on the 17th day of May, 1933, by the Gordon's Band of Indians, in the Touchwood Indian Agency, in the Province of Saskatchewan, of parcels of land containing by admeasurement seven hundred and twenty acres, more or less, more particularly described as follows:\n\nThe North-East Quarter of Section Two, the South-East Quarter of Section Ten, the South half of Section Eleven, and eighty acres being the South-Half of the North-West Quarter of Section Eleven, all being in Township Twenty-seven, Range Seventeen, West of the Second Principal Meridian.\n\nThe said surrender has been given by the said band in order that the said lands may be made available for the use of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, subject to the conditions contained therein.\n\nThe said surrender has been duly authorized, executed and attested in the manner required by the 51st Section of the Indian Act, and the undersigned would accordingly recommend that the same be accepted by Your Excellency in Council, the original surrender to be returned to the Department of Indian Affairs and the duplicate thereof to be kept of record in the Privy Council Office.\n\nSuperintendent General of Indian Affairs.\nMay 31, 1933.\n\nTo recommend that authority be granted for the surrender of parcels of land containing seven hundred and twenty acres, by the Gordon's Band of Indians, Touchwood Indian Agency, Sask., pursuant to the provisions of Section 51 of the Indian Act.\n\nThe said surrender has been given by the said band in order that the said lands may be made available for the use of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, subject to the conditions contained therein.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

I have advised the Venerable Archdeacon Knowles to that effect.\n\nI may advise the department that it will be necessary to have George Pratt, a member of the Band who is residing on this land, remove his buildings at once as the Church Authorities desire the location he has his buildings on for the purpose of erecting a residence for their resident clergyman. I have taken the matter up with Agent Waddy who informs me that this will entail an expenditure of $100.00. This agrees with the estimate I made when on the ground last spring and which I mentioned in my letter to you dated May 22nd last.

Farm, of some thoroughbred Holstein cows, which took place in this City last week. He asked me to make the purchase for him, and stated that he would be able to make payment for these cattle out of his next quarter's earnings.\n\nAs the deal was cash, I would be glad if you would send me an advance of $35.00, being the amount due, so that I can keep my word with the C.P.R. Farm, and deduct same from the next quarter's grant to the school. Mr. Atwater requested me to have this done.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, November 25, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your No. 312-11A of the 21st instant, requesting that an advance of $835.00 be sent to enable the Principal of the Gordon's Indian Residential School to make payment for some thoroughbred Holstein cows which he recently purchased at a sale by the C.P.R. farm.\n\nIn reply I beg to say that a cheque for the above amount is being sent to the Secretary of the Synod of the Diocese of Qu'Appelle, Regina, as it is necessary that all cheques in payment of the per capita grant be sent him. The above advance is made on the earnings of the school for the current quarter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to inform you that the School Authorities at the Gordon School in the Touchwood Agency have made application to have the following assistance in the way of equipment,-\n\n2 Wagons\n1 Gang Plow\n1 Walking Plow\n1 Disc Harrow\n3 Sets Work Harness\n6 Work horses\n6 Axes\n6 Rakes\n6 Hoes\n\nWhen this school was handed over to the church authorities, the equipment on hand at the old school was practically all gone. They have had no assistance from the Government in the way of equipment, and I think their request is a just one and that they should be treated as other schools, viz:- St. Paul's, who were in better shape than Gordon's in the way of equipment, the R.C.School on the same reserve who were also in better shape, and other schools where assistance has been granted.\n\nI would strongly recommend that funds be found to meet the request of this school, as they are greatly handicapped and have no funds with which to buy equipment.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nM. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, July 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 312-11A of the 15th instant, with reference to agricultural equipment and work horses for the Gordon's Indian Residential School. I regret that there are no funds at present for this purpose and any assistance the Department can give in this connection will have to be at a later date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner,\nRegina, Sask.\nSir:\n\nI beg to ask the Department if it is at all possible to supply four horses for use at the Gordon Residential School, at a cost of $300.00. This school has not, in my opinion, had anything like the assistance that has been given to other schools. The Principal is labouring under great disadvantages which make it very hard to carry on. Canon Irwin, the newly appointed Principal, is doing well, and there has been a great improvement in the school proper, but the outside work is in bad shape as a result of not having anything to work with. If you could authorize me to purchase four head of work horses and two sets of harness it would be doing a good work. The Canon in a letter to me today says, - \"I am completely up against it for hauling coal, and cannot afford to hire a drayman from the town.\" Of course he cannot hire a drayman from the town; the grant would not begin to provide for this. Horses are cheap and I think we should give this man an opportunity to carry on the outside work of the school efficiently, by providing him with the necessary horses.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. M. Graham,\nIndian Commissioner.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nNovember 2, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nDr. Scott,\n\nIn the summer, Mr. Commissioner Graham recommended the purchase of stock and agricultural equipment for the use of the Gordon's Indian Residential School, which institution has had very little assistance from the Department in this connection. At that time the request was not favourably entertained.

It is noted that you estimate the cost of supplying the horses to be $300, and this amount should not be exceeded. You should see that a good type of work horse, in sound condition, is obtained.\n\nPlease forward certified vouchers, in duplicate, in the usual manner, covering the expenditure incurred in the purchase of the horses and two sets of harness.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

We understand that these horses are required in order to properly carry out the outside work in connection with the school. Mr. Commissioner Graham will, no doubt, arrange for the supplying of the horses and harness at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev. Canon J.

Irwin\nPrincipal.\nDear Sir,\n\nI am taking the liberty of writing to you about a matter which is worrying me considerably. I have several times asked Commissioner Brown to try to obtain permission from the Department for me to buy three teams of horses and three wagons and bob sleighs. We have been very much handicapped all this summer for want of equipment and have practically no land ready for next spring. On August 7th I received a letter from the Commissioner telling me that he had taken this matter up with the Department and that they had advised him that there were no funds available at that time. He also told me in conversation that the Department did not make a practice of helping in this way.\n\nWe are facing very cold weather and as you know we are over seven miles from town and have not got a team that is able to draw a load of coal and the only wagon I have has broken down several times.\n\nThere are several auction sales listed near here during the present month and I feel sure I could purchase horses at a very\nreasonable price \u2014 about $175.00 a team, the horses weighing about 1400 lbs. The first sale is to be on November 14th, and there are three teams listed which would suit me very well.\n\nI have enquired the total cost of what is absolutely necessary at the present time and find it is as follows:\n\n- Swaggons complete $161.00 each wholesale 483.00\n- Sleighs $46.75 each wholesale 140.25\n- Teams of horses $175.00 each 525.00\n\n$1148.25\n\nMight I respectfully ask you to come to my assistance in this matter as during the recent very cold weather we were suffering here for want of coal.

As you were informed on the 3rd instant, Mr. Commissioner Graham has been authorized to purchase two teams with harness. I regret that this is all the assistance that can be allowed at the present time, as our funds are extremely limited. You should look to the Church authorities for whatever wagons and sleighs are absolutely necessary. I shall try to place an item in our Estimates for the coming fiscal year, so that more comprehensive assistance can be given to you.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C.

I would be glad to know if the Department will authorize me to purchase a wagon at a cost of $142.55, F.O.B.

The equipment is all run down and the horse power is not what it should be, and he is going to have a difficult time for a couple of years to get things in the shape they should be in. However, I may inform you that he has taken on a first-class man as Farming Instructor, a man who has held prominent positions in an agricultural way here in Saskatchewan, and it was a great surprise to me that he was able to get a man of this type. This man, however, is greatly handicapped in not having the proper things to work with.

Since he has taken over he has improved conditions as far as farming goes as he has put in more crop and done some summerfallow, and if given half a chance will no doubt make a success of it as he is very interested in his work and is very energetic. However it is very hard for a man of 57 to make over a position like this without previous experience, and in my opinion is a job for a younger man.\n\nThe education of the children is the same as it was before, absolutely no improvement has been made. This was one of the things I understood the Department was anxious to get rid of Mr. Frayling for. However, in my opinion, the children of this school have been, and are now receiving, as good an education as children in any other boarding school.\n\nConsiderable repairs are needed and will have to be done in the near future. However this school is in wonderful condition for the amount of money spent on it by the Department in the last 12 years. Anything that was done up to the present has been paid for mostly out of school grant. The new water tanks are on hand and will be installed as soon as I can get men to do the work.\n\nR.S.

The assistance now asked for is to be treated as a strictly capital expenditure to meet a situation largely created by war conditions, and we ask your favourable consideration of, and co-operation in this matter, to enable us to meet a situation which is a matter of the greatest concern, not only to the Indian Committee, but also to the Diocese as a whole.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nEdwin O.

This, I had an opportunity to do yesterday.\n\nYou are, no doubt, aware that it has never been the policy or practice of the department to purchase tractors and farm machinery for use at residential schools. The officials here hesitate to establish a precedent in this case. At the same time, we appreciate very fully the difficulties you are experiencing in the operation of the Gordon's Residential School. In view of this fact, I have asked the Chief of the Training Division to review the standing of the Institution in the hope that adjustments might be made in the payment of per capita grants or in the authorized pupilage. In addition to this, if tractors are available, we might by paying the regular per capita grant in advance, enable the Principal to proceed with the purchase of a tractor and the six-foot tiller combine. I am also asking Inspector Ostrander to investigate the land holdings at the school and to discuss with the Principal the best ways and means of bringing the land available under cultivation.\n\nRt.

This will permit you to pay immediately for any machinery purchased. The amount sent you would be taken off the per capita allowances in equal payments at the end of June, September and December 1946, and March 1947. For instance, if you applied for $2,000.00, we would send it in April 1946 and the amount of $500.00 would be deducted at the end of each of the following four quarters.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRight Rev.

We shall take action on this letter as you suggest.\n\nI am amazed to learn that the cattle referred to are recorded in that Association's books in the name of the Department of Mines and Resources. Our files indicate very clearly that all negotiations in connection with the purchase of these animals took place between this office, the Department of Justice and the Kingston Penitentiary. Nowhere in our files is there any record of the purchase being discussed with your Branch, and payment for this stock was made to the Penitentiary from our funds.\n\nI would also add that, before any action towards transfer of these cattle was taken, the economics of keeping cattle at Chapleau was discussed fully with your Mr. Arneil and we consulted the Veterinary Director General, Department of Agriculture, to make certain that there were no restrictions on transferring cattle from Chapleau to Punnichy.\n\nIf you do have some interest in these cattle which does not appear on our files, I would be glad if you would advise me so that we may keep the record straight.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nG.

I went for a walk around the barns and onto the highway and then came back to the school. I met Ernest Whitequill, Hubert Assoon, Warran Kay, and we went down towards the lake. We are not allowed to go near the lake, but I have been there several times before with other boys. When we arrived at the lake we saw three girls out on the water on a raft. They were Myrtle Moostoes, Mary Whitequill, and Margaret Bruce. Two of the girls were sitting on the raft and Myrtle Moostoes was using a pole to push the raft, and as we watched them one of the girls stood up and then fell into the water. We were about 100 yards from them when this happened. Right after this one of the other girls fell into the water and we then ran around to the edge of the lake and Ernest Whitequill called to the other girl on the raft to stay on the raft. This girl was Mary Quitequill, Ernest's sister. The wind blew the raft in towards the shore and Ernest Whitequill pulled the raft into the shore and his sister, Mary, got off, and went back to the school. The other two girls were still in the water and I ran up to the school and told Mrs. Daysh, the school matron, that the two girls were in the water. Mr. Wickenden came with me and I showed him the spot where I had last seen the girls in the water and we saw one of the girls still in the water. Mr. Wickenden then went into the water and pulled this girl out. This was Myrtle Moostoes, but there was no sign of the other girl. I was then sent back to the school for a swim suit for Mr. McLeod.\n\nSigned\n\nWilliam Favel.\nGordon's (Anglican) Indian Residential School,\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nJune 15th, 1947.\n\nErnest Whitequill, aged 14 years, student of Gordon's Indian School, Punnichy District, Sask.,\n\nOn Saturday, June 14th, 1947, at about 1.30 P.M. I met William Favel in the school yard, also Herbert Assoon and Warren Kay. We all went down towards the lake which is located at a quarter of a mile east of the school. When we arrived at the lake we saw three girls out on the water on a raft. Two girls were sitting down and one girl was pushing the raft with a pole. Myrtle Jane was pushing the raft, Margaret Bruce and my sister, Mary Whitequill, were sitting down on the raft. As we watched this raft one of the girls fell into the water, and then Myrtle Jane went into the water, and the other girl stayed on the raft. William Favel and I raced around the edge of the lake and told the other girl to stay on the raft. This girl stayed until it was blown to the edge of the lake and then I pulled it in to the shore and helped my sister off the raft. William Favel ran towards the school to tell Mr. Daysh that the other two girls were in the water and I brought my sister back to the school.\n\nSigned\n\nErnest Whitequill.\nGordon's (Anglican) Indian Residential School,\nPUNNICHY, Saskatchewan.\n\nJune 15th, 1947.\n\nI, Mabel Matchechuk, Treaty Indian, aged 14 years, student of Gordon's Indian School, Punnichy district, Saskatchewan, state as follows:\n\nOn Saturday, June 14th, 1947, I was working in the kitchen shortly after noon, and when I had finished my work I went out into the girls' playground. I met Joan Blind, aged 13 years, near the gate and asked her if she knew where Myrtle Moostocs was. Joan said, \"Maybe she is down by the lake\", and we both walked towards the lake, which is located about a quarter of a mile east of the school. When we arrived at the lake I saw three girls on a raft. They were: Myrtle Moostocs, Margaret Bruce, and Mary Whitequill. They were quite a way from the shore. Shortly after we arrived at the lake shore some boys came down and then William Favel came over and told us to come and tell the matron that the girls were in the water. Joan and I ran up to the school, but by the time we arrived William Favel had run to the school himself and both Joan and I went into the washroom. I have been down to the lake several times before with Myrtle Moostocs. I know that it is against the regulations for any of us girls to go near the lake, or to leave the playground without permission.\n\nSigned\n\nMabel Matchechuk.\nJune 15th, 1947.\n\nI, Joan BLIND, aged 13 years, student of Gordon's Indian School, Punnichy district, state as follows:\n\nOn Saturday, June 14th, 1947, I was working in the kitchen and when I had finished my work I went to the girls' playground. After I had been in the playground for about an hour, I was walking towards the gate to the girls' playground when I met Mabel Matchechuk, aged 14 years, who asked me if I knew where Myrtle Moostos was. I said \"Maybe Myrtle is down by the lake\", as Myrtle had been down by the lake before. Mable and I walked down to the lake and when we arrived Mabel saw three girls on a raft and said, \"There they are\", and when I looked the raft was quite a way out from the shore going in a north easterly direction. Several boys came down to the lake at this time and as we watched the raft we saw Myrtle jump off the raft and William Favel told us to come and tell Mrs. Daysh, the school matron. William Favel, however, came to the school himself, ahead of us, and told Mrs. Daysh, and we stayed at the school. I did not see Margaret Bruce leave the raft. I have been down to the lake about three times. I have been told by the school Matron, Mrs. Daysh, that I was not allowed to go near the lake, and also that I am not allowed to leave the girls' playground without permission.\n\nSigned\n\nJoan BLIND.\nGordon's (Anglican) Indian Residential School\n\nPunnichy, Saskatchewan.\n\nJune 15th, 1947.\n\nMary Whitequill, aged 12 years, student, states as follows:\n\nOn Saturday, June 14th, 1947, at about 1.00 P.M., I was in the girls' wash-room and Myrtle Moostoes came in and asked me to walk down to the lake with her. I started off with Myrtle Moostoes and Margaret Bruce, aged 10 years. The lake is on the east side of the school, and we arrived at this point and there was a raft made of gasoline drums near the pump house. Myrtle got on this raft, and Margaret and I took our stockings off and played around in the water for a short time. Myrtle then called to us to come and get on the raft, which we did. Myrtle then pushed the raft out into the water with a pole that was on the raft and we started off across the lake. We were going in a north-easterly direction. Myrtle then saw two girls coming from the school, and said: \"Let's hurry\" as she did not want any more girls on the raft. We then saw some boys coming towards the lake and Margaret said \"Let's jump off as they might throw stones at us\", and Margaret then jumped off the raft into the water. The water was too deep for Margaret at this point and Myrtle passed the pole towards her and told her to grab it. Margaret tried to reach the pole but could not do so. Myrtle then said, \"I will jump off and try and catch Margaret\", and Myrtle then jumped off the raft and let the stick go and I was on the raft by myself. Myrtle tried to swim but could not do so and she went down into the water, and was not able to get anywhere near Margaret. Margaret disappeared in the water. I sat still on the raft and the wind blew it towards the shore and when it arrived my brother, Ernest Whitequill, aged 13 years, pulled the raft in and I got off and walked back to the school.\n\nSigned\n\nMary Whitequill.\nDear Mr. Hoey:\n\nWith reference to my telegram of the 14th instant advising of the death of two Indian girl pupils of the Gordon's Indian Residential School by drowning, I wish to report as follows:\n\nAt approximately 4.00 P.M. Saturday, the 14th instant, while at the Fort Qu'Appelle Indian Hospital on other business, I received a telephone call from Dr. Golman at Punnichy, advising me of the death by drowning of two Indian girl pupils of the Gordon's Indian Residential School and asking me whether an inquest should be held. I informed him that in my opinion an inquest was very necessary and that he should make arrangements for same.\n\nI proceeded to the Gordon's School as soon as I had finished my business at the Fort Qu'Appelle Hospital. At the Gordon's School I talked to Reverend D.C. Wickenden and Mr. Mayo, joint acting Principals of the Gordon's School, also the engineer and Cpl. Playford, of the R.C.M. Police. Dr. Golman had been at the school and taken what action he considered necessary and returned to Punnichy, and I did not see him. Indian Agent Mr. R.S. Davis, and Mr. Evers, Clerk, were away at the Nut Lake Reserve paying Treaty and Mr. Davis did not get to the school until late in the evening. Enclosed are copies of statements of Mary Whitequill, Joan Blind, Mabel Matchecheuk, Ernest Whitequill, and William Pavel, all pupils of the school. The statements in question were given to Cpl. T.E. Playford, R.C.M. Police.\n\nThe two girls who had drowned are Myrtle Moostos, 16 years old, from the James Smith's Reserve, Duck Lake Agency, and Margaret Bruce, 11 years old, from the Bay Star Reserve, Touchwood Agency. Also with them on the raft was a third girl, Mary Whitequill, 11 years old, who was saved. Evidence at the inquest will probably reveal that these three girls were supposed to be playing in the girls' playground at the time. Apparently they, and possibly others, had left the playground unnoticed, crossed the road, proceeded through the garden and two fences down to the shore of the small lake which has been used to supply water for the school. There is evidence that they played on the shore of the lake a short time, then proceeded around the lake to where a raft was lying on the shore. Apparently they played on the shore of the lake a short time, then they pushed the raft out on the water and boarded it. There was a fairly high wind blowing and the raft drifted lengthwise of the lake, which is about 400 yards long. The girls had clung to the raft until nearing the far shore when apparently they became frightened. The girl, Margaret Bruce, fell off the raft and the older girl, Myrtle Moostos, jumped into the water in an effort to rescue her. The third girl, Mary Whitequill, clung to the raft and was saved.\n\nThe raft referred to is constructed of oil drums held together by a hastily constructed framework and had been used at the time of the spring break-up when some of the school staff were giving attention to the pump which had been on the ice of the lake. It had apparently been left on the shore of the lake after they finished with it.\n\nMr. Wickenden and Mr. Mayo both informed me that the area of the lake was out of bounds to all of the children and that it was strictly against orders for the children to go down to the lake. However, at this particular time, about 2.00 P.M. on Saturday afternoon, it would appear that several children were at or near the lake, both girls and boys, as it was a boy who ran to the school and reported the accident as he had seen it from the shore of the lake.\n\nMr. Wickenden and Mr. Mayo,.....\n\nIndian Affairs.

I would be in the hall and go in and out to see that the children were all right. At the same time I was trying on dresses for the junior girls in the hall. It must have been just after 2 o'clock when one of the boys came in and said that 2 of the girls were drowning. I came in and told Mr. Mayo and Mr. Wickenden.\n\nThe girls are not allowed to go off by themselves. They had been told about that the week before. I had told them and asked Mr. Mayo to make a public announcement in the dining room, which he did very forcefully after supper one evening. They were worrying their supervisor very much because they had taken into going into the space across the road which used to be Mr. Frayling's garden and they were not supposed to be there. They have a large space of their own with playground equipment. The Saturday previous I had been shaking mats on the front steps and heard voices and saw a red sweater in that garden. I went over and saw Myrtle Jane Moostos, Mabel Matchechuck, Betty Moosemay and Myrtle McNab, with some younger girls, coming up the path. I told them they were doing wrong by taking the little girls and encouraging them to go out of bounds. I did not realize this garden gave them such easy access to the lake. On the Monday it worried me so much I asked Mr. Mayo to speak to the girls about going out of their playground. On the same Monday I found Betty Moosemay, Leona Bird, Etheline Bird and Minnie Miristy in the garden again and I sent them to bed right away and also sent them to bed early the next night.\n\nOn Saturday, the 14th, I asked Miss Coe, the Girls' Supervisor, if she had seen the girls going into the garden during the past week and she said she had not. She supervises them during the hours when they are not in the classroom or working under some instructor. I had no idea of their being on the raft. Myrtle Jane was a kitchen girl and should have been at work in the mornings\u2014possibly went down to the lake during recess.\n\nThe girls were playing baseball by themselves when I went out that Saturday afternoon to the playground. The supervising under Mr. Mayo and Mr. Wickenden has been the same. The supervisor gets the children up in the morning, supervises the breakfast and cleaning of the dormitories and has them whenever they are not in school or working about the building. Twice a week after nine Miss Coe has been going to help with the laundering of the quilts as an emergency measure, otherwise she is free during classroom hours.\n\n(The end)\nMr. Harry Morrow: (Manual Training Instructor, acting-supervisor).\n\nThe Boys' Supervisor gets the boys up, gets them ready for school, supervises meals, sports or handicrafts during the evenings, and puts them to bed.\n\nI try to keep them on the playground, but it is hard to keep check of them unless you are able to be there all the time. Other duties sometimes keep you inside. There are times when they have to be left on the playground alone. If some of them are not around they have to be locked up.

Wickenden:\n\nThe lake is generally known to be out of bounds and all the staff are aware of this and that no child should go down without some definite reason. I am joint Acting-Principal and my particular sphere of influence is the supervision of the children in the various phases of their work and recreation. Boys and girls know quite definitely that the lake is out of bounds and girls particularly, know that their proper place is their own playground, and that they should not be out of it without permission, unless they are occupied in the school. I have two small children and have allowed smaller girls at times to play with my children on my grounds. I have not encouraged the older girls to come in and I have often sent girls away. I have told them that they must ask permission of Mrs. Wickenden or of me before they play with the children.\n\nOn Saturday, June 14th, after lunch, I came back to the office to work. At about 2 o'clock the matron came in and announced that two girls were reported to have drowned in the lake. William Pavel, the school boy who brought the information, appeared and confirmed this. I called for blankets and immediately ran off with William Pavel, followed by William Anderson (a general helper on the farm). The boy guided us to the north shore of the lake where he had seen the girls fall in, and with very little loss of time we saw one body floating, barely submerged. I took off a little clothing, waded in, and swam and waded back to shore with the body. I recognized it as Myrtle Moostos. About this time Mr. Mayo appeared and blankets came. Without delay I began artificial respiration. I continued alone until the doctor arrived, which would be shortly before three. Under his direction artificial respiration was carried on, and when he left about 3.30 his directions were to carry on for one-half hour longer and then to desist if there was no evidence of a pulse. Actually, spelled off by others, we carried on until a quarter to five and then we decided that it was hopeless.\n\nIn the meantime the search for the other body continued under Corporal Playford, and two of our staff members, Mr. MacLeod and Mr. Morrow, aided by others. This body, that of Margaret Bruce, was not recovered until Monday forenoon.\n\n(The school had been asked to try to overcome the ill-will among the Indians, so a concession was made and the children allowed to go home one Sunday a month, also Saturday afternoons also. There is a strong demand on the part of the parents that the children visit their homes whenever possible, leading to a con-\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-23, part 1)\ntinual shifting of responsibility. For instance, at Lac la Ronge the older boys were originally allowed to go home once a month, then it gradually got down to once a week. There was increasing pressure from the parents and there has been the same thing here. I have allowed the girls to go in and play with my children in the interests of friendship, but have tried to control it. The children should not have gone down to the lake and it is strange that Myrtle Jane should have got this notion. She has always been a well-behaved girl. Perhaps those from far away Reserves feel the restrictions and the fact that they never get home during the year. The girls concerned are those that live at a distance. The Sunday they mentioned was one of the visiting Sundays. This may have been the day they started going down to the lake\u2014it was a nice day and they might have been able to slip off.\n\n(The end).\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs.

We knew she was down there because she was there before dinner also. Mabel saw them first when we looked through the bush; we saw Myrtle and Mary on the raft. We were coming closer and we saw Myrtle jump in or something. William Pavel told us to come and tell Mrs. Daysh, but he came himself instead of us telling. And we went in the washroom.\n\nI had been to the lake before and went on the raft once, but jumped off. That was about a week before. Other girls had been coming before. Myrtle Jane was there before. Mabel and Myrtle were the only ones I knew of being there before. I had been told not to go out of the playground by Mrs. Daysh.\n\nWhen I came out from the dining room I went and did my work. It takes about, then I went into the playground and came up and met Mabel. I was there nearly an hour.\n\nJean Blind\nMabel Matchechuck, aged 14, Poorman's Reserve:\n\nAfter dinner I was in the dining room first, doing my work. I went to the playground right away and I came out and went inside. I went outside again and met Joan Blind and asked her where was Myrtle Jane. She said she must be down at the lake. We went down to the lake. When we were near the lake we saw three girls on the raft. I heard the girls say there were some boys over there. I looked and saw some boys coming. Next time I looked I saw girls in the water. William Favel told us to go and tell right away. We came up to the washroom and then we saw William come and run for the front door. After that we went out to the playground.\n\nJoan and I were walking together. I saw three girls on the raft first. I was down there about seven times before with Myrtle Jane, also Mary White Quill and Myrtle Jane. We first went down on a Sunday, June 1st. Some days we went down more than once. We were going down there every day, that is me and Myrtle Jane and Margaret, and sometimes Margaret and Mary White Quill. Mrs. Daysh told us not to go down there. We went down the path. I had been on the raft before. Every time I went down I went on the raft. We had been on the lake before when it was rough. It was very windy that day. It is hard to stand on the raft when it is windy.\n\nMabel Matchechuck\nMary White Quill, aged 12, Ochapowace Reserve:\n\nAfter dinner we were in the playground first and we came inside and Myrtle Jane went in the washroom and she asked us to come down to the lake and we went down with her. Myrtle Jane, when we got down there, she was on the raft by herself. We were playing in the water. We had our shoes and stockings off and Myrtle Jane looked and saw Joan Blind and Mabel coming and she told us to get on, she would not give any more girls a ride. We were on the raft and Myrtle Jane she came and looked and she saw Ernest and William coming, and Margaret said, \"I am going to jump off,\" because she was afraid the boys might hit them with stones. Myrtle Jane, when Margaret jumped, she gave her the pole, and Margaret couldn't hold it, and Myrtle Jane said, \"I'll jump,\" and she tried to catch her and she couldn't. After that when she jumped off I was on the raft myself and Ernest told me to stay on and I stayed on, and I was going that side, and when I was getting near the shore Ernest pulled the raft in. I came and walked back and Ernest was behind me.\n\nWilliam Favel and William Charles had brought the raft around west of the pumphouse before Saturday. William Favel and William Charles were throwing stones at Myrtle and Mabel twice before. One of these times was Friday after 4 o'clock, 8 days before the drowning. The girls were Myrtle Jane, Mabel. Margaret and I were not on the raft that day. Before Margaret jumped she said, \"I'm scared, the boys are coming.\"\n\nMary White Quill\nAccident, June 14, 1947, at Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nWilliam Charles, 13, J. Roberts Band:\n\nWilliam Fayel and I took the raft around west of the pump-house. I had been on the raft twice before. The first time was about a week before. We left the raft on the west side on Thursday. We did not tie it, but pulled it up on the mud. We threw stones at Myrtle Jane and Mabel before Thursday. Margaret and Mary watched us throw stones at the others on the raft. They were west of the pump-house. We threw the stones to scare them to leave the raft alone. Mr. Morrow had told us not to go to the lake.\n\nWilliam Charles\nWilliam Favel, aged 13, Poorman's Reserve:\n\nAfter dinner we went down to the barn, I and Ernest. We came back to the school again, then we saw the boys in the playroom, Warren Kay and Hubert Assoon and the four of us went down to the lake and we saw them girls on the raft and we saw one fell in the water and the other fell in the water. When we saw them fall we ran around there and we told Mary to stay on the raft. She was going to jump off and we kept on telling her to stay on the raft; so she stayed on the raft. The wind blew the raft to the shore and then Ernest pulled the raft to the shore. I went up to the school and told Mrs. Daysh about them girls and Mrs. Daysh went into the office and told. We went down to the lake and I saw one of the girls in the water and I told Mr. Wickenham. He ran to get the girl and I came up to the school. Mr. MacLeod told me to come up to the school for his swimming clothes and I took them swimming clothes down there and I came up to the school and I stayed in the playground.\n\nI had been playing down there about twice before. Other boys at the lake with me before were Mervin Bittern Nose and William Charles. It was my idea to go down to the lake to see the ducks. On Saturday afternoons we are allowed to go home or to play ourselves. The Principal had told us not to go down to the lake.\n\nI do not know what time it was when we went down there. We went to the barn right after dinner, only stayed about five minutes, then went to the playroom, got the other two boys and went right down to the lake. The girls were already there and were having trouble. I think the last one fell in. It was a very windy day and the pole might have cracked.\n\nWe just ran down there as soon as we saw the girls and then came right back to the school. Mr. Wickenham and William Anderson ran right down.\n\n2nd. Appearance: One time before the Saturday we threw stones at the girls on the raft. We were not really trying to hit them or scare them. We did not want the raft. On Saturday afternoons we are allowed to walk around. We know we are not allowed to go down to the lake. We were trying to splash water on the girls with the stones, not to hit them. That day we saw Margaret Bruce and Mary White Quill on the south shore.\n\nWilliam Favel\nAccident, June 14, 1947; at Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nErnest White Quill, aged 14, Ochapowace Reserve:\n\nI went down to the lake and saw some girls fasting. One fell in, then another one fell in, and one stayed on. I started running there, the girls told us they were drowning. I told Mary to stay on the raft. I ran up to the school.\n\nWilliam Favel and Warren Kay were with me. I brought my sister (Mary) back to the school. William came to the school first. The raft was blown into the shore.\n\nThe children down at the lake then were William Favel, Hubert Assoon, Warren Kay and myself, Mary White Quill, Joan Blind, Mabel Matchecheuck, Margaret Bruce, and Myrtle Jane Moostoes.\n\nI had not been on the raft before; I only went down there when sent. I do not know if others had been there before that day; it was the first time I had been down there on my own.\n\nOn the raft were Myrtle Jane Moostoes, Mary White Quill and Margaret Bruce.\n\nErnest White Quill\nDr. S. Golzman:\n\nOn the 14th of June between 2.30 and 5.00 p.m. I had a phone call from Mr. Mayo, who said that two girls were drowned, or apparently drowned, at the lake east of the school and could I come right out. I immediately called Mr. Davis to inform him of the accident, but he was away on another Reserve. I also called the Mounted Police but learned later that they were already at the scene of the accident. I arrived at the school about 15 minutes after the phone call. Mr. Mayo met me at the School and we proceeded down to the lake. When I arrived there I saw a body, which was later identified as that of Myrtle Jane Moosos, and Mr. Wickenden was giving her artificial respiration at the time. Artificial respiration was carried on according to my instructions and stimulants were injected intra-muscularly. I could not detect any visible pulse nor were there any respirations. I assisted in the artificial respiration for almost an hour, changing off with Mr. Wickenden, but the body failed to respond to any treatment. Death was due to drowning. We could not find the other body at that time.\n\nOn June 16th, at about noon, I was informed by the Mounted Police of Punnichy that the other body had been recovered from the lake, and as coroner I came out and viewed the body. I was unable to go out until about 5 o'clock. When I arrived there the body was at the edge of the lake, face down, and it was the body of Margaret Bruce. She was identified by Mr. Wickenden. She was quite dead and death was apparently due to drowning.\n\nThere were no marks of violence of misdemeanour on either of the two bodies.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs. (RG 10, Volume 6312, file 654-23, part 1)\nAccident, June 14, 1947, at Gordon's Indian Residential School, Punnichy, Sask.\n\nMr. Mayo:\n\nI came in here under peculiar conditions. I came in here first of all for two weeks, then a month, and when I went into the office in Winnipeg I was asked to come right on here. Dr. Alderwood requested me to come, as the place was a muddle and the Indians had a great aversion to the Residential School and to an ordained man. I was asked to try to regain the goodwill of the Indians. I believe I have got it and they brought their children without hesitation. They told me that they would bring their children if I were remaining. When I first came they were here wanting their children constantly, and afterwards I made an arrangement with them that they could have their children once a month, but always under escort.\n\nFred A.

Now I understand how it happened. I have not enough money to take me home. I want to go back to the Reserve.

Myrtle MCFARLANE came and asked me to walk home to the lake with her. I started walking with Myrtle MCFARLANE and Margaret BRUCE, aged 10 years. The lake is on the east side of the school, and we arrived at this point, there was a raft made of gasoline drums near the pump house. Myrtle got on this raft, Margaret and I took off our stockings and played around in the water for a short time. Myrtle then yelled to us to come and get on the raft which we did. Myrtle pushed the raft out into the water with a pole that was on the raft, and we started off across the lake, so were going in an northerly direction. We could hear some girls coming from the school and said 'lets hurry as she did not want any more girls on the raft.' He then saw some boys coming towards the lake and Margaret BRUCE said \"Lets jump off as they might throw stones at us\" and Margaret then jumped off the raft into the water. The water was too deep for Margaret at this point and Myrtle passed the pole towards her and told her to grab it. Margaret tried to reach the pole but could not do so. Myrtle then said \"I will jump off and try and catch something\" and Myrtle then jumped off the raft and let the stick go and I was on the raft alone. Myrtle tried to swim but could not do so and she went down in the water, and was not able to get anywhere near Margaret. Margaret disappeared in the water. I sat still on the raft and the wind blew it towards the shore and when it arrived my brother Ernest WHITESHILL aged 13 years pulled the raft in and I got off and walked back to the school.\"\n\nSigned Myrla WHITESHILL.\n\n(P.S.C.)\n\nIndian Affairs.

I went for a walk around the house and went to the riverbank and then came back to the school. I met Ernest Whitesill Hubert Jackson and Warren Kay and we went down towards the lake. We are not allowed to go near the lake but I have been there several times before with other boys. When we arrived at the lake we saw three girls out on the water on a raft, they were Myrtle McTeece, Mary Whitesill and Margaret Bruce, two of the girls were sitting on the raft and Myrtle McTeece was using a pole to push the raft, and as we watched them one of the girls stood up and then fell into the water, we were about 100 feet from them when this happened, right after this one of the other girls fell into the water and we then ran around the edge of the lake and Ernest Whitesill called to the other girl to stay on the raft, this girl was Mary Whitesill, Ernest's sister, the wind blew the raft towards the shore and Ernest Whitesill pulled the raft to the shore and his sister Mary got off, she went back to the school. The other two girls were still in the water and I ran up to the school and told Mr. Wickham the school iron that the girls were in the water. Mr. Wickham then came with me and I showed him the spot where I had last seen the girls in the water and we saw one of them. Mr. Wickham then went into the water and pulled this girl out, this was Myrtle McTeece, but there was no sign of the other girl. I was then sent back to the school for a swim suit for Mr. McLeod.

Myrtle Jane was pushing the raft, Margaret Bruce and my sister Mary Whitesill were sitting down on the raft, as we watched this raft one of the girls fell into the water, and then Myrtle Jane went into the water, and the other girl stayed on the raft.

WICKENDEN, acting Principal of the Gordon Indian School was interviewed and the following statement obtained:\n\nBRUNGE: About 2:00 P.M. Saturday June 14th, 1947, I was in my office at the Gordon Indian School, attending to a telephone message. Mr. William MAY and William JENSEN were present. Suddenly our Matron, Mrs. BATH, entered and announced that two girls had drowned in the lake, her informant, who may have been William FOWL, expressed forthwith and confirmed the report that he and others had seen two girls, Margaret BRUCE and Myrtle Jones MCCOOG, fall from a raft into the lake where they had drowned. I called for blankets and immediately ran off towards the lake guided by William FOWL to the scene of the incident, and followed by William JENSEN.\n\nWe ran along the north shore and very soon sighted one body floating barely submerged in the water not many yards from the shore. After removing my outer clothing and shoes I entered the water and brought the body to land. It was Myrtle MCCOOG drowned. I dragged her feet out of the water and applied artificial respiration without delay. The other came to me and assisted me in the second body. Mr. MAY had arrived by this time and was closely followed by Mrs. MAY who brought blankets. Mr. MAY did not delay but went off to phone for Dr. GOLDFIHN, who arrived at the school 20 minutes later. In the interval I persevered with the artificial respiration assisted by Mrs John PISHER, wife of the Chief; Miss L. McCONNELL and Miss Orches of the school staff and others who attempted to restore circulation of the blood. Very shortly after Dr. GOLDFIHN appeared on the scene unexpectedly accompanied by Mr. George TRIPP, the former launched a raft and assisted by Mr. D. McLEOD, and Mr. R. MORROW of the school staff kept up the search for the body of Margaret BRUCE around the shore. Dr. C. GOLDFIHN arrived about 2:45 P.M. and artificial respiration was continued under his direction. When he left, about 3:30 P.M. there was still no sign of life in the body and we were told that we might consider our efforts useless if there was no sign or indication of a pulse after another half hour. Actually we continued artificial respiration until 4:45 P.M. but in vain.\n\nI should estimate that artificial respiration was applied within five minutes of the announcement of the drowning to us in the office, and it appears that the pupils who viewed the tragedy lost little time in reporting it.\n\nMyrtle Jane MCCOOG was 16 years of age and due for discharge, she belonged to the James SMITH Band, Fort Le Gorne and was born February 19th, 1931. Margaret BRUCE belonged to the Day Step Indian Reserve and was 11 years of age.

I said maybe Myrtle is down by the lake, so I walked down by the lake before I came back down to the lake and when I arrived Isabel saw three girls on a raft and said they were coming down to the lake at this time and we watched the raft as Myrtle jumped off the raft.

In the A.M. of this date the writer being absent on other Police duties at Yorkton Sub-Division Headquarters the search at the lake was continued by Sgt. M.G. CRANFORD, of Regina Liquor Squad, and who was successful in locating the body of Margaret BRUCE shortly after 11:00 A.M. very close to the place where Mr. EVERTON had found the body of Myrtle MOSTOOS floating; this body was pulled to the shore of the lake and a responsible person placed there to guard same and efforts made to contact Dr. S. GOLDFMAN Coroner, Dr. GILPIN being away engaged in the operating room at Lestock, Sask., could not be reached until the P.M. and upon the writers return from Yorkton Dr. GOLDFMAN and the writer proceeded to the lake and the body was examined by the Coroner and then removed to the Ministers Residence on the Gordon Indian Reserve.\n\n13. In the late P.M. this same date the Jury was summoned and the body viewed and same being identified by the Rev. D.G. WICKENDEN, Acting Principal of the Gordon Indian School, the Inquest was adjourned sine die.\n\n14. The lake in which this drowning took place is oblong of water located approximately a quarter of a mile east of the Gordon Indian School, from which water is pumped for washing purposes etc., same is approximately 400 yards long running east and west and approximately 250 to 275 yards in width north and south, there is a pump located on the west side and it was from this point the girls embarked upon the raft which was a homemade affair consisting of four gasoline barrels and a wooden frame, on Saturday June 14th, there was a strong south west wind prevailing and when the raft left the shore it proceeded in northerly direction, about half way on the north side of this lake there is a point which juts out into the lake possibly 15 to 20 feet and it was near this spot that the body of both girls were located, the water at its deepest point is about 10 to 12 feet, the bottom of the lake is composed of a black alluvial of earth about 10 to 12 inches in depth. There are no boats or canoe's kept near this water, presumably to discourage these Indian children attending the school from going near the water, the raft in question was built during the spring to assist in securing a pump which is used to supply water to the school.\n\n15. It will be noted from the statements obtained that it is strictly against the rules of the school for any of the students to leave the playground without permission, and that the girls who did go to the lake were fully aware of this ruling and admit same in their statements.\n\n16. The Inquest in the above regard is scheduled for Thursday June 19th, 1947 at 8:30 P.M. at the Gordon Indian School, it being thought that the Indian Children who will be called to give evidence would do so in a better manner in their own environment.\nROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE\nHEADQUARTERS\n\nOTTAWA, July 4, 1947.\n\nREGISTERED\n\nRe: Myrtle Jane MOSTOOS & Margaret BRUCE -\nDrowning of - Gordons Indian School -\nPunnichy Dist., Sask.\n\nAttached in the above connection are copies of reports from our Punnichy Detachment, Saskatchewan, dated the 18th and 20th ultimo, concerning the death by drowning on June 14, 1947, in a lake on the Gordon Indian Reservation, of Treaty Indians Myrtle Jane Mostoos and Margaret Bruce, aged sixteen and eleven years respectively.\n\n2.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended STURGEON LANDING, SASK. 193...\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated..............................................193...\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Smith\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at..............................................\n\nthis..............................................193...\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the [Ouy Indian Residential School] School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1941.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 26th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this [Date] 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Guy Indian Residential School School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1941\n\nPrincipal: Rev. M. Dugan\n\nDated June 26th 1941\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Lovell\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended 19 .\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19 .\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19 .\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFoar No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LAKE, SASK. ended ........................................... 19\n\nPrincipal ...........................................\n\nDated ........................................... 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ...........................................\n\nthis ........................................... 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, SASK., ended: 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated: 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Dorill\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SURGEON LANDING, SASK.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL STURGEON LANDING, B.C., School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1942.\n\nPrincipal: ____________________________\n\nDated: March 21, 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent: ____________________________\n\nDated at: ____________________________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRequ.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the STURGEON LANDING, SASK., School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. W. Dyer\n\nDated: March 26th 1942\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Lovell\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: The Pas, Man.\n\nthis March 31st 1942\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the ___________________________ School for the Quarter ended ___________________________ 19 ________\n\nPrincipal _______________________________________\n\nDated ___________________________ 19 ________\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent _______________________________________\n\nDated at ___________________________ this ___________________________ 19 ________\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, B.A.S.C. ended ........................................... 19 ...........................................\n\nPrincipal ...........................................\n\nDated ........................................... 19 ...........................................\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at ........................................... this ...........................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertainable by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended Principal Dated\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SURGEON LANDING, SASK. School for the Quarter ended Dec. 31st 1942.\n\nPrincipal Rev. M. Deyon, B.C.S.S.\n\nDated January 3rd 1943\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Jan. 5th 1943\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d.\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal number of days in quarter\u201d.\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and tuition at the STURGEON LANDING, B.C., School for the Quarter ended ...........................................

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL STURGEON LANDING, SASK.

The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended 19\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated 19\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return; and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal No. of days in quarter.\u201d\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \u201cTotal No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\u201d\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \u201cAggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\u201d by the \u201cTotal No. of days in quarter.\u201d\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \u201cAverage attendance of pupils during quarter\u201d by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended...September the 30th...19.43\n\nPrincipal...L.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY BEAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, STUNSON LANDING, ONTARIO School for the Quarter ended September the 30th, 1943.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October the 7th, 1943.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nOctober 18th, 1943.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER No. |

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROW INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended December the 31st 1934.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January the 7th 1934.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 1934.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n| REGISTER No. | NAMES OF PUPILS          | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-------------|--------------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 206         | Brought forward          |     |     |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 207         | Daniel Linklater         | 11  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 208         | Osnut Spence             | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 209         | John Hill Spence         | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 210         | Joseph Nicolas           | 13  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 211         | Ubald Nicolas            | 11  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 212         | Simon Bighetty           | 10  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 213         | Philippe Castel          | 11  | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 214         | Pierre Castel            | 9   | 1   |      |                |                    |                         |                             |            |\n| 215         | Joseph D.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertainable by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during Quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, STURGEON LANDING, B.C., School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1934.\n\nPrincipal:\n\nDated: June 30, 1934.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\nDated at this date, 1934.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm 23\n| REGISTER No. | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|-------------------------|----------------------------|------------|\n| 0208        | Caroline Bighetty     | 59  | 59  | 51   | Pakitawagan    |                         | 15/8/43                    | 8261       |\n| 0210        | Josette Highway       | 8   |     |      | South End      |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0211        | Genevieve Ninine      | 7   |     |      |                |                         |                            |            |\n| 0212        | Noella Moore          | 7   |     |      | Nelson H.      |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0213        | Henriette Spence      | 11  |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0214        | Dorothy Spence        | 8   |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0215        | Helen Linklater       | 10  |     |      | S.Indian L.    |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0216        | Sarah Linklater       | 8   |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0217        | Evelyn Moose          | 11  |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0218        | Margaret Moose        | 8   |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0219        | Martha Spence         | 12  |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0220        | Evelyn Spence         | 9   |     |      |                |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0221        | Marie Bear            | 7   |     |      | Island Falls   |                         |                            | 91         |\n| 0222        | Veronique Dadzinemare | 10  |     |      | Lac La Hache   |                         | 16/4/44                    | 77         |\n\n**TOTALS**\n\n- **REGISTER No.**: 59\n- **AGE**: 59\n- **BOY**: 59\n- **GIRL**: 51\n- **CLASS OF STUDY**: 39\n- **TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY**: 28\n- **DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL**: 13\n- **ATTENDANCE**: 28\n\n**TOTAL NO.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, WUNGEON LANDING, SASK., School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1944.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June the 30th, 1944.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis July 15, 1944.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm 22\n| REGISTER No. | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OF STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 134         | Auguste Mercasty      | 15  | 1   |      | Pelican N.     | 1                  |                         | 15/8/36                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 149         | Cyrille Daniel        | 14  | 1   |      | Pakitawagan     | 1                  |                         | 15/8/36                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 151         | Patrice Bighetty      | 12  | 1   |      | South End       | 1                  |                         | 15/8/36                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 155         | Napoleon Michel       | 9   | 1   |      | Pelican         | 1                  |                         | 1/8/37                    | 91         |                                                               |\n| 167         | Laurent Colomb        | 14  | 1   |      | Pakitawagan     | 1                  |                         | 15/8/37                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 159         | Harry Bighetty        | 12  | 1   |      | \"               | 1                  |                         | 15/8/37                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 160         | George Moise          | 13  | 1   |      | Split Lake      | 1                  |                         | 24/8/37                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 161         | Thomas Morin          | 14  | 1   |      | Pelican N.      | 1                  |                         | 10/8/37                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 164         | Sidley Cook           | 12  | 1   |      | South End       | 1                  |                         | 10/8/37                   | /          | not back to school                                           |\n| 169         | William Siwap         | 12  | 1   |      | Cumberland      | 1                  |                         | 22/1/38                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 172         | Hubert Morin          | 10  | 1   |      | Pelican N.      | 1                  |                         | 15/8/36                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 174         | Henry Gursiteur       | 11  | 1   |      | \"               | 1                  |                         | 15/8/36                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 177         | Thomas Leblerte       | 11  | 1   |      | Cumberland      | 1                  |                         | 15/8/36                   | 91         |                                                               |\n| 178         | Leo Sauteux           | 11  | 1   |      | South End       | 1                  |                         | 15/8/38                   | -

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be entered on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the STURGEON LANDING, B.C., School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1945.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 655-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pagging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY BEKAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended June 30th 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30th 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry over all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended September the 30 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated October 12 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas Oct. 17 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CROW INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 5, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas, Manitoba,\n\nTenth Day of January 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReqn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CIVIL INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, SASK., ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. L. Parry\n\nDated: January 4, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: The Pas, Manitoba\n\nthis Tenth day of January 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL, STURGEON LANDING, SASK., School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. L. Poirier\n\nDated April 4, 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas, Manitoba.\n\nthis 9th day of April 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, SASK. ended June 30 1946.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 26 1946.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Dorrell\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas, Manitoba this 2nd day of July 1946.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, SASK. ended September 30th 1946 Principal Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per pupil grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL and Tuition at the STURGEON LANDING, SASK. School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1946.\n\nPrincipal Rev. L. Lewis\n\nDated October 10, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Lovell\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas, Manitoba\n\nthis 16th day of October 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. 1 A 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pasting it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1946\n\nSTURGEON LANDING, SASK.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated December 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Horner\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas, Manitoba,\n\nthis 8th day of January, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 655-2, part 1)\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended MARCH 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated APRIL 1, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 3rd April, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReg.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the STURGEON LAKE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1947, SASK.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended March 31st 1947.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated July 5, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nSamuel Lovell\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this 19\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Guy Indian Residential School School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, Sask. ended September 30 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at this Oct 5 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 408\nRegn.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively; and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the Guy Indian Residential School School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, Sask., ended...September 30...1947.\n\nPrincipal...[Signature]\n\nDated...October 2...1947.\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at...[Signature]\n\nthis...October 8...1947.\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY STURGEON LANDING, Sask., School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at The Pas, Man.\n\nthis Oct. 8, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nRepr.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is obtained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY STURGEON LANDING, Sask., School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1947.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 2, 1947\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Regina, Oct. 8, 1947\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nReq.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL STURGEON LANDING, SASK., School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1947.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 2, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 2nd January, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 655-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1946.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: March 31, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at: [Signature]\n\nthis 1st April, 1946\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 0250            | Dorothy Linklater | 11  | 72  | 39   | Indian Lake    | 47 1925 14 7 6 3   |                       | 15-8-45                  | 7792       | Sanatorium                                                   |\n| 0252            | Isabel Hoese     | 8   |     |      | Nelson House   | 1                |                       |                           | 91         | Truant                                                       |\n| 0254            | Mary Ann Hart    | 10  |     |      | Nelson House   | 1                |                       |                           | -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. This Return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount of quarterly grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, SASK. ended March 31, 1945\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL STURGEON LANDING, BASSIN School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1948.\n\nPrincipal: Rev. L. Boivin\n\nDated: March 31, 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: April 1, 1948\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\nR. 3444\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The annual per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI hereby certify that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter STURGEON LANDING, SASK. ended June 30, 1945 Principal: [Signature]\n\nDated: June 30, 1945\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent\n\nDated: July 3rd, 1945\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, pading it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the COL. INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended September 30 STURGEON LAKE, SASK. 1948\n\nDated October 4 1948\n\nIndian Agent\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nTHE PAS.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CITY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended September 30 1948.\n\nActing Principal\n\nDated October 4 1948\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at THE PAS MAN OCT 12 1949\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403 R. 3444\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|----------------|-----|-----|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 01275           | Sarah Head     | 15  | 83  | 1   | Cumberland    | 36 11 9 10 4 7 2 3 | 1                      | 15-8-35                   | 5531       | 1607                                                                 |\n| 0137            | Agnes Ballantyne | 15 | 1   | 1   | Pelican       | 1                 | 1                      | 15-8-36                   | 92         | 28                                                                 |\n| 0142            | Lucy Merasty   | 14  | 1   | \"   | \"             | \"                 | \"                      | \"                        | -

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 3, 1946\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at CARLTON this JAN 28, 1946\n\nIndian

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper column.\n\n4. The return must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of day pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9. The amount of per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the CIVIL INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1945.\n\nSTURGEON LANDING, SASK.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 655-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The average number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total No. of days pupils in residence during quarter.\"\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate No. of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total No. of days in quarter.\"\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils enrolled in the school and has continued to attend the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the...

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September, and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the SASKATCHEWAN INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated April 12, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 13 1949\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the GUY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated June 30, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at JUL 7,

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet or the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended June 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal: Rev.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 26, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nIndian Agent\n\nDated at Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. IA. 408\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS       | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE |\n|-----------------|-----------------------|-----|-----|------|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|\n| 0245            | Agnes Sinclair        | 12  | 1   | 1    | Pakitawagan     |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0246            | Marie-Louise Bighetty | 12  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0247            | Veronique Ballantyne  | 11  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0248            | Belle Bighetty        | 11  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0250            | Dorothee Linklater    | 12  | 1   | 1    | Indian Lake    |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0252            | Isabelle Moose        | 10  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0257            | Myrtian Hughes        | 11  | 1   | 1    | Nelson House   |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0258            | Cecilia Michel        | 10  | 1   | 1    | Lao Laflache   |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0259            | Marguerite Merasty    | 12  | 1   | 1    | Pelican N.     |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0260            | Therese Merasty       | 14  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0262            | Maggy Mc Callum       | 12  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0263            | Catherine Merasty     | 12  | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0264            | Mary-Ann Bear        | 12  | 1   | 1    | South End      |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0265            | Mary Patterson        | 13  | 1   | 1    | Pakitawagan    |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0267            | Emma Flett           | 11  | 1   | 1    | Nelson House Pr.|                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0269            | Lina Francois        | 8   | 1   | 1    |                |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0273            | Helen Colomb         | 11  | 1   | 1    | Pakitawagan    |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0274            | Therese Webb         | 15  | 1   | 1    | The Pas        |                    |                         |                             | 92         |\n| 0275            | Cecile Merasty       | 6   | 1   | 1    | Pelican N.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a

Fill in all the columns of the Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the JAY INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL School for the Quarter ended September 30, 1949.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated October 26, 1949\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby

(RG 10, Volume 6312, file 655-2, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nNOTES ON THE PREPARATION OF THIS RETURN\n\n1. Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. All Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated January 16, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at Indian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereon.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3.

The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nINDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended March 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal\n\nDated March 31, 1950\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at APR 3, 1950\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM No. I.A. 403\n## INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL QUARTERLY RETURN\n\n**CARLTON Agency**\n\n**REPORT OF the GUY School at Sturgeon Landing on Sturgeon Weir Reserve for Quarter ended March 31st 1950**\n\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAMES OF PUPILS | AGE | SEX | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS TO PROGRESS, ETC., REASON FOR ABSENCE, DATE OF ABSENCE, WHETHER AUTHORIZED OR NOT |\n|-----------------|-----------------|-----|-----|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 155             | Napoleon Michel | 14  | 1   | Pelican        | 1                  |                         | 1-2-37                   | 90         |                                                                                                 |\n| 187             | Rodrigue Thomas | 15  | 1   | South End      | 1                  |                         | 15-8-39                  | 90         |                                                                                                 |\n| 188             | Hermegilde Morin| 14  | 1   | Pelican        | 1                  |                         | 15-8-39                  | 90         |                                                                                                 |\n| 213             | Peter Cartel    | 15  | 1   | Pakitawagan    | 1                  |                         | 15-8-41                  | 90         | Truant                                                                                           |\n| 218             | Stanley Sewap   | 14  | 1   | Cumberland     | 1                  |                         |                          | 90         |                                                                                                 |\n| 229             | Ch.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the School for the Quarter ended December 31, 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated: January 5, 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\nIndian Agent:\n\n[Signature]\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nForm No. I.A. 403\n| REGISTER NUMBER | NAME OF PUPILS | AGE | BOY | GIRL | CLASS OR STUDY | STANDING IN CLASS | TRADE OR OTHER INDUSTRY | DATE OF ENTRANCE TO SCHOOL | ATTENDANCE | REMARKS AS

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nIndian Affairs.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The columns of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant.

Fill in all the columns of this Return, giving full particulars in the case of each pupil, as called for under the various headings thereof.\n\n2. The column of the Return should be correctly added and the totals placed at the foot thereof.\n\n3. When, owing to the number of pupils, all the names cannot be included on one sheet of the Return, use another sheet, paging it No. 2, and carry forward all totals, placing them in the proper columns.\n\n4. The Returns must embrace only the quarterly periods ending 31st March, 30th June, 30th September and 31st December, respectively, and should be prepared and forwarded immediately thereafter.\n\n5. No Quarterly Grant will be paid until Returns have been received by the Department.\n\n6. The total number of days in quarter means every day in the quarter, including Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.\n\n7. The aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter means the total number of days in residence of all pupils entered on the Return and is ascertained by adding the column under the heading \"Total number of days pupils in residence during quarter\".\n\n8. The average attendance of pupils during quarter is ascertained by dividing the \"Aggregate number of days pupils in residence during quarter\" by the \"Total number of days in quarter\".\n\n9. The amount per capita grant due for quarter is ascertained by multiplying the \"Average attendance of pupils during quarter\" by the amount of the quarterly per capita grant. In no case, however, will payment be made for any average attendance in excess of the number of pupils for which grant is allowed.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE\n\nA new number must be given to each pupil upon entrance to the school. On this Return the names of the boys and the girls must be arranged consecutively according to numbers.\n\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that the within Return is a true and faithful statement of the attendance and tuition at the NEW INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL STURGEON LANDING, BARK School for the Quarter ended December 31 1950.\n\nPrincipal: [Signature]\n\nDated January 5 1951\n\nI have carefully examined the within Return and hereby certify that it is correctly made out in accordance with the instructions of the Department.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent\n\nCARLTON\n\nDated at JAN 17 1951\n\nIndian Agency\n\nNOTE\n\nPrincipals will please be guided by the instructions printed on the last page.\n\nFORM NO.

I have prepared a rough sketch of the proposed building, which will accommodate approximately 110 children. I prepared this plan after obtaining the necessary information from His Lordship, and I may say that he has approved of the general layout and accommodation as provided for in the sketch plans.\n\nAs there is only $25,000 available in this year's estimates for this work it will be possible to make a commencement only of the building, and His Lordship has approved of my suggestion to erect the rear portion of the building, which is somewhat similar to the first unit of the Coqualeetza Institute, this year. There will be sufficient funds to erect this portion of the building and also to provide water, light and drainage for the building.\n\nWith reference to the sewage disposal system, water supply and electric lighting plant, Bishop Charlebois informed me that the engineers of the Water Power Branch in Winnipeg are somewhat familiar with this locality, and intimated to me that if they received instructions from Ottawa they would be glad to visit the site of the proposed building and report to the Department on the above mentioned systems. With your approval I will direct a letter to the Dominion Water Power Branch and ask them to give their engineers the necessary authority to visit the site and submit a report on the water, light and sewerage systems for the building when weather conditions will permit.\n\nOwing to the short building season at Sturgeon Landing tenders should be invited as early as possible, and I expect to have the plans and specifications ready by the end of this month.\n\nArchitect.\nOttawa, March 18,\n1925.\n\nDear Mr. Brown,\n\nI am preparing plans and specifications for the proposed new Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing in Northern Saskatchewan. This building will be located at a considerable distance from Pas, Man., in an unsettled portion of the country.\n\nWill you please advise me if it will be satisfactory to your Department if the general fair wage clause is inserted in the specifications for this building. I am of the opinion that owing to its location, it will be more satisfactory and practical than the schedule of wages. As the specifications are now being prepared I would appreciate a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nYours truly,\n\nP. GUPNEY ORP.,\nArchitect for the Department.\n\nGerald H.

The Minister of Labour may at any time and from time to time determine for the purposes of this contract, what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages, and the current or fair and reasonable hours, and may from time to time rescind, revoke, amend or vary any such decision, provided that his determination and any amendment or variation shall not be operative prior to the period of three months immediately preceding the date thereof. Where there are special circumstances which in the judgment of the Minister of Labour make it expedient that he should do so, he may, in the manner and subject to the provisions hereinabove set forth, decide what are the current or fair and reasonable rates of wages for overtime, and what is the proper classification of any work for the purposes of wages and hours. Immediately upon receipt of notice of any decision of the Minister of Labour hereunder the contractor shall adjust the wages and hours and classification of work so as to give effect to such decision. In case the contractor shall fail so to do, or to pay to any employee or employees for any services performed or for any hours of labour, wages according to the rates fixed therefor by the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Labour may authorize and direct the Minister to pay any such wages at the rates so fixed and to deduct the amount thereof from any moneys owing by the Government to the contractor and any such payment shall for all purposes as between the contractor and the Government be deemed and taken to be payment to the contractor, and the contractor shall be bound in every particular by any such authority, direction and payment as aforesaid. The powers of the Minister of Labour hereunder shall not be exercised as to any employee or employees where it is established to his satisfaction that an agreement in writing exists and is in effect between the contractor and the class of employees to which such employee or employees belong or the authorized representatives of such class of employees fixing rates of wages, overtime conditions and hours of labour.\n\nIndian Affairs.

It is proposed to set a suitable site and property for the new Guy Indian Residential School from this new reserve, which is in Tp. 61, W.R. West of the First. A fraction of Section 15, at the mouth of the Sturgeon-Weir River, has been surveyed into the reserve, and even if this point is desirable for the location of the new school, some of it may be difficult to acquire. In the first place, the roadways are vested in the Crown. Second, two of the lots are leased to the company concerned, an Indian has secured the right to purchase them, and two lots have been offered to other Indians. The Interior is looking into this matter and will let us have a statement (file 397387).\n\nThe north half of Section 11 is at present Crown lands and it will be possible to reserve only after the Order in Council block has been gazetted.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nCANADA\n\nOttawa, March 30, 1925.\n\nMr. Orr,-\n\nThe advertisement, calling for tenders for the new Guy Indian residential school at Sturgeon Landing, Sask., may be inserted in the following papers:\n\nWinnipeg........

Indian Residential School. His Lordship, Bishop Charlebois, in whose diocese this school will be located, advised me that he had discussed with your engineers in Winnipeg the possibility of obtaining water power for generating electric current for this building. I understand that your engineers are familiar with the conditions of this locality, and I would be grateful if you would give them the necessary instructions to visit the proposed site and report as to the feasibility of erecting a small hydroelectric power plant, also their recommendations regarding the water supply and sewage disposal systems. When making arrangements to do so they should communicate with Bishop Charlebois, who will accompany them on their inspection. Owing to the short building season in the locality it would be advisable to have the report and inspection made as soon as weather conditions will permit.\n\nIf your Engineers in Winnipeg wish to see copies of the plans of the proposed new residential school same can be had at the office of John R. Bunn, Inspector of Indian Agencies at Winnipeg. I may say that his office is located in the same building as your Engineers'.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nA. H. Maclean,\nAsst.

(RG 10, Volume 6313, file 655-5, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nRe Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing.\n\nThis will acknowledge your letter of April 11th asking for an investigation and report on the feasibility of erecting a small hydro-electric power plant and recommendations regarding a water supply and sewage disposal system in connection with the above mentioned school.\n\nI have already written to The Pas inquiring as to the first sailing of the steamer from The Pas to Sturgeon Landing and will arrange to have the necessary survey made at the earliest possible date. If a power plant, water supply and sewage disposal system are to be built it would be most desirable to have this work done by contract, and possibly by the contractor building the school, and in my opinion it will be more economical and facilitate matters a great deal if a complete detail survey is made right at the start. The plans of such a survey would then permit of a general layout or any alternatives that may be later decided upon when preparing estimates of the cost of construction.\n\nI am also trying to arrange to have Bishop Charlebois visit the site at the time of the inspection.\n\nIn the fourth paragraph of your letter you ask for estimates of cost and detailed specifications. In order to secure this information it is necessary to obtain from machinery firms in Winnipeg prices on the machinery required, and as this entails a considerable amount of work on the part of the firms in Winnipeg it seems to me that it would be only fair that the Department of Indian Affairs give these firms an opportunity on tendering on the machinery required. Most of these firms are branches of the large Eastern and American firms and I have found their prices compare favourably with those received in the East, and unless they can be given some assurance that they will be given an opportunity of tendering on this work you can hardly expect them to continue to supply quotations.\n\nWhen submitting my report containing plans, estimates and specifications, I will submit a list of names of firms from whom prices have been received for the various equipment required.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nC. H. Attwood,\nDistrict Chief Engineer.\n\nJ. T. Johnston, Esq.,\nDirector, Dom. Water Power & Reclamation Service,\nDept. of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nApril 11, 1925.\n\nSir,\n\nRe: Indian Residential School at Sturgeon Landing.\n\nEnclosed hereto is a copy of a letter which has been received from the Department of Indian Affairs with reference to the proposed Indian residential school near Sturgeon Landing, in which a request is made for a report on the feasibility of erecting a small hydro-electric power plant and recommendations regarding water supply and sewage disposal systems. I shall be obliged if you will arrange to have this report made in accordance with the request of the Indian Department.\n\nWe are advised by the Department that Bishop Charlebois has already been in communication with you and that you have arranged to accompany him to the site of this school, for the purpose of obtaining the material for this report.\n\nThe report which is now desired would be in the nature of a preliminary investigation to outline the most desirable scheme for supplying the school with power and water. The exact location of the school has not yet been fixed and you should advise on that point, so that the location may be decided upon with due regard both to water supply and sewage disposal, as well as hydro-electric power if this should be decided upon. This scheme appears to be similar to the one now being carried out for the McIntosh school and probably the same conditions will govern construction methods.\n\nThe report which you are now asked to prepare will naturally be of a general nature, but any estimates of cost should be very carefully prepared. If the general plan submitted by you is approved by the Indian Department, detailed surveys and estimates will be necessary with specifications for the machinery required; these specifications also should be complete and accurate in detail, as the Indian Department will no doubt buy the machinery themselves, as they have decided to do in the case of the school at McIntosh.\n\nIt is probable also that unless this outside work is carried on at the same time as the building of the school that it will have to be done by day labour.\n\nThese considerations and other details which you will learn from the Inspector of Indian Agencies at Winnipeg should be of assistance in deciding whether or not to recommend the installation of a hydro-electric development.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. T. Johnston,\nDirector,\nWater Power and Reclamation.\n\nO. H.

A.\nLITHOPLATE\n\nManifestly the Perfect Composition Board\u2014Really Better Than Slate\n\nHas a Velvet Smooth Surface With Just Enough \"Bite\"\n\nThree Separate Layers of Abrasive Coating Black Color Resembling Slate\n\nLithoplate is better than natural stone slate and the various composition boards advertised as some other kind of \"plate.\" It is better because the surface is better than that of slate even\u2014it is easier to write on, and, due to its heavy body, it will last for years.\n\nLithoplate is better than other blackboards because it has a better writing surface; a surface that \"bites\" the crayon like a file, yet is velvety smooth to the hand or eraser; a surface that wears like steel. It will wear twice as long as the surface of other boards or plates applied with a brush or roller.\n\nLithoplate surface is composed of finely ground natural stone slate, mixed with carborundum to add abrasive qualities lacking in the slate and certain cement binding materials. This mixture is applied with a hand trowel in three separate coats.\n\nThe backing is a compressed pulp board, made from spruce sheets compressed under heavy pressure and cemented together to a thickness of one-quarter inch. This is thoroughly kiln dried and then made moisture proof to prevent warping.\n\nThe cost of Lithoplate is less than natural slate, being only about 60% of the slate price. The freight on Lithoplate, weighing one pound per square foot, is only one-sixth of that on slate weighing six pounds per square foot, making the final cost of Lithoplate less than one-half the cost of slate.\n\nLithoplate is never broken in shipment\u2014rarely if ever damaged. Hardly a shipment of slate is made without a certain percentage of breakage necessitating the bother and delay of replacement.\n\nSlate in its natural state is gray. It is stained black but even then it is not a dead black and soon fades to its natural color. Lithoplate is made a dead black, making markings stand out clearly and easily discernible.\n\nLithoplate comes in one piece any length up to 12 feet without a joint\u2014over 12 feet only one joint up to 24 feet, etc. Slate is rarely to be had over 4 feet, thus making a joint every 4 feet or less.\n\nHow to Order Lithoplate\n\nAfter deciding width or height wanted, measure exactly the length of each space to be filled, giving up a separate memorandum for each space as: One board 9 feet 4 inches by 3\u00bd feet, one board 3 feet 2 inches by 5 feet, etc. We cut the plate to any specified length, but fractions of a foot will be charged for as a full foot.\n\nSelect Your Size\n\nThe stock lengths of LITHOPLATE are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 feet. The stock widths of LITHOPLATE are 2, 3\u00bd and 4 feet.\n\nGuaranty\n\nWe unreservedly guarantee every LITHOPLATE blackboard for ten years. This Guaranty covers warping, bulging, curling, breaking, scaling, peeling, cracking, becoming shiny or reflecting the light, providing the blackboards are installed in accordance with the simple directions accompanying each shipment.\n\nIndian Affairs.

We have therefore allowed for a cost of $5.00 per yard f.o.b. site.\n\nWith regard to excavation, Mr. Waddy informs us that not having definite information about the site, the cost of preparing it for the building, and the kind of excavating to be done cannot be gauged. In one place the excavation may be clay and boulders and in the other limestone may have to be blasted. We have therefore allowed the sum of $3195.00 as an upset price for all excavating, which includes the excavating necessary for the future portion of the building, but not including the footings for it.\n\nThe transporting of supplies from the docks to Sturgeon Landing is another item which cannot be definitely settled. We have allowed for moving 230 tons at a cost of $1150.00. If there is no roadway to be built, this amount may be ample, but on the other hand, if a road has to be prepared, or bush cleared to make it, an additional cost may be incurred.\n\nThese amounts are included as prime cost, and any actual cost above or below the amount stated to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe specifications do not state if ceiling boards will be required between the metal ceiling and the bottom of the joists. We have not included for them. If they are required, the additional cost will be $350.00.\n\nIt is not stated in the specifications or drawings if the sloping portion of the roof which will be exposed in the upper storey is to be covered with plaster or treated as ceilings and covered with metal. Kindly note our tender includes the covering of these surfaces with metal.\nOwing to the impossibility of visiting the site, and so arriving at a guaranteed cost, we suggest it will be to the interest of the Department for this work to be done on a commission basis. We offer to carry out all the work for cost, plus a fixed sum of $5,000.00.\n\nIn addition to the previous building work done for your Department, we have erected many other structures away from Winnipeg and located at about thirty different points scattered from Fort William to northern Alberta, and therefore have gathered a considerable experience in reaching out of the way places, the economical handling of camps, etc., and will be glad to place ourselves at your disposal in erecting the building at Sturgeon Landing.\n\nWe are very gratified indeed to have done so much work for your Department and trust this may be continued in the future.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nCLAYDON COMPANY LIMITED.\n\nEC/R.\n1 enclosure\n\nDuncan C.
