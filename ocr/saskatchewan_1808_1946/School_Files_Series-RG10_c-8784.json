Service such defects arise from defective workmanship or materials.\n\nElectrical Current:\n\n2300V DC cycle three phase current will be obtained from the local power company at a point about 600' distant from the main school building, where a pole top disconnect switch is to be installed.\n\nMetering:\n\nThe contractor is to install the following meters in conjunction with the B.C. Electric Power Company:\n\nMain School Building, Church, Manual Training Building and Cannery.\n\nThe metering of the single phase three wire lighting power and the three phase motor power for the above-mentioned buildings shall be accomplished by two meters, located in the main school building.\n\nFarm Buildings\n\nThe metering of the single phase three wire lighting power supplying these buildings shall be accomplished by a meter connected to the secondary side of a pole mounted transformer supplying these buildings.\n\nStaff Residences\n\nThe five residences shall be fitted with individual outside mounted meters.\n\nOutside Distributing System:\n\nGeneral:\nGeneral:\n\nThe contractor is to erect and install an outside primary distribution system with a secondary network, and service wires as shown on Plate I of Plan 106. The British Columbia Electric Power Company will supply the transformers and make the necessary installation and connections for the transformers at the poles upon which they are mounted. This entire system is to be installed in a manner to conform with the rules for the construction of overland electric lines in British Columbia, passed by Order in Council under the \"Electrical Energy Inspection Act\" 1922.\n\nPoles:\n\nThe poles are to be winter cut and conform to Class \"B\" specifications of the B.C. Electric Power Company's Code. Each pole must be given a good brush coat of creosote on the butt, for a distance of seven feet from that end.\n\nPoles supporting both primary and secondary feeders are to have a minimum length of 40 feet and those supporting the secondary feeders alone are to be not shorter than 35 feet.\n\nSetting of Poles:\n\nIn normal firm ground the poles must be set to a depth of 6 feet and 5\u00bd feet respectively according to their length.\n\nIn digging and excavating pole holes, as little material as possible in excess of that necessary to admit and erect the pole is to be removed or disturbed. The diameter of holes dug in earth must be the same from top to bottom and sufficiently large to permit the use of a tamping bar on all sides of the pole.\n\nPoles are to be set to stand perpendicular when the line is completed so that no pole is more than 2\u00b0 out of line with the others. Poles at line terminals, angles and other points of abnormal stress are to be given a slight rake against the direction of the stress. Poles with a bend are to be placed with the bend in the direction of the line.\n\nIn straight runs alternate poles are to be set facing in opposite directions. Poles next to corner poles are to face the corner. Poles next to end poles are to face the end of the line.\n\nAfter a pole is in position, only one shovel is to be used in filling the hole, while three tampers continuously tamp until the hole is completely filled. When available, small size rocks should be used in the filling.\n\nGuying:\n\nGuys are to be installed wherever the wires tend to pull a pole or cross-arm out of place and when installed are to take up all of the strain so that the pole acts merely as a strut. The only exception to this rule is to be for angles up to ten degrees, when poles which carry not more than 4 No. 6 wires or 3 No. 4 wires are to be raked and the ordinary straight line construction used.\n\nLine Grading:\n\nThe length of the poles, if possible, is to be so proportioned to the contour of the ground that the difference between the level of the wires on adjacent poles shall not change by more than 10 feet.\n\nGround Clearance of Secondary Distribution Lines:\n\nThese lines shall have a minimum clearance of 20 feet to ground at the poles and no less than 18 feet to ground at any point over their span lengths.\n\nRacks:\nRacks:\n\nAll secondary distribution and service connection wires are to be supported on the poles by racks to give 8\" spacing between conductors. The racks should be attached to the poles by means of a 3/8\" through bolt at the top and a 1/2\" lag screw at the bottom as long as no service feeders are attached, in which case 5/8\" through bolts must be used at both points of attachment.\n\nPrimary Distribution Lines:\n\nThe existing supply wire is to be utilized for the primary distribution lines which will be carried on crossarms.\n\nSecondary Distribution Lines:\n\nThese lines are to be #4 Medium Hard Drawn Double Braided Weather Proof Wire.\n\nTransformers:\n\nThe transformers are to be of capacities as shown on Plate 1. Each transformer is to be protected by two expulsion cutouts fused appropriately adequately grounded, and mounted on the poles located on the above-mentioned drawing.\n\nClearances to Buildings:\n\nThe distribution lines are to be not less than five feet in a horizontal direction or eight feet in a vertical direction from any window, balcony or other part of any building.\n\nService Conductors:\n\nThe minimum size for the service conductors to the homes or other buildings is to be #6 Double Braided Weather Proof wire supported at the structure at a distance of not less than 15 feet from the ground level or sidewalk by end connectors.\n\nService Drops:\n\nThe service drops in all the outlying buildings, other than the Manual Training Building are to be No. 8 Thermoplastic-covered single braided wire carried in a 1\" galvanized conduit. Those in the Manual Training Building and Church are to be installed as shown on the plans. The service entrance cables are to be equipped with an approved rain type service head. Drip loops are to be formed on each conductor and a minimum of 30\" left for splicing.\nMemorandum to Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: Modification and Renewal to the Electrical System - St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn accordance with your instructions, I visited St. George's Indian Residential School on November 2nd, 1949, to inspect the electrical system at the school and obtain sufficient information to draw up plans to improve the lighting in the class rooms and also bring the entire system up to date to meet the requirements of the B.C. Electrical Code.\n\nGeneral Existing Conditions\n\n(1) The illumination in the class rooms, sewing room, manual training shop, kitchen, etc., was entirely inadequate.\n(2) The electrical distribution system to the main school and adjacent buildings is in poor condition, since the poles are badly decayed, and should be replaced.\n(3) The service entrance panels in all buildings are ungrounded.\n(4) The wire and conduit runs in the farm buildings in most cases are partially pulled down and many of the existing fixtures broken.\n(5) The wiring runs in the staff homes are in poor condition, the fixtures inadequate and not installed in accordance with B.C. Code requirements.\n(6) The staff rooms in the main school building have no utility outlets. At present, drop cords in most cases have been connected to the ceiling fixtures in a precarious manner.\n\nIn general, the entire system is in poor condition and requires many modifications. With this in mind, the attached specification and plans have been drawn up to bring the installation up to first class shape.\n\nProposed Alterations\n\nMain Supply Distribution System\n\nTo be rebuilt and modified as shown on the attached plans.\n\nMain School Block\n\n(1) New light and power service boxes and installations to be installed to feed the main school building, manual training building, and Church.\n(2) New multi-breaker panels to be installed to feed all circuits.\n(3) Fluorescent lights to be installed in class rooms, sewing room, staff dining room, scullery and kitchen.\n(4) Utility receptacles to be installed in the staff quarters.\n(5) Domestic purpose receptacles to be installed in laundry and sewing room.\n(6) Any existing fixtures in disrepair to be repaired or replaced.\n(7) Wiring is to be run in \u00bd\" conduit using #14 gauge Thermoplastic wire except as shown on plans.\n(8) Fire escape and exit lighting, and fire alarm system shall be installed as hereinafter specified.\n\n(9) The entire system to be modified to conform with the B.C. Electrical Code requirements.\n\n**Manual Training Building**\n\n(1) New light and power service box assemblies to be installed.\n\n(2) New multi-breaker panels to be installed to feed all circuits.\n\n(3) Fluorescent lights to be installed in the class room and manual training room.\n\n(4) Utility outlets and motor outlets to be installed as shown on plan. All permanent motors to be solidly connected.\n\n(5) Any existing fixtures in disrepair to be repaired or replaced.\n\n(6) Single phase circuits to be run with #14 ga. wire except as shown on plans.\n\n(7) The entire system to be modified to conform to the B.C. Electrical Code requirements.\n\n**Church Building**\n\n(1) Multi-breaker panel to be installed to feed all circuits.\n\n(2) Lamp holders to be replaced in basement outlets.\n\n(3) Any existing fixtures in disrepair to be repaired or replaced.\n\n**Farm Buildings and Teachers' Residences**\n\n(1) Each of the above-mentioned group of buildings is to be provided with a new service entrance installation with multibreaker panel.\n\nThe following is a list of the buildings with a general resume of the work required to bring their electrical installations to satisfactory standards.\n\nFor full details see appropriate plans attached to this report.\n\n**Cannery**\n\nTo be completely rewired in conduit with water-tight fixtures. Juicer to be wired with R.W. or T.W. wire.\n\n**Blacksmith Shop**\n\nTo be almost completely rewired in conduit.\n\n**Root House**\n\nTo be completely rewired in conduit using R.W. or T.W. wire.\n\n**Dairy Building**\n\n(1) Service entrance and multi-breaker panel to be installed.\n\n(2) Water-tight switches and one water-tight receptacle to be installed.

Electric Power Company.\n\nThe B.C. Electric Power Company has not definitely set its rates for diesel generated electric power in this territory. However, tentatively it is expected the rates charged to the school will be approximately as given below:\n\nLighting and 230V Single Phase Power - Commercial Rate\n\n0 - 1000 K.W. @ 6.5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n1000 - 2000 K.W. @ 4.5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n2000 - @ 2\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n\nThree Phase 230V Power\n\n0 - 300 K.W. @ 5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n300 - 0 @ 2\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n\nDomestic Rate for Homes with Individual Meters\n\n0 - 30 @ 6.5\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n30 - 230 @ 2\u00a2 per K.W. Hr.\n\nRecommendations\n\nIt is recommended that the work suggested above be carried out this summer as outlined in the accompanying plans and specifications to eliminate the fire hazard which presently exists and provide the class rooms and staff accommodation, etc., with modern light and power facilities when the school re-opens in the fall term. To initiate this project, tenders should be obtained in the near future from several reliable electrical contractors.\n\nThomas A.G.

Arnell, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nVancouver, B.C.,\n\n1 June 1950\nMemorandum to Mr. Arneil:\n\nRe: Modification and Renewal to the Electrical System - St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nEnclosed are four copies of a memorandum dated 1 June 1950 covering the above mentioned proposal.\n\nWe recommend that the work outlined in the memorandum be carried out this summer in order to eliminate the fire hazard which presently exists at the school and also provide the class rooms and staff accommodations, etc., with modern light and power facilities. This work, it would seem, should preferably be carried out prior to the reopening of the school in the fall.\n\nMr. Robinson and I felt it would be unwise to attempt to estimate the cost of this project since it is largely an overhaul job. For this reason, it would be more satisfactory to issue invitations to tender for the job to several reliable electrical contractors in this neighbourhood.\n\nThomas A. G.

Beechling, that the entire system is in poor condition, and requires many modifications and the work will be quite costly. It is also apparent that the present wiring constitutes a definite fire hazard.\n\nWill you please advise if there is any possibility of funds being made available this year for this work and if so, if it will be in order for us to approach Electrical Contractors for Tenders.\n\nW.S.

Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School. Your File 165/6-1-888\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 13th instant, enclosing memorandum in connection with modification and renewal of the electrical system at the above school.\n\nIf all the work suggested in the memorandum is carried out, we presume it will involve a considerable sum. No funds were specifically provided in the current year's appropriation for renewing the electrical system at this school, and in view of the expenditure which has been authorized for the domestic water system, funds at our disposal are not sufficient to provide the total amount that might be required.\n\nWe have approximately $2,000.00 available which we could use for repairs to the electrical system which are especially urgent.\n\nFunds to carry out the rest of the work required could be included in the 1951-52 Estimates.\n\nPlease refer the matter again to Mr. Beeching and let us hear further from you.\n\nBernard F. Neary,\nSupt. of Indian Education\nDear Mr Arneil:\n\nI hate like everything bothering you; for I know you will be busy up there. But perhaps you could find time to plead my cause a little in respect to a few wants we look upon as urgent.\n\nThe Department bought us a two ton truck in April 1939. It is hardly necessary for me to tell you that after running on these roads in this part of the country for eleven years, it is just a bill of expense to us. And yet, we cannot do without it. For we must use it for hauling coal from station, three miles away, and for hauling wood fuel from Lot 47, eight miles away. As well as using it for other freightage. Will you please see if you could place this urgent matter before them there, and get us a two ton truck of some reliable make, with a twelve foot body on it. We cannot do anything in the matter of buying ourselves; for it takes everything to buy the bare necessities of life; and yet, this present vehicle is unsafe on these roads, and is costing us too much in the way of repairs.\n\nWhile the pupils are out, I would like to do some painting and repair work to the interior of the building. We need paint $400.00, Lumber for lockers $150.00 and Hardware for locker hinges etc. $50.00.\n\nOur weather is hot, but we are doing alright. The Fraser stands steady at quite a high level. But it has been about the same level for some days, so we are hopeful of it not going any higher.\n\nWith kindest regards to yourself, the Major, Mr Phelan, and Col. Neary.\n\nI am, Yours sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.\nAIR MAIL\n\nJune 29th, 1950.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School\n\nWe have considered the contents of Canon Hives' letter of June 21st which you left in our office on the occasion of your recent visit.\n\nIt is not the practice of the Department to purchase a truck for use at a residential school. Consequently, no funds for this particular purpose were included in the current year's appropriation. However, there is an amount of slightly over $300.00 in the New England Company account at the present time, and we are prepared to forward this to the Principal, and if he so desires he can use it as the first payment on the cost of the new truck. Of course, the balance of the cost will have to be paid from school funds.\n\nPlease let me know if Canon Hives agrees with our proposal, and if so, we will forward a cheque for $300.00 to him.\n\nWe approve local purchase of the lumber for lockers in an amount not exceeding $150.00 and hardware for locker hinges in an amount not exceeding $50.00.\n\nPlease have the Principal forward a requisition for the paint required. It is understood that the cost of the paint required must not exceed $400.00.\n\nPP/ST\n\nBernard F.

I will see Mr Hett this morning about the paint etc.\n\nIt was a great disappointment to know that the Department cannot help us in the purchasing of a farm truck. I feel sure they must realize that we cannot possibly handle an expense of over three thousand dollars under present conditions, without depriving other departments of the school of the funds for necessary obligations which must be met. Our pupils, like all other children must be fed and clothed properly. The 6\u00bd increase in the per capita grant allowance does not begin to take care of the extra cost of living which has been forced on us, and which is still climbing. I feel sure that the Department is cognizant of this condition. We make a little out of the farm beyond what we require for our own consumption, but that is made by the sweat of my brow, at least. The little financial help we receive from New England Company is now so small, it has to be absorbed into paying for the necessary food and clothing for pupils.\n\nIn regard to taking the $800.00 from New England Company funds to make a down payment; I feel sure the Department do not really favour such a plan of making \"down payments\" on expensive machinery. Who knows how long I shall be here in charge? Looking back nine years, I see myself taking charge here loaded with a financial burden. In every way, I have tried to rid ourselves of that burden, in spite of the persistent increase in the cost of living. I would not, on any account purchase a truck by making a down payment of $800.00. As I said above, I do not know how much longer I shall be here, and I would not like to leave such a burden to my successor.\n\nIf the Department cannot see their way to buying a farm truck for us this year, and we really have no other source from which to draw financial help, I would ask that you kindly make a request to the Department for $400.00 of the New England Company funds, so that we may patch up again our old truck, with a hope that it may hang together over these mountain roads for another year, without any serious accident, until the Department is able to purchase another for us.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nRev.

Under separate cover he will be forwarded payment of $400, from New England Company funds.\n\nAt the present time we are not prepared to supply paint as he requested. Please point out to Mr. Hives that from the present year's appropriation we have already expended the following amounts for improvements at this school:\n\n| Description                          | Amount   |\n|--------------------------------------|----------|\n| Materials for domestic water supply | $1,994.60|\n| An accountable advance for labour    | $3,300.00|\n| Miscellaneous repairs                | $600.00  |\n\n$8,894.60\n\nIn addition, we intimated in official letter of June 26th that we would make available an amount of $2000.00 for repairs to the electrical system. It is felt that in view of the above expenditure we have dealt very fairly with this school during the current fiscal year.\n\nBernard F.

Vowell, Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nMy dear Sir:\n\nThere is in the immediate neighborhood of Lytton a site consisting of something over twenty acres which the Church of England some years ago leased from the Provincial Government and occupied as a Mission station.\n\nBefore our lease expired the Railway Belt was established and I am given to understand that the land now is possessed by the Dominion Government.\n\nI enclose a tracing of the neighborhood of Lytton on which I have designated the site I refer to by a red cross. The site is favourably situated for drainage, and water is conveniently and abundantly to be had from Lytton Creek.\n\nAlmost immediately adjoining this site I hold a pre-emption of 160 acres which only needs surveying for the Crown Grant to issue. For the purpose of farming agriculture or grazing this preemption would be a valuable adjunct to the school. One dollar per acre would require to be paid and a ditch would have to be dug for irrigation.\n\nUnder a skilful farm instructor this land might not only contribute largely to the support of the school but might even become remunerative.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) A. W., New Westminster.\nOttawa, 20th April, 1891.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st instant, No. 41672, covering an extract from a letter addressed on the 18th February last to Mr. Vowell by His Lordship, the Bishop of New Westminster with reference to the transfer of His Lordship's pre-emption to your Department for the purpose of a site for an Industrial School at\n\nThe Surveyor General reports that the land required for the site is probably in section 31, of township 14, Range 26, West of the 6th Meridian, but that there is no information by which the location can really be defined, no Dominion Lands Surveys having yet been made in the above township.

Y.) covering a communication from the Deputy of the Superintendent General I think I shall be right in saying that the land in question is not in section 31, Township 14 Range 26 West of the 6th Meridian, but in section 36 Township 14 Range 27. The Dominion Lands surveys have not yet reached the proposed site of the School, nor my pre-emption, though they have approached so nearly that it will be but a simple matter to include them.\n\nWith a view to correcting what may be a possible misconception you will allow me to point out that my pre-emption claim (which I am willing to transfer to the Indian Department for the purposes of a school in connection...\nconnection with the Church of England) is not\nthe site I recommend for the school buildings\nthemselves. The latter is situated somewhat to\nthe North of the pre-emption claim and consists\nof land formerly leased by the Church from the\nProvincial Government, and now, presumably, in\nthe possession of the Dominion Government as part\nof the Railway Belt.\n\nI beg to suggest that it would be convenient\nif the Government could direct any one of their\nsurveyors at present at work in the neighborhood\nto connect the proposed school site with the sur-\nveys already completed, and, by arrangement with\nthe Provincial Government, to survey my pre-emption\nclaim as well, and further, if the same surveyor\nwere directed to lay off a main irrigating ditch\nit would be less expensive than employing anyone\nspecially for the purpose. I have placed in the\nhands of the Dominion Lands Agent here the Original\nlease from the Prov.

That portion marked brown being Bleekth-a-muck Indian Reserve No. XVII, and containing 22\u00bd acres. The portion colored green being T.S.16, Sec. 35, and T.S.15, Sec. 36, acreage not known to me, has been reserved by Dominion Government for School purposes. This reserve also includes three lots of 5 acres each, colored yellow, which too have been reserved for School purposes. To the south of these sections lies what is known as Bishop Sicotte's pre-emption, not included in my sketch, as the ground is not considered necessary and is valuable for agricultural or pasture purposes.\n\nThese plots, colored brown, green and yellow would be ample in area for the purpose for which they are intended. They occupy a high plateau and that colored green is intersected near the boundary of Indians.\n\nA.M. Vowell Esq.,\nIndian Superintendent,\nVictoria\n\nReserve\nReserve by a deep gorge through which flows Kington Creek, from which water for irrigation purposes could be obtained.\n\nThe amount of land at present fit for cultivation is relatively small. On Klichk\u2014a much reserve about eight or ten acres are at present fit for cultivation. The soil is light, but well suited for garden purposes. The greater portion of Sec. 35 and Sec. 36 is covered thinly with a growth of scrubby pines. The land would be easily cleared and portions of it would with plenty of water produce well.\n\nThe attitude of the Indians towards a surrender of Klichk\u2014a much reserve is favorable.

The Bishop's Synod had most recently approved the site recommended by the committee which had been previously inspected and approved by the Indian Agent Irvine.\n\nIt is a piece of land 11 acres in extent known as the Clarke's Point Reserve adjacent to the site selected by the late Bishop with a gully into running. It is believed to contain that also additional land for cultivation when need arises. I hope that you will accord your sanction to the Agent's proposal. Steps are being taken to have the land released by the tribe to the Government, and I trust that after this long delay the matter will be able to go forward, so shall be most grateful for any help that you can afford us with respect to the plans.\n\nBelieve me,\n\nYours very faithfully,\nRichard Small\n\nA W Woodley Bay\nIndian Superintendent\nVictoria\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,\n\nReverting to your letter dated 12th June 1896 relative to a site for the proposed school at Lytton, I have the honour to submit hereewith for your approval the Ven.

The Indians in council with the consent of the Indian Agent agreed to give the school 1 acre. This was duly fenced in after clearing the land but the acre was never conveyed to the New England Missionary Society. I brought the matter before the Royal Commission on Indian Lands at their meeting in Lytton and understood they would recommend the final conveyance of the land for the Indians to the school.

The Principal should see that a man with a good knowledge of farm work is obtained.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nExtract from Rev. R. H. Cairn's Report on the Lytton Industrial School for April 1, 1921.\n\nIn my opinion, this school has always been overmanned. The farm has not paid. I pointed this out to the late Principal, but he thought he could make it pay.\n\nThere are about 30 acres in the piece of land on which the buildings have been erected. If this were used as a school farm and garden, and if a system of intensive cultivation were pursued, there could then be some hope of putting things in good shape. As it is now the men connected with the farm do not earn their wages. The farm is a liability.\n\nMy plan would be to lease the balance of the land, or by some method make such an arrangement that the farm would be an asset, the profits being turned over to the school. At present the land is not used to advantage. The system is too complicated. Very few men would be able to take the farm and school as it is and make it a going concern.\n\nOver a year ago, I suggested to Mr. Laronde a scheme of this kind. I also discussed the matter with the Agent, Mr. Graham, today. I am convinced that the farm will be operated at a loss till it is put on a new basis.\n\nI intended to visit this school in May, but at the request of Mr. Graham I went earlier. I had a conference with members of the staff. I asked the Girls' Matron to remain till June 30. She is a very fine woman and was inclined to leave at the end of the present month. I have not heard what she actually did.\n\nI tried to pour oil on the troubled waters. It was a matter of surprise to me to find the school work going along so very smoothly. The danger was that a number of the teachers would resign and cause confusion by having inexperienced teachers take their places.\nOttawa, Nov. 9th, 1921.\n\nDear Mr. Mathews,\n\nI am also enclosing a draft of the proposed lease of St. George's School at Lytton, B.C. We do not appear to have at the Department a description of this property, nor am I aware as to how the property is held, whether in the name of trustees or in the name of the Company itself. I will accordingly have to rely on you to insert the necessary description and to have the document executed by the proper persons.\n\nDuncan C.

H. S. R.\n\nGood Standing\n\n82-208\n\nSpur Wryed\nSir,\n\nMr. Lett, principal of St. George's School, advises me that the Dominion Land & Crown Timber Office, Department of the Interior, at Kamloops, is charging him up for dues on firewood, and also for some lumber cut from logs taken off the school's own property at Lot 47, and adjoining land purchased by the New England Company.\n\nI wrote the Land Agent at Kamloops advising him that all this land was taken over by the Indian Department for St. George's Industrial School, and should certainly be exempt from timber dues, as it was all cut off school property, and not off crown land. He replied that according to the records this land still stood in the name of the New England Company, and had not been transferred to the Indian Department, and under the Act purchased land was due for fees for any wood cut. The firewood that was cut was all old timber lying down, which would have to have been burnt up to clear the land, and instead of doing this, they hauled some of it to the school for firewood. It appears the Department of the Interior would rather see all of this burnt up on the ground, than let us make use of it for firewood at the school, where some good is being done with it. We did cut some trees off school property to have flume lumber for the school made out of.\n\nI trust the Department will take this up with the proper authorities.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nHG/MD Ottawa.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, January 5, 1924.\n\nSir:\n\nThe New England Company, of London, England, own property near Lytton, B.C., which is known as the St. George's Indian Residential School. The Department of Indian Affairs has lately leased the institution and its land for a period of 21 years.\n\nThe Rev. Principal advises me that the Dominion Land and Crown Timber Office at Kamloops is charging him for dues on firewood and also for some lumber cut from logs taken off the school's own property on lot 47. This lot is described as \"all that parcel or lot of land situate in Yale Division of Yale District, said to contain 150 acres more or less and more particularly described on the map or plan annexed to the Crown Grant, dated the 17th October 1901 and coloured red and numbered lot 47, group one, on the official plan or survey of the said Yale Division of Yale District in the Province of British Columbia.\"\n\nI should be pleased if you would inform me how to instruct the principal of the school. He wishes to cut firewood from old, lying timber and is asking this Department to arrange, if possible, that there be no dues.\n\nI might add, for your information, that the St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton is financed and controlled, under the terms of the lease with the New England Company, entirely by this Department.

This land is irrigated from Lytton Creek.\n\nThis area consists of about 10 acres which has been cleared of timber and brushwood. Also considerable work has been taken off and cultivated with the aid of cultivation which system entails considerable expense for the construction of a ditch and flume. Lots Nos. 2 & 3 and that portion of Lot No. 1 lying east of the waggon road is all enclosed by an eight-strand wire fence. Apparently there has been quite a dispute in connection with this land between the Church of England Mission, the Department of Indian Affairs and the Provincial Government, and upon which considerable correspondence has taken place at different times since 1868.\n\nFrom what I can learn by personal observation in our office and in conversation with Archdeacon Bishop and one A.F. Hauley, an oldtimer who was residing at Lytton at the time that the Reverend J.S. Good established the Mission at Lytton, it would appear that when the Reverend Mr. Good came to the Lytton District to establish in connection with the Church of England the Indian Mission about 1868, he purchased from Mr. Vincent Petit his rights and improvements on\n\nHomestead Inspector.\n\nInspected\n\n[SECTION DIAGRAM OVER.]\nHOMESTEAD INSPECTOR'S REPORT.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY FORM.\n\nNo. of Report\n\nName of Homestender\n\nLand: ________of Sec. ________Tp. ________Rg. ________M.\n\nGeneral Remarks Continued:\n\nA certain piece of land known as the Vincent Petit Pre-emption, just what land the Petit pre-emption included does not appear to have been clearly understood by the Church of England Authorities, and when survey was made by the Provincial Government, some mistakes evidently were made in connection with the Petit Pre-emption and Lot No. 225. The Petit pre-emption and improvements are shown me by Mr. Hamilton, together with the sketch map of same now on file in our Office. This map is an old one and shows the pre-emption as originally staked out, starting from a point on Lytton Creek near the centre of L.S. 13 of Sec. 10, plane to the North, and runs West, bearing slightly to the South along the top bank of Lytton Creek for a distance of seven hundred yards to the high bank of the Fraser River, thence South and Southwesterly along the river bank for a distance of five hundred yards thence East bearing slightly to the North for a distance of four hundred yards North-Easternly to point of commencement for a distance of two hundred yards. This sketch shows that Lots Nos. 1, 2, and 3 and the Northern portion of Lot No. 225 were included within the original Petit pre-emption. Mr. Petit's house and barn were erected near the southwest corner of Lot No. 3. He had also cleared and cultivated a certain amount of land on Lots Nos. 1, 2, and 3; also cleared and cultivated some land on L.S. 15 of Sec. 35, part of which was destroyed in the construction of the C.P.R. right-of-way. After the war, Mr. Petit had acquired the Petit pre-emption. In 1868, he erected his residence and Mission Church and School near the South boundaries of Lots Nos. 2 and 3, and which were in use for a good many years until the Church and School were moved to the town of Lytton for greater convenience. Since then, the buildings on Lots Nos. 2 and 3 have been removed, but the land on\n\nHomestead Inspector.\n\nInspected\n\n[SECTION DIAGRAM OVER.]\nHOMESTEAD INSPECTOR'S REPORT.\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY FORM.\n\nNo. of Report\n\nName of Homesteader\n\nLand: ________of Sec. ________Tp. ________Rg. ________M.\n\nGeneral Remarks Continued:\n\nLots No. 1, 2, and 3 have been in use by the Mission.\n\nIt would appear, along about 1875, Lots Nos. 1, 2, and 3 were transferred to the Department of Indian Affairs for the purpose of erecting an Industrial School which was to be under the control of what is known as the New England Company. Apparently, the site was not suitable, and the Industrial School was located elsewhere. The New England Company\u2014which managed the Industrial School\u2014must not be mixed up with the Church of England Mission, which I understand are two separate organizations, and as the Church of England Mission has continued to make use of the land on Lots Nos. 1, 2, and 3, and having acquired the rights in the land in the first place and seeing that the New England Company have never made any claim to the land and never acquired it, Archdeacon Puck is very anxious to have the matter taken up with the Department of Indian Affairs with a view to having title to Lots Nos. 1, 2, and 3 transferred to the Church of England Mission or the Diocese of Cariboo.\n\nI am strongly of the opinion that this should be done as the Mission have a very strong moral claim, seeing that they have been in undisputed possession for so many years, and having spent considerable money in connection with the irrigation system, the fencing, and clearing of the land besides the original purchase price of $1500.00 paid by the Reverend Mr. Good for the Vincent Petit rights and improvements to the land, which beyond any doubt, in my mind, included Lots Nos. 1, 2, and 3.\n\nJas.

It would appear from the correspondence that the school was not erected on these lots and that they have been used for many years by the Church of England Mission which considered them part of the Petit preemption, which was acquired by the Mission from the original preemptor in 1868.

The British Columbia Lands Branch of the Department of the Interior informs me that these lots have been used for many years by the Church of England Mission, which considered them part of a petit preemption which was acquired in 1868 by the Rev. Mr. Good on behalf of the Mission from the original preemptor.

I have written today to our local Indian agent and immediately upon receipt of his answer you will be further advised.

If they could be retained in this way they would be of some value to us, but if not, as far as I can see, there would be no objection to them being transferred back. We are always in need of land, and therefore it seems foolish to let what we own slip from us.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist Deputy & Secretary\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHG/MD\nSir:\n\nWith reference to your File No. 165-0-9, and your enquiry of the 5th ultimo, with reference to timber operations conducted on behalf of St. George's Industrial School, I beg to advise you that the branch had previous information with reference to operations on behalf of the school, and was advised that 6000 feet B.M. had been cut on Legal Subdivision 5 of Section 32, and Legal Subdivision 8 of Section 31, Township 15, Range 26, West of the 6th Meridian, outside of Lot No. 47, which had been purchased by the New England Company, the deed reserving the timber to the Crown. 14000 feet B.M. had also been cut on Lot No. 47, which according to information available is an old Provincial lot, and the grant issued did not reserve the timber to the Crown.\n\nThe decision reached was that no dues are of course payable on Lot No. 47, but on the 6000 feet B.M. cut outside of the lot licence dues are to be charged if the material was cut in clearing the lands for agricultural purposes, but otherwise permit dues are to be assessed.\n\nPossibly the Rev. Principal of the School does not understand the precise application of this decision, as probably the agent is endeavouring to collect whatever dues are payable on the 6000 feet cut outside of the lot, and not on timber cut on the lot as claimed by the Rev. Principal.\n\nAt any rate any timber cut on Lot 47 is not subject to dues, but any cut on Legal Subdivision 5 of Section 32 and Legal Subdivision 8 of Section 31, Township 15, Range 26, West of the 6th Meridian, outside of the lot, is subject to dues as specified above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

It transpires that these lands, otherwise described as Lots 1, 2 and 3 of Legal Subdivision 16, in the above named section, are no longer required for the purpose for which they were originally transferred, and that as a matter of fact they have been used for a number of years by the Church of England Mission. The Department of the Interior now requests the return of these lots, and as the Schools Branch approves of such action, I would recommend that the Order in Council of the 13th of May, 1893, be rescinded, and a memorandum to Council prepared, providing for the return of these lands to the Department of the Interior.\n\n[Signature]\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\n\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\n\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 21, 1924.\n\nHis Excellency\nThe Governor General in Council\n\nThe undersigned begs to state that, upon application having been made to the Department of the Interior by the Department of Indian Affairs for a grant of fifteen acres in Section 35, township 14, range 27, W.6 M., in the province of British Columbia, otherwise described as Lots 1, 2 and 3 of legal subdivision 16 in the above named section, the same being required for the purposes of an Indian industrial school, an Order of His Excellency the Governor General in Council was passed on the 13th May, 1893 (Ref.

We are informed by the Department of the Interior that timber cut on Lot 47 is not subject to dues, but that any cut on Legal Sub-divisions 5 and 8, outside of the Lot, is subject to dues, as the deed to the New England Company for these two Sub-divisions reserves the timber to the Crown. According to information available, Lot 47 is an old Provincial lot, and the grant issued did not reserve the timber on this lot to the Crown.\n\nYou will be good enough to inform the Principal of the Lytton Residential School accordingly.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1649)\n\nLytton, B. C., March 10/24.\n\nMr. W. Graham,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Mr. Graham:\n\nReferring to letter No. 165-8-9 dated Feb. 29th to which you called my attention, I wish to make the following remarks. In the first place the wood which the Department of the Interior is asking me to pay tax upon, is wood cut from trees, which prior to my coming here were slashed and left to decay. In the cutting there was not one green tree felled. It seems to me to be an absolute absurdity to be forced to pay for wood of this sort. I was in hopes that I would be able to cut this wood without any unfair restrictions in the way of such tax imposed by the Department of the Interior, as wood on the School lot is getting very limited. It will simply mean this that I shall be obliged to either ask the Department of Indian Affairs to increase our coal requisition or have the Indians cut firewood for the school, increasing our expenses but decreasing work which the staff could easily do and the only expense incurred would be the hauling, which would be a very small item, especially when we shall have the truck. It seems as though anything that I do in this manner, that would save expenses, both for ourselves and the Department, is sat upon by another Department, and I am unable to get anywhere.\n\nRe the lumber saved. These trees were cut on land for which we asked for a special grant to raise the dam at Bootanee Lake, that there might be enough water to increase acreage and there should be no charge for trees cut for clearing purposes. Furthermore the lumber cut was used in building a dairyman's residence for which a special grant was issued. This grant has not all been used up and this expense could be defrayed through this channel, and would not be a direct expense to the school. I do not see why anyone should be obliged to pay this overhead charge under the circumstances and the purposes for which the lumber and wood is being used. I might say that if I have to pay the tax on the wood it will be done with some reluctance as I do not consider it a fair charge.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n(A.R. Lett)\nprincipal.\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter dated Feb. 29, in reply to mine of November 26th, 1923, in which the Department advised me that St. George's Indian Industrial School must not take any wood away from the lots bought by the New England Company, and now held by the Indian Department.\n\nI have shown this letter to the Reverend Principal and am now enclosing a letter which he has written to me in reply.\n\nIt seems to me that now that this land is held by another Department the school should be allowed the use of this wood, instead of having to just cut it down and burn it up on the ground, as we wish to clear the land for agricultural purposes. Economy is always being preached, especially by the Forestry Branch for preservation. Surely it is to their advantage to have this cut and cleared rather than slash it down and burn it up on the ground, and run the risk of standing timber being burnt, which there is always a big chance of when clearing land. It does seem absurd that the Land Department would rather have this burnt up on the ground than to allow one to cut it up properly and use it for fuel.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Lett of Lytton dues on 6000 feet B.M. of sawlogs and 50 cords of wood cut in the actual clearing of L.S. 5 of Section 32, and N.E. 8 of Sec. 31, lying outside of Lot No. 47, Tp. 15, Rge. 26, W. 6th Meridian. It appears that they have transferred the land in question to the Indian Department in Ottawa, and, therefore, that Department should be responsible for the dues. No doubt the cutting was done under direction of their agent in Lytton.\n\nAs the timber was cut on land suitable for cultivation, the dues will amount to $6.00 on the sawlogs and $20.00 on cordwood or $27.00 including the permit. If you are successful in collecting that amount, please let me know and advise me how to apply it.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) James Bannerman,\nAgent.\n\nB.L.

Maclean, Secretary of the Department of Indian Affairs, a copy of which was forwarded to yourself.\n\nAdvice was submitted to this department in reply that the Agent of the Department of Indian Affairs had been advised that timber cut on Legal Subdivisions 5 and 8, outside of Lot No. 47, was subject to dues.\n\nPossibly in the meantime you have come to an understanding with the Agent of the Department of Indian Affairs, and secured settlement.

Possibly, however, the Agent of Department of Indian Affairs may refer the matter to the department.\n\nIn the meantime pending further advice from either of the agents, matter may remain in abeyance for a reasonable time, say sixty days, to see if settlement has been effected, unless you are aware of the fact that the Agent of the Department of Indian Affairs is waiting action on your part, which might be immediately taken towards effecting settlement.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.D.

Before this can be done, however, it is necessary to do a considerable amount of clearing which Mr. Lett has informed me has been commenced already, but it is essential in any event that if the Licence is to be retained the land should be put under cultivation at an early date.\nOttawa, November 24, 1925.\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nI have to inform you that Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn was lately successful in having the Board of Investigation withhold cancellation of Conditional Water Licence No. 687, Botanie Creek. It appears that land should be brought under cultivation and the water used. Mr. Ditchburn informs me that you have already commenced clearing; but he states that it is essential to the retention of the licence that land should be put under cultivation at an early date. I should be grateful if you would let me have a report concerning what action you are taking to this end. In the meantime, I have telegraphed Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn that the Department is taking early steps to secure title to the lands of the school and he is hopeful that an extension of time on the water licence will be granted.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

Cossitt of Vernon, B.C., suggested therein as Appraiser, that he will be unable to act in this connection. The Minister is informed that Colonel C.E. Edgett, of Vernon, is prepared to act, and it is therefore desired that this work be given to Colonel Edgett.\n\nW.J.F. Pratt,\nPrivate Secretary.\nOttawa, June 10, 1926.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nMr. Ferrier,\n\nColonel C.H. Edgett, of Vernon, B.C., is to be engaged as Appraiser of the Lytton Industrial School property.\n\nD.S.G.I.A.\nSir:\n\nI would request you to kindly refer to your File No. 165-0-9, and your letter of the 5th January, 1924, addressed to this branch, and reply thereto, dated 13th February, 1924, wherein you had been advised that in connection with timber operations conducted on behalf of the St. George's Industrial School at Lytton, B.C., 14,000 feet B.M. had been cut on Lot 47 in Township 15, Range 26, West of the 6th Meridian, which had been sold to the New England Company without reserving the timber to the Crown, and that 6,000 feet B.M. had been cut on Legal Subdivision 8 of Section 31, and Legal Subdivision 5 of Section 32, just outside of Lot 47, which also had been sold to the New England Company, but the timber on which was reserved to the Crown. Moreover, 50 cords of wood had also been cut for the school on the lands mentioned above, outside of Lot 47.\n\nThere was, therefore, no dues payable to the department on the 14,000 feet B.M., cut on Lot 47, but $6.00 was payable on the 6,000 feet B.M. cut outside of the lot, and this amount has been paid, but there is still outstanding dues at 4\u00bd per cord on the 50 cords of wood, $20.00, and $1.00 per mile fee, totalling $21.00, which have not been paid.\n\nMoreover, it is noted that by your memorandum of the 21st March, 1923, (your file not quoted, but presumably the same file), that Legal Subdivision 8 of Section 31, and Legal Subdivision 5 of Section 32, is owned by the New England Company, but leased to the Department of Indian Affairs, and that your department are financing from parliamentary appropriation, and are wholly responsible for the conduct and management of the Lytton Industrial School.\n\nMoreover, it is noted from your letter of the 29th February, 1924, addressed to this branch, that you had advised your Agent at Lytton\n\nJ.D. McLean, Esq.,\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa,\nOntario.\nthat any timber cut on Lot 47 was not subject to dues, but any cut on Legal Subdivisions 5 and 8, outside of Lot 47, was subject to dues.\n\nIn the meantime, therefore, the Agent of Dominion Lands at Kamloops, B.C., has been endeavouring to collect the $21.00 payable on the cordwood, but without success. It was stated when a timber inspector recently interviewed the Reverend A.R. Lett, Principal of the School, the reverend gentleman informed the inspector that he did not feel disposed to pay anything for the wood, as it was cut from dry fallen timber, which was going to waste in the woods, and as the Industrial School was not run for any profit making, he could not understand why the school should be called on to pay for wood that was going to waste. He was informed by the inspector that it was the practice of the department to assess dues on all timber whether fallen or standing, but the reverend gentleman stated that he would call at the Kamloops Timber Office later and further discuss the matter with the Agent of Dominion Lands. This was in May last, and apparently nothing further has developed, as no further advice has been received from the agent of this department, who, however, made enquiry at the time whether the department would approve of allowing the school the wood they had cut under Clause (d) of Section 48 of the regulations, which authorizes the issue of free permits \"for the construction of educational, religious and charitable institutions.\" You will appreciate the fact, however, that cordwood cannot be placed under such a classification.\n\nThe fact that this department finds it necessary to make no exceptions in levying dues payable to this department particularly in the railway belt of British Columbia, where there are considerable portions of this tract which have been disposed of with the timber reserved to the Crown, while other portions have been disposed of without reservation of the timber to the Crown, and the department wishes to impress upon all settlers and residents as much as possible the fact that they should take particular care to know whether their title to the land included the right to cut timber also. Moreover, the department does not follow the practice of making any exceptions and the penalty for cutting timber without authority, which includes trespass as in this instance, is the assessment of three times ordinary permit dues. In the case of the school the penalty assessable under the regulations would be $63.00 per cord, or three times the regular permit rate of $20 per cord. However, the department offered to accept from the St. George's Industrial School payment of single license dues of 40\u00a2 per cord on the cordwood, which was obtained by the school. Moreover, following consideration of the fact that Rev. Mr. Lett had advised\nadvised that the wood which was secured was dry and fallen timber, it has been decided to assess against the 50 cords which was obtained, the usual rate charged on dry timber, which is 25\u00a2 per cord.\n\nIf, therefore, you will kindly take action to have $12.50 dues and $1.00 permit fee paid to the Agent of Dominion Lands at Kamloops, B.C., or to this branch, the Agent of Dominion Lands at Kamloops will be authorized to issue a timber permit to the St. George's Industrial School covering the 50 cords of dry logs already obtained, which will be forwarded to the Rev. Mr. Lett, Principal of the School, to have him take affidavit on the back of the permit that 50 cords only of dry wood had been obtained thereunder. Moreover, the agent will be authorized to issue each season to the school a timber permit covering whatever quantity of dry wood the school will expect to need each year subject to dues at 25\u00a2 per cord, with $1.00 permit fee payable in each instance also.\n\nCopy of this letter is being forwarded to the Agent of Dominion Lands at Kamloops, B.C., for his information, and whether payment is made direct to the department or to the Agent of Dominion Lands through your Agent at Lytton, B.C., action will be taken and an understanding reached as outlined above.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nG.P. Pereira,\nActing Controller.\nOttawa, October 22, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 609738 T & G of the 19th instant, with reference to timber dues and permit fee covering 50 cords of dry wood which has been taken by the Rev. Principal of the Indian Residential School at Lytton, B. C. Under separate cover, there will be directed to you a cheque for $13.50. I am writing to our local representative, explaining that in future a fee will have to be paid on timber cut on Legal Subdivisions 5 and 8, outside of Lot 47, T. 15, R. 26, W. 6th.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKensie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nThe Controller,\nTimber & Grazing Lands Branch,\nDepartment of the Interior,\nOttawa, Ont.\nOttawa, October 22, 1926.\n\nI wish to refer to official letter of this file of February 29, 1924. The Department is satisfied that dues should be paid for any timber that is cut on Legal Subdivisions 5 and 8, outside of Lot 47, T. 15, R. 26, W. 6th. The Department of the Interior have decided on a permit fee of $1 and 25\u00a2 per cord, as this is dry timber. The Department is issuing a cheque for the permit fee and the dues for the 50 cords which were cut some time ago. The Rev. Principal will receive a timber permit covering the 50 cords already obtained and he should take an affidavit on the back of the permit that 50 cords only of dry wood were secured. The local agent of the Timber and Grazing Lands Branch will also be authorized by his headquarters to issue each season to the school a timber permit covering whatever quantity of dry wood the school requires each year, subject to dues at 25\u00a2 per cord with $1 permit fee payable in each instance. A copy of this letter is enclosed, for transmission to the Rev. Principal.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst.

I have also marked the proposed site of the New Building and as you will see this part of the reserve is directly in front of the School Buildings.\n\nTo get immediate access to the main Highway the road to join should go through this property as I have indicated.

With this land cutting in as it does I am obliged to break up a small portion of land for corn potatoes and vegetables on some other part of the farm away from the main cropped acreage thus inconveniencing proper rotation pasturage etc. The Indians working this piece of land take the water for irrigation purposes out of the School ditch and this is an endless nuisance and constant irritation as they come along any old time and help themselves to water causing our Irrigator a great deal of trouble and extra work in rearranging his water and when he has just finished rearranging they turn the water back again resulting in confusion in irrigation in fact our Irrigator never knows where he is at during the summer season. Again Indians no matter how hard-working and prosperous they are will not clean up their land and the piece of land is a constant source of weed infection to the School property. The manner also in which they keep their land will not much lend itself as a frontage for the New School.\n\nI have already had some correspondence with Commissioner Ditchburn regarding the School's acquiring this part of the reserve and he suggested that Mr. Indian Agent Graham and myself see what we could do in regard to perhaps buying a piece of land from some other Indian in the Reserve who wishes to sell and give this in lieu of the part within the school property. I have talked this over with Mr. Graham and we have found an old Indian who has said he would sell but on again approaching him he was not inclined to sell to me thinking perhaps I was out for to benefit myself or to in some way do the Indians. This Indian is now receiving an annuity from the Dept. towards his support and I could arrange to substitute this by giving him a few sacks of potatoes and vegetables to help him through the winter months.\n\nThe piece of land between the school lots if not in some way transferred to the school will be an endless bother and as you can see by its situation it, in reality, should belong to the School property. If it could be arranged for transfer immediately it would give an opportunity to do some road grading in readiness for the heavy hauling of the material for the New Building otherwise it will all have to be done through the present school yard. With it we could also begin rearranging our fences and perhaps if time could be found plant some trees.

For your information I might say that the No. 21 Reserve, has very great difficulty every year in getting water onto their reserve, owing to the great length of the ditch, and if this particular piece tried to get it from this source, they would never get anything, so through the kindness of Mr. Lett he has allowed them to take the water through the school ditch, and from the joint ditch from the creek, between the school and the Indians, but there is really no licence from this source for this piece.\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H.

Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School, with reference to the acquisition of that portion of Indian Reserve No. 21 which is situate between Lots 11 and 12. I believe it advisable for you and Mr. Lett to continue your efforts to arrive at a satisfactory arrangement with the Indians or Indians who are on the property in question. In the meantime, you might let me have a report, with rough sketch, showing the Indian holdings. Would it be desirable to have a small portion of land to the west of the Lillooet-Lytton road? If an additional Indian has to be dealt with to secure the land across the road, it might be undesirable to extend the eastern boundary of Lot 12. If you examine the blue print directed to you last year, you will understand my point.\n\nI should like to know if those holding the land desired are agreeable to moving. If so, it might be well to again approach the old Indian mentioned by Mr. Lett, with a view to securing his property, on which the Indians to be moved could be placed. I am enclosing a copy of this letter, which you may hand to Mr. Lett.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nEXTRACT FROM REPORT OF INSPECTOR CAIRNS\n\nFeb. 8 and 9, 1927, on the\nLytton Indian Residential school.\n\nGENERAL REMARKS:\n\nThere are twelve acres that divide the school\nlands. This should be bought and added to the present school\nproperty. I would respectfully recommend that the Depart-\nment look into this matter before the erection of the new\nbuilding.\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated February 23rd, in reply to mine of the 14th ult., enclosing a communication from the Reverend Principal of Lytton Residential School.\n\nIn reply I beg to state that the Reverend Principal and I had another meeting with the Indians last week, with a view to trying to come to some satisfactory arrangements with them, that is with the Indian family who now occupy along the Lytton R.R. No. 11 situated between Lots 11 and 12, which is the land we would like to obtain, in order to get an outlet to the highway through this particular piece of land. The old Indian with whom we expected to exchange a portion of land refused to give it up, as he had willed his land away to his small boy. Then again the Indians who occupy the portion between Lots 11 and 12, refused to consider any proposition of any description, although they could find another piece of land from which they could derive the same benefit as they are now getting from this piece.\n\nI am enclosing a sketch, as per your request, showing the position marked out as that we wish to get, right below this that the school is under the \"trees\", so you will see from the diagram how essential it is that the school should obtain this piece, in order to get access to the new school, besides a piece of Indian Reserve running in between the school properties in this way is always going to be a detriment.\n\nThere is a portion of land on Lot 11, above the wagon road, and the present school, that is uncultivated, and to which water could very easily be got by building a new ditch. It would take a very little work to put five acres under cultivation, and another five with very little more work.\n\nIn regard to your suggestion that a small portion of land to the west of the Lytton-Lillooet Road be used, I might say that there is no land available above the road, so this would be out of the question.\n\nThe Indians whom we want to exchange lands with, claim they have no money to start on new land, so if the Department could see its way to assisting them this might be a solution to the difficulty.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nH. Graham\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, March 18, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 1-A-15/21 of the 9th instant, with further reference to securing that portion of Lytton I. R. No. 21 east of the Lillooet-Lytton road situate between Lots 11 and 12. I note the difficulty you are having in connection with securing quit claims from the Indians holding the land. I note, also, your suggestion that the Department offer these owners assistance if they move to other property. See what arrangements you can make and let me have an estimate of the cost. Your early attention to this matter is requested.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nLytton, B.C.,\nApril 19, 1927.\n\nC. H. Pitts, Esq.,\nAshcroft, S.C.\n\nSir:\n\nThe chief and council want me to write to you about trouble here with the water. Mr. Graham and Lett will not give Charlie Cisco any water for his place, they want him to give his land to the school and to take Alex George's land instead and then the Government to pay Alex George and his wife every month from the store, because Charlie Cisco is not willing to give his land to the school, they will not let him have water. Charlie Cisco worked in the ditch with the rest but Mr. Lett would not pay him and he told Ivor Cisco not to do any ploughing in the land. We want you to find out if this comes from Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\nChief Johnny Rapheal.\n\nSecry.\nMr. Raymond Dunstain.\nAshcroft, B.C. April 25, 1927.\n\nSecretary Department of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nSir:\n\nI beg to inclose herewith a copy of a letter I have received from Chief Johnny Rapheal which explains itself.\n\nI had, before this, explained to the chief that the Indian School could expropriate land from the Indians if necessary, but that the Indian must receive compensation. Apparently this procedure is not being taken.\n\nThe Indians in the Lytton district have asked me to look after their interests for them, and on or about February 11 last they signed a petition addressed to the Department asking that they be allowed to retain me to investigate their water rights, and that I be paid out of the funds in their credit at Ottawa, and handed this petition to the agent at Lytton, Mr. Graham, to be forwarded to you; nothing further has been heard of the petition. They have told me on several occasions that they have no confidence in their agent, and I believe this is the reason for their wishing me to act on their behalf so that they may obtain their rights.\n\nI would be glad to hear from you in connection with\nthis as I do not wish to stir up discord or encourage discontent without knowing that I would have the backing of the Department in rectifying any grievance that might become apparent.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nP/C\nOttawa, May 3, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, enclosing copy of a communication from Chief Johnny Rapheal, of Lytton, concerning the Department's proposal to take over a certain portion of Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21 for the use of the Indian residential school. I may inform you that the Department does not propose to expropriate, under the authority of the Indian Act, until every effort of arriving at an amicable arrangement with the Indian holders has been exhausted. At the present time, Mr. Indian Agent Graham, of Lytton, is empowered to offer these Indians assistance if they move to other property. If we expropriate, the Indians will receive fair compensation.\n\nRelative to the penultimate paragraph of your letter, I may say that, on the 7th ultimo, the Department wrote to Johnny Rapheal, at Lytton, to the effect that we considered it unnecessary for him and those associated with him to employ a solicitor in connection with water records. It was stated that the officials of this Department, the Dominion Water Powers Branch and the Provincial Authorities are doing all that is possible in the matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. H. Pitts, Esq.,\nBarrister,\nAshcroft, B. C.\nWe want you to know about Charlie Cisco because he does not want to sell his land to the school. Mr. Lett would not pay him his share for working in the ditch and told him he was not to work his land and that he cannot have any water. Mr. Graham and Mr. Lett said that they have got a letter from Ottawa that they were to take Charlie Cisco's place and he was to have Alex George's land and the Government are going to give him and his wife food from the store as long as they are living. If a man wants to keep his place when he has made it a good place it is not right to take it from him without giving him another place just as good which he is willing to take for the other place.\nOttawa, May 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI am enclosing, for your attention and report, a letter from Mr. C. H. Pitts, Barrister, of Ashcroft. I should also like to have an answer to my letter of March 18th, last, in this connection.\n\nEnclosure.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nOttawa, May 25, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 18th instant, with reference to the complaint of Charlie Cisco against the Principal of the Lytton Indian Residential School. I am making enquiries regarding this matter.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary\n\nC. H. Pitts, Esq.,\nBarrister,\nAshcroft, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of your letter of May 25th, enclosing one from Mr. C.H. Pitts, Ashcroft solicitor, regarding some amicable arrangement with Charlie Cisco over the Indian Reserve land owned by him, which Mr. Lett was anxious to obtain for the use of a road leading to the new school.\n\nOn receipt of your letter of March 15th, Mr. Lett and I met the Indians together and in fact have done so several times, with a view to trying to settle this question, but they absolutely refused to be moved in the matter.\n\nI then applied to Mr. Inspector Fragnell and tried to get him down to assist us, but he has been unable to get away until this week. He visited the location on Thursday last, and Mr. Fragnell came to the conclusion that he should not try to force the Indians to vacate, but would point out to them that as the water record for this particular land should come from the upper ditch that they, the Ciscos, must either get their water from the proper source that the record called for, or else come to some arrangements with the Indians to get water from them through the lower ditch.\n\nAs you are aware the lower ditch is a joint one between the school and the Indians, and for the last few years trouble has arisen through the distribution, the Indians being the first ones on the ditch have just taken what they needed, with the result that we often only have allowed nothing to pass by for the use of the school. Several occasions the Indians have used and on one occasion only a small quantity was allowed to pass, and that was taken by the Ciscos with the result that Mr. Lett went up and told the Indians he would have them arrested if they interfered with and took the school water.\n\nI then applied to the Dominion Water Power Branch to send an engineer to put in weirs to distribute the water according to the acreage, so that every man got what he was entitled to. Before this was done the Indians said that they would let water go for the Ciscos' use, but now these weirs have been installed, and everyone is getting his proportion, they find that they have not got sufficient.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nnot got sufficient\n\nfor their own use, and therefore refuse to allow any to pass onto the Ciscos. In fact some of the Indians, through having long ditches leading to their land, claim that their portion is not reaching them. This goes to prove that the Indians have been in the habit of wasting water when they were entitled to for their acreage at the expense of the school. The only solution that I can see now is for some of these long Indian ditches to be filled in order to preserve their water, and I would like to have the Dominion Water Power Branch send a man to see what could be done in this respect, and also the cost of same.\n\nIn regard to Mr. Pitt's accusation that Mr. Lett, principal of the school, is endeavoring to repudiate the agreement entered into with Mr. Dawson, and the Indians, this is quite untrue. Mr. Lett has told them over and over again that all he wants is his share, which the Indians recognize and have signed up with him for, and that the Ciscos, if they can get water from the Indians, may have the use of the school ditch.\n\nIn regard to the statement that I have told the Indians and the Ciscos that I can do nothing to assist them, it is not true. What I have told them is that they have my wholehearted interest and sympathy, but I cannot get a further record for them as the Provincial Government engineer will not give me any, and that if the other Indians are not willing to give the Ciscos water I can't make them, but have done all in my power to arrive at some solution.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\nJune 1st., 1927.\n\nDear Mr. Cisco:\n\nWhilst in Lytton the other day, I went into the matter of possible exchange of land between yourself and Mr. Lett, and seeing that you did not wish to do so, although it looked to me the most sensible thing to do, I have therefore made the following ruling.\n\n1. No attempt will be made to remove you from your land unless you desire to move yourself.\n\n2. You must, however, not touch any of the water allowance which belongs to the Indian School when it is going down the ditch and being used by the School.\n\n3. Your correct legal record only pertains to the upper ditch, and you are at liberty to build a ditch to this point from which to get your water.\n\n4. If you find you cannot do this, and the Indians from the other reserve like to let you have water from their own record from the school ditch, when not in use by the school, you can make your own arrangements with them, but I again warn you that the water belonging to the School record must not be touched.\n\nI regret that you are having this trouble and I sympathize with you, but I do not wish to move from the land that you have used for a long time. However, you must understand that it is important that the School receives its correct share of water for irrigation, as the School is a large and important Institution, and it is absolutely necessary that they be able to grow agricultural produce for the benefit of the children at the School.\n\nIf you desire to write me upon the matter, you are perfectly at liberty to do so.\n\nYours truly,\n\nGeo. S. (signature)\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\n\nGSP/S.\n\nCharlie Cisco,\nIndian Reserve,\nLYTTON, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJune 1st., 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI have just returned from an inspection trip in\nthe Lytton Agency. Later on, I will forward you the usual\nreport of my trip.\n\nIn the meanwhile I have to state that I went into\nthe matter of the water supply of the Lytton Reserve and the\nIndian School from Britannia Lake, also the Cisco matter with\nreference to the land which Mr. Lett was desirous of changing\nwith the Indians concerned. I might say that Senator Bostock\nindeed owed me upon this matter, also that I have seen varied\ncorrespondence from Mr. Pitts, who seems to be acting as\nSolicitor for the Indians in the case. There have also been\nnumerous Indian letters. Taking it all round there seems to\nbe a great deal of talk going on about the whole thing. The\nclaim of the Indians was that the water supply is\nvery many sided and complicated, but the gist of the general\ncomplaint is that they are not receiving their correct amount,\nand that the School is stealing it from them. Doubtless you\nhave correspondence upon the matter as Mr. Graham has shown me\nsome that he received from you.\n\nWith reference to the Cisco case, the claim is as\nfollows: Charlie Cisco has been using water out of the same\nditch that goes to the School. As a matter of fact, he never\nhad any legal right to use this water, as his piece of land\nbelongs to the Upper Reserve and should be served by that\nrecord. However, it is quite a long way to carry the water\nfrom the existing upper ditch to Cisco's place. This has\nbeen pointed out to them, but apparently they cannot under-\nstand it, and the only thing that rests in their minds is that\nthey think that Mr. Lett is trying to force them out and take\ntheir land away from them. In order to quieten things down,\nI had to make a final ruling whilst I was there, and I am send-\ning you a copy of the letter addressed to Charlie Cisco so\nyou will see by the letter, I assure them that nobody is going\nto, or trying to force them off the land merely that the ex-\nchange would be to the mutual benefit of themselves and the\nSchool. I have also stuck strictly to the letter of the law,\nand have informed them that they cannot take water for this\nland out of the school ditch, and they must either dig a ditch\nto the upper ditch and connect up with them, or compel the\nIndians from the Lower Reserve would allow them water from\ntheir share on days when the School was not using it. I hope\nthis ruling is in order, but something had to be done about it\nimmediately.\n\nWith reference to the remaining water question as to\nwhether the various Reserves are getting their proper supply, I\nwas of the opinion that the only way to settle the question was\n\nThe Deputy Superintendent General,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nto apply to the Provincial Government Water Board to have a bailiff put on there this summer. There is a possibility that more water than their records call for is consumed by some of the earlier record holders, also they have not yet complied with the regulations regarding measuring weirs and water boxes. However, despite all that, I am of the belief that the Indians have in the past actually received at their intakes, more water than that to which they are entitled, and the water bailiff would show whether this was right or not.\n\nOut of this there is a great loss and much is lost every considerable amount of water from seepage after it has reached their various ditches, and I think that a considerable amount of fluming will have to be done to rectify this wastage.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, therefore, as I have said before, a water bailiff to divide the water properly so as to be only sufficient and hope I might in asking the Water Commissioner to have one put on. When he is actually regulating all the water, and nobody else is interfering with it, we shall then be able to know whether the quantity is being properly divided and whether there is sufficient for all.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies.\nOttawa, June 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the first instant, with reference to the water supply for the various reserves and the Indian Residential School at Lytton. Relative to the difficulty between the Indian Charlie Cisco and our local representatives, I note that you have made a \"final ruling.\" I wish to point out that it is the duty and province of Headquarters to make final decisions; and, as it may be necessary for the Department to take the land of this Indian for school purposes under Section 11A of the Indian Act, I have to request that you will write to him, referring to your letter of the first instant with a view to changing Ruling No. 1. You should inform Charlie Cisco that the Department requires his property for the use of the school; that we will make any reasonable exchange with re-establishment or compensation and that he would be well advised to make arrangements with Mr. Indian Agent Graham for his removal.\n\nI should be glad to have a copy of your letter to Cisco, as he may again enlist the services of Mr. C. H. Pitts, Barrister, of Ashcroft, who is quite likely to quote from your earlier letter in this connection.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nLt. Col. George S. Pragnell,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nBox 752, Kamloops,\nB. C.\nOttawa, June 14, 1927.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your l-D-15 of the 30th ultimo and I note you have had no success trying to move the Indian Charlie Cisco from land which is required for the purposes of the Indian Residential School at Lytton. Mr. Inspector Fragnell's report is to hand and I am today asking him to correspond again with Charlie Cisco to the effect that it will be necessary for him to move and that he had better accept any arrangement he can make with his Indian Agent. The Department will allow any reasonable exchange with re-establishment or compensation to the Indian or Indians in question. Please make the best arrangements you can. Charlie Cisco should be given to understand, however, that the Department is prepared to remove him, if necessary, under authority of Section 11A of the Indian Act.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ. D. McLean,\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham,\nIndian Agent.\nJune 21st., 1927.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to my letter to you of the 1st., inst., I now beg to inform you that the Department of Indian Affairs at Ottawa have written me informing me that it is not within my power to make the ruling that I did in my letter to you, the said ruling of mine being:\n\n\"1. No attempt will be made to remove you from your land unless you desire to move yourself.\"\n\nThe above ruling must therefore be considered null and void. The Department states that \"it may be necessary for the Department to take the land of this Indian for School purposes, under Section 11A of the Indian Act.\"\n\nFurther, their instructions to me state that I am to \"inform Charlie Cisco that the Department requires his property for the use of the School;\" and \"that they will make reasonable excuse with the establishment or compensation and that he would be well advised to make arrangements with Mr. Indian Agent Graham for his removal.\"\n\nI regret that I have misled you in the matter, but I am, of course, subject to the orders of the Headquarters of the Department at Ottawa, and their ruling that I have not the power to rule as I did, must be correct and final.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Geo. S. Pragnell)\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nCharlie Cisco,\nLytton Indian Reserve,\nLytton, B.C.\nDEPARTMENT OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nOFFICE OF\nINSPECTOR OF INDIAN AGENCIES\nBRITISH COLUMBIA\n\nP.O. BOX 752\nKAMLOOPS, B.C.\n\nJune 21st, 1927.\n\nDear Sirs:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th inst., and enclosed you will find a copy of a letter to Charlie Cisco, written by me in accordance with your instructions. I have made it, I hope, as explicit as possible.\n\nI regret my error in this matter, and now understand that I am not empowered to make a definite ruling for the Indians or Agents on behalf of the Department, unless instructed previously by the Department headquarters at Ottawa, or, I take it, by the Commissioner for B.C. I will therefore act accordingly in future.\n\nIn extenuation of my error, if there really is any excuse for me, I can only attribute it partly to my past training in life as a soldier, which emphasizes the fact that a subordinate must in cases of emergency, make a decision, notwithstanding any contrary orders, and consequently being expressly instructed to use his own initiative, informing the headquarters as to what he has done with reasons, as soon as possible. My reasons for considering this a case of emergency were many, and hard to grasp, except to one on the spot. The main reason being that the School ditch lays at the mercy of the Indians, and interference with same was expected out of sympathy with Cisco, because fostering a strong prejudice against the school and principal, and also because of repeated threats from the Indians.\n\nI might also say that I did not make this ruling without consultation with Mr. Agent Graham and Rev. Mr. Lett, and I came to the conclusion that the longest way round was the safest and that, having in view the water situation at the Cisco place, that he would, before long, voluntarily offer to give the place up. I really thought the Department would expect me, as their representative, to make a decision.\n\nAs said before, I will not enlarge upon the matter of my reasons, but I hope you will accept my apology for this error, and attribute it to a mistaken idea as to my responsibilities and duty towards the Department, and a desire to prevent any regrettable incident due to hasty action on the part of the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nGeo.

All that parcel or lot of land situate in the former District of Lytton, now in Township Fifteen, Range Twenty-seven, West of the Sixth Meridian in British Columbia, said to contain Eighty-two acres more or less and numbered Lot Twelve, Group One on the official plan of the said Township approved and confirmed by E. Deville, Surveyor General on the 21st day of June 1904.\n\n3. All that parcel or lot of land situate in Yale Division of Yale District said to contain One hundred and fifty acres more or less and more particularly described on the map or plan annexed to the Crown Grant dated 17th October 1901 and coloured red and numbered Lot Forty-seven, Group One on the official plan or survey of the said Yale Division of Yale District in the Province of British Columbia, now being in Township Fifteen, Range Twenty-six, West of the Sixth Meridian.\nJanuary 16, 1928.\n\nDear Mr. Lett:\n\nWith further reference to your letter of the 29th ultimo, I have to authorise you to expend the sum of $1,200 in the preparation of a root and apple cellar. Competitive prices should be secured before purchasing materials and the accounts should be given to Mr. Indian Agent Graham for his certificate. You may also expend $500 in connection with grading around the new building, planting shrubbery and fencing the playgrounds and vegetable garden.\n\nI may say that it is possible the New England Company will have a representative at the official opening of the new building. I have informed them that, at the present time, June 15th appears to be a suitable date for the ceremony. I intend to place a brass tablet in the main entrance, for the purpose of recording the Company's interest in and connection with the institution.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nDuncan C. Scott\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nHaving further reference to departmental letter dated June 14th, 1927, regarding the possibility of obtaining land from the family of Charles Cisco over that portion of Lots 11 and 12, which is required for school purposes in order to build a road into the new St. George's Residential School, I beg to state that I have made various attempts to try to get some settlement in this matter, but to no avail.\n\nI have had three long meetings within the last ten days, at which the Rev. Mr. Lett was present, but I could make no progress. Both Mr. Lett and myself have suggested various exchanges, but they have turned a deaf ear to every one of them. They harp back all the time to the old Aboriginal title, etc., etc., but this explained to them, and even the interpreter who is a very learned man, has explained it to them very minutely, by authority the Department had under Section 111 of the Indian Act, but nevertheless notwithstanding this they refused to be moved. I have been at it late the last two nights, and last night they asked permission to write to you direct themselves about it. I told them they could certainly do so if they wished to, but thought they could save themselves the trouble, as the Department had made up its mind to reestablish them, or else buy them out.\n\nAs a last resort I suggested to them trying to make arrangements with the Diocese of Cariboo, through the Bishop Adam, for the purchase of Lots 11 and 12, Group 1, C.C., situated and being in the same section of Section 2, Township 18, Range 27, East of the 9th Meridian, as this same family is making several land on the Canadian Pacific Railway right-of-way about half a mile from the proposed piece of land and could work both to better advantage. At the present moment I am not in a position to say for sure whether or not the Diocese is prepared to sell, and if so, at what figure. The last time the Bishop was down he talked about selling, but when Mr. Lett wrote him last week, put up to the present we have had no reply, and I presume he is waiting until he comes down here next Saturday. I will advise the Department again as soon as I get something definite from him.\n\nI may further state that I informed the Cisco family that this matter had to be settled before the spring, so as to have a chance to reestablish them, so that they may not lose crops through the matter being taken up too late. I may also add that this particular piece of land that they are making such a fuss about has only been in their possession a few years, as they bought the improvements from the Wilson family, so there can really be no sentimental attachment to it, as they are making capital of.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 9, 1926.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 373-A-15/21 of the 2nd instant, with reference to land held by the Indian Charles Cisco, which is required for the use of the St. George's Indian Residential School. I note the effort you have made to arrange settlement in this matter. Please let me have a report as soon as you hear from Bishop Adams in connection with the proposed purchase of a parcel of land for this Indian. The Department wishes to secure the land lying between Lots 11 and 12 for the use of the school at an early date, so I should be pleased if you would keep me informed.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

This I consider very reasonable, but it will take another few hundred to fence it up, repair the flume, etc. Mr. Lett and I have gone into this and we think it will take about another $500.00, but even at this expense, this would be in our estimation a cheap purchase, and I would like strongly to recommend that the Department give this favorable consideration, at the earliest possible date, so that if the Indian is to be re-established on this, it be done before the spring, so that they would suffer no loss.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\n(H.

His holding, which is approximately 16 acres, is so situated that it is necessary to acquire it for school purposes. Mr. Indian Agent Graham, the new Principal and Inspector Triggell have all failed in the effort to get this Indian to move to other land. It will likely be necessary to expropriate, under Section 11 A of the Indian Act. Mr. Graham is unable to find, on one or the nearby reserves, any parcel that he feels would be entirely suitable for this Indian, and he recommends that we purchase from the Bishop of Cariboo a parcel of approximately 70 acres, 4\u00bd miles to the south or 2\u00bd miles south of Lytton town. This parcel is known as Lots 7 and 8, Group 1, C. G., and is in the East half of Section 26, T. 14, R. 27, W. 6th. The Bishop of Cariboo has offered to sell to the Department for the sum of \u00a3650. Mr. Lett and Mr. Graham estimate it would take another \u00a3600 to re-establish Charles Cisco.\n\nI recommend that action under Section 11 A be taken and that the Lands Branch make early arrangements for the purchase of the property mentioned as an Indian reserve. Funds are available in the Appropriation for Indian Education. I understand the authority of Council is required.\n\nAs soon as we have secured authority for the purchase immediate arrangements should be made to have the Indian in question re-established before spring, so that he will suffer no loss.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, February 27, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 463-A-15/21 of the 17th instant, with reference to removing the Cisco family to a parcel of land which can be purchased from the Diocese of Cariboo for the sum of $650. I have to inform you that the Deputy Superintendent General has approved of this scheme and the Department wishes to arrange for the purchase in the immediate future. I am today asking the Department of Justice to have their agent search title and, if found satisfactory, to prepare a conveyance of Lots 7 and 8, Group 1, C. G., of the East half of Sec. 26, T. 14 R. 27 W. 6th. to His Majesty as represented by the Superintendent General of Indian Affairs. Before making the purchase, the authority of the Governor in Council for the transaction will be requested. It is necessary to also secure the authority of the Governor in Council if Charles Cisco has to be forcibly removed from that portion of the Indian reserve which is required for the site of the St. George's Indian Residential School. At an early date you should personally take Cisco to the new property and inform him the Department is purchasing it as an Indian reserve for himself and family; that you have been authorized to expend the sum of $600 in getting him re-established in his new home; and that, if necessary, the services of the police will be enlisted to effectuate the removal. You may take action in this matter. I am very hopeful that it will not be necessary to use the authority that is given the Governor in Council by Section 11A of the Indian Act. You might let me have a special report concerning your efforts in this connection.\n\nPlease inform His Lordship the Bishop of Cariboo that the Department is making arrangements to accept his offer for the property in question.\n\nInformation on our files suggests that the parcel at present held by Charles Cisco, between Lots 11 and 12, and to the west of the Lytton-Lillooet wagon road, comprises approximately 15.7 acres.

Regarding the Indian Reserve No. 21 of the Lytton Band of Lytton, which is situated near the town of Lytton, which is good among years. The said Reserve, being very far from the town of Lytton, an Indian of the Lytton Band.\n\nOur Indian Agent, Mr. Johnson, is known to have been very close to this reserve and that the reserve be given over to the Lytton School for Road purposes only, as stated by him.\nWe had two meetings with him, in which he showed us letter No. 41 came from your Department. Our Representative Regarding Mr. Charly Cissie Removal from his present land as it was most essential this be done and that a Re-establishment in exchange be granted to Mr. Charly Cissie. Equal in Valuation or Compensation is desired.\n\nThe ground mentioned by the Agent for Charly Cissie Re-establishment in Exchange was unsatisfactory as stated.\n\nOne without Irrigation water and uncultivated and other with very little water not enough for the Irrigation season for our crops. Having so we agreed to Mr. Charly Cissie's request for his removal. As an Agent's answer to our petition was unsatisfactory.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 838-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, March 12, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI am directed to acknowledge the letter, signed by Arthur Skakie and other Indians of the Lytton Band, which was addressed to the Honourable Charles Stewart. Concerning the property of Charlie Cisco, which is part of Indian Reserve No. 21, it is true that the Department intends to expropriate this, if necessary, for the use of the Indian residential school. You may rest assured that this Indian will be dealt with very fairly and will be re-established on suitable property. Mr. Indian Agent Graham of Lytton has already received instructions in this connection.\n\nThe other questions raised in your letter are receiving attention.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. Mackenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nMr. Andrew Bob,\nIndian,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir:\n\nI beg to acknowledge receipt of departmental letter dated February 27th, in regard to the removal of the Cisco family to a parcel of land, which can be purchased from the Diocese of Cariboo.\n\nYesterday I went to interview this family and explained the letter to them. They told me that they were quite reconciled, and willing to make the transfer, but as they had written to the Department on February 24th, three days before your letter was written, they were waiting for a reply and asked me not to rush them, assuring me that everything would come all right, but preferred to have your answer first.\n\nI explained to them that the Department has bought this as Indian Reserve for the benefit of Charles Cisco and his family, and that I was authorized to expend the sum of $500.00 in re-establishing them. There were some suggestions made that I turn over this piece of land and the sum of $500.00 to him, and let the family do all the work necessary in re-establishing themselves. I promised to write you and recommend that this be done, as I think they would be better satisfied. I would therefore like to suggest that you send me a cheque made out in favor of Charles Cisco, which I can deliver to him on him signing a paper that he relinquished all interest to that portion of Lytton L.R.No.21, situated between Lots 11 and 12, the property of the Department, now held by St. George's Residential School, comprising approximately 15.7 acres. You also ask for the acreage of Lots 7 and 8. This is as you state just about 70 acres.\n\nThe Deputy & Secretary, Your obedient servant,\n\n(H.

C. Cisco's holding is contiguous to the new school building and the institution and is absolutely necessary for the satisfactory operation of the school.

One copy of this should be returned to the Department for our file. You should fill in a description of the property that Cisco is relinquishing.\n\nThere is also enclosed a cheque in your favour, for $500. I note your suggestion that the amount of compensation be handed to the Indian, but I am doubtful of his ability to administer the money in his own best interests. I believe you should explain to him, before an interpreter that he favours, that you have the $500 and that you and he, together, are going to expend the major portion of it in re-establishing him and his family on the property which is being purchased from the Bishop of Cariboo. The balance you may give to Cisco in cash, if you consider he would make proper use of it. You should take receipts, showing how the $500 was expended, and forward these to the Department at your earliest convenience.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nSir,\n\nI have departmental letter dated March 17, together with cheque for $500.00, and quit claim forms for me to fill in and have executed by Charlie Cisco, for the relinquishment of certain piece of land owned by him on the Inkluckcheen, Lytton I.R.No.21.\n\nI have had Charlie Cisco in, and other Indians with a good interpreter twice, and I regret to state, that I am absolutely no farther. Charlie Cisco absolutely refuses the piece of land that we proposed buying from the Bishop of Cariboo, that we wish to re-establish him on, claiming it is no good.\n\nUnder these circumstances, if the Department has not gone ahead with this matter, I would like to recommend that it be left in abeyance.\n\nCharlie Cisco says, if the Department wants his piece of land, he is quite willing to relinquish it, but wants compensation. When asked how much, he replied, \"$4000.00.\" I told him straight that that was quite out of the question, and that the Department would not consider this for one moment. He admitted that he was being well dealt with, in giving him $500.00 to reestablish him. As an alternative Cisco says he'd accept $20.00 a month recompense.\n\nI explained your former letter, that if it was necessary, Charlie would be brought in to expel them, and also read Section II of the Indian Act to them, and explained it to them carefully, showing them that as we could not come to an amicable arrangement the Superintendent General had agreed what compensation was coming to them, which was the exchange of land and $500.00 to reestablish them.\n\nI have informed them that the school intends to start building the road through this property immediately, and if they wish to keep haggling, and putting the matter off, that they are doing it at their own risk, that is, of being late with their crops this spring.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(H. Graham)\nIndian Agent.\n\nAssist. Deputy & Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nHM/MD\nOttawa, April 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have to inform you that, for some time, the Department has been in correspondence with Mr. Indian Agent Graham, in connection with the removal of the Indian Charlie Cisco from his holding on Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21 - which property is required for the purposes of the St. George's Indian Residential School. The Department has offered to purchase a property of 70 acres, at a cost of $650, for an Indian reserve and to place Cisco thereon, and in addition, to allow $500 for his re-establishment. Mr. Graham reported on the 6th ultimo that Cisco appeared reconciled to the proposal, which the Department considers a fair one, and it was hoped that it would not be necessary to remove him under authority of Section II A of the Indian Act.\n\nAs you are to be in Lytton in the early future, I should be pleased if you would see the correspondence on Mr. Graham's file A-16/21 and let me have a recommendation as to what course to pursue. It is possible that Cisco would agree to the arrangement if the offer was repeated by yourself. In the interim, I am not completing arrangements for the purchase of the property south of Lytton town, to which we were prepared to move the Indian in question.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nW. E. Ditchburn, Esq.,\nIndian Commissioner,\nBox 666, Victoria,\nB. C.\nOttawa, April 3, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your 797-A-15/21 of the 26th ultimo, with reference to the proposed removal of Charlie Cisco from his holding on Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21. I note that, in spite of his earlier promise, he now refuses to be re-established on the land the Department proposed purchasing from the Bishop of Cariboo. You should hold the cheque for $500 as it is possible that Cisco might agree at any time to the Department's proposal. I have directed that the purchase of Lots 7 and 8, Group 1, C. G., from the Bishop of Cariboo be held in abeyance for the time being.\n\nI am asking Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, who purposes being in Lytton in the near future in connection with the St. George's Indian Residential School, to look into this matter of removing Cisco and to see if he can arrange an amicable settlement. It is possible that Cisco might be willing to do business with him. When I have the Commissioner's report in the matter before me, the Department will be in a position to take further action. You might be prepared to inform Mr. Ditchburn if Cisco has looked over the property on which we propose to re-establish him, and, if he has, what reasons does he advance to show that it is unsatisfactory to him.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. F. MacKenzie,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nC. H. Pitts\nBarrister & Solicitor, Etc.\n\nAshcroft, B.C. April 25, 1928.\n\nSecretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nRE: FILE No. 165-0-9\n\nI beg to inform you that I have been again consulted by Charlie Cisco and his wife in regard to their ranch on No. 24 Reserve, Lytton, B.C. In this connection I would refer you to the correspondence that has already taken place between us, especially your letters of May 3rd 1927 and May 5th 1927.\n\nThe situation is more or less explained in my letters to you of the 25th of April 1927 and the 13th of May 1927 and the enclosures, and I had advised the Indians that they would receive fair compensation if their lands were expropriated, as stated by you in your letter of the 3rd of May.\n\nI am now consulted again in this regard, and am told that both Mr. Lett, the principal of the school, and Mr. Graham have told the Indians that unless they gave up this land they would be deprived of water.\n\nThe only compensation offered for this land is another ranch, in which the water supply is very inadequate and on which the soil is not nearly so productive as on the land in question, and the local authorities are apparently endeavoring to coerce the Indians into accepting this in substitution for the lands they now possess. This you must agree is not in accordance with the spirit of the Indian Act.\n\nI would further like to point out that my instructions are that the land in question lay unused for a long period before my clients, the Cisos, took it up, they purchasing the rights of the preceding owners. They have gone to considerable labour and expense and have now all the available arable land under cultivation, having 14 acres cultivated out of a total of 16 acres. They have done all this in eight years' time, and now have the reputation of getting the best crops on the reserve. Charlie Cisco is, I understand, almost blind, but his wife appears to be a hard working woman and seems heart broken at the thought of having to leave the ranch they built up to maintain them in their old age.\nI would also like to point out that during the whole period this land was not being worked no effort was made by the school to acquire it, and only after eight years labour on the part of the Ciscos and the land has shown its quality that they step in and try to oust them.\n\nI might say that Mrs. Cisco informed me that they would be very loath to part with the land for $4,000., and in fact, would not consider disposing of it unless compelled to do so.\n\nI would respectfully suggest that this matter be given immediate attention, and that these Indians receive the consideration they are entitled to, if the spirit of the Act is to be lived up to.\n\nYours truly,\n\nCHP/GC\nMay 26, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nThe Indian Charlie Cisco, who holds 16 acres on Lytton No. 21 Indian Reserve, which is required for the use of the St. Paul's Indian Residential School, was interviewed by Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn and still refuses to accept the land which we proposed to purchase for him from the Bishop of Cariboo. The cost of the proposed new reserve was to have been $650 and Mr. Indian Agent Graham was to administer a cheque for $500 for Cisco's re-establishment. I believe Mr. Graham is holding this cheque.\n\nMr. Ditchburn reports that there is strong feeling in the community regarding the removal of Cisco, and if the action is taken without the Indian being satisfied, the Commissioner is convinced there would be much criticism. He therefore examined other properties with a view to recommending the purchase of a farm that would be acceptable to Cisco.\n\nMr. Ditchburn recommends that the Department purchase a 66.2 acre property, described as Legal Subdivisions 5, 6, 11 and 12 of Sect. 36, T. 13, R. 27, which lies on the left bank of the Fraser river, between Siska Plains Reserves Nos. 2 and 3. This property has much superior water rights and more suitable buildings than the farm we were about to purchase from the Bishop of Cariboo.\n\nThe property may be purchased for $1,800 from Messrs. Grinnell & Parker, Barristers, of Merritt, who are acting for the owners of the land. It appears that, last year, they nearly completed a sale for $2,000; so, apparently, the present price is fair and reasonable. I might add that Messrs. Grinnell & Parker are apparently the agents of the Minister of Justice in this district, as their office was dealing for us in the matter of the purchase of the property from the Bishop of Cariboo.\n\nMr. Commissioner Ditchburn strongly recommends that the 66.2 acres referred to be purchased. It appears that such action would satisfy Charlie Cisco, and I should be glad if you would give your approval.\n\n[Signature]\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, May 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI have your letter of the 25th ultimo, with reference to the removal of Charlie Cisco from Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21. In reply I have to inform you that the Department intends to deal fairly with this Indian and, some time ago, directed Mr. Commissioner Ditchburn, of Victoria, to try to arrange an amicable settlement. I may say that recent developments suggest that such arrangement is imminent.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst. Deputy & Secretary.\n\nC. H. Pitts, Esq.,\nBarrister,\nAshcroft, B. C.\nOttawa, May 28, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nI wish to refer to your 483-A-15/21 of February 17th, last, and my reply of the 27th idem. I have now to inform you that the Department is not proceeding with the purchase of the property owned by His Lordship the Bishop of Cariboo, on which it was proposed to establish Charlie Cisco. Please inform His Lordship of the circumstances in connection with this change in decision and express our regrets that the deal will not be completed.\n\nI may say that, following the report of Mr. Indian Commissioner Ditchburn, the Department is taking steps to secure a 66.2 acre property, described as Legal Subdivisions 5, 6, 11 and 12 of Sec. 26, T. 13, R. 27, which lies between Siska Flats Reserves Nos. 2 and 3. I understand that Charlie Cisco will be quite satisfied with this.\n\nI take it for granted that you are holding the cheque for $500 which was directed to you to re-establish this Indian on his new property. In a few days, I will have a letter to you with reference to this cheque.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Asst./Deputy & Secretary.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nMay 29, 1928.\n\nMemorandum:\n\nIndian Education cheque No. 6421 (1927-28) for $500.00, was directed to Mr. Indian Agent Graham under cover of March 17th. It was in Mr. Graham's favour, in trust, and was to be administered for the purpose of re-establishing an Indian, Charlie Cisco.\n\nThe scheme was not proceeded with and I understand Mr. Graham is holding the cheque. It is now proposed to purchase a more expensive property for this Indian, and I should be glad to know if we could have Mr. Graham make a specific endorsement in favour of the vendors of the property and return the cheque here, so that we could send it along with a cheque for the balance of the purchase price. The Department proposes to give the Indian a better property than was first contemplated, and there would be no necessity to send a cheque for re-establishing him.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 338-9, part 1)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, May 30th, 1928.\n\nSir:\n\nReferring to official letter to you of March 17th, last, enclosing cheque No. 6421 for $500, and also to Department's letter to you of the 28th ultimo, I now have to request that you will return this cheque to the Department as it was drawn on last year's appropriation which has been closed.

Some of our records date back to 1864 and 1867.

Some of our records date back to 1864 and 1867. In this dry belt plenty of irrigation water is essential.\nSir:\n\nNew England School at Lytton\n\nYour letter of the 15th ult., addressed to the Comptroller of Water Rights, has been submitted to the Board of Investigation.\n\nThe Board found that the water records of 1864, etc., were appurtenant to the lands around the school but not to Lot 47 which was acquired long after the records were granted. I would suggest that Mr. Dawson apply to the Comptroller for a water licence covering that lot.\n\nI am given to understand that all the people using water from Botanic Creek are forming a \"Water Users' Community\" under the provisions of the Water Act, with a view to conserving the water. If a water licence were obtained by the New England Company for Lot 47, they could join in the Community for that lot also.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nChairman, Board of Investigation.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that part of your report relating to the water records for the Lytton Industrial School, I beg to inform you that in reply to a communication from this Department Mr. J. F. Armstrong, Chairman of the Board of Investigation, says that the Board found that the Water Records of 1864, etc., were apportioned to lands around the school but not Lot 47 which was acquired long after the Records were granted. Mr. Armstrong suggests that you should apply to the Controller for a water license covering that lot. Mr. Armstrong further states that he understands that all the people using water from Botanie Creek are forming a \"Water Users' Community\" under the provisions of the Water Act, with the view to conserving water and that if a water license were obtained by the New England Company for Lot 47 they could join in the community for that lot also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary.\n\nRev.

L Dawson of St. George's Indian Industrial School, in reply to a request from him for permission to construct a reservoir on the Lytton Indian Reserve No 21. I may say that I have examined this site thoroughly in company with the Indians and we can see no objection to the construction of the said dam and would recommend that Mr. Dawson be given permission to go ahead with this work.\n\nI have the honour to be,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst Deputy & Secretary\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa. Ont.\nApplication has been made by the Rev. Leonard Dawson Principal of St Georges Indian Industrial School for permission to erect a dam and store water on the Inklusheen Indian Reserve for irrigation purposes.\n\nI beg to say that I went over the proposed site today with the School Manager, and the Indian Chief and I found that the area of ground proposed to utilise is in a hollows and absolutely useless for any other purpose so it will do no harm to anyone, and the Chief is perfectly willing that the School be allowed the use of this particular piece of ground, the area of which is 7\u00bd chains by 1\u00bd chains with a dam breast of 15 feet.\n\nOn behalf of this application I beg to say that in the spring of the year there is always far more water than can be used but by the end of July it runs very short so if the New England Company for St Georges School were allowed to build this dam and save water, it would be a very great help to the School.\n\nTrusting that the Department will give this matter there earliest attention.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

In view of your report there appears to be no objection as far as the Department is concerned to allowing the dam to be constructed and the water stored. It is, however, desirable that the Principal should make application to the proper office. His letter should be addressed to Wm. Young, Esq., Comptroller of Water Rights, Victoria, B.C.

Mr. Dawson should obtain a permit from the Comptroller of Water Rights. This permit has been received in the Department. The Indians have signified their consent to the Indian Agent. I think that Mr. Dawson might be given the permission desired to go ahead with the work.\n\nThe St. George's Indian Industrial School in question is situated outside of the Indian Reserve. It is the property of the New England Company. It receives a per capita grant from the Department. No mention is made of any monetary assistance required from the Department for the construction of the dam and it is not expected that any such application will be made.\nI think it is advisable that we should obtain from the Rev. Mr. Dawson, a promise, in writing, to the effect that any reasonable request that may in the future be made by or on the part of the Indians for water stored under this permission, be granted if it is at all convenient to do so.\n\nChief Surveyor.\n\nNote: This dam is situated in Reserve No. 21 of the Lytton Band.

Loring and McKay and the New England Co., obtain their water supplies.\n\nMr. McKay had an original Licence to dam and store water in this Lake but has not used it for some years.\n\nThe New England Co., who have the first right on Bootanie Creek have been in the habit of using all the water out of the said Creek, so the water Commissioners advised me, as a means of protecting the Indians' Water Rights and securing a more continual water supply to go in with Messrs. Loring and McKay and build a storage dam on Bootanie Lake and gave us so long to complete the work; I therefore immediately applied for a conditional Water Licence, which was granted and Messrs. Loring, McKay and the Indians immediately started construction of the said dam under\n\nF.T.O.\nIN INDIAN AGENT'S OFFICE,\n\nLytton B.C.\n\nDec. 24th 1914\n\nSir,\n\nthe supervision of the Government Water Engineer.\n\nThe work of construction has been nearly completed and which we expect to fully complete as soon as the frost gets out of the ground in the Spring.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst.

Young, Esq.,\nComptroller of Water Rights,\nVICTORIA, B.C.\nReport re Water Difficulty at George Lytton Indian Industrial School & Farm\n\nSupplementing my Annual Report May 14 - April 15 I regret to have to report the serious state of affairs on our school farm through lack of sufficient water for irrigation purposes and non-irrigated crops for domestic use last year though plenty of irrigation water was lost over 40 acres of hay and 50 acres of potatoes besides damage and destruction of fruit trees meaning a loss of over $2000.\n\nIn my last Report for year to April 14 I dealt with the matter regarding Department funds and the matters up with Mr. Armstrong the Chairman of the Provincial Water Commission and wrote the letter No. 446303 dated June 16/14.\n\nThe Water Commission cut down our supply by irrigating Ditch from Botanica Creek to 7/8 so that the water would not reach the school along the Ditch which is 5 miles long when I asked for leave to take part in the building of Dam at Botanica Lake referred to in your letter. I was courteously refused by Water Commissioner Young although I was original mover in the matter of building this essential Dam and held meetings to all parties concerned in the school system and will urge a co-operative effort.\n\nI have now by way of School Board Holding the efforts of our Lawyer Mr. Taylor Kitty & Wrightman very kindly unsuccessful in obtaining any fair treatment.\n\nMr. Young's letter was peremptory, unreasonably and showed him as a last resort to prevent litigation and try to save the Institution I went down to Victoria.\nto see his young and found his mind had been largely poisoned against the Indian Agent Graham, who instead of helping the Indians, has persistently worked against us in the matter to serve his own private interests. I have charged him personally with waste action and he could not deny it.\n\nWhen the Water Commissioner met in Lytton for the first time on Oct 27/3 Mr Graham actually employed Lawyer Cockran at Indian Department expenses to oppose our ancient Water Rights dated 1864-1867, to earliest on Botwin Creek and tried but it was cancelled.\n\nNow Mr Graham is trying to take away our only water for Domestic Purposes (private water) which obviously affects our children and driving us into complete poverty.\n\nThis is the situation which I am defending the rights of an Indian Settlement by law, and after writing the young agent as General Counsel, Mr Graham is now in trouble with the Commissioner outside business which I shall meet his tactics as Indian Chief and present him acting fairly to his Indian Band and the Indians generally.\n\nHe is partner in a Ranch owned by Lorings Brothers from Wisconsin half breed, he is also partner with them in a saw mill which is now supplying the Indians with lumber.\n\nHe is also joint owner with Mr Lorings in some sporting teams.\n\nThe Springs have done their best prayers to hurt us by stealing our cattle and water and whenever this a question between ourselves and Lorings or the Indians and Lorings Mr Graham's private interests bias him unfairly.\nCause serious injustice.\n\nWhen a company was formed in 1914 to build a dam at Botanum Lake as supported by me and your letter No. 446-503 instead of standing up for the rights I tried to have a part in building Dam and benefiting by it. Mr. Graham helped to keep us out.\n\nIf he had defended the interests of the Indian School he could have secured us a share in the building of the Dam which would have meant enough water power and all concerned.\n\nNow this will be no water after the beginning of June.\n\nMr. Graham's interest in Louie's Ranch which holds 3rd Rent on Botanum Creek is his chief motive in trying to destroy our water right from its benefit to our property.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 888-9, part 2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nMEMORANDUM\n\nMr Scott,\n\nAs the letter hereunder from Mr. L.

Most of this is now at hand and I have arranged to begin the examination of witnesses at Lytton on June 22nd. As soon as possible after hearing of the case and examination of the ground, I will be ready to report, unless some point arise during the hearing which may make it desirable to go to Victoria to interview the Water Comptroller.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6465, file 388-9, part2)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nSir,-\n\nI beg to advise you that I returned today from Lytton where I went carefully into the matter of the charges made by Mr. Leonard Dawson, Principal of St. Georges Industrial School, against Indian Agent H. Graham.\n\nAlthough I took evidence steadily from 9 a.m. to almost 6 p.m. with 45 minutes off for lunch, I find that there is some more information I require from Victoria before making report. This I have written to obtain as I did not want to incur the expense of a trip to the Coast, if it could be avoided.\n\nThe task of making the inquiry was not rendered very agreeable by the parties concerned, although I cannot find any fault with Mr. Graham in the matter of conduct during the inquiry. I did not take the evidence under oath, nor did I adhere to court rules of evidence but allowed the widest possible latitude to both parties in the questions they wanted to ask. In spite of this I have reason to believe that Mr. Dawson is not satisfied and thinks me biased, as he has done with the Water Comptroller, the Supreme Court Judges and everybody else who is not willing to become a partisan on his side. He had two of his employees at the inquiry to give evidence in his behalf, and one of them, Fitzgerald, was offensive in his language towards me. Nevertheless I took down all the evidence.\nMr. Dawson had to offer, either by himself or his employees, and will forward with my report which I shall endeavour to complete at as early a date as possible.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\n\nDuncan C. Scott, Esq.,\nDeputy Superintendent General\nof Indian Affairs, Ottawa\nTo the Secretary of Indian Affairs.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nIn reference to my supplementary report submitted in last April on our water difficulties, I beg leave to withdraw that part of my report which charged Indian Agent Graham with outside interests and partnership with the Loring Brothers.\n\nWhile at the time I wrote this report, I was morally convinced of the accuracy of my statement about Mr. Graham, yet as it is based only on circumstantial evidence and cannot be proved legally, and he asserts definitely that he has no interest at all in any business outside his post as Indian Agent, I can only withdraw my remarks and express regret for having made them.\n\nYou will shortly be receiving Inspector Neppin's report.\n\nJune 26, 1915.\nOf his investigation \u2014 but in justice to my own character I feel bound to say protest against the Inspector's conduct in this investigation.\n\nHe conducted it not as a judge but as prosecutor, as if he were Mr Graham's lawyer.\n\n(1) He showed within a few minutes by attacks on me that his mind was already made up.\n\n(2) He repeatedly gave me to understand he thought me a liar.\n\n(3) He called me James Macdonald Mr Fitzgerald \u2014 a man of integrity and much respected by all who knew him as \"Private Detective.\"\n\nNow whatever my errors of judgment may be \u2014 in the course of 30 years of public life I have never before been called a liar or told that my solemn word or oath was not to be believed.\n\n(4) Again and again when I was trying to make some point clear he either ruled the matter out or silenced the point once.\n\nFaithfully,\n\nEdward Dawson\nDear Sir,\n\nI regret to say that I must lodge a protest, and a very strong one, against the treatment accorded me at the inquiry conducted on the 25th inst by Major McBrat.\n\nWithin a few minutes of the opening of the inquiry Mr. McBrat showed clearly that he had already formed an opinion. I cannot complain about this as every man has a right to his opinion, but there are certainly decided grounds for complaint when an official acting in the capacity that Mr. McBrat was, allows his own personal prejudices to influence his conduct of the proceedings.\n\nIn every possible way he showed bias even to the extent of insulting\u2014this is a strong term but the true one\u2014both Mr. Dawson & myself.\n\nWhether Mr. Dawson could substantiate his charges against Indian Agent Graham or not should make no difference to the fact that an\nan impartial & courteous hearing is expected for both sides, this was certainly not the case as will be seen from the following incident\u2014this is merely one out of many similar incidents.\n\nWhile Mr. Dawson was giving his evidence my name was mentioned. Mr. M. Drew immediately burst in with the insulting & offensive remark that I was employed by the Quit England Co. as a private detective to go about the streets of Lytton finding out things about Mr. Graham. These are almost the very words he used. How I wish to ask you, is a witness to be insulted in this way by a Public Official? Must he submit to an offensive, ungentlemanly & false charge of this sort? Does Mr. M. Drew's official position entitle him to insult private individuals in this way, and if not what redress have I in the matter? In any case I try to call your attention to the manner in which the inquiry was conducted and insist upon Mr. M. Drew's absolute withdrawal of the above mentioned remark.\n\nI remain yours respectfully,\n\nGerald Fitz Gerald\nOttawa, July 10, 1915.\n\nRev. Sir,\n\nIn reply to your letter of the 26th ultimo withdrawing your complaint against Agent Graham that he was in partnership with Loring Brothers but complaining of the treatment accorded you by Mr. Inspector Megraw in the investigation made by him recently, I beg to state that Mr. Megraw's report as to the result of the investigation has not yet been received.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nJ.

McLean\n\nAsst. Deputy and Secretary.\n\nMr. Gerald Fitz Gerald,\nLytton,\nB.C.\nSir,\n\nWith reference to that part of your report relating to water records for the Lytton Industrial School, I beg to inform you that in reply to a communication from this Department, Mr. J.F. Armstrong, Chairman of the Board of Investigation, says that the Board found that the water records of 1864 etc., were appurtenant to lands around the school, but not to Lot 47, which was acquired long after the records were granted. Mr. Armstrong suggests that you should apply to the Comptroller for a water license covering that lot. Mr Armstrong further states that he understands that all the people using water from Botanica Creek are forming a \"Water User Community\" under the provisions of the Water Act, with the view to conserving water and if a water license were obtained by the New England Company for Lot 47 they could join in the community for that lot also.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) J.D. MCLEAN,\nAssistant Deputy & Secretary.\n\nRev. L. Dawson,\nPrincipal, Lytton Industrial School,\nLytton, B.C.\nSir,\n\nOn the approach of Spring and the water season, the trouble between the Rev. Leonard Dawson at St. George's School and the Indians, has commenced on account of the New England Company taking all the water off the Indian Reserve.\n\nI have this morning been all over the disputed territory with Mr. Dawson and the Indians and he, Mr. Dawson, admits that the spring that he is taking water from is on the Indian Reserve but that you have granted him a record on the same, as well as another spring which is situated on Lytton I.R. No. 21.\n\nWhen the Water Board met here at Lytton, Mr. Cockrane, the Solicitor of the Indians, protested, as both these springs were on Indian Reserves and were recorded for the Indians as you will see on Page 83 of the Schedule of the Indian Reserves for Reserves Nos. 21 & 22.\n\nThere is a family relying on each of these springs, there being no other water available and last season they were completely cut off for even domestic purposes and what crops they had were completely ruined.\n\nI will be very much obliged if you will give this your best and earliest attention as I feel sure that the Water Board cannot have granted a record to the New England Co. for water off an Indian Reserve, for it would have been a case of trespassing for anyone to take up anything on a Reserve.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nWilliam Young Esq.,\nComptroller of Water Rights,\nIndian Agent\nVictoria, B.C.\n\nW.G./N.B.\nWater Rights Branch,\nVictoria,\nApr. 7th, 1915.\n\nRev.

Now the Indians have prior rights which must be considered and such rights as you have are not only subject to revision on hydrographic survey, but also subject to the rights of the Indians under their records.\n\nFurther, the domestic requirements of these families must be immediately observed. In the meantime, I am going further into the question with a view to determining a proper system for diversion whereby you may receive water in order of priority.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) WILLIAM YOUNG,\nComptroller of Water Rights.\n\nW.Y./B.S.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nLytton, B.C.\nDecember 18th, 1914.\n\nSir,\n\nRe. dam on Lytton Reserve No. 21.\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of December 16th 1914, re. the application to store water for the benefit of the St. George's Indian Industrial School on the above named Reserve.\n\nIn regard to this I beg to say that I have gone over the proposed site with the Chief and the Councillors of the Band and we do not see any objection to your request to build a dam for storing water on the said Indian Reserve.\n\nThe site of this dam will not affect the Reserve or the Indians in any way and I haven't the slightest hesitation in granting your request, provided that it meets with the approval of the Department at Ottawa.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Sgd.)

Dawson,\nSt. George's Industrial School,\nLytton, B.C.\nIndian Agent's Office,\nLytton, B.C.\nFeb. 17th, 1915.\n\nSir,-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of the Department's letter No. 100094, dated Feb. 9th, 1915, in regard to you demand upon the Rev. L. Dawson to give Indians right to take water from the proposed dam, on the Indian Reserve. As this proposed dam that Mr. Dawson proposes to build will only be a very small affair and is only to be used as an emergency for the school, I do not think that it would be practicable to give the Indians any privilege on this as I agree with Mr. Dawson it might very easily lead to friction and complications and I think Mr. Dawson might be given the privilege of erecting this reservoir with the one proviso; that he is responsible for any damage recurring from the same.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.)

Dawson of St. George's School and the Indians, on account of the New England Company taking all the water off the Indian Reserve.\n\nI have just written Mr. Dawson advising that such rights as he may have are subject to the rights of the Indians and that Domestic requirements at least must be recognised.\n\nThe Water Board has no authority to grant a record to the New England Company for water off any of the Reserves. The jurisdiction of the Water Board extends only to the determination of such rights as may be held under records. Licences for water are granted by the Comptroller and considerable care is exercised at all times in so doing. In the instance where a licence was granted to the New England School, the whole matter was laid before the Indian Department so that no trouble would arise.\n\nThis question will be given as early attention as possible and if necessary, suitable headgates will be installed which will provide for the automatic control of the water.\n\nReferring again to the jurisdiction in respect of granting records for water on Indian Reserves, I might say that we are very desirous that a working arrangement be arrived at.\nas there are many instances where Indians have acquired records from streams outside the reserves with all the advantages provided under the Water Act.\n\nIt is only reasonable that property owners in the vicinity of a reserve should in like manner divert water through a reserve. However, we are working on the problem now and trust in due course to have a good working basis established.\n\nI will do my best to be in Lytton at as early a date as possible, or have Mr. Pileworth call.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Signed) WILLIAM YOUNG,\nComptroller of Water Rights.\n\nWY/BS.\nA.

Megraw Esq.-  \nInspector of Indian Agencies,  \nVernon, B.C.\n\nSir.-\n\nI have the honour to acknowledge your letter of June 2nd., with which is enclosed copy of a complaint from the Rev. L. Dawson, Principal of St. George's Industrial School at Lytton, against the Indian Agent, H. Graham.\n\nThe situation at Lytton has been one of the most difficult we have had to handle, but like all other contentions in respect of the use of water, we have tried to be fair in our decisions which have always been made in the light of existing conditions. In view of the reference that has been made to this Department, I will endeavour to answer your questions as clearly as possible:\n\n1st. \"Has he been able to establish the right of the School to the first record on Botanie Creek?\" - The Board of investigation has adjudicated on all the records on Botanie Creek, handing down their decisions which give priority as follows:\n\n1. New England Company 1864  \n2. McKean 1876  \n3. Loring 1876  \n4. S. C. Indian Reserve 1878  \n5. New England Company 1898  \n6. \" \" \" 1902 on springs\n\n2nd. \"Is it true that Loring's claim to water in Botanie Creek ranks now only as a third record?\" - Yes, see answer to one.\n\n3rd. Has the school any record on the springs on the Indian Reserve?\" - Yes, see answer to one.\n4th. \"The claim that the Indian Agent, Mr. Irwin, has allotted the spring to them with the consent of the Indians, is of course, nonsense, as Mr. Irwin had no such power; and his claim that Mr. Graham has tried to deprive the School of the use of domestic water from those springs is quite the opposite of what Mr. Graham has assured me\" - An application was made by the Company for a storage licence in support of licence of date 1902 on springs already held. It would appear that no serious objection to this storage application was entertained by the Indian Department and in due course the licence was granted. Copy of letter from Ottawa on the point is herewith.\n\nWith respect of the loss of the loss of over $2000.00 complained of; to a certain extent it may be real, if Mr. Dawson has in mind the irrigation of Lot 47. Although Mr. Dawson held no record for this Lot, he for a time insisted on irrigating it, there being continual friction as a result. When the Board adjudicated on the records and pointed out this fact, as Comptroller I enforced recognition of the law on this point. We are, however, granting a record for irrigation on this lot for a limited time, that is to say until June 16th, during which time there will be ample water. From what we can gather, all parties are agreeable to this and which will enable Mr. Dawson to take at least one crop of fodder off the property.\n\nWhen the Board adjudicated on the prior record of the School, a certain quantity of water was allowed. As the ditch through which this water is carried is a very long one, a large portion of water is lost through seepage before it reaches the property to be irrigated. Mr. Dawson endeavoured to establish through his lawyers that he had the right to take sufficient water to irrigate the land in question regardless of loss. This point has now been settled, leaving it within our power to\nat any time insist on beneficial use of water from the time it leaves the stream. As the School has made some improvements to the ditch, and since the other water-users are favourably inclined, Mr. Dawson will be permitted to irrigate his land through the ditch in question, using the water within reason.\n\nNow with reference to the dam recently constructed, the other water-users entered into co-operation and filed their application. Having priority over the application of Mr. Dawson, objections were filed; and because of these and the contentions of the past, I declined to sustain Mr. Dawson in his application for storage until we had some assurance that there would be amicable co-operation with the other users. The objectors to the application of Mr. Dawson did not appear in person; they were represented by their solicitors and were not at any time interviewed by this Department on their objections. My decision has been in the light of past contentions and the fact that apparently no genuine effort was made to get together with the other water-users.\n\nWe are keeping in reasonably close touch with the situation and I see no reason why the Industrial School should not eventually have storage privileges with the other users, but it will rest with the authorities of the School.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd.) WILLIAM YOUNG,\n\nComptroller of Water-Rights.\nOttawa, 23rd February, 1916.\n\nSir.-\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 15th instant enclosing Conditional Water Licence in favour of the New England Company to store and take water from a spring on the Lytton Indian Reserve No. 21.

Megraw,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to our conference regarding the letter of Mr. Dawson as to water rights at Hilton, I regret there is little I can say in answer as that gentleman has evidently studiously avoided an opportunity of opening up a fair discussion on the merits, and I certainly have no inclination to follow his cue and direct a tirade against Indian Agent Graham, the Water Board, the Comptroller and other persons in authority.\n\nAs near as I can recall, the chief loss suffered by the School was that the record it claimed and for many years had been using on Lot 47, was disallowed. The Board had no option in following this course. Our law relating to the acquisition and use of water has altered little in the fundamental principle for many years. In order to obtain the right to use water on any particular hereditaments it is essential that the applicant be the owner thereof. In the early Acts, the benefit of which was available to the School, this clause was not so stringent but any person in lawful occupation and bona fide cultivating lands might secure the right to use water. The School could not avail itself even of this special legislation. Lot 47 was at the time of the Record granted in 1864 still held by the Crown and was not alienated for sometime subsequent to such date; and no right to the use of water thereon existed by law.\nMr. Dawson, therefore, complains bitterly of a state of affairs not caused by any ruling of the Board of Investigation or other official. Most men under similar circumstances would remain silent and be satisfied that \"they had got away with it\" for several years. Naturally the disallowance of this right reduced the allowance of water to which the School was entitled, but any right good in law was not interfered with.\n\nI am inclined to believe that the loss alleged to have been suffered by the School was in respect only of this Lot 47, and if such lot was cropped surely it was at the School's risk as its officials well knew the condition of affairs.\n\nIt must be distinctly understood that the Board's action in disallowing the use of water on Lot 47 was not final; if \"this Board was prejudiced\" the School had the right to appeal therefrom to the Court of Appeal. The procedure is simple and inexpensive: no appeal having been taken, it can be safely assumed that the Board's adjudication was good at law.\n\nThe statement that \"Mr. Graham actually employed Lawyer Cochrane at the Indian Department's expense to oppose our ancient records and have them cancelled\" can be dismissed as wholly untrue. My instructions were received direct from the Department of Indian Affairs and at the time of the hearing Mr. Graham was entirely ignorant of the flaw in these Records as was also the writer until the case proceeded and the School was unable to prove its title to Lot 47. Mr. Graham's instructions have always been eminently fair. The balance of the paragraph from which the above statement is taken shows a desire to thrust a knife in the agent's back. I do not consider this an opportune moment, nor is it necessary, to wash dirty linen so will make no further comments on these statements.\nThe other serious matter dealt with by Mr. Dawson is the question of his not being allowed to share in the construction of the dam on Botannie Lake. There were two reasons for this - one, that the School had no present right to more than a diversion record from Botannie Creek, and the other that neither Mackay, Loring nor the Indians, as a matter of fact, could work in harmony with Mr. Dawson. The two former absolutely refused to consider admitting Mr. Dawson to share in this work and the resultant benefits, consequently the Indians had no choice.\n\nI was present at the meeting at which the question of storage was considered; there were also in attendance Mr. Graham and Messrs Mackay and Loring, with their solicitor, Mr. James Murphy. The question was fully looked into after the other parties agreed to the Indians sharing in the benefits to be derived from this work, and I do not recall the Agent saying one word that would influence the others in their determination not to work in with Mr. Dawson - such determination was apparent and deep-rooted.\n\nIt was brought out in evidence by Mr. Ditchburn that when he was in charge of the School \"he had no trouble with the Indians; by arranging matters from time to time all parties succeeded in obtaining sufficient water.\"\n\nMight I add that in my dealing with the Indian Rights that have come under my jurisdiction I have at all times attempted to show reasonable judgment in opposing conflicting interests and in not one of the score of applications have I been at all biased or been requested to oppose valid rights by the respective Indian Agents.\n\nYours truly\n\n\"ARTHUR COCHRANE\",\nKamloops, B.C.\n4th June, 1915.\n\nA.

C.\n\nSir:-\n\nIn reply to your letter of June 25th, about equitable distribution of the water from the springs, if I remember correctly, I explained to Mr. Dawson that a head-works could be placed with two gates from which water would flow into each ditch, the water dividing, a portion going through each gate. If each party would not interfere with such an arrangement there would, in my opinion, be no further trouble.\n\nOf course it is practically impossible to say at this distance what is or is not feasible; one must be guided by conditions that exist. Assuming that there is a flow of water and two parties are entitled to the use of it, the above plan seems to me the only satisfactory way out of the difficulty.\n\nIf this is not clear to you, kindly let me know.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nsgd.

Megraw Esq. -\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th inst. and now enclose a copy of a letter addressed to the Department of Indian Affairs by the Attorney-General which will give you a fair idea of what happened in the case of Loring's criminal prosecution. We have no depositions in this office as the prosecution was a private one, the Crown not taking any part in it. Mr. Justice Gregory presided at the Spring Assizes at Clinton in 1913 when Loring was tried and acquitted but his judgment is not reported.\n\nLoring brought an action for malicious prosecution but this action was dismissed and I enclose copy of Mr. Justice Murphy's judgment in this case. We do not keep any record of civil actions in this department and I am unable to state whether Chief Justice Hunter presided at any trial in connection with this matter.\n\nThe original depositions taken at the preliminary inquiry are in the custody of the Clerk of the Peace at Clinton and all documents relating to the civil action are kept in the Vancouver Supreme Court Registry.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(Sgd) J. P. McLeod\nDeputy Attorney-General\n\nEnc.\n14th June, 1913.\n\nJ.D. McLean Esq.-\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Honourable the Provincial Secretary has handed me your letter of the 27th ult. with an extract from a letter from the Rev. Leonard Dawson, Principal of the Industrial Indian School at Lytton, making certain criticisms as to the administration of Justice in this Department.\n\nPerhaps it would be as well for you to know exactly the circumstances surrounding this case.\n\nMr. Dawson, through his manager, Mr. Fitzgerald, laid an Information against one Loring for cattle stealing and as Loring was a brother-in-law of our Chief Constable for the District, I at once wired the Chief Constable to take no part in the prosecution so that it could not be said that he had in any way influenced it. I then instructed a barrister from Vancouver to go to Lytton to act for the Crown at the preliminary hearing, so that Mr. Dawson would possibly have no ground for complaint. When he arrived there he found that Mr. Dawson had already retained a Private Prosecutor, so that there was nothing further for him to do but return. The case was dismissed by the Magistrate, and the Private Prosecutor asked to have himself bound over to prosecute at the Assize to be held at Clinton, under a section of the Code - but of course this carried with it a penalty of costs against the Private Prosecutor should he be unsuccessful in his prosecution.\n\nMr. Dawson then took the matter up with this Department and wished us to indict the prisoner in the ordinary way so that he would be relieved of the payment of costs. After looking into the matter, I came to the conclusion that it was not a proper case to indict and I refused to do so. Mr. Dawson then proceeded and placed his case before the Grand Jury and a\ntrue bill was found; the case was then tried by a Petit Jury and Loring was acquitted. The Presiding Judge passed some very serious remarks about the way that the Private Prosecution had acted and inflicted costs against Mr. Dawson's informant in favour of Loring.\n\nYou will now see what little justification there is for the criticism which Mr. Dawson offers of this Department. From what I have seen of Mr. Dawson, I think he is a gentleman who has been always more or less a trouble with his neighbours, and I would suggest that you look carefully into any complaints made by him, before acting upon them.\n\nYours truly,\n\n\"W.J. BOWSER.\"\n\nAttorney-General.\nCOPY\n\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.\n\n(before Murphy, J.)\n\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nLORING VS. NEW ENGLAND\n\nREASONS FOR JUDGMENT.\n\nTHE COURT:\n\nIn this action, assuming, without deciding, that the proceedings have been terminated in favour of the Plaintiff, I am of the opinion that the action fails because it has not been shown there was not reasonable and probably cause for instituting criminal proceedings.\n\nThe condition of Fitzgerald's mind on the morning of the arrest was, I think, this. He had been in the employ of the Mission Company for about two years - he entered that employ sometime early in 1911. He was an old resident of Lytton and up to the time of construction of the railway, there was no butcher shop in that town. The construction of the Canadian Northern being started, or reaching the vicinity of the town, a butcher shop was opened and butchering, presumably to a large extent, went on.\n\nFrom the time Fitzgerald entered the employ of the Mission Company in 1911 until April 1912, none of their cattle disappeared. The butcher shop was being conducted throughout that period. About that time, April 1912, the Plaintiff purchased the butcher shop. During the summer of 1912, from April to November, no less than 16 or 17 head of Mission Cattle disappeared, and it is to be noted, all these cattle were fit for butchering.\nThe Mission people were not engaged in the cattle business, they merely kept a small herd, 34 head of animals or thereabouts. Just sufficient for their supply, and possibly for that of their Industrial School.\n\nLoring being an old resident to Fitzgerald's knowledge Fitzgerald had reasonable cause to believe that Loring knew the Mission people were not in the cattle business, and consequently it would be somewhat unusual if they had sold cattle to anyone. Fitzgerald also knew and had reasonable cause to believe that Loring knew, that the Mission cattle, ranging as they did between the Fraser River and the Thompson close to the junction thereof could scarcely stray to the extent of half of the head in 6 or 7 months, so far as to absolutely disappear. Fitzgerald also knew he had requested Loring some month or two before this occurrence, to report any strays belonging to the Mission that he might come across in his travels as a cattle dealer. He further had heard from two Indians on separate occasions, detailed accounts of alleged cattle stealing on the part of Loring.\n\nNow in that condition of things, he comes into the town of Lytton, finds in Loring's butcher corral one of the Mission cattle - that is in a place where he had reasonable cause to believe the animal was for the purpose of being slaughtered. It is to be noted this corral is not in the town of Lytton, but on the extreme edge of the town, and not in a place where cattle would be likely to be observed sufficiently to be identified. In fact it is probably only on account of the Mission people using brass or metal tags that Fitzgerald observed this particular cow in Loring's corral; and it is further to be noted that even if the Plaintiff's corral was so close to town that any person could observe cattle in it, it would not follow by any means that anyone would suspect, if they saw strange brands, that the cattle were stolen, because butchers in the upper country, or anywhere, buy cattle from\nnumerous persons and the cattle in the corral consequently bear many brands.\n\nUnder all these circumstances I think Fitzgerald had reasonable and probable cause for laying the Information, but it is to be remembered the onus is on the Plaintiff to show he had not. Then Fitzgerald says he went and laid the matter before the policeman at Lytton, not for the purpose of having criminal proceedings taken, but in order that the policeman might come down and authorize him to take the cow out of the corral, he thinking he had no right to do that on his own initiative. It was the policeman apparently who first suggested criminal proceedings, and Fitzgerald being an ex-policeman himself sat down and wrote out the Information. He then went to the Magistrate in Lytton, who was an old resident there, and who is not a cattle man as shown by the evidence. He was for a long time road superintendent, and is now apparently living in retirement. He laid before this Magistrate, Mr. Stevenson, all the facts and the Magistrate took such a serious view that he said it was a case for a warrant. Mr. Stevenson, the Magistrate, being an old resident of Lytton, must have known Loring was a farmer living in that vicinity, and must have known, presumably, that Loring was at that time in town, or would be very shortly, inasmuch as he had been conducting a butcher business there for some 6 or 8 months previous. That in itself is, I think, a fair test of whether there was reasonable and probable cause for Fitzgerald taking the action he did.\n\nI am not at all sure that Fitzgerald could not escape liability if there was not reasonable and probable cause, on the ground that he laid all the facts before the Magistrate and the Magistrate directed a warrant should issue. It is true the evidence is not as clear on that point as it might be, but\nI think a fair inference is that the facts were laid before the Magistrate and on the Magistrate's direction these proceedings were taken.\n\nHowever, I rest my judgment on the proposition that the onus on the Plaintiff to show there was not reasonable and probable cause for laying this information has not been satisfied. And I further think there was no evidence of malice. The suggestion that a dispute between the parties over a race taking place two or three years ago engendered such malice as to cause Fitzgerald to have a sinister motive in laying this information, to my mind is not established. I think this case on that point is weaker than the case recently decided in the Court of Appeal - I think it is Prentiss vs. Anderson Logging Company 16 B.C. Reports.\n\nThe action is dismissed with costs; and as I do not decide the primary point as to whether proceedings were terminated by what occurred, I also direct that the costs in the chamber application before me in that connection be costs in the cause and therefore under this judgment recoverable by Defendant.\nNorth Lytton, B. C.\nJune 22nd, 1915\n\nA. Megraw Esq.,\nInspector\n\nDear Sir,\n\nYour letter to hand re. partnership with Mr. Graham for which I thank you.\n\nI cannot see why Mr. Dawson should be trying to make the public believe that Mr. Graham is in partnership with us. Mr. Graham is just a personal friend --nothing more, and has never been in partnership with us, either on the ranch, saw-mill or in freighting contracts.\n\nIt appears that Mr. Dawson knows more of our affairs than we do ourselves. If he would look after his own affairs as he does other people's it would be far better for the welfare of the Indians.\n\nYours truly,\n\nLoring Bros.\nper A. F. L.\n\"EVIDENCE\"\nEvidence taken at Lytton, June 23rd, 1915, in investigation of charges preferred by Mr. Leonard Dawson, Principal of St. Georges Industrial School, against H. Graham, Indian Agent, and others.\n\nMR. DAWSON -- The loss of hay referred to through want of irrigation was on Lot 47 and refers to the second crop of hay and clover generally grown each year on Lot 47. Witness could not tell what was the average crop of hay grown on this lot for three years prior to 1914, and appealed to Mr. Fitzgerald who said 116 loads would be about the average first crop on that land for the years 1911-12-13 & 14. No definite amount was stated for the second crop, but both Dawson and Fitzgerald said that the second crop in 1914 was less than the second crop in former years. The loads were not weighed but Mr. Fitzgerald was sure they went considerably over a ton. The loss on potatoes was not on Lot 47 but on the home lot or school farm. There were 7 acres of potatoes in 1913 and 9 acres in 1914. A proper crop of potatoes for the 9 acres would be 80 tons and in 1914 they only got 30 tons. Shortage of water was an annual occurrence and there was interference with the water in 1912 and 1913 as well as in 1914. The fruit trees which suffered from want of water comprised peach, plum, apple and cherry. Mr. Dawson did not know the number but Mr. Fitzgerald said: 60 peach trees, 50 plum and he did not remember the number of apple and cherry trees. All the peach trees died except 3; there were 50 odd trees died in all. The ground was cultivated around the trees. They were planted in 1912. Mr. Dawson stated the market price of hay to be $30.00 to $40.00 per ton; Mr. Fitzgerald said the average price was $15.00; Mr. Dawson said they delivered it in town for $24.00 per ton and got $19.00.\nper ton on the ground. The price of potatoes was $20.00 per ton which was the least price obtained by the school. The fruit trees cost on an average 35\u00a2 each. The school held no record for Lot 47 but had the oldest record on Botannie Creek. Witness made application in June 1914 for a record from Botannie Creek for Lot 47, said record being both to divert and to store. This application was refused by Mr. Young on October 8th, 1914 and was granted by him in part on November 11th, 1914. One benefit already obtained from this application so far as right to use Botannie Creek water on Lot 47 is concerned, is the permission given by Mr. Young, Water Comptroller, to use the water up to June 15. The partial grant of this application is obtained in Mr. Young's letter in the following words:\n\n\"The application in so far as taking and using is concerned will for the present stand.\"\n\nThe permission to use water on Lot 47 from the Botannie ditch was given verbally and witness had no documentary evidence to establish it. The New England Company bought their holdings in 1901 from a man named Seward and the estate they bought comprised the land and improvements thereon and the water records. It was not until the Water Board investigated the record holdings in that vicinity that exception was taken to the right of the school to use the water from their Botannie ditch on Lot 47 and no objection had been made by the neighbors for first watering. Seward's clearing on Lot 47 contained about 60 acres and the school have since cleared 15 acres more. The grievance of the school in the matter of being denied the right to join in the storage scheme in connection with the Botannie Creek dam dates from a meeting held in the Hotel Lytton at which there were present, Loring, McKay, Indian Agent and Mr.\nFitzgerald who represented the School, while Loring was represented by Mr. Lucas, Mr. McKay by Mr. Murphy and Mr. Cochrane represented the Indians. They all agreed to appoint an engineer to survey the site of the dam. Christie & Dawson of Kamloops were chosen, the expense to be borne equally and the result to be reported. Mr. McKay said that the dam wouldn't hold enough for all. Subsequently to this meeting Mr. Graham invited me to his office to meet Mr. Cochrane with reference to the dam. In my report of 1914 I mentioned a serious state of affairs with reference to water and in reply I received a letter from the Department No 446, 303 dated June 16, 1914 (Letter marked Exhibit \"A\"). Then I made the application suggested in that letter and it was turned down as I have before said on October 8th, when I became convinced that Mr. Young had become biased against me. After first agreeing to go in together I was advised by Mr. Young through my lawyers, Messrs. Tupper, Kitto & Wrightman, that the others were going on with the scheme for storage in Botannie dam and I was to be left out. The letter was dated Sept. 23, 1914 and the last paragraph stated:\n\n\"In respect of the application of your client I will write you in a few days. The history of the situation in Lytton in respect of your client is that there has been for a number of years a series of contentions more or less bitter, and in view of this state I will have to consider granting a licence to those who have already applied for storage independent of your client, possibly refusing him.\"\n\nMy complaint against Indian Agent Graham in this matter of storage is that as Agent he did not look after the interests of the school which he should not have allowed to be left out, and he should not have hindered as I believe he did. There were four parties interested in the storage at Botannie Lake. Mr. McKay had the first right to store water.\nin Botannie dam and built an old dam which had rotted down over ten years ago. Swan-Benson, contractors, offered to put a dam in that would cost $10000.00 and would have been there for all of us after they got through, but Mr. Drummond who was Agent at the time wouldn't give them permission. When the first meeting was held to store water the only record to store was held by Mr. McKay and it specified Botannie Lake.\n\nI told Mr. Young that he had been influenced to keep the school out and he did not deny it. I said so to Mr. Graham in his office and he did not say anything. The reason I have for saying that Mr. Graham has an interest in Loring's farm is that he works there. He worked there last Sunday. He worked there Whitmonday. He called down one of the Lorings for feeding his horse at the haystack and said \"we can sell all the hay.\" (Witness refused to give the name of the one who told him that he heard Mr. Graham make that remark)\n\nA young fellow named Blanchford was fined by a magistrate for supplying liquor to Indians. He subsequently sold an animal to Mr. Graham to pay the fine and that cow now has the Loring brand upon it. It was Mr. Fitzgerald who told me that Blanchford sold the cow to Mr. Graham and Fitzgerald told me that the cow no has Loring's brand. Mr. Graham pays for things used at Loring's by his own cheque. I do not know this but I was told so; Mr. Fitzgerald told me so. Mr. Graham has an interest in teams working on the government road. I know this because he asked me for work for his teams at the time Lorings were hauling some logs for me. I know Mr. Graham has an interest in the saw-mill with Lorings because he acknowledged to the timber inspector that he had. The timber inspector's name I think is Gamble. Mr. Fitzgerald told me. I know that Mr. Graham employed Mr. Cochrane to oppose the school records because Mr. Cochrane said in court \"I object\nMr. Dawson\n\nto those two records of 1864 and 1867. The school has a record on the springs dated 1902 and it covers three springs, one on government land, one on reserve No. 21 and one on the line between Nos. 2 and 22. The proof that Mr. Graham is trying to take away our domestic water from the springs will be found in his letter to Mr. Young and Mr. Young's reply to the same. (exhibits \"B\" and \"C\") It was on April 6th Mr. Graham held a meeting at which Witness, Fitzgerald, Chief Paul McCarty, Charlie Spintium and Pete were present. It was agreed that the school was to have one spring and Spintium the other, and Spintium was to extend his ditch up to the spring. It was the same date Mr. Graham wrote to Mr. Young. The reason I say Lorings steal our water is that Mr. Fitzgerald in the presence of another party heard Mr. Loring say that he meant to interfere with the ditch by meddling with the gate and turning the water into the creek and I had to place a man at the head of the ditch to camp there to protect ourselves. They also tapped by a ditch above the house. This stealing of the water extended up to about 12 months ago. The cattle stealing was over a definite period between April and November 1912. One of the stolen cattle was found in the slaughterhouse here. The skins that they were selling at that time, many had the brand burnt out. I did not see these, but Goldberg who bought the skins did. This matter of the cattle stealing was adjudicated upon in 1912 and 1913. The first hearing was before the magistrate in Lytton. That case was dismissed but Mr. Fitzgerald was bound over to prosecute at the assizes. The next hearing was an action instituted by Loring against Mr. Dawson for malicious prosecution which took place in Vancouver before Mr. Justice Murphy and terminated in my favour. The assize case was heard at Clinton before Mr.\nMr. Dawson\n\nJustice Gregory when the case against Loring for cattle stealing resulted in a verdict of \"not guilty\". The fourth hearing was before Chief Justice Hunter who disposed of the case by giving judgment for the defendant and said that he believed Dawson and Fitzgerald and did not believe Loring. I said in the public prints what I thought of Mr. Justice Gregory's decision. Subsequent to the prosecution of Loring for cattle stealing there was no more cattle stealing done in the neighborhood.\n\nI say that Mr. Graham helped to keep the school out of the joint storage scheme on Botannie dam by not sticking up for us.\n\nCROSS-EXAMINED BY MR. GRAHAM\n\nQ. Does the information I gave you to come to my office to discuss the matter of a joint dam with Mr. Cochrane look as if I was hindering you getting in on the storage?\n\nAns. I have nothing to say as to that.\n\nQ. In 1914 when Mr. Young and I went over your ditch was not all the water seeping away?\n\nAns.-I was not there to see.\n\nQ.- Did not Mr. Young himself turn the water off that day on account of the whole of the water being lost through seepage?\n\nAns.- I was not aware of that\n\nQ.- Did you not send up and ask the Indians' permission to turn the water from their ditch into your ditch that day?\n\nAns.-Yes\nMr. Dawson\u2014cross-examined\n\nQ. For what reason did you do this if not to deceive?\nAns.-My reason was to give us sufficient water to irrigate a small piece of land, as I had previously given them water.\n\nQ. If your own water had been running in your ditch that day why did you want to take Indian water from their ditch?\nAns.-Because a small quantity was not sufficient to go over the land.\n\nQ.-Are you not wrong in saying that Mr. Drummond refused Swan-Benson's application?\nAns.-No\n\nQ.-Would you be surprised to know that I was Agent at the time and did all I could with Swan-Benson to get their dam built?\nAns.-That must be a subsequent occasion you are referring to.\n\nQ.-Did not Mr. Lucas act for Mr. McKay at the first meeting of the Water Board?\nAns.-Not at the beginning\n\nQ.-Why do you say that I poisoned Mr. Young against you?\nAns.-Because when I asserted that to Mr. Young he did not deny it.\n\nQ.-Would you expect me to refuse Mr. Young when he asked me to go with him over the ditch?\nAns.-No\n\nQ.-What proof have you, Mr. Dawson, that Mr. McKay waived his storage right on Matannie Lake as you say he did?\nAns.-Towards the end of the second meeting of the Commission when matters were informal, I went up to Mr. Lucas and said, if you can get Mr. McKay to waive his prior claim to the dam we all could work together. Mr. Lucas went over and talked to Mr. McKay. Mr. Lucas said: \"My client under my advice has waived his claim if we can make a good arrangement.\"\nMr. Dawson, cross-examined\n\nQ. Did you know that he never waived it and still holds it?\nAns.-I don't know.\n\nQ.- Have I not assisted you generally in the work of the school? (Witness at first would not answer, but to the Agent, admitted one by one, as they were enumerated, the following things: in the matter of attendance; in obtaining storage site by a dam on reserve No. 21; in obtaining a stallion for the school; in getting fruit trees; but he would not admit assistance in getting domestic water from springs on the Indian reserve. As evidence that Mr. Dawson was in honour bound to admit this as well as the others, Mr. Graham tendered copies of letters marked Exhibits \"D\", \"E\" and \"F\")\n\nQ.- Because I work at leisure times on Loring's ranch, is that any reason why I should be financially interested in it?\nAns.-If you have an interest in the farm, it is.\n\nQ.- If I did buy an animal to assist Blachford in paying a fine, is there any objection to me investing my own money as I see fit?\nAns.-Yes, because a man in an official position should not put himself in a doubtful position.\n\nQ.- Is it a doubtful position to buy an animal to assist a man to pay a fine?\nAns.-In your position it is.\n\nQ.- Do you know who came to me to buy the animal?\nAns.-No.\n\nQ.- Would you be surprised to know that the man who was selling the animal did not come to me at all?\nAns.-I have nothing to say.\n\nQ.- Have you any evidence that I pay for anything bought for\nMr. Dawson cross-examined\n\nLorings with my cheque?\nAns.-Not that I can produce\n\nQ. Have you authorized Mr. Fitzgerald to keep his eye on me and carry everything to you concerning my actions?\nAns.-Certainly not.\n\nQ.- How do you keep track of these dates I was seen working on Lorings farm?\nAns.-I remember these particular dates I mentioned; the Indians have told me of seeing you there often.\n\nQ.- (By Inspector) Do you encourage the Indians to discuss matters of this kind with you?\nAns.-No, but they come to me with their troubles.\n\nQ.- Did you personally see me there on the dates you mention?\nAns. I saw you personally on Whitmonday, but not on Sunday\n\nQ. Did I not tell you at our meeting on April 6th last that I would write Mr. Young and ask him whether any records had been granted you on springs on the Indian reserve?\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Did you tell me that Indian Agent Irwin had granted you one of the springs and the Indians the other?\nAns.-It was Chief Paul who said so.\n\nQ.- Did I not tell you that if there were two springs I was willing for you to have one and the Indians the other?\nAns.-Yes.\n\nQ.- Does that look as if I had been trying to deprive you of domestic water from the springs?\nAns.-Mr Young's letter does.\nMr. Dawson cross-examined\n\n(The letter referred by Mr. Dawson is exhibit \"C\")\n\nQ.- Could you find the second spring that day which you wanted the Indians to take?\n\nAns.- Yes, the location of it.\n\nQ.- Was there any water in it?\n\nAns.- That day there was none showing.\n\nQ.- Did I not say that day that I was not justified in asking the Indians to dig a ditch to where there was no water?\n\nAns.- No\n\nQ.- Was it not on that account that I said I would write to Mr. Young?\n\nAns.- You said you would write to Mr. Young to satisfy the Indians.\n\nQ.- Did I not show you a letter later from Mr. Young, saying that no record had been granted you for water on any Indian reserve?\n\nAns.- I have no recollection.\n\nQ.- Did I not say to you a day or two later in my office that I was prepared to meet you halfway in the matter of domestic water from spring, but that I could not give to any person any right to an Indian spring?\n\nAns.- I do not remember.\n\nQ.- Did I not tell you then that I thought the best way would be to collect all the water from these springs in a tank and give a continuous flow through a half inch pipe to the Indians?\n\nAns.- Yes.\n\nQ.- Did Mr. Ochranne not oppose your record on the spring before the Water Board?\n\nAns.- I cannot say.\nMr. Dawson cross-examined\n\nQ.- Didn't Mr. Cochrane oppose the record on the springs on the ground that they had been wrongly described?\n\nAns.-I don't remember.\n\n(Here Mr. Graham tendered as evidence exhibit \"G\", being a memo of the manner in which they were described and drew attention to the fact that no mention is made of them being on an Indian reserve, which he claimed was calculated to deceive the Water Commissioner and secure a record by stealth. He also cited a memo from the Department's Schedule of Indian Reserves and Water Rights page 941 of the militia of in which the Department claims these springs for the Indians\u2014exhibit \"H\")\n\nQ.- Do you not remember the Board giving instructions to have these springs re-surveyed?\n\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- Do you not remember Mr. Parker and Mr. Mackintosh going over and re-surveying these springs?\n\nAns.-No. I have no recollection of them having made the re-survey. I was not officially advised of it and do not remember it. Mr. Fitzgerald tells me that he met them casually.\n\nQ.- Are you surprised at Mr. Cochrane objecting to the records on Botannie Creek when he was there in the interest of the Indians who had only a fourth record on Botannie Creek?\n\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Was Mr. Cochrane's objection not because you were using water on land that you had no record for?\n\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- Because Mr. Cochrane objected on a legal point, had that anything to do with me?\n\nAns.-Yes\nMr. Dawson cross-examined\n\nQ. - When did I tell the timber inspector I had an interest in the saw-mill?\nAns. - Within three months\n\nQ. - Did the timber inspector tell you so, or who did tell you?\nAns. - I didn't get it direct. It came to me from John McKay and had been told to him. It came to me about fourth hand.\n\nQ. - Would you be surprised if I give you the information now that I paid for the mill in April 1907 and the amount was all repaid to me on October 3rd 1908?\nAns. - I should\n\nQ. What evidence have you that I have an interest in the teams?\nAns. - Because you asked me if I had any work for \"our teams.\"\n\nQ. - (by Inspector) Who did you pay for the service of the teams on that occasion?\nAns. - I paid Loring's.\n\n(here Mr. Graham explained that he had no work for his teams at that time but Loring's offered to take them to their pasture where they had plenty of feed and would work them when they had occasion. He was glad to get them off his hands in that way, and knowing that they had plenty of horses of their own to do most of the work on the farm. He had taken it upon himself to ask Mr. Dawson for work for the teams to make them earn the feed they were consuming---It will be noted also that Mr. Graham refers to this same Inspector for Mr. Dawson on page 4 of his evidence, 5th line from bottom spells of the horses as \"his teams\" which he now makes Mr. Graham call \"our teams.\")\n\nQ. - Did my teams not pull the logs for you?\nAns. - I was not aware\n\nQ. - (by Inspector) You say in your report to the Department \"whenever it is a question between ourselves and Loring's or the Indians and Lotings Mr. Agent Graham's private interests bias him\", in what way has the Agent worked against\nMr. Dawson cross-examined\n\nthe school to benefit Lorings?\n\nAns.-Believing as I do that Mr. Graham is interested in Lorings property, any transfer of the water from the school to Loring would benefit Mr. Graham's private interests.\n\nQ.- How is it that in your predecessor's time there was not this strife between the school and Lorings about the water?\n\nAns.-There was trouble during my predecessor's time between the school and Lorings.\n\nQ.- Were you ever given to understand by either Loring or McKay that you were personally objectionable to them and they didn't want you in with them because they couldn't work with you?\n\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- If the water was interfered with in Mr. Ditcham's time, as you say, were Lorings the only ones who did so?\n\nAns.-As far as I know they were the only ones\n\nQ.- Did you take Mr. Justice Gregory's decision in the cattle stealing case with bad grace?\n\nAns.-I did\n\nQ.- Did the Attorney-General make you apologize through the papers for the letter you published concerning the Judge?\n\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- Was the case not dismissed?\n\nAns.-It was.\n\nQ.- Had you counsel in the criminal case before Mr. Justice Gregory?\n\nAns. My own lawyer was away and Mr. Robertson was engaged by Mr. Fitzgerald 5 minutes before the case was called.\nMr. Dawson cross-examined\n\nQ.- Wouldn't you take it to be more Christian-like to drop this thing about Lorings?\nAns.-I would much rather but for its bearing upon Mr. Graham.\n\nQ.- Do you not think you have left yourself liable to Lorings for making these unwarranted criminal charges against them to get a stab at me in the back?\nAns.-I will not answer.\n\nQ.- You claim that the school is wholly Indian, do you think you are doing the right thing by the Indians in trying to take their water off the reserve?\nAns.-I am not trying to take Indian water from Indians.\n\nMR. FITZGERALD,(Called by Mr. Dawson as his witness and examined by him.)\n\nQ.- Indian Agent Graham says in his letter to Mr. Young \"As we are taking all the water from certain springs on reserve No. 21\", is this statement true?\nAns.-No.\n\nQ.- He says \"there is a family relying on each of these springs and through your operations they have been completely cut off even from domestic water\", is that statement true?\nAns.-Absolutely no.\n\nQ.- Is Mrs. Nalee ever deprived by us from domestic water?\nAns.-No.\n\nQ.- Where does she get her water?\nAns.-Alongside her house.\n\nQ.- Since Spintum put that little ditch up the hill, have we ever knowingly deprived him of water?\nAns.-Not to my knowledge.\nMr. Fitzgerald, examined by Mr. Dawson\n\nQ.- Do you frequently cross his ditch under the road?\nAns.-Yes, I cross it at his house\n\nQ.- Have you found water running in that ditch?\nAns.-Yes, invariably. I have seen it on one or two occasions without.\n\nQ.- Have ever given any of our water to Annie for irrigation of her lands?\nAns. On several occasions\n\nQ.- Have you found me anxious in every way to help the Indians?\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Have you gone outside your official duties to help the Indians?\nAns.-I have\n\nMR. SMITH (Called by Mr. Dawson as his witness and examined by him)\n\nQ.- Are you in charge of water tanks at the school?\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- As such do you see Spintlum's ditch frequently?\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Have we deprived him of domestic water since he put the ditch in in 1914?\nAns.-No. He has used the ditch all the time excepting when the gate was clogged with silt or when the gate froze up.\n\nQ.- Has the school used that spring for domestic water ever since it was opened in 1901?\nAns.-Yes\nMr. Smith, examined by Mr. Dawson\n\nQ.- Was there ever trouble with the Lorings about the cutting off of the water in the ditch in my predecessor's time? A.-Yes\n\nQ.- What was the nature of the trouble?\nAns.- The water would cease flowing and someone would have to be sent up to see what was the matter.\n\nQ.- Who caused the trouble?\nAns.- We didn't know who interfered with the ditch. It happened every year somewhere.\n\nQ.- In bad years did it happen frequently.\nAns.- To the best of my recollection it happened every week.\n\nQ.- In your opinion am I a difficult person to work with?\nAns.- No\n\nCross-examined by Mr. Graham\n\nQ.- Do you remember Messrs. Ditcham, Loring and McKay making arrangements to use water alternately when the water became scarce?\nAns.- There was no such permanent arrangement but there were temporary arrangements of that kind.\n\nQ.- Were Lorings the only ones that interfered with the ditch?\nAns.- I wouldn't say that they were.\n\nQ.- Was ever such arrangement made by me?\nAns.- I have heard of it.\n\n(Mr. Dawson tendered declarations made by Messrs. Fitzgerald and Smith with reference to flow of water from spring to Spintlum---Exhibits \"I\" and \"J\")\nMR. GRAHAM\u2014The loss mentioned by Mr. Dawson in his complaint to the Department is fictitious as regards him being prevented from using water to which he had any right, for he mentions a loss of hay on Lot 47 and he had no right to use water on Lot 47. If there was any loss on the home lot it was due to him using the water on land he had no record for. I think the figure mentioned of 116 loads of hay for the first crop is about right. His claim of loss of 50 tons of potatoes on the home ranch does not agree with what he told me for I heard him say last year that he had 80 tons of potatoes and all grown on the home ranch. I think if they had kept the water running on the home ranch where they had a right to use it they would not have lost so many of the fruit trees. The principal loss sustained by the school from insufficient irrigation is due to their own defective ditch which is excessively long and goes through soil which permits great loss from seepage. At the time Mr. Young turned the water off the ditch there was a loss of 47 miners' inches from seepage. Some of the loss in fruit trees also was due to bad care of the trees. Those given them free by the government were choked out with alfalfa in addition to being deprived of the amount of water they should have had. The prices mentioned by Mr. Dawson are also excessive. For potatoes $15.00 to $17.00 per ton is a good average price and $20.00 per ton for hay is higher than the average price.\n\nThe decision given by the Water Board confirmed the New England Company in first right to water in Botanie Creek but confined its use to lots 11 and 12 and reduced the amount. Mr. Young made careful examination of the water situation; I don't know whether he had been sent\nMr. Graham\n\nfor on that occasion. I know of no instance in which I sought to poison anyone's mind. I think Mr. Young, the Water Comptroller, a fair and capable man and not to be influenced by anyone beyond what he believes to be his duty. This is not merely my own opinion, but I have heard nothing but the most favourable comment on the Water Comptroller's work and that of the Water Board. I deny that I ever worked against the school, and I have done a great deal for it and helped Mr. Dawson out in every way I could, consistent with my duty. I have put myself out to obtain pupils for him. Mr. Dawson reported me to Ottawa for not getting pupils. I told Mr. Dawson where they were to be had and advised the Department to that effect and was told by the Department that I had done right in notifying Mr. Dawson where his pupils were to be found, and after that it was for him to get them himself.\n\nAs far as the storing of water in Botannie dam is concerned I tried to get an arrangement for all four. We held a meeting in the Lytton Hotel re storage of this water. At that meeting Mr. McKay said that he didn't believe the dam would hold enough for all four claimants, and he didn't think he could work with Mr. Dawson. He said that nobody could work with Mr. Dawson and Mr. Loring got up and said the same thing. Mr. McKay said that he was perfectly willing to go in with Mr. McKay and the Indians, and then Mr. Cochrane advised me that when Mr. McKay who had the storage right, held those views, I had better fall in with the other two.\n\nI did not employ Mr. Cochrane, as Mr. Dawson states. It was the Department who employed him and I think it was a wise appointment and the Indians have got full benefit from it. In Mr. Cochrane's work before the Water Board he\nclashed with Mr. Dawson. To a certain extent the interests of the Indians and the school were opposed. The first thing Mr. Cochrane opposed in behalf of the Indians as against the school was the school record on Botannic Creek. His ground of objection was that they had more land under cultivation than their record would warrant. The Indian record was only fourth and for that reason he should oppose giving so much to the school, when they were using more than their record would call for. They were remonstrated with because of this excessive use of water and there was argument on it before the Water Board. It is not true that I tried to take away water from the school for domestic purposes. In the matter of the springs on the Indian reserve the interests of the Indians and of the school were clashed and in that case I considered that my duty lay with the Indians. I don't think it would injure the Indians to allow Mr. Dawson to have water from the springs for domestic purposes and where the school could be benefited without injury to the Indians I was always willing to do what I could to meet Mr. Dawson half way to that purpose and I did so. The spring is on the Indian reserve and the water belongs to the Indians, but I know that the school needs the water for domestic purposes and under those conditions I was and am willing to divide up with the school. I have had clashes with Mr. Dawson on various things, but on most matters of business we are able to hit it off. I have found him very obstinate and unreasonable in the matter of water. I don't think he has shown a disposition to meet the Indians fairly in the matter of water, especially with the springs and the dam. I have not had much difficulty with him as regards the creek. I had\nMr. Graham\n\nnever heard of Indian Agent Irwin and the Indians allotting\nthe spring to the school until Mr. Dawson told me. I dis-\nbelieved it then and I told Mr. Dawson that no Indian Agent\nhad the right to give an Indian spring to the school. I\ndid hear of occasional friction between Mr. Ditcham and the\nother claimants to water on Botannic Creek, but have every\nreason to believe that the general relations between them\nwere neighborly and accommodating. Mr. Ditcham himself told\nme that he was willing to share up and be neighborly with\nthem. I object to Mr. Dawson saying in his complaint to the\nDepartment that I was trying to take away their water for\ndomestic purposes from the spring and doing it \"on the\nspecious plea of defending the rights of an Indian named\nSpintium? I have worked for the Indians and defended their\nrights and in doing so there was never anything specious\nnor make-believe about it. Mr. Dawson has always had trouble\nabout that spring. I say this because of complaints that\nwere continually being made to me by Indians about it. There\nwas one family and different members of it would come com-\nplaining to me. I went out time and again to investigate\nand in most cases found that the Indians' complaints were\nright and they were without water. Mr. Fitzgerald's evidence\nis in the main correct, but it has very little to do with\nthe point at issue for it refers only to the period since\nthe Spintium ditch was put in, and the times I investigated\nwas before the ditch was put in.\n\nEvery charge made by Mr. Dawson about me being mixed up\nin other things on the outside are absolutely false. I have\nno interests outside the Indian Agency. I had a freighting o\noutfit that I was interested in before I was Indian Agent,\nMr. Graham\n\nand I had it after, but I did not let it take any of my time. There was no one in partnership with me; I had it myself, and after I became Indian Agent I had a manager who was Jimmy Innes. I don't think the Lorings are the criminals Mr. Dawson represents them to be. They are not South Mexican half-breeds as he has stated. Mr. Loring was an American and had served with the U.S. army in Mexican war and was a pensioner of that country. Mrs. Loring was born in Victoria, B.C. The community generally do not share Mr. Dawson's estimate of them. I am a personal friend of the Lorings. I go up there any spare time, and as I am not of a lazy disposition I work with them, but I never received wages for it, nor have I any interest with them in the ranch whatever. I have not known of any particular disagreement between Lorings and the Indians. The dislike of the Indians to Lorings is directed against one member of the family who had a butcher shop in Lytton and they blamed him for taking cattle that they lost and in that way tried to incriminate me in the charges they made against me. I think it is false what Mr. Dawson said in his evidence about Loring having skins in his possession with the brands burnt out. The credit taken by Mr. Dawson of having been the originator of the scheme for damming Botannic Lake is groundless. It was mooted many years before he came to the district, and I myself tried to get the different parties interested in it to get together 8 years ago to put in the dam. I think it was back in 1876 that Mr. McKay got his record to store water in Botannic Lake. In order to get the Indians into the scheme for damming I had to fall in with whoever built the dam, and both McKay and Loring absolutely refused to have Mr\nMr. Graham\n\nDawson in it; and as the Indians had a record to put water into Botannic Lake from Skoonka Creek, I couldn't let the opportunity for storing to pass and so I fell in with the other two parties, for I claim that to the Indians I owe my first duty. I believe in helping the school wherever an opportunity offers and the interests of the Indians are not injured thereby. I am of the belief that there are instances where the interests of the Indians and of the school are opposed and other instances where they are identical. There was not the disagreement in Ditcham's time which there has been since Mr. Dawson came and I believe that Mr. Dawson is in a large measure responsible for the clashing.\n\nMr. Dawson has never had a friendly feeling to me ever since I was appointed. He even wrote articles against me in an English magazine which he was not justified in writing for he didn't. The allegations in the article were actionable and if I had been a free agent I would have taken action against him as I was advised to do. I am not the only one Mr. Dawson cannot get along with. I think he could count all the friends he has in town on the fingers of one hand.\n\nCross-examined by Mr. Dawson\n\nQ.- Do you really mean to say that I have fought with nearly everyone in town?\n\nAns.-Yes, I stand by the statement that you have fought nearly everyone in town.\n\nQ.- Give me particulars. Who have I fallen out with?\n\nAns.-You have fallen out with the principal people in town\u2014\n\nMr. Anthony, Mr. Irwin, former manager of the Bank, Archdeacon Pugh, W. C.

Is it true?\nAns.-Not altogether, for domestic purposes.\n\nQ.- Could Messrs. McKay and Loring have built the dam without your consent as Indian Agent?\nAns.-Yes, because Mr. McKay's record was before the reserve was allotted.\n\nQ.- Could Mr. Loring have built a dam on the Indian reserve without the Indian Agent's consent?\nAns.-Not by himself, but he could in conjunction with Mr. McKay.\n\nQ.- Did you try to save the school from losing its share\nMr. Graham, cross-examined by Mr. Dawson\n\nin the dam?\n\nAns.-I did not.\n\nQ.- During the time that Ditcham had difficulty with the Lorings about the water, were you living with Lorings?\n\nAns.-For a short period I was?\n\nQ.- Would you not know about the water differences?\n\nAns.-I would\n\nQ.- How long is it since McKay's dam fell down?\n\nAns.-I have no idea; it was not standing when I came to the town.\n\nQ.- Would you consider it a loss to the Indians if the school were closed down?\n\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Did you help Mr. Cochrane to work up the local cases.\n\n(Answered by the Inspector who said it was the duty of every Indian Agent to accord whatever assistance he could to the solicitor appointed by the Department to look after the Indians' water rights, and he hoped Mr. Graham had not failed to do so in this Agency)\n\nQ.- Did you, Mr. Graham, instruct Mr. Cochrane regarding the local cases?\n\nAns.-I assisted him.\n\nQ.- After that meeting in the hotel when it was agreed that Christie & Dawson should make a survey for all of us, why did that fall through?\n\nAns.-I don't remember\n\nQ.- How long was the journey you made with Mr. Young?\n\nAns.-The length of your ditch\n\nQ.- Did Mr. Young ask you to go up with him from the auto to the ditch to examine it for him?\n\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- Did he call at the school on the way up?\n\nAns.-No.\nMr. Graham, cross-examined by Mr. Dawson\n\nQ.- Did he call at the Loring's on that trip?\nAns.-Coming home he did.\n\nQ.- Can you tell me why Mr. Young refused to grant a record to Lot 47, when I applied?\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- Did you make objection to my application for record for 47 when you were notified of it?\nAns.-No\n\nQ.- Did Mr. Young ask your opinion about the water difficulties between Lorings and ourselves?\nAns.-Only in regard to using the water on Lot 47\n\nQ.- When water is turned on and off, is it apt to make a flume leak?\nAns.-It is\n\nQ.- Would it be worse if the water was turned on and off frequently?\nAns.-If the flume was allowed to dry out, it would make it leak, but if often enough to prevent drying out, the more frequent the better.\n\nQ.- Is it possible that the water would reach 47 when it wouldn't reach the school farm?\nAns.-Quite possible indeed.\n\nQ.- Did I say to you that we had 80 tons of potatoes in 1914?\nAns.-Yes, in your own study at the school. I think you told me that you had 80 tons in the cellar.\n\nQ.- How do you base your price of potatoes at from $15.00 to $17.00 per ton?\nAns.-Just from general observation and my knowledge of the local markets.\nMr. Graham, cross-examined by Mr. Dawson\n\nQ.- Do you know that this year I have sold them at the coast, never below $20.00 per ton?\n\nAns.-No, I don't.\n\nMISS BURGESS-(Stenographer in Mr. Graham's office)\n\nExamined by Mr. Graham\n\nQ.- Do you remember the day when Mr. Dawson came down to discuss the matter of the spring which he accuses me of having taken away from the school?\n\nAns.-I do\n\nQ.- Did I not tell Mr. Dawson I was willing to meet him half-way?\n\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Did I not tell him that I knew the school required the water and suggested to him that we endeavour to come to arrangements whereby both could have the water?\n\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Did I not suggest to him that we put the water into his tank and he should deliver a certain quantity through a half inch pipe continuously to the Indians?\n\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Do you remember me telling him that I couldn't see my way to give him a right to the spring as it was on an Indian reserve?\n\nAns.-Yes\n\nQ.- Did I not show Mr. Dawson Mr. Young's letter stating that he had not granted any right to the New England Company on the reserve?\n\nAns.-Yes, I remember getting the letter for him.\n(Mr. Graham later submitted exhibits \"K\" and \"L\" which have an important bearing in corroboration of his evidence, and before I left Lytton requested to be permitted to put in exhibit \"M\" which goes to show that his memory did not fail him in the matter of what Mr. Dawson told him about the potatoes)\n\nThe evidence of Water Comptroller, Young, Solicitor Cochrane and former Indian Agent, Irwin, will be found in exhibits, \"N\", \"O\" and \"P\" respectively\nOffice of Inspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\n\nJuly 17, 1915\n\nFile 446303\n\nAssistant Deputy and Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa\n\nSir,- I beg to report that on June 23rd I held an investigation at Lytton into the complaint of Mr. Leonard Dawson, Principal of St. George's Industrial School, and beg to report thereon as follows:\n\nMr. Dawson claims a loss of $2000.00 and specifies that the loss was incurred from 40 tons of hay, 50 tons of potatoes and from destruction of fruit trees. In his evidence he states that the loss in hay was on the second crop on Lot 47, for which land the New England Company have no water record and never had, although they have always used water on it from their Botann\u00e9e Creek ditch and were able to gather a second crop each year at the expense of other holders of water rights below them\u2014Messrs Loring and McKay, and even to the loss of their own school farm which was made to suffer from lack of water owing the amount used on Lot 47 in the effort to obtain a second crop. But when the Water Commission sat in Lytton at which meeting all claimants and users of water from the various streams of the district, or water precinct as it is called, had to prove their legal title to the water which they claimed, the New England Company were unable to establish any right to water from Botann\u00e9e Creek for Lot 47, but they were able to show that they had the first two records (dated 1804\nand 1867) from Botannie Creek for their school farm to which it had to be conveyed through a ditch some six miles long. These facts are amply brought out in the evidence taken by me and in letters from Water Comptroller, William Young, and solicitor A. O. Cochrane, (Exhibits \"N\" and \"P\").\n\nFortunately for the New England Company large powers are given to the Water Comptroller and in this case Mr. Young has used them generously in giving to the New England Company permission to use water from their Botannie ditch on Lot 47 notwithstanding the fact that they have been adjudged by the Water Board to have no legal right to the same. In view of these facts it will be seen that Mr. Dawson's claim of loss of hay for a second crop on Lot 47 is not sustained.\n\nTurning to the claim of loss from potatoes there is a conflict of evidence between Mr. Dawson and Indian Agent Graham. Mr. Dawson says that he should have had 60 tons from 9 acres and only had 30 tons, showing a loss of 30 tons. Mr. Graham was sure that Mr. Dawson had told him that he had saved a crop of 80 tons of potatoes from nine acres of the school farm in 1914. Later Mr. Graham found an old notebook which he had used in 1914 and an entry in it made about the end of 1914 bears out the correctness of Mr. Graham's contention during the hearing. The entry is found in Exhibit \"M\". In a measure also this entry is corroborative in part of Mr. Dawson's own evidence for it shows him to have been right in saying that a proper crop would have been 80 tons, only he appears to have forgotten that the school had gathered that much in 1914 and that he had told Mr. Graham so. I must therefore come to the conclusion that the alleged potato loss was not sustained.\n\nWith no legitimate loss on the hay and no loss on the potatoes the balance would have to be made up on the fruit\ntrees. Taking Mr. Fitzgerald's count at \"50 odd\" trees that died and allowing it to be 55 trees at $25 each the loss would be $19.25 instead of $2000.00. But Mr. Graham claims that neglect of the trees which were allowed to be choked out with alfalfa contributed to the fatality.\n\nMr. Dawson's statement as to the amount to which the Water Board cut down the New England records need not be discussed as the Indian Agent seems to be in no way responsible for it nor connected with it, and the Department of Indian Affairs are not likely to be interested in any disagreement between the Principal of St. Georges School and the Water Comptroller. The reason for the reduction in quantity so far as the Comptroller is concerned, is set forth in his letter marked Exhibit \"M\".\n\nThe principal grievance of St. Georges Industrial School is in not being allowed to participate in the building of the storage dam on Potanum Lake. That the fact of being thus barred from participating in that project means a more or less serious material loss, there can be no question. The point to be determined is why they were barred and who is responsible for it. Mr. Dawson says the Indian Agent is responsible and Mr. Graham and others say Mr. Dawson is. Much evidence was taken on that point, but the weight of it evidently favours Mr. Graham's contention. A careful examination of the evidence will show that those who wanted to keep Mr. Dawson out (and it was Messrs. Loring and McKay who wanted to do so) had two good reasons for it. The one was that the school having no storage right but merely a diversion right, were in no position to contribute any legal strength to the partnership; and the other and main reason was that Mr. Dawson had managed to make himself personally objectionable to these two men by his tendency to quarrel with them, for in the assertion of his own rights\u2014both real and assumed\u2014he had no misgivings about riding roughshod.\nover the rights of others. Why I regard this the main reason is that there was another reason why they should have wanted to have had him in with them on it, and that was to share up the expense with them. But when they were ready to forego that very obvious advantage, it shows how strong their personal antipathy to Mr. Dawson had become.\n\nMr. Dawson is too much given to jumping at conclusions, and because Mr. Graham managed to get the Indians into the storage scheme while St. Georges Industrial School was cut, he at once assumed that Mr. Graham was the cause of his being kept out, or at all events could have carried the school in with him if he had wanted to do so. But as there were those two reasons for keeping Mr. Dawson out, so there were also some reasons for taking the Indians in. These were that the Indians could contribute some legal strength and substance to the enterprise by holding a storage right on Shoona Creek whose waters could be diverted into Botannie Lake; moreover they (the Indians) were not personally objectionable to Messrs Loring and McKay who had always neighbored with them on satisfactory terms, and one of whom (McKay) held the first storage right on Botannie Lake. Besides, they could contribute their share of expense and labour in the building of the dam, which they did. Under these circumstances I am satisfied that Mr. Graham, acting on the advice of Mr. Cochrane, solicitor for the Indians, was not only justified in entering into arrangements to have the Indians included in the storage scheme, no matter whether the school was to be taken in or left out, but he would have been guilty of bad management and serious neglect to the Indians if he had failed to get them in.\n\nTo make plainer this matter of the benefit to be derived from possession of the Indians' storage right on Shoona Creek, some knowledge of the topography of the locality is necessary.\nThe Fraser valley in which St. Georges Industrial School is located, at this point runs approximately north and south, and the Thompson empties in from the east at a point about two miles below and south of St. Georges. Botannie Creek flows into the Thompson from the north, thus paralleling the Fraser from which it is separated by a high range of hills terminating southward at the Thompson River, the three streams forming the three sides of a quadrilateral. The drainage basin of Botannie Creek is very short\u2014not more than about 16 or 17 miles. Botannie Creek does not flow out of Botannie Lake, but seems to rise some distance south of it. Skoonka Creek does not drain into Botannie Lake but flows past the north end of it in a southeasterly direction towards the Thompson into which it empties a few miles farther up than the point at which Botannie Creek empties. By diverting the water from Skoonka Creek a short distance up, it can be made to discharge into Botannie Lake basin. This has been done and the dam on Botannie Lake is now full. Mr. Dawson should see that when the Indians have this storage water right on Skoonka, this should be sufficient reason for the Indians being taken in. I cannot see therefore that the point against the Indian Agent is well taken on Mr. Dawson's part and it has not been established.\n\nMr. Dawson's complaint that the Water Comptroller had been poisoned against him by the Indian Agent is one which does not appear to be capable of satisfactory proof either for or against. Mr. Dawson bases his proof on his own statement that he had charged each and neither had denied. Both Mr. Young and Mr. Graham regard the charge as too preposterous to be discussed, and probably this reluctance to discuss was what Mr. Dawson interpreted as failure to deny. Before dismissing that feature of the complaint I may say that I have had good opportunity to note how generally satisfactory Mr. Young's work is regarded over the province. He is one of the few men who could safely be trusted.\nwith the large power given him under the present Water Act, for he does not appear to be influenced by any personal likes or dislikes, and I fail to see wherein he has shown any disposition to show prejudice to Mr. Dawson or the New England Company.\n\nTurning to the charge that Mr. Graham \"actually employed lawyer Cochrane to oppose his records\" this is disproven by Mr. Graham's evidence taken in conjunction with the statement of Mr. Cochrane (Exhibit \"F\") and Mr. Dawson had no evidence in support of it except his own statement.\n\nThe matter of right to the springs does not appear to be clear. The letter of Mr. Young, Water Comptroller, makes it evident that there is some right on springs held by the New England Company under a record dated 1902, and such right is claimed by Mr. Dawson in his evidence (page 5). The description of the springs in application made by the New England Company for their record of 1902 is shown in Exhibit \"G\". Mr. Graham brought out in evidence (pages 10 & 11) that a re-survey was ordered by the Water Board and had been made. A plan of this survey will be seen in part of Exhibit \"G\", obtained from Water Rights Branch of the Lands Department at Victoria. Nevertheless these springs are claimed for the Indians by the Department of Indian Affairs as will be seen on page 53 of the Schedule of Indian Reserves for Reserves No. 21 & 22. Mr. Graham's contention is that the record of 1902 claimed by the New England Company is not good insomuch as it was obtained by a wrong description in the application, which tended to mislead the resident Water Commissioner who issued it, and in this contention he seems to be borne out by the statement of the Water Comptroller (Exhibit \"H\") where he says:\n\n\"The Water Board has no authority to grant a record to the New England Company for water off any of the Reserves.\"\nThe additional claim to the water from the springs on the reserve which Mr. Dawson sought to establish in his reference to Mr. Irwin, does not seem to be borne out in the letter from Mr. Irwin, (Exhibit \"Q\"). Even if it were so that Mr. Irwin had done as claimed by Mr. Dawson, that could have no bearing on the case so far as present right is concerned, for Mr. Irwin had no power to grant water belonging to the Indians to any other person.\n\nThe next phase in connection with Mr. Dawson's complaint about the springs is that Mr. Graham was trying to deprive him of the use of domestic water from the springs. In view of the conversations which passed between them, as shown in the evidence and also the letters, it is rather remarkable that Mr. Dawson should make this charge against the Agent. Apart from Mr. Dawson's assertion to that effect there does not seem to be anything to bear it out. On the contrary it seems to be pretty well established from the evidence that Mr. Graham recognized the need of the school for domestic water from the Indian springs and was always willing to facilitate matters in that direction. Exhibits \"D\" and \"E\" appear to show very conclusively that there was no contumacy or wanton opposition on Mr. Graham's part, but rather a desire to concede as much as he possibly could without injury to the Indians. It is very true that he remonstrated against the Indian Spintum being deprived of water from the springs both for domestic purposes and for irrigation. Why his doing so should be characterized by Mr. Dawson as a \"specious plea\" does not appear clear. The evidence of Fitzgerald and Smith and also their sworn depositions put in by Mr. Dawson and to be found as \"I\" and \"J\" of the Exhibits to refute the claim that any of the Indians had been deprived of domestic water, will be seen at the bottom of page 14 of the evidence to refer only\nto the time \"since Spintum put that little ditch up the hill\" and in his letter to the Water Comptroller (Exhibit \"H\") Mr. Graham specifies \"last season.\" Thus this part of the evidence of Smith and Fitzgerald was given to disprove an alleged statement by Mr. Graham which Mr. Dawson fancied had been made but had not been made nor intended by Mr. Graham, although the Water Comptroller appears to have rather carelessly transcribed it that way.\n\nNext, Mr. Dawson makes the charge that \"Mr. Graham is mixed up in so many outside businesses which clash with his duties as Indian Agent and prevent him acting fairly to this school and the Indians generally.\" This is the same charge made in the complaint of the Indians against Mr. Graham, investigated by me on May 8th, 1915, and reported on to the Deputy Superintendent General, but in the investigation the Indians repudiated having included it in the charges made by them. It was also made by Mr. Dawson in a letter to me under date of May 10th, 1915, a copy of which I forwarded with the report above mentioned, and from that circumstance I inferred that Mr. Dawson was either responsible for, or in some way connected with, the formulation of the Indians' charges. Now that it is again repeated by Mr. Dawson there is no longer reason to doubt the origin of a part, at least, of the Indians' charges. It is therefore up to Mr. Dawson to make good what the Indians refused to endorse. He charges that Mr. Graham is financially interested with Lorings in their ranch; in a saw-mill, and in freight teams. His reason for charging Mr. Graham with having an interest in the Loring ranch is that Mr. Graham had been seen at work on it, and also that he had been heard to make a remark which tended to the supposition that he was interested in the ranch; but it is still only supposition and he refused to say who had heard the remark. All the evidence\nMr. Dawson had to offer on this will be found on page 4 of his deposition and on pages 12 and 13 of his cross-examination by Mr. Graham. In view of the unsatisfactory hearsay character of Mr. Dawson's evidence on these points and Mr. Graham's flat denial supported by data such as he furnishes in his own evidence and in Exhibits \"E\" which is capable of being verified with files in the Department, I am of the belief that Mr. Dawson's charges in this connection are not only unproven but are in a great measure disproved.\n\nThe charges which Mr. Dawson makes against Loring's of stealing water and stealing cattle belonging to the school is, so far as the cattle are concerned, a revival of civil and criminal cases adjudicated upon in the courts of this province and somewhat fully set forth on pages 5 and 6 of Mr. Dawson's evidence and in Exhibits \"S\", \"T\" and \"U\". It will be noted that in his charge against Loring's Mr. Dawson says: \"have for years done their best to hurt us by stealing our cattle and water\" which implies that cattle and water are still being stolen from him, but in his evidence he corrects this and restricts the cattle stealing to a definite period in 1912 but still ignores the fact that two Courts of this Province had already decided that Lorings had not been guilty of cattle-stealing at all and that the other two did not adjudicate upon the charge of cattle-stealing at all but on that of malicious prosecution which is altogether the text of Justice Murphy's decision (Exhibit \"U\"). The Lorings, so far as I can learn, bear a good reputation in the community, and in view of the adjudication of some years ago I do not think Mr. Dawson was justified in making the charge again in the manner in which he did. As for stealing of the water, I have reason to believe from what has transpired that the Water Comptroller and his engineers who have thoroughly looked into the matter, regard Mr. Dawson as the more blameworthy of the two for the disagreements which have taken place.\nThe last three paragraphs of Mr. Dawson's complaint seem to put in more definite form his grievance against Mr. Graham in connection with the exclusion of the school from participation in the building of the storage dam at Botanie Lake. But as I have already gone into that pretty fully there is no need to repeat the points brought out and the conclusions I drew from those points. It is very unfortunate that the school has been left out, but I cannot see that the Agent is in any degree responsible for it. It has been pretty plainly shown from the evidence that Mr. Dawson is responsible, and I am quite sure that the Water Comptroller is of the same belief as myself in that connection. If not, I do not understand what he means in that last paragraph of his letter (Exhibit \"N\") where he says:\n\n\"I see no reason why the Industrial School should not eventually have storage privileges with the other users, but it will rest with the authorities of the school.\"\n\nBy it he evidently means that with another man than Mr. Dawson in charge, the school could have obtained and might still obtain storage privileges with the others, in Botanie Lake, and I think the Water Comptroller has good grounds for arriving at that conclusion.\n\nIf Mr. Dawson's appointment as Principal of St Georges Industrial School rested with the Department of Indian Affairs I would feel it my duty to recommend that he be asked for his resignation, as a means to restore harmony in that Agency. He has prejudiced the interests of the School in being the direct cause of exclusion from the storage project and I am convinced that he has considerable to do with dissatisfaction among the Indians against the Agent, although I doubt whether he is as much to blame in that connection as his employee, Fitzgerald, who seems to work under-handedly among the Indians, carries carries tales to Mr. Dawson and has a faculty for keeping him in hot water.\nThat Mr. Dawson's heart is in his work and that he has succeeded in building up the school and secured an attendance far over that of his predecessor there can be no question, but I have reason to believe that much of that success in getting pupils is due to the assistance he had from the Indian Agent, while his predecessor, from what I can learn, had practically no assistance from the Agent who preceded Mr. Graham. Neither was it generous on Mr. Dawson's part to say of his predecessor: (page 23 of the evidence) \"When I came there were only five boys in the school and the Indians were not welcome inside the gate.\" The first part of that assertion may be true, but I doubt the second part. It does not comport with the general impression entertained of his predecessor, Mr. Ditcham, who appears to have been able to get along agreeably with others, and it is very much like so many other conclusions arrived at by Mr. Dawson on altogether insufficient foundation and with too great tendency to believe the worst rather than the best. Mr. Dawson, I believe, means to do well, and his morbid disposition and tendency to quarrel is his misfortune rather than his fault.\n\nThere are some other features of the situation to which I might refer but they have no direct bearing upon the things charged by Mr. Dawson which I was instructed to investigate.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nInspector of Indian Agencies\nAugust 18, 1915.\n\nSir:\n\nI have carefully read Mr. Inspector Hegren's report concerning the recent difficulty between yourself and Mr. Graham, in regard to water storage and other matters.\n\nThe Department keenly regrets that the school should have sustained the losses of which you complain, and fully recognizes the difficulty of the situation with which you have been confronted.\n\nThe Department is glad to note, in your letter of June 26th, that you have found reason to withdraw the charge that Mr. Graham devotes his time to other than departmental interests, and, it is confidently expected that, upon further investigation, your other complaints against him may resolve themselves in a similarly happy manner. It must also be clear to you that the agent's\n\nRev. Leonard Dawson,\nPrincipal St. George's Industrial School,\nLytton, B.C.\nposition is somewhat embarrassing in that he is called upon to protect the interests of both the Indians and the school, whereas these interests, owing to unfortunate circumstances for which neither side is responsible, would appear to be in conflict.\n\nThe Department regrets that you should feel compelled to place an unpleasant interpretation upon the attitude assumed towards you by Inspector Degrav, but prefers to leave the matter in abeyance, without further comment for the present, in the hope that future developments may provide a basis for a more amicable understanding.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\nAugust 18, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing copy of my letter to Rev. Leonard Dawson, dealing with your report on the recent investigations of his charges against Agent Graham.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nA. Mcgraw, Esq.,\nInspector of Indian Agencies,\nVernon, B.C.\nAugust 18, 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI am enclosing copy of my letter to Rev. Leonard Lawson, dealing with Mr. Inspector Megraw's report concerning Mr. Dawson's complaints against you.\n\nYours truly,\n\n[Signature]\n\nDeputy Superintendent General.\n\nH. Graham, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nAugust 6th, 1915.\n\nMemorandum,\n\nMr. Scott.\n\nI have carefully read over Mr Megraw's report of his investigation into the complaints preferred by Mr. Leonard Dawson, Principal of the St George's Industrial School, against Indian Agent Graham at Lytton, B.C.\n\nAlthough Mr Megraw has not made any definite recommendations, still, his opinion is very clearly stated. He entirely exonerates Mr Graham and shows that some of the complaints should never have been made and that others are the result of Mr Dawson's inability to live on satisfactory terms with his neighbors.\n\nThat the School should have lost heavily through an insufficient supply of water is very regrettable, and Mr Megraw has endeavoured to place the responsibility for this loss. He has found that the blame falls more upon Mr Dawson himself than upon Mr Graham, and points out that the School has no legal right to storage of water, and that that was the main reason why Mr Dawson was not allowed to join with the others in the\nconstruction of the storage dam. Both Mr Megraw and Mr Young are of the opinion that had a reasonable man been Principal of the School, he would have been allowed to share in the expense and benefit.\n\nI do not find any of the complaints against Mr Graham justified, and although Mr Dawson, in a letter dated June 26th, complains about Mr Megraw's unfair investigation; Mr Megraw, on his part, stated on June 25, that his task was not rendered very agreeable and implies that the fault lay, not with Mr Graham, but with Mr. Dawson.\n\nPerhaps the clearest statement in Mr Megraw's report is in the last paragraphs, when he remarks that if Mr Dawson's appointment rested with this Department, he would feel it his duty to recommend that Mr Dawson's resignation be called for as a means of restoring harmony in the Agency.\n\nThe evidence, which is voluminous, entirely bears out Mr Megraw's report, and it seems a pity that an Indian Agent should be placed upon the defensive by Mr Dawson, who thinks that even the Commissioner of Water Rights and Supreme Court Judges are biased because they are willing to become active partisans upon his behalf.\nIN YOUR REPLY REFER TO\n\nIN INDIAN OFFICE,\n\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDEPT. OF INDIAN AFFAIRS\n\nSURVEYS\n\nAug. 25th 1915.\n\nSir,\n\nI beg to advise you that the Rev. Leonard Dawson of St. George's School wrote to the Comptroller of Water Rights asking him to use his influence with so that I would consent to allow him, Mr. Dawson, the use of the Ditch as there is only one Indian using water at the present time and he is not using half a ditch full.\n\nThe Comptroller thought that it was a pity that water should be going to waste, when it might be made good use of at the Indian School, and I myself think it would be better for the flume to be well filled and kept from shrinking during the hot weather.\n\nI considered the matter over, and as it was to our advantage to have the flume kept in good repair, I gave Mr. Dawson permission to use the extra space, for this season only, on condition that he put more water in and divided up with this one Indian, and to be responsible for any damage that may accrue.\n\nTrusting that this meets with the Department's approval.\n\nI have the honour to be,\n\nSir,\n\nyour obedient servant,\n\nIndian Agent.\n\nAsst. Deputy & Secretary,\nDept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ont.\n\nH.G./H.B.\nSir,\n\nI beg to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th ultimo and to inform you that there appears to be no objection to allowing the Rev. Mr. Dawson to use water as referred to in your letter. Your action is therefore approved.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nH. Graham Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Mr. Scott:\n\nAgent Graham has written to me to see if it is possible to obtain exemption for the St. George's Industrial School at Lytton from the payment of water rentals, the same as has recently been done in the case of Indian Reserves as this school is now a Government institution and it would assist greatly if the rentals were waived from these accounts. I have it that Agent Graham informs that he should deal with the Provincial authorities on this subject, but as the Lytton Industrial School is within the Railway Belt and the Provincial Government only administers water rights within the limits of it at the school, the Dominion Government is of the opinion that the exemption of rentals is a question to be dealt with by the Ottawa authorities by way of an Order-in-Council being passed granting such exemption, and such Order then being forwarded on to the Provincial Comptroller of Water Rights for his information and guidance.\n\nIf you think my views on this point are sound I would suggest that an Order-in-Council should be passed covering the situation and have it forwarded on to the Provincial authorities so as soon as it would, Agent Graham states, assist in keeping down the expenditure at this school.\n\nAs to the status of the land at this School I am not sure, but I may say if the title has passed from the New England Company to the Dominion Government it should be free from taxation by the Provincial Government.\n\nThe British Columbia Water Act makes no provision for exemption of water rentals on lands owned by the Dominion, but as the Dominion owns the water within the Railway Belt it appears to me that the Ottawa Government would be perfectly within its right in exempting this Institution from payment of water rentals even if the title to the land is not held by the Dominion Government.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nW.

I regret to inform you that your communication was inadvertently filed and put by without acknowledgment or action. The Superintendent of Indian Education drew this to my attention and I have communicated with the Department of the Interior. I am informed that the Department receives only a nominal rental for the use of Dominion Lands involved in water undertakings and that the Provincial Authorities receive the rental from the administration of the water rights in the railway belt. I have therefore to suggest that you or the authorities of the Lytton Indian Residential School make application for exemption from water rentals to Mr. E. A.

The consequence has been that Indian schools are not billed by the Water Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW. E.

This undertaking was for the purpose of supplying water for the Lytton Indian Reserve and the Indian Industrial School. $1000 was to be taken from the Capital Funds to the credit of the Band and $1000 from Indian Education. Certain Indians and white settlers were to give their labour free and the $2000 available was considered sufficient to complete the programme outlined by Mr. R.G. Swan, the District Chief Engineer of the Dominion Water Power Branch at Vancouver. The work was authorized in October, last, but the District Engineer for some reason or other was unable to undertake it at that time.\n\nThe raising of the Bootahnie dam is very necessary for the satisfactory conduct of the Lytton Industrial School, and, as the authority of Council has been secured, I wish to urge that the Departmental Engineer get in touch with the Dominion Water Power Branch without delay.\n\nSupt. of Indian Education.\nOttawa, September 4, 1934.\n\nH.

November 17, 1925.\n\nFile 165-0-9.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI beg to inform you that on the 22nd of September, during my absence, Mr. Balls, the Senior Assistant Engineer of the Dominion Water Board Branch, received a notification from the Board of Investigation under the British Columbia Water Act reading as hereunder:\n\n\"Conditional Licence No. 687, Botanie Creek, appurtenant to certain lands in the vicinity of Lot 47, G.I., Kamloops Division of Yale District, has been referred to the Board of Investigation, together with correspondence from your Department relating to an application for the extension of the time within which to complete works.\n\n\"It appears that the time for completion of these works expired on the 1st of November, 1920, and that no land had then been brought under irrigation. At the present time (some 5 years later) very much the same conditions prevail and the Board is of opinion that the licence has become null and void. Consequently, it is unable to grant or recommend the granting of the extension applied for.\n\n\"I enclose herewith a formal notice to the licensee to show cause why the licence should not be cancelled for non-use.\n\nUpon my return to the City I immediately wrote to Mr. Indian Agent Graham in an endeavour to ascertain the status of this land, as it was part of the holdings of the New England Company, and in his reply he stated that he thought that while you were in England you intended to take up with the New England Company the matter of purchase of all its land holdings.\n\nOn receipt of this information I wrote to the Board of Investigation asking them to withhold the cancellation of the Licence until I could learn from you on your return to Ottawa, whether the land which the Licence is appurtenant to was now controlled by our Department, and the Board consequently have agreed to take no further action until I can give it definite information in the matter of ownership.\n\nThis Licence, I may say, is an important one, as the water was intended to be used as far as it would go on the land described in the Licence and the remainder from the storage system from Bootanie Lake recently completed which was for the irrigation of both Lot 47 and the lands described.\n\nDr. Duncan C.

Before this can be done, however, it is necessary to do a considerable amount of clearing which Mr. Lett has informed me has been commenced already, but it is essential in any event that if the Licence is to be retained the land should be put under cultivation at an early date.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nW.E.

Deputy and Secretary.\n\nThe Controller\nof Water Rights,\nDepartment of lands,\nVictoria, B.C.,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School\n\nSupported by the New England Company\n(The oldest English Missionary Society, founded 1648)\n\nMr. D. C. Scott\nDept. Sup Gen.\nDept. of Indian Affairs\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Scott,\n\nRe: The Water Rights on Lot Forty Seven & adjoining acreage.\n\nIf the Water Rights branch insist on the use of the storage water in the lake, it will necessitate the expenditure of approximately $1000.00. There is no need whatever in the Dept. having to spend any amount. If the Water Rights Branch can be made to see that for the present, this water can be very profitably used for a second watering on Lot 47, with an extension of the water rights, now expiring each year on July the 15th. There is an opportunity in this second watering for immediate revenue which I need, which will, if properly handled, relieve the Dept. of perhaps extra expenditure on the School.\n\nI have already started the men to cut some fence posts to fence Lot 47 together with about 50 acres adjoining. This latter acreage has essentially been brought in under cultivation & it is my intention to do this gradually, beginning with from four to eight acres of potatoes next spring.\n\nTo purchase the wire for this needed fencing I thought of asking the Dept. for the expenditure of $500.00 to be taken from the New England Grant for next quarter, thinking this would be the most plausible way to overcome the necessity both for myself & the Dept.\n\nI have written Mr. Molan concerning the water & trust that he will be able, together with Commissioner Ditchburn, to arrange for the use of part of the storage water on Lot 47 in order to get a second crop, which would increase our output of hay on this Lot by about 100 tons giving us immediate revenue.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\n[Signature]\nPRINCIPAL\nDear Sir,\n\nRe: Letter No.165-0-9 of Nov.24th, concerning water rights for Lot 47 & adjoining acreage. I have had some correspondence on the matter with Commissioner Ditchburn & have also written Inspector Pragnell, asking him to take the question up with the representatives of the Water Board in Kamloops.\n\nThe Conditional License No. 880 which Commissioner Ditchburn has been successful in having renewed, calls for rights on the acreage adjoining Lot 47, about fifty acres, of which has been slashed, ten acres ready for cultivation except for a small percentage of stumping which I hope to get cleaned up during the coming winter months. The remaining forty acres will take some time & work to be brought into cultivation.\n\nWhen asking for the raising of the Dam at Botanic Lake I had not thought so much of the land adjoining Lot 47 as I did about Lot 47 itself. Our present Water rights on Lot 47 expire, or run out, each year, on the fifteenth of June, with a mutual agreement extending these rights to July the 15th., giving one crop only, while a much greater benefit would be derived if the storage water could be used on Lot Forty seven to get a second crop.\n\nI would suggest that if it is at all possible arrangements should be made so that enough of this storage water should be used for a second watering on Lot 47. In fact this is the only way in can be used to derive the greatest benefit & financial help to the school.\n\nThere is storage room for 300 acre ft. of water which would easily irrigate 75 acres of land & it would be unreasonable, to say the least, if the water board would now insist upon the clearing of the above No. of acres when the land already cleared with the rights extended to cover the whole irrigating season, that is, that I be allowed to use sufficient of the storage water to irrigate Lot 47 from the 15th. of July until Sept 30th., would probably give me beginning next summer an additional 100 tons of hay to dispose of at the rate of perhaps $20.00 per ton.\n\nI trust this will explain the matter & that you will if possible take the necessary steps to XXX enable me to get the greatest possible benefit out of the use of this water.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\n[Signature]\n\nPRINCIPAL\nOttawa, 9th February 1926\n\nSir,\n\nYour file No. 23-12-7\n\nOn December 4th last, in accordance with request contained in your letter of the 28th November, the Department forwarded to you final Water Licence No. 4815 for amendment.

It will be necessary, also, to forward receipted accounts, covering the payment for all materials supplied. The account which you forwarded covered only the cost of nails used. An account for the cost of the oakum supplied is required.\n\nI am returning herewith the account which you submitted, in order that you can attach the receipts, as requested, and return the account, when payment will be made.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Unfortunately during that time there was an epidemic of influenza and several cases of pneumonia at the school. One of the Smoker girls, Lillian, whose father was summoned, being in an undernourished condition, contracted pneumonia and died. The hue and cry raised caused me to cease recruiting until the termination of this epidemic, as the Indians claimed that their children were being taken to the school, only to die.\n\nIt so happened that during the time of Inspector Barry's visit this epidemic had about run its course at the school, although there were still a number of influenza cases from the school still in hospital, besides one scarlet fever case from the local rancherie. Shortly after the Inspector's visit an epidemic of measles broke out, starting at the Foster Bar School twenty-two miles up the Lytton-Lillooet Road, and several of the Indian children of that vicinity, two of whom attended that school, were afflicted. Subsequently it reached St. George's Indian Residential School when a large number of the children, together with several of the school staff came down with it, and are still on the sick list.\n\nAfter the death of Lillian Smoker, Dr. Ellis advised that no more children be brought into the school until the influenza epidemic had ceased, but now the school is under full quarantine owing to measles, and has been from the first week in December, when the trouble first broke out at the Foster Bar School.\n\nOn the receipt of the above mentioned letter from the Department, I again approached the doctor regarding the recruiting of the few children in this Agency still out of school, but he would not hear of any being brought in owing to the serious consequences that might result therefrom.\n\nDr. Ellis this morning reported two cases of chickenpox on the local rancherie at Lytton.\n\nIn conclusion I may advise the Department that no effort\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nThe Secretary continued........2.\n\nthat no effort\nhas been spared on my part to bring the school to capacity and\nyou can depend upon the resumption of these efforts when the school\nis in a position whereby children can be received.\n\nTrusting that this information is satisfactory to the\nDepartment,\n\nI have the honor to be,\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

It is noted that, owing to an epidemic of influenza and measles, you have deferred action in having any children who are in good health and of school age placed in the above named school.\n\nI would request that, as soon as the medical officer of the school is satisfied that the pupils now in the school are free from any contagious disease, you will make an effort to have the children whose names you mention at the bottom of your letter placed in the school. Applications and certificates of health should be forwarded for any children whom you succeed in having placed in the school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

The Rev. A. R. Lett was with me during my visit to this school. He saw at least two of the children I mean. With an untrained teacher here I do not believe that we should try to keep pupils above Grade 4 in the Shulus Indian Day School at present. It will be all that Mr. Westaway can do to teach Grades 1 to 4 properly.\nOttawa, March 10, 1936.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nIn connection with his inspection of the Shulus Indian Day School on the 25th ultimo, Inspector Barry writes:\n\n\"There are about three or four of the children here whom I should like to see at St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton.

The Department agrees with Inspector Barry that it would be in the best interests of all parties concerned. Provided there is accommodation for them in the St. George's School, and the children are in good health, the Department is prepared to approve their admission.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ. D.

It would not have been easy to get any children in to the school whilst the cold weather was on, but I may be able to do this at the end of the March quarter, although I think probably it would be better now to leave them out until September.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\n(A.

As soon as the quarantine is lifted, the Department considers that you should take immediate steps to place in the school the children mentioned in your letter of January 10th.

C.,\nJune 29, 1936.\n\nSir:\n\nI herewith beg to enclose the following:\n\nForm No. 403\u2014Indian Residential School Quarterly Return, quarter ending June 30, 1936.\n99\u2014Admission & Discharge,\n99\u2014Requisition for School Material.\n\nTrusting that these will be found in order,\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\n[Signature]\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nAB/MD\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nSupt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland:\n\nAnswering you letter #165-0-10, dated June 16th.\n\nPupil No. 0135 Eileen Thom:\nThis girl, if she passes her grade VIII, would like to take grade IX and continue her music. She comes from Lytton and has an opportunity of assisting in the Church and community.\n\nPupil No. 0155 Mary Dick:\nThis girl's mother is dead and her father has married again. Because of this she feels the need of school protection and I think she should have such care for at least another year. She is not a bright youngster but is conscientious and wants to be of some use to her people.\n\nPupil No. 0119 Mabel Sami:\nThis girl has become extremely interested in her music and also wishes to take grade VIII work. Her farther is a white man, her step-father an Indian. Since she wishes to return I feel she is sincere and that the extra year would benefit her greatly.\n\nPupil No. 0147 Rosie Jones:\nRosie wishes to continue for the next year. While she is in her eighteenth year, or just gone seventeen, yet I feel it would be to her advantage to return.\n\nPupil No. 165 Minnie Albert:\nThis girl, while she has expressed her desire to return, would benefit by another year at school but as yet I do not think her parents will allow her to continue. The family has always given trouble but lately her parents have shown more friendliness. I have therefore asked for her return in order to give her an opportunity with her parents to make a choice for themselves.\n\nPupil No. 114 Nellie Bent:\nThis girl is in her last year of high school and\nWishes to try her Junior matric. Last Wednesday she took a final in one Subject (Chemistry II) in which she evidently did very well. Her tests so far have averaged 72%.\n\nPupil No. 149 Gladys Shute:\nThis girl has just gone sixteen and should not go out now since she is anxious to continue. Her parents are agreeable.\n\nI have been able during this last school year to have a definite course in music given and all of these girls are anxious to continue this training. While some have done extremely well, yet lessons for eight months are insufficient to benefit greatly. With another year the older girls would be fitted to at least take care of mission church services. I have, in this training, had in mind the mission work as well as the social uplift tendency which music instills. I have picked pupils from widely separated districts so that they could be of assistance, especially in Church life.\n\nThe Department has also to remember that the school is not only an institution of Academic and technical training, there is a great deal of work entailed in cleaning, cooking and washing which smaller girls cannot readily do, therefore we need these older girls to assist in the general work and which helps to keep down expenses.\n\nPupil No. 239 Tommie Hall has just gone sixteen and since he wishes to return it would be wise to allow this. Pupil #295 Jimmie Dick has also just gone sixteen. He wishes to return for another year's training. This pupil is a brother of Mary Dick, the family situation also applying to him.\n\nI trust you will see fit to allow the return of these pupils, especially as the girls would benefit greatly with their music.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. Dett,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, August 15, 1936.\n\nRev. Sir:\n\nI regret that your letter of June 22nd was mislaid.\n\nThe Department approves the following children remaining in the St. George's Indian Residential School for another year:\n\nNo. 0114 - Nellie Bent\n# 0119 - Mabel Sam\n# 0135 - Eileen Thom\n# 0147 - Rosie Jones\n# 0149 - Gladys Shuta\n# 0155 - Mary Dick\n# 0165 - Minnie Albert\n# 239 - Tommie Mali\n# 295 - Jimmie Dick.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nFor Supt. of Indian Education.\n\nRev.

Barber)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nMr. J. D. Sutherland,\nActing Supt. of Indian Education,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Sutherland;\n\nI understand, from Indian Agent Barber, that there is some objection from the Roman Catholic Church regarding six of the children lately sent into this school. In connection with which I might say that the work was entirely done through our Missioner at Shulus and in so far as the school is concerned we had nothing to do with bringing in these children. It is true I visited the parents with the Missioner, but visited them as Anglicans.\n\nIt is very evident, from the point of view of baptism, that three of these children are definitely Anglicans, the other three, being baptized by the Roman Catholic Church, have been, from their early age, recognised and taught in the Anglican faith and received in the Anglican Church; therefore all are definitely Anglicans. The parents are definite in their wishes that their children remain in St. George's and the children, themselves, are extremely happy and have very strongly expressed themselves as not wishing to return home or to be sent to another school.\n\nI do not wish to appear a busy-body but wished to point out to you the situation and feel keenly that the children are in their right place and do not wish to lose them. It is also a case of exercising our own rights.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nOttawa, October 14, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of the September quarter return of the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nYou may inform the Principal that the discharge of the following pupils is approved:\n\nNo. 277 - Wilfred Wells          No. 0165 - M.

You should, also, let me have full information regarding the children and state on what grounds the Roman Catholic Church authorities have objected to the admission of the children to the St. George's School. You should, also, state if these children have already been sent to the St. George's School. If not, they should remain at home until it is finally decided under what religious auspices they should be educated.\n\nIf there is any doubt regarding the religion of an applicant for admission to a residential school, Indian Agents are expected to supply full particulars to the Department for our consideration and, in the meantime, such children should remain at home.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJ.

I will, however, trust that the Department will advise on this application at an early date, in order that I may advise the Church authorities.\n\nI expect that due to the overzealousness of the new missioner, we will have more complaints of this nature in the future, as if one side trespasses, the other side is sure to retaliate.\n\nI trust that this explains the matter fully, and that the Department will advise accordingly.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n(Alfred H.

Band.\n\nTillie Swakum Coldwater Band.\nMary August\nHazel August\nGeorge August\nMathew McKay\nJohn Hubert McKay\nHoward Coulter Shulus (Lower Nicola)\nElizabeth Bostan Quilchena Creek (Lower Nicola)\n\nA few days later the Roman Catholic Missioner called at this office and complained that all the above children were Catholic children (except Elizabeth Bostan, whose name was not mentioned.) and that they should go to the Kamloops School. He also produced statements of the parents: Charlie August, Mrs. Charlie Swakum, Jimmy Major and Major H. McKay, to the effect that they desired their children brought up in the Roman Catholic Religion and taken to the Kamloops school. The Roman Catholic Missioner requested me to have the children returned from St. George's School and sent to Kamloops, immediately.\n\nIn view of the above I advised both the Anglican Missioner and the Roman Catholic Missioner to submit copies of the baptism records of these children, and that I would myself interview the parents in the matter.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nThis I have now in several instances done, and obtained a further certificate of their desires in the matter.\n\nI also have in several instances received copies of baptismal records, all of which I am forwarding to the Department herewith for their consideration.\n\nI would advise that this trouble appears to have arisen through the Anglican Missionary recruiting pupils for St. George's School, on the Coldwater Reserve, which is looked upon as being totally Roman Catholic, though apparently, as will be seen by the records submitted herewith, there are some families of the Anglican faith who moved there years ago, and whose children are baptised in the Anglican faith.\n\nI respectfully submit herewith the applications for admittance to St. George's School as follows:\n\nTillie Swakum\nMary August,\nGeorge August\nHazel August\n\nAttached to these applications please note Certificates obtained by the Anglican Missioner, the Catholic Missioner, and myself. Also baptism records of Hazel and Mary August.\n\nApplications of: Elizabeth Boston\nHoward Coutlee\n\nApplications of: John Hubert McKay\nMathew McKay\n\nAttached to these applications will be found certificates of the parents taken by both missioners and myself, as in above cases.\n\nIn this instance the desire was expressed to me by Jimmy Major, father of John Hubert, that he wanted his boy to go to the Kamloops School, with the other children of the Coldwater Reserve.\n\nThe Secretary,\nDepartment of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nJimmy Major also informed me that his father, the Guardian of Mathew desires the boy to go with John to Kamloops. I, however, have not yet been able to interview Old Major personally.

If you are satisfied that this information is correct, you may authorize their admission to the St. George's Residential School.\n\nThe Department has carefully reviewed the correspondence submitted with regard to the applications for the admission of Howard Coulth, Mary August, George August, Hazel August and Tillie Swakum. In each of these cases, there is definite information to show that the father is recognized as a Roman Catholic. In view of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act, the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of these children to the St. George's Indian Residential School and, if they are at present in the school, you should at once notify the Principal to return these children to their parents. Please let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nAs pointed out in the first part of this letter, when you are doubtful regarding the religious auspices under which a child should be educated, you should make full inquiries, with a view to ascertaining the religion of the father. This information should then be forwarded to the Department and we will decide in what school the child should be placed.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nActing Secretary.\n\nA. H.

Pierro has not yet been returned, being required at home to help get in potatoes. I will not return him until I have been advised by the Department if these children should be transferred from St. George's School to the Kamloops Residential School, as requested by the father.\n\nAn early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Alfred H.

He stated so and had asked that his children go to the Lytton School.\n\nHowever, I find he was married by the Roman Catholic Church in 1925, and he was attended by the Roman Catholic priest before his death, though two brothers and a sister now living are Anglicans. Another brother, Joseph George, is a Roman Catholic, and his children are at Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nI forwarded to the Department on the 27th instant, a further request of Eneas, asking that his children be sent to the Kamloops School.\n\nI would point out that in this Agency there are many Indians who are claimed by both Churches, though it is apparently no worry to the Indian. In these cases I am not in a position to say to which Church they belong, but, must take the word of the Indian concerned.\n\nThe two children of Eneas George concerned at this time are Pierro, who has not yet been returned to St. George's School, and Ada, who is at the School at the present.\n\nThe mother and grandparents of the children are at the office every few days to find out if the children are going to the Kamloops School.\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 9)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, December 9, 1936.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 30th ultimo, with further reference to the children of the late Enos George.\n\nIt now appears that his children should be recognized as Roman Catholics and, consequently, Pierre may be placed in the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nThe Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School is being written regarding Ada George and you should communicate with him and arrange for her transfer to Kamloops.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA.

In each of these cases, there is definite information to show that the father is recognized as a Roman Catholic. In view of Section 10 (1) of the Indian Act, the Department is not prepared to approve the admission of these children to the St. George's Indian Residential School and, if they are at present in the school, you should at once notify the Principal to return these children to their parents. Please let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\"\n\nIf the five children mentioned above have not been returned to their parents by the time this letter reaches you, the Department will expect you to carry out the instructions contained in Mr. Barber's letter at once. He is also being written in regard to this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nT. R. L. MacInnes,\nSecretary.\nOttawa, January 5, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to refer you to official letter of November 19th, last, with reference to applications for the admission of certain children to the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn the fifth paragraph of that letter you were definitely instructed to arrange with the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School to return the five children whose names were mentioned to their parents.\n\nThe December quarter return of the St. George's School has just been received and grant is requested for each of the five children for 92 days. Apparently they were not discharged from the school by December 31st.\n\nMr. Lett is being written today and informed of the contents of our letter to you of November 19th, and is being instructed to have these children returned to their parents at once. As soon as they are returned to their parents, you should advise the Department.\n\nIf Mr. Lett does not comply with our instructions within the next two weeks, we should be so advised.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

R. L. McInnis,\nSec. Dept. of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. McInnis:\n\nI have your letter No. 165-0-10, dated January 5th, regarding the children who were requested to be returned to their homes because of their Roman Catholic Status.\n\nMr. Indian Agent Barber, of Merritt, agreed in conference with the Anglican Missioner at Shulus that these children should remain in school until the 18th of December, which brought them to the close of the classroom term. By this time Hazel August had fallen ill, and wishing to save myself a double trip held the children until the 31st of December when I returned to their homes Mary and George August and Tillie Swakum, Hazel having not sufficiently recovered for me to take her along. This girl is now back in classroom but the school is in quarantine for measles and the Doctor has forbidden any children out; therefore, it is impossible for Hazel to go home until such time as the Doctor allows.\n\nWith regard to Howard Coutle, he was in the hospital and his parents have taken him home, wishing that they should be able to take care of him.\n\nThe above is the situation in regard to these children and the school, which I trust will meet with the approval of the Department.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\nA. R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nLytton B.C. Jan.2nd/37\n\nMr. A.Barber,\nIndian Agent\nMerritt.\n\nDear Mr. Barber-\n\nOn Thursday I took Mary and George August and Tillie Swakum home. Hazel August is still convalescing after a touch of influenza. Howard Coutlee is in the hospital at Lytton and is I am afraid very sick. I have acquainted his parents with this fact. Dr. Ellis has asked me to take his name off our lists stating that he is a T.B. case.\n\nAda George I thought of taking along but, refrained from doing so lest you should not be prepared to take her on to Kamloops.\n\nMay I wish you and the family every happiness and prosperity for the New Year.\n\nSincerely\n\nA.R.Lett.......\n\nPrincipal.\n\nCOPY.\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL.\n\nLytton B.C.\nJan. 2nd/37\n\nMr. A. Barber\nIndian Agent\nMerritt, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber:\n\nI have your letter regarding Ada George. She will be ready for you at your convenience and anytime now that you are able to come along she can go out. We are very sorry to lose her and it seems a bit unfair after having taken her on for so long.\n\nI had hoped, today, to have taken the August children, Tillie Swakum and Howard Coutle home but Howard is sick and will not be able to travel for some time. Hazel is also in bed but is not very ill; just as soon as she is ready I shall bring these children up.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA.R. Lett,\nPrincipal.\n\n(Notation in longhand)\nHoward Coutlee is very ill in the hospital and has been taken off the register by order of the Dr. His parents saw him Sat. morning here. I have written Fr. Silva-White regarding his condition. A.R. Lett.\n\nC O P\n:::Y:::::\nSir:\n\nIn reply to Departmental letter No.165-0-10, of the 5th instant, which is hereby acknowledged, I respectfully advise that Mary and George August, and Tillie Swakum, were not returned to their parents by Mr. Lett, Principal of St. George's Residential School, until the last December, whereas it was agreed that they, along with Howard Coutlee and Hazel August, would be returned home on December 15th. However, Howard Coutlee and Hazel were sick, and therefore some delay was caused. I believe, by waiting for these two to recover enough to travel. Howard Coutlee was returned home on the 8th instant, but Hazel August is still at the School.\n\nOn the 12th instant I visited the School to effect the transfer of Ada George to the Kamloops Residential School, also to bring Hazel August home to her parents, but found the School quarantined for measles (only two cases) and therefore could not remove the children. I had not been notified of this outbreak by Mr. Lett, who, however, is to advise me as soon as the quarantine is lifted, when I will immediately transfer Ada George to Kamloops School, and bring Hazel August home to her parents.\n\nI attach hereto copies of two letters received from Mr. Lett, which explain the situation.\n\nI will advise the Department as soon as these transfers have been made. I might advise that the extreme cold weather of the past ten days has prevented me from bringing the children from the School.\n\nYours obediently,\n\nAHB/ES\n\n(Alfred H.

Barber,\nNicola Agency\nKERRITT, B.C.\n\nDear Mr. Barber,\n\nRegarding the children of your Agency whose admittance to St. George's School was protested by the Roman Catholic Church authorities, namely, Howard Coutlie, Mary August, George August, Hazel August and Tillie Swakum. I wish to advise that all of these children have been returned to their homes as per your instructions, except for Hazel August. This last named child will be returned immediately the quarantine on the School has been lifted.\n\nYour letter of November 26th quoted to Department's instructions as follows:\n\n\"... In each of these cases there is definite information to show that the father is recognised as a Roman Catholic. In view of Section 10 (2) of the Indian Act, the department is not prepared to approve the admission of these children to the St. George's School...\"\n\nI wish to state that, in regard to the above, that the Department's decision is, I feel, quite fair and just, and I have so informed the parents concerned, except in the case of Tillie Swakum. At the mother's own request I now ask you to reconsider her case. According to the Department's own judgement (as quoted above) this child should be eligible for admission to the St. George's School, and I submit the following information in proof that Charles Swakum was an Anglican.\n\nThe full facts are as follows:\n\n(A) Charles, the father of Tillie Swakum, was an Anglican during his whole lifetime, and until his death in December 1935. I visited him regularly in my priestly capacity. Knowing this, the surviving relatives brought his body to me for burial.\n\n(B) Charles Swakum in September 1935, asked me to send his daughter, Tillie, to St. George's School to be brought up as an Anglican like himself. As the child was then under age, my reply was that he must wait until the following year, when I would make the necessary arrangements.\n(C) Charles Swakum died on December 22, 1936, and his body was subsequently brought to me for burial.\n\n(D) In August, 1936, according to the deceased father's wish, the child Tillie was sent to St. George's School, by the surviving parent.\n\nAttached hereto are three extracts from the Shulus Mission's records which practically give a complete history of Charles Swakum's religious life, proving him to be a recognised adherent of the Anglican Church.\n\nYour early reply will be appreciated.\n\nYours truly,\n\n(Rev.) Cyril Silva-White\n\nMissionary at Shulus.\nSir:\n\nI respectfully forward herewith for the consideration of the Department, a letter received from Rev. Silva-White, Missioner at Shulus Indian Reserve, which is self-explanatory.\n\nIn regard to Tillie Swakum I would recommend that she be admitted to St. George's Residential School, in view of the Anglican Church records, copy of which is attached, and the fact that the mother of the girl is anxious that she be allowed to attend the St. George's School.\n\nThe complications in regard to this girl arose through the father, who apparently was an Anglican, going to live on the Coldwater Reserve, where he resided for 15 years prior to his death, and there being looked upon as a Roman Catholic in common with the whole of the Coldwater Band.\n\nAHE/ES\n\nYours obediently,\n\n[Signature]\n(Alfred H. Barber)\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Ontario.\nOttawa, February 19, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nThe Department is in receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, enclosing letter received from Rev. C. Silva-White, with reference to Tillie Swakum.\n\nWhen you forwarded an application for this girl under cover of your letter of October 20th, last, there was enclosed one statement from the mother requesting her admission to the St. George's Indian Residential School and a second statement requesting her admission to the Kamloops Indian Residential School.\n\nIt is felt that it would be advisable for you to interview the mother, Mrs. Charles Swakum, and ascertain from her the religion to which she belongs. It would appear from Rev. Silva-White's letter that the woman is a member of the Church of England but, in order that we can be absolutely certain, the Department believes that you should personally interview Mrs. Charles Swakum.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

But there is no doubt that Charlie Swakum, the father of this girl, now deceased, was of the Anglican faith.\n\nI attach hereto a statement signed by Mrs. Swakum, and would state that she requested me to send her daughter Tillie to the Kamloops School after the summer holidays.\n\nAHB/ES\n\nYours obediently,\n\n(Alfred H.

Under these circumstances, her daughter is eligible for admission to the Kamloops Indian Residential School and you may forward an application form before the school re-opens after the summer holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nT.

Ibelan,\nChief of Training Dept.,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nDear Mr. Ibelan:\n\nI have just finished my quarterly reports and you will notice that Hazel August and Ada George, both of whom appear on the discharge sheet at the end of the December quarter, and who during this quarter were unable to be moved as expected, Hazel to her home and Ada to the school at Kamloops. I trust that the Department will see fit to allow their names to stay as per capita earning pupils for this quarter.\n\nIndian Agent Barber came yesterday for Ada and expected to take her right through to Kamloops. Hazel is still in bed and is not in a condition to be removed.\n\nA great number of our children are still hanging fire with temperatures and cardiac. Dr. Ellis is removing a number to their homes, which fact is going to make it rather difficult for the school financially during the next two quarters.\n\nYou will find, by our discharge sheets, that we have lost six children, four of whom passed away directly due to the epidemic and we still have two girls who are not expected to return to health again, which will make eight losses in all since the first of January. You can readily see that we have had a very trying spell which the school will feel for years.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nA. R.

Eddie Major\n390 - Sack\n391 Willie\n\nApprove Disc.\nDear Sir,\n\nIn accordance with Circular Letter No 150-37 of March 30th last, I have submitted to the Merritt and Lytton Agencies lists of the names of those children who at the Doctors request, have now been transferred to their respective homes on the reserves for rest and recuperation after the late severe epidemic.\n\nI would be very grateful if you would remind the Agent at Lytton of the necessity of his close attention to the health of these children in their homes, mentioning also that he might materially help in having those children who are allowed home until June returned promptly. I have taken the matter up with the parents and they have promised their co-operation.\n\nI note with satisfaction the Departments decision regarding the extension of the Summer Vacation. This will obviate more than one difficulty experienced in respect to the short six week vacation period.\n\nI have of necessity, from a business point of view, to think in terms of Per Capita Earnings and may I ask if I shall be allowed earnings for the full roll strength of the School for the vacation months. Will those children, for example, whom the Doctor has sent home indefinitely, and whose return is expected after the vacation, and who now become non-earners, become earners at the last of July and continue to be so for the months of July and August? I would be glad of your advice regarding this. My earning capacity, as you can see, is terribly reduced and while I need all the pupilage can earn yet I do not wish to tread where I ought not to.\n\nI have been obliged to reduce my staff and am not myself a good typist which I hope you will overlook.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal\nApril 22 /37\n\nMr. A.

You will note that some are allowed home until June others indefinitely. Dr. Ellis states that these latter will in the main, he feels, be able to return after the vacation beginning July the 1st.\n\nYours very sincerely\n\nPrincipal\nJoseph Dunstan Lytton Indefinitely\nTommie Jones Chomox \"\nJohn Molby Lytton \"\nDavid Hance Lytton \"\nEarl Adams Lytton 16 mile \"\nMary Mack Lytton 14 mile \"\nMary Ann Frank Lytton 16 mile \"\nDoris McKay Keefers (Lytton) \"\n\nDr. Ellis states that most if not all of the above named children should be physically fit to return after summer vacation.\n\nAlbert Antoine Boston Bar Until June\nOscar Phillip Lytton \"\nRalph Williams Sedell \"\nRosie Adams Lytton \"\nEvlyn Phillip Boothroyd \"\nClara Nali Lytton (at Toketio) \"\n\nLytton Agency\nApril 22, 1937\n\nMr. A.H.

Dr. Gillis should periodically see them and especially does this apply to Leonard Faddy.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nPrincipal\nLillian Toodlican to the Hospital at Merritt\nLeonard Paddy To his home at Shulus Reserve\nWillie Major To his home at Cold Water Reserve\n\nMerritt Agency--\nOttawa, April 30, 1937.\n\nDear Sir,-\n\nThe Department is in receipt of a copy of letter written to you on the 22nd instant by the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, regarding certain children from your agency who have been sent home for rest and recuperation.\n\nIt appears that Dr. Ellis considers that six of these children should be returned to the school in June and the Department will depend on you to see that they are sent back at that time.\n\nEight children from your agency have been allowed indefinite leave owing to illness. You should keep in touch with the homes of these eight pupils and, as soon as the condition of their health permits, you should arrange to have them returned to the St. George's School. If they are not able to return to the school before June 30th, you should make certain that they are returned as soon as the school reopens after the summer holidays if their health has improved.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.

Please have Dr. Gillies see these children regularly and, if their health improves, you should arrange to have them returned to the St. George's School when it reopens after the summer holidays.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

They are, also, being instructed to keep in touch with the parents of the pupils mentioned in your letter in order that the children may be returned to the St. George's School as soon as the condition of their health permits.\n\nWith reference to the last paragraph of your letter, the usual practice has been to allow the holiday grant only in the case of those pupils who are resident in the school on June 30th.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Strang\nIndian Agent\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nAS/JC\nOttawa, October 26, 1937.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of October 18th, you may inform the Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School that the admission of the following pupils is approved:\n\nWesley Williams\nNathan Spinks\n\nYours truly,\n\nR. A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nA. Strang, Esq.,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B. C.\nDear Parents and Friends:\n\nI am a little behind in my first letter to you, but it will have more school news for you, I hope.\n\nFirst of all, may I thank those from whom I have had letters of good wishes, and God's blessing for this school year. I wish I could really make you feel as I do when I receive a letter from parents of our children, extending well wishes and blessings. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Those letters received from parents living in that big reserve of Shuswap are very much appreciated, and especially so since so many of our children come from the Lower Nicola Valley.\n\nThe parents have not all kept their promise in having their children in on time. I had hoped that with the long holiday this year, equal to the white schools, you would be very punctual, but we had many stragglers, and even yet a number have not returned. This fact does not help out your boys or girls, nor the other children in the Grades to which the missing ones belong. It is very upsetting to the school's advance of your children. I am sure you wish the very best for your children, and one way, perhaps the greatest way, you can carry out that wish, is to see that your children return punctually and attend regularly. I am glad to say that this applies only to a few, but please let me try and impress upon that few, the retarding effect you exercise on the school on the whole. Nobody cares so much about the welfare of your children as you do yourself\u2014and you owe your child a chance to prepare himself or herself, for after-school-age life.\n\nThere are a number of Indians who are still holding their children away from school. In cases, these children are reaching the ages of ten, eleven and twelve years. In holding back your children this way you are doing very unfair to them. The greatest gift you can give your child is education. The Department makes this very easy for you because it takes full responsibility for educational expenses, making education free to you, and surely it is your duty to avail yourself of this for your children's sake. The school needs your children in order that it might do its best for all. Please send them in, and we shall do the best we can for them.\n\nAgain we have had a medical survey of the school, and we are very happy to be able to report to you that your children have passed a really good test. There are no children suffering from Tuberculosis. The Doctor has asked permission to have diseased tonsils removed. Many of the children have tonsils which are impairing their health, and we need your consent to have this needful operation performed. Please write me, giving your permission, and I shall be able to allow the Doctor to perform such operations when convenient to him and the hospital. Your attention in this is important.\nAt the present time, because there is an outbreak of infantile paralysis in B.C., we are isolated. Will you be good enough to remember, that for the present you cannot visit the school. We are all in the best of health, and we are thankful to Almighty God for this blessing.\n\nWe held our largest Thanksgiving service on the 20th Sunday after Trinity, and the hospital at Lytton benefited by receipt of the chapel decorations of flowers, vegetables, and fruit, for which the Matron has expressed her grateful thanks. We hereby wish to thank the missionary at Shulus for his helpful Thanksgiving address.\n\nThe School has helped in filling the relief car, loaded at Lytton and sent to the drought-stricken areas in the Indians. The congregation has also forwarded $25.00 in cash. We are thankful that the year has brought us good crops so that we are able to help those in need.\n\nMrs. M. Frest, who came to us last Autumn for the first time, is with us again this year. She is widening her course of handcraft in wool, to rug-weaving. She is also teaching bead-work.\n\nHandicraft and Manual Arts are being extended into leather work. Our music teacher, who takes vocal as well as piano, is also able to give leather work instruction. This will be done with the regular buckskin tanned leather, and will be developed to cater to tourist sales.\n\nAt this time of the year many of you will go to the mountains to hunt deer and goat. Don't kill for killing's sake. God gives us the game for our use, and you should be careful in the first place to conserve, by taking only what you need, and waste none by leaving it to decay\u2014bring it out for winter food.\n\nMay God bless you all, and remember always, that you must fit yourself to receive the best from your Heavenly Father by obeying His Commandments, by being sober, honest and peaceful in your homes, and amongst your friends. We ask you to remember us always, in your daily worship and in your church services.\n\nYour sincere friend,\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 9)\nMr. Philip Phelan;\nChief of Training,\nDept. of Ind. Affairs,\nOttawa.\n\nDear Mr. Phelan\u2014\n\nAnswering yours re the Certificates of Admission dated Oct. 12th and numbering 165-0-10. Referring to Pupil No. 389 Eddie Major please note that my letter Dated May 7th answering yours No. 105-0-10 will cover this boy's admission.\n\nRegarding the new entries I have a letter from Indian Agent Barber stating that 395 Ronald Bent, 396 Stanley Joe, 397 Clarence Angus have been accepted by the Department.\n\nPupils No. 392 Nathan Spinks and No. 393 Wesley Williams belong to the Lytton Agency and I have no doubt that Mr. Strang will forward these when he gets around to it.\n\nNo. 273 Edna Frank I had some difficulty in getting this signed and it should be in your hands shortly.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of my circular letter to the Indians and you will notice I have drawn their attention to the fact that a number of their children have not yet returned. The Agencies to which they belong can be ascertained by reference to the Quarterly Reports.\n\nI have also asked those Indians who are holding their children back to send them in. I do feel that I should not every year be burdened with children older than entrance age. Please refer to my quarterly reports of Sept. 1936 and you will find that last year we had the same factor to contend with.\n\nThe school needs children in order to carry itself financially. An average of 140 is not good enough especially when this could readily be increased to 160 by having those children who are on the rolls and who are within the limited age returned and those eligible for entrance brought in. The School organization is designed to carry up to 180 but if our numbers are not increased I shall be obliged to curtail which fact will not be beneficial to the success of the School on the whole.\n\nThe above facts have been carefully and constantly kept before the Agencies concerned and if the children are allowed to remain out or ignore completely the Act I can only say that I shall not be able to carry on as I ought to be able.\n\nMy per Capita earnings for last quarter has not yet come to hand and my Bank Acc. is overdrawn.\n\nYours very obediently\n\nPrincipal.\n| Pupil No. | Name               | Agency          |\n|----------|--------------------|-----------------|\n| 319      | Jimmie Charlie     | Lytton Agency   |\n| 287      | Cecil Sampson      |                 |\n| 310      | Johnny Green Raphael |                |\n| 346      | Leonard Joe        | Nicola Agency   |\n| 362      | Albert Antoine     | Lytton          |\n| 370      | Joseph Dunstan     |                 |\n| 340      | Willard Angus      | Nicola          |\n| 376      | Matthew McKay Major|                 |\n| 389      | Eddie Major        |                 |\n| 377      | Alex Swakum        |                 |\n| 390      | Jack Major         |                 |\n| 398      | William Major      |                 |\n| 0202     | Zela Hall          | Lytton          |\n| 0206     | Gladys Albert      | Nicola          |\n| 0215     | Rosie Williams     | Lytton          |\n| 0234     | Elizabeth Bent     | Okanagan        |\n| 0239     | Mary Frank         | Nicola          |\n| 0243     | Florabelle Raphael | Lytton          |\n| 0250     | Ray Dunstan        |                 |\n\n*Living with Louis Phillips - 10-mile.*\nDecember 31st, 1937.\n\nMr. A.

It is necessary for me to reconstruct my attendance roll and some definite information in regard to these children would be appreciated.\n\nThere are a number of children, of course, from the Nicola Agency and one appearing who has come from the Okanagan Agency, but as the School is situated in the Lytton Agency, all reports should come through the Agency Office.\n\nI would appreciate your getting into touch with the Medical Officer and having definite reports made so that I shall be able to make full statements regarding these children, and also that my lists may be reconstructed.\n\nYours very sincerely,\n\nPrincipal.\nMr. R.A.

P. Ellis, B.A., M.D.\nLytton, B.C.\n\nJanuary 18th 1936\n\nMr. A. Strong,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Sir,\n\nWith reference to your inquiry regarding the state of health of a number of St. George's School children who have not returned to school, I beg to advise as follows:\n\nNo. 710 - Jimmie Charlie, has just recently been re-examined and has returned to school.\n\nNo. 252 - Albert Antoine,\nNo. 270 - Joseph Dunstan,\nNo. 2202 - Zola Hall,\nNo. 2217 - Reba Williams,\nNo. 2250 - Amy Dunstan.\n\nThe above children have not been examined for some time due to the great difficulty in visiting them because of bad weather and roads, and also the difficulty in bringing them in to see me for the same reason. All, however, were decidedly unfit for school from the health standpoint when last seen, and were not expected to be fit for school for a considerable time.\n\nNo. 247 - Florabelle Raphael, has been seen recently and may possibly be fit for school next term.\n\nTrusting this is satisfactory,\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nJohn P. Ellis, M.D.\nIt is difficult to understand the Principal's attitude in respect to the seven children returned home last spring with a number of other children, some of whom have returned, some who have died. The school has a full staff including the Principal, Vice Principal, Boys' Instructor or Supervisor, a Registered Nurse, and also two cars at their disposal. Yet, seemingly no effort has been made on the part of the Principal to visit these children, although a few of them live within easy distance of the school. One would expect that after the condition in which these children were sent home from the school, the Principal would at least show some interest in their welfare. As he has time for outside activities, it cannot be that he is pressed for time.\n\nIt should be remembered that this is a large, busy Agency in which I am practically alone. I feel that too much time is being taken up on groundless complaints from the Principal of the St. George's School being sent to the Commissioner's office at Vancouver as well as to the Department at Ottawa.\n\nI have the honor to be,\n\nSir,\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA. Strang\nIndian Agent\n\nAS:MH\nEnc.\n\nThe Secretary\nIndian Affairs Branch\nDepartment of Mines and Resources\nOttawa, Ontario\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith beg to acknowledge receipt of Departmental letter 165-0-10 dated January 5th instant with reference to certain children not yet returned to the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn this connection, I beg to enclose a letter just received from Dr. Ellis reporting on the present condition of the seven of the children mentioned in your last letter. These children are the balance of those sent home last spring too sick to carry on. I may say that I have kept in close touch with these children either by visits or by communication with the parents or relatives, and as they recovered, they were sent back to school with no opportunity wasted on my part.\n\nRegarding Johnny Green and Cecil Samson, the former was given permission to stay home to look after his grandmother's ranch during the winter months. There was no one else available at the time, as the grandfather died last spring. This boy's case was discussed by the Principal and myself. Johnny is fifteen years old, and is only passing into Grade 6. He had reached the stage where he was discontented at school, and being as slow as he is, I consider him better off doing what he is doing than attending school.\n\nWith regard to Cecil Samson, as soon as the school was out of quarantine, I had this boy brought to my office. I was away at Lillooet on Departmental duties at the time, so my clerk asked Mr. Lett, the Principal, to come for him. This he refused to do saying that the boy should have been brought in before; that he did not want him now as he would retard the whole class. When I returned the boy had gone back home with his father. The reason the Principal gives for the boy's return home is that he did not get the Doctor's examination. However, the Doctor is always available in Lytton. I now understand Mr. Lett does not want these two boys returned.\nThe Secretary\n\nJanuary 25, 1938\n\nIt is difficult to understand the Principal's attitude in respect to the seven children returned home last spring with a number of other children, some of whom have returned, some who have died.

This boy had not been returned, but on receiving this report I immediately took steps to ascertain his whereabouts and found that he had been living near Lytton with his friends, these people stating that his presence with them had been reported to the Office at Lytton, but the School had no information regarding his whereabouts.\n\nI also have your report from Mr. Coleman regarding the health of Elizabeth Bent. I might say that Mr. Coleman and Mr. Barber have both sent in their reports to me answering my queries, but up to the present time, excepting for your letter regarding the children on the Lytton agency I have had nothing. There are a number of eligible children in this agency who should be in the School at the present time and who would mean much to our financial status. I have gone to many of these parents and they have all promised me faithfully that their children will be brought into School, but they have not carried out their promises.

Possibly the best course to take would\nbe to keep these certificates and present them to\nthem next year or, if you so desire, you can destroy\nthese certificates and new ones will be issued next\nyear.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev.

I should appreciate hearing from you regarding these children and at the same time you should return her letter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. A. R.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn connection with our Quarterly Returns, I wish to call your attention to the following pupils.\n\nBoys. No.291. Roy Williams\n311. Eddie Lewis Sam\n312. David Shuta.\n\nWith your approval, I would like to give these boys special training for this year, it being their last year in the School. The training would consist of Manual training in general, and I am hoping to do some building with them, and together with this, emphasising agriculture in every phase as these boys, with the exception of Roy Williams, will return to the reserve to take up farming on their reserve farms.\n\nGirls. No.149 Gladys Shuta\n173 Katharine McKay\n213 Emily Justice\n\nAgain, I wish to give these girls special training in domestic science, handicraft and woolwork, subject to your approval, of course.\n\nWill you please let me know by return your decision on the matter. The children are very anxious to take these courses and I feel that it is very much more important to them at this stage of their education than for them to continue academics.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nMay I call your attention again to the quarterly Reports, in regard to those children who are still absent?\n\nThe Department's Medical representative has closed the School since September 22nd, against any children returning or any possible visitors coming in, owing to the fact that one of the Indian parents contracted infantile paralysis.\n\nThe Indian was sick some twelve days prior to the Doctor's knowledge and it was feared perhaps the School would fall prey to this disease.\n\nThe children are late in returning and in reality should have been in the School much before September 22nd, but unfortunately when a number of them were ready to be brought into the School, they were sent home at the Doctor's orders.\n\nYesterday, I had a conversation with Dr. Ellis and he hopes to lift the quarantine against those children and I expect within the next few days they will be returned to us. I shall, however, keep you posted.\n\nMay I specially point out to you that there are no cases of infantile paralysis in the School, but that the School is closed to any people who would wish to come in.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal\nMr. R.A. Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nI was suddenly called East on 23rd ultimo owing to the sudden and serious illness of my mother, who has now gone to her rest. I returned to the School on the morning of the 4th inst. and as a consequence of this trip East, my Quarterly Returns were held up. I trust, however, they will be forwarded to you at once as they were released from this Office in the late afternoon yesterday.\n\nI would appreciate your attention at your end and for the cheques to be sent forward at the usual time.\n\nYours very obediently,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n## ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT St. George's Indian Residential SCHOOL DURING September QUARTER, 1938\n\n| No. | NAME

However, from personal knowledge I do know that since about 1925 she has been living with a white man, W.M. Blain, at his farm a few miles from the Ashcroft Reserve. It may be accepted that he is the acknowledged father of the children referred to, and under Provincial statute is responsible for the care and keep of these children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOTTAWA, Canada.\nOttawa,\nOctober 25, 1938.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI am in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to the children of Molly Scotty.

Hoey,\nSupt. of Welfare & Training,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOTTAWA, Ont.\n\nDear Mr. Hoey,\n\nIn connection with my quarterly returns, may I call attention to Pupils Nos. 0221 and 0253 - Elizabeth Adams and Margaret Smoker - who have been truants unreturned since last October.\n\nInspector Barry at his last visit carefully investigated their accusations from the School standpoint and I understood from him at the time of his inspection that he expected to go on to the reserve and see the parents of these children. This fact, I am told indirectly, did not materialise owing to unsatisfactory arrangements being made to ensure the parents being at home to meet Inspector Barry.\n\nI think you will agree with me that some report should be given the School so that I may intelligently make my returns, and I do not quite understand why these children, since their accusations against the School are absolutely unfounded, should be allowed to remain out. As you know, it is not in my jurisdiction to go on to the reserve and forcibly have these children returned, but I might say I do feel strongly that such cases should be allowed to maintain their charge against the School as it does more harm than one is aware of. I think it would be wise for the Department to enforce their return, even if they ask for their immediate discharge.\n\nRegarding Pupil No. 0208 - Janet Peter Charlie - this girl has been discharged at the request of the Agent on application from the Chief, and Pupil No. 338 - Nelson Floyd Raphael - was discharged at my request because of his bad influence in the School, and I trust the Department will see fit to approve.\n\nPupil No. 0228 - Mary Mack - who was sent home after the epidemic in 1936 has not been reported to me for some time and in taking her name off the list, I feel it is being\ndone without proper regard for her condition of health at the present time. I have seen this girl quite often and recently and she seems to be in very good health.\n\nPupil No.320 - David Lewis McKay - Whilst I have no report about him I would suggest that my action in deleting his name should be maintained.\n\nYours very faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\nOttawa,\nApril 18, 1939.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nOn checking the March quarter return of the St. George's Indian residential school it is noted that Elizabeth Adams, No. 0221, and Margaret Smoker, No. 0253, truanted from the school last October and have not since returned.\n\nAs the former is stated to be 12 years of age and the latter 11 it is difficult to understand why they have not returned to school. Please make a personal investigation of the home conditions of these two children and if you find them in good health arrangements should be made for returning them to the St. George's Indian residential school immediately. Please let me know when you have taken action in this matter.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nA.

I would respectfully recommend that this pupil be deleted from the school register.\n\nMargaret Smoker, whose date of birth is September 13th, 1925, is at present, and has been for some time, looking after a sick relative who is a helpless cripple. I have endeavoured to have someone else look after the crippled woman but without success.

However, in view of the fact that the number of children of school age is apparently increasing and the further consideration that due to the conditions now confronting us there is no immediate prospect of our securing funds to provide increased pupilage at Indian residential schools, it is considered that in future it will be necessary to adhere more strictly to the provision of the Indian Act requiring discharge of pupils at 16 years of age.\n\nRev. A. R. Lett,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B. C.\nI feel you will agree with me that it is not fair to deprive children of education simply because the accommodation that might be available for them in a residential school is being used by those who have had the advantage of residential school training for some years and who have reached the age of 16 years.\n\nUntil further advised you should make arrangements for the discharge of pupils when they reach the age of 16 unless there are some very exceptional circumstances and in this event full particulars should be given to the Department and our permission obtained before such pupils reach the age of 16.\n\nWith the above in mind I desire to hear from you at the earliest possible date stating the date on which the pupils mentioned in the first part of this letter can be discharged from your school.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, June 26th, 1939\n\nReverend Sir:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 20th instant, the Department approves the undermentioned pupils remaining in the St. George's Residential School for another year:\n\nNo:262 - Handy Sam\nNo:0118 - Bessy Kelly\nNo:0129 - Theresa Williams\n\nIf you consider such action advisable pupil No:0186 Amanda Agnes Sam and No:0191 Mary Mali may also remain for another year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division\n\nReverend A.

Enquiries were instituted at Lytton and eventually MAJOR traced to a point called Gladwin, B.C. Here it was found that he had been given a lift by Indians of the Spences Bridge Reserve, and another lift later on into Marritt by Indians of the Canford Reserve.\n\nOn returning to Marritt the boy was found in company with his mother, and on her assurance to the Indian Agent that she would be responsible for him overnight, he was allowed to stay with her.\n\nOn Sunday, the fifth, the boy MAJOR was returned to the Rev H.S. Lett, Principal of St George's School at Lytton, a patrol per Police transport being made for this purpose.\n\nCopy of this report to the Indian Agent at Marritt, B.C.\n\nExpenses shown $93.00\n\nCheetham period may last to May 15th 1940.\n\nMILEAGE: 222 miles.\n\nCONCLUDED.\n\n(J.R.Cheetham) Reg No 12106.\n\nThe O.C.\nR.C.M.P.\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSir: FORWARDED: 6-5-40\nsgd l/opl\n\n(R.R.Garnett) Reg No 10119\n1/c Marritt Detachment.\n\nFile numbers must be quoted\nRe: Jackie MAJOR, Indian Boy - Missing from St. George's Indian School - Lytton, B.C.\n\nThe Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nSir: Copy for your information.\n\nVancouver,\n7-8-40\n(J.

The children appeared very happy to return to classes, and their parents expressed in general their good-will. As far as student numbers go, I feel that in the very near future St. George's School will have a waiting list for admissions.\n\nPrior to the children's return to school, the whole of the school was thoroughly cleaned. All walls and floors were scrubbed and staff rooms kalsomined. The boys' playroom was given very careful attention, and new lockers are at present being made in our manual training room to replace the old lockers. A small reading room for Senior Boys' was fitted out with tables and chairs, and they have found this a great help to them in the evenings. The school entrance, main corridors, and staff sitting room were done over and re-arranged to give a brighter and more cheerful appearance to the school.\n\nThe cleanliness of the children has been given very special attention. All boys' wash to their waists daily. They also have a foot bath each night before retiring, and once a week all have a warm body bath under supervision. Following this bath each boy's body is examined by our school nurse, Mrs. C. Lowe. One of the Senior boys' has also been instructed in the art of hair cutting, thus each Saturday Morning any boy desiring his hair trimmed, appears at our school barber shop.\n\nThe diet of the children has been carefully planned. The weights of all children were taken on entrance to school this fall, and are to be taken each month thereafter. We are glad to find that some children have gained as much as seven pounds this month, and very few have not gained at least two pounds.\n\nFor the present (until our new principal gives his sanction) I have allowed the children only one half hour of games or gymnastics in the evening, twice a week. In the past in my estimation\nthis kind of recreation has been overdone, and no doubt was the indirect cause of ill health and loss of weight among these children. The majority of children here are under 13 years of age, and are up in the morning around 6 a.m. and after working out one-half day on the farm, followed by one half-day in the classroom, together with their playground exercise, can't have a great deal of surplus energy left for organized evening games. Since we have given them more rest, we find they are more eager to do good work in the classroom and on the farm.\n\nThe staff and I have done our best to bring a calmer attitude among the children here. They are extremely excitable and will need a great deal of care to bring them to an understanding of self-control. In fact the whole school in the past has been somewhat possessed by a restlessness, and I would believe it was fostered by unhappiness and the frequent changing of staff. Last year alone, ten changes were made in staff during the term and four at the end of June. This has a very harmful effect upon the school as a whole.\n\nDay and night fire drill have been carefully carried out. I have also given the boys' a great deal of instruction on this important matter, and at last we have them reacting to the various emergencies in a calmer and more logical manner. I have also made it my business to have a nightly round made of the school at 10.30 p.m. to see there are no danger of fire breaking out.\n\nAll four of the entrance class passed their examinations to High School. One boy Clarence Walkem, (brother to Miss Edith Walkem, teacher in our intermediate Room here) is taking High School in my classroom at present. He appears bright like his sister, and should do well in the future.\n\nThe staff of the school are doing very careful and painstaking work in their various departments. In fact they all appear exceptionally happy, and the atmosphere of the school is gradually clearing. To add to the social aspect, the Head Matron has organized the following gatherings; A Red Cross Meeting for the ladies of the staff one evening per week; and one evening for them to have tea together in the staff sitting-room about 9.30 p.m., and one evening for badminton in the school gymnasium.\n\nThe religious instruction of the school has not suffered. Fifteen minutes per day is still devoted to this work, additional to daily prayers said in the chapel. Each Sunday the local Anglican Priest from Lytton attends to our Communion Service, and I am responsible for the 11 a.m. service. The Administrator of the Diocese has given me a temporary license for church duties.\n\nMay we also on this occasion take the privilege of thanking Dr. W.H. McGill, Director of Indian Affairs, and Major D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., for honoring us by a visit on August 21. We would also like to thank all officials in Ottawa for their kind cooperation in helping us over the difficult period of the last few months.\n\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to our local Indian Agent, Mr. A. Strang, for his untiring aid and advice to us; and to Captain G.H. Mortimer, Indian Agent, Merritt, B.C., for his assistance in collecting the children of his Agency; and lastly but not least may I thank the Department for the privilege so kindly given to me, in permitting me to carry on, in the capacity of \"Acting Principal\" during the\nQuarterly report------continued\n\nlast quarter.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nActing Principal\n\nNS.\nLytton, B.C.\nOctober 1st, 1941.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith beg to submit the Quarterly Returns, ending September 30th. Also a list of Pupils for discharge, requisition for Supplies, requisition for Drugs, together with a report from Mr. Noel Stewart, Acting Principal, of the St. Georges Indian Residential School.\n\nI trust these will be found in order and that the requisitions receive the favourable consideration of the Department.\n\nYour obedient servant,\n\nA.

Dick, No. 0321, was shown on the June quarter return but does not appear on the September return, although no application has been received for her discharge. Please advise regarding this girl.\n\nUnder the heading \"Date of entrance\" on the return should be entered the exact date on which the pupil originally entered the school. In preparing the September return Mr. Stewart entered under this heading in many cases the date of the return from the annual holiday leave. However, we have adjusted the matter and it will not be necessary to send back the return. It might also be noted that in the case of pupils entering the school for the first time during the September quarter grant should only be requested from the date of entrance to the end of the quarter.\n\nThe Department approves the discharge of the pupils numbered as follows:\n\n| No. 0198 | No. 0210 | No. 342 |\n|----------|----------|---------|\n| \" 0201   | \" 0245   | \" 350   |\n| \" 0205   | \" 0252   | \" 370   |\n| \" 0207   | \" 0298   | \" 337   |\n\nYours truly,\n\nMr. A.

Strang,\nIndian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\nDear Sir:\n\nI herewith acknowledge receipt of Departmental Letter with reference to the September Quarterly Returns of the St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nIn respect to Lena C. Dick, whose name was shown on the June quarter return and does not appear on the September return. This girl was not a strong child and did not enter school until she was 11 years old. The child was conscious of her age and size compared with the other children in her grade; and this made her very nervous. The principal, Mr. Lett, I understand did not improve matters by quarrelling with the parents, because of having a girl of this age starting school and gave them to understand that he did not care if she continued at school or stayed at home. I was unaware of this at the time.\n\nThe father is employed on the railroad and is now working some distance outside the district, and Lena is now in her thirteenth year. Under these circumstances I would respectfully suggest that her name appear on the next quarter's Discharge List.\n\nYour obedient Servant,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nR.A.

In issuing these it is intended to only send them to pupils who have been in the school for a reasonable number of years and have shown decided progress in whatever work they were asked to do. Please let me know the names and register numbers of the pupils for whom you desire diplomas.\n\nYours truly,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev. C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\nLytton, B.C. June 23, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe Rev. C.F. Hives, Principal of the St. George's Indian Residential School, has asked that David Albert, shown on the previous Quarterly School Return as David Martin, be taken from the roll of the School. Soon after his admission, David was found to be a T.R. suspect and taken to the St. Bartholomew's Hospital at Lytton and transferred to Coqualeetza Hospital at Sardis. It is hardly likely that he will be able to return to the School in the near future, so I would recommend this request be granted.\n\nYours truly,\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nThe Secretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOttawa, Canada.\n\nMM.\nOttawa, June 29, 1942.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nI desire to acknowledge receipt of your letter of the 23rd instant and to state that your recommendation that David Martin be discharged from the Lytton Residential School is acceptable to the Department and approved.\n\nYours very truly,\n\nR.

When a pupil is discharged his name should be removed from the return and you should so inform the Principal. We have not yet received the application forms for pupils 453 and 454, although they have been in the school for several months. It would be appreciated if you would arrange to have these application forms forwarded at once.\n\nThe names of 14 pupils are shown on the return but no grant is requested for them and no explanation is given regarding their absence.

They have done very well in school, having made good progress, and have it in them to take their place in a work-a-day world, and make a living. I would therefore recommend that the following receive an honorable discharge from our school.\n\nNos. 351, 365, 369, 371, 375, Reynold Smith, Walter Angus, Nelson Henry, Oliver Stewart, respectively.\n\nI would also recommend that No. 390, Jackie Major receive his discharge. I think he would be much happier out of school. He will make very little progress in school, and I think he would be much better at home, where, I understand he can be helped.\n\nI would also recommend that the names of the following pupils be taken off our roll. They did not return after last holidays because they were needed at home. They are now of the age of 16 years.\n\nNos. 347, 353, 358, 359, 362, 368, Francis Joe, Earl Adams, Oscar Phillips, Dan Phillips, Fred Peters, John Charlie respectively.\n\nI would also recommend that the following pupils be honorably discharged:\n\nNos. 0241, 0242, 0247, 0250, 0251, 0276, Glorias Angus, Lily Phillips, Elsie Stewart, Thelma Abbott, Mae Dunstan, Laura Jumbo respectively.\n\nAlso that the following be discharged.

This was duly sanctioned. There are several pupils such pupils who have returned, and whose parents have asked that they be allowed to continue for another term, as not being old enough to leave school. It has not usually been that way. Generally they have wanted them home as soon as possible. I would recommend that the following pupils be allowed to continue for another term:\n\nLily Phillips, Thelma Abbott, Mae Dunstan,\nNos. 0241, 0247, 0248 respectively.\n\nPupil No. 363 Earl Adams, who did not return to school after the 1942 holidays, was convicted of house-breaking with three other young men. The other young men were given term in the penitentiary. Earl Adams was committed to the Reformatory. I asked that he should be placed in my custody for a period of six months on suspended sentence. The magistrate granted my request. He is now in school, and I would recommend that he be allowed to stay as a pupil for the space of six months. He appears to be doing fairly well; and I think he will improve.\n\nI would recommend that the following pupils receive their discharge: 388 Leonard Thomas, 404 Edward Charlie, 434 Henry Munroe, 0238 Bertha Sam, 0272 Ida Edwards. It appears that all these pupils are required at home; and I think they would be a help to their own people.\n\nWe are short of a few supplies in the classroom, and I would be very much obliged if you would supply them to us as soon as possible, as per requisition enclosed.\n\nChas.

October 16, 1944.\n\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines and Resources,\nOTTAWA, CANADA.\n\nI enclose herewith Quarterly Returns in connection with St. George's Indian Residential School for the period ending September 30th, 1944, which indicate that several new pupils have been admitted to the school. I beg to advise the Department herewith that completed applications for the admission of these pupils will be forwarded as soon as received at this Office.\n\nA. Strang,\nIndian Agent.\n\nMM.\nOct. 14, 1944\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI have sent in the Quarterly returns, and feel very dissatisfied with them. It has been so difficult to get the pupils back this year. The people here are quite spoilt anyway; but this year, they have had such opportunities of making money, one way or another. And they have made use of their children, even little ones, by letting them pick hops or fruit; they seem to have lost sight of the importance of education. Or at least, the school is a very secondary consideration.\n\nWe have received quite a number of new pupils. So far, I have been unable to get them all examined by the doctor; who appears to be extremely busy. I will send in their Application forms at the first opportunity. In the meantime, will you kindly allow them in as pupils. The people are all scattered over the country picking fruit, and it is difficult getting their signature to the Application forms.\n\nI was hoping that some of the older girls would come back to work on my staff as probationers or assistants; but they found such an abundance of work with good pay awaiting them, they have not come back. I don't know what they will all do when we get back to normal conditions.\n\nWe have had great difficulty keeping a full staff; but we are managing somehow, and will continue to do so until better times come.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\nOttawa,\nOctober 24, 1944.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nI have your letter of the 14th instant, with reference to the September quarter return of the St. George's Residential School. As soon as the applications for the new pupils are received they should be forwarded to this office. I have arranged to have the cheque for the grant go forward immediately. This cheque will include not only the regular per capita grant for the quarter but also the quarterly payment of the special grant of $15 per pupil which the Department is allowing this year.\n\nIn connection with the quarterly return I would refer you to my letter of July 12, in which you were requested to correct certain numbers shown on the quarterly return. These corrections have not been made and it would be appreciated if you would give the matter your immediate attention. This will involve giving different numbers to the new pupils who entered the school for the first time during the September quarter. I might also add that the total number of pupils shown under the heading \"Class\" does not agree with the total of the boys and girls. In other words, the grade of several pupils is not shown. It would be appreciated if these matters could be adjusted on the next return.\n\nYours truly,\n\nRev. C.F.

Pupil No.0347 Nora Justice is the last name on the returns. In the next quarterly returns we have quite a few new pupils following on to 0347. These numbers are original, and Freda Hanna, No.0358 is the last on the Returns.\n\nOwing to some carelessness in typing, the numbers in the next Quarterly Returns are muddled, so that in the Quarterly Returns ended March 31st. 1944, a mistake was made by missing out the number 0357. This mistake was rectified in the Returns ended June 30th., giving to Irene Spinks her original number 0357 and Freda Hanna 0358.\n\nI hope this clears up the matter. I made the same explanation in the last Quarterly Returns, but expect it was not sent from the Agent's office.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nP.s Will you kindly try and hurry up a cheque as soon as possible after the Returns are in.\n\nMr Philip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nOttawa.\n## ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT St. George's SCHOOL DURING Sept.-Dec. 1944 QUARTER\n\n| No. | NAME               | Date of Admission | Age at Admission | Band          | NAME OF PARENTS AND LIVING OR DEAD | Father       | Mother       | Religion of Parents | State of Education upon entering the School | Places and period of Previous Education |\n|-----|--------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\n| 471 | Ranger Seymour     | Oct. 1            | 8                | Lower Nicola  | Harry Seymour L                   | Susan Seymour L | Ang.         | nil                 |                                             |                                          |\n| 472 | Ralph Jumbo        | \u2022\u2022                | 7                | Lytton        | Leonard Jumbo L                   | Ada Jumbo L  | nil          | nil                 |                                             |                                          |\n| 473 | Louis Holy Singer  | \u2022\u2022                | 7                | Cardston      | Eddy Soup L                       | Julie Holy Singer L | \u2022\u2022           | nil                 |                                             |                                          |\n| 0369| Loretta Webster    | Nov. 1            | 7                | Lytton        | Fred Webster L                    | Norma Blanchford L | \u2022\u2022           | nil                 |                                             |                                          |\n| 0370| Lily M.

You may inform the Principal that the Department approves her admission.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI was very glad indeed to receive your letter in answer to my request for an advance on the quarterly Grant; for it gives me the urge to write you, and try and explain to you some of the difficulties that contribute toward the problem of meeting expenses without going into debt. I must confess there are times when I feel almost persuaded to write, asking the Department to please relieve me of this job; for certainly it is a very worrying one.\n\nThe matter of lack of pupils is a very serious one. This can be accounted for in various ways. These people, from what I can see, have little or no appreciation of the value of education. At present they make such good wages without it, they don't see why they should bother to send their children to school. Our older boys during the Summer holidays were making five and six dollars a day. In fact, some who went to the States, made as much as eight dollars a day. Why should they come here to study and work for nothing? The older girls also made wonderful wages; some of them more than I can earn. And so I had great difficulty persuading them to return to school; and when a boy runs away from school, we receive no help from the parents in having him returned.\n\nI would be very grateful indeed if you would write to the Indian Agents at Lytton, Merritt, and Kamloops, asking them to make every effort in have all school-age children in school. I feel sure there must be many of school age in the Merritt Agency who are not attending school. We did not receive one girl from there when school opened at the Fall term. We have had to send several of the Merritt Agency children to the Coqualeetza Hospital. One of them died two years ago. It is very difficult explaining to the Indians, when a T.B. clinic is held, and the X-ray reveals the workings of the T.B. germ, that it was not placed there by St. George's School. I am sure this may seem rather childish to you; but I have heard more than once that children develop T.B. as soon as they arrive at St. George's School. During the three and a half years that I have been here, two pupils have died; one at the Coqualeetza Hospital, and one at the Lytton Hospital. Many\nof their own children, at home, have died during that time, but these two seem to be the only ones they remember having died.\n\nThen there is the foolish and expensive system of outside married staff, adopted years ago. There are five cottages with married couples (three with families) living in them. This institution cannot afford this expense. Those cottagers have to be provided with fuel, light, vegetables, fruit, milk and meat rations. Their salaries have to be in keeping with their status as married people with families. The Farmer and Manual Training Instructor, each receives $90.00 per month. The Dairyman, Engineer and Irrigator each $80.00 per month. The salaries of the inside staff have all had to be raised considerably; although I have cut down their number, and I have been teaching in the Sr. Boys' classroom since the beginning of the Fall term. Yesterday I was able to engage a young man teacher, who has been discharged from the R.C.A.F. Medical Service. He receives $80.00 per month.\n\nThe B.C. Department of Education seems to be over emphasizing the matter of teachers' salaries just at present. They will find, I think, that character building does not always accompany the teacher who draws a big salary. I was greatly relieved when the Public School Inspector, during his recent inspection, said that this would probably be his last inspection of us. He has not been very helpful. His one song is about Academic training. And he criticises our methods; our equipment; religious instruction, and our salaries; and shows very plainly that he does not comprehend the nature of our work. He thinks there should be more man servants and maid servants, so that the girls and boys could go to class full time. We really send all but a very few to school full time.\n\nThen there is the medical situation. Too many children are laid off from school and work for insignificant ailments. We not only make babies of them, but give the parents the impression that their children become weaklings when they come to St. George's School. A week or two ago, we read in the paper that Vancouver had an epidemic of measles. Although Vancouver is 171 miles away, the doctor immediately gave orders that our pupils were not to go to Lytton, and their parents were not to visit the school. I wrote to all the parents and explained as well as I could; but, at the same time, such stuff gives our school a \"black eye\", so that the people look upon us as a kind of a chronic pest house.\n\nYou will think I have a fit of complaints. Well, if I have, it has been on the go for a long time, and I don't think I can stand it much longer. I thought perhaps I could have climbed on the top of it before now; but somehow I did not get off to a very good start. The Church or diocese did\nnot welcome me. That fool of a fellow, Captain Mortimer, who was Indian Agent at Kerritt, told the people there I certainly was not his choice. Which is quite true, but he might have been truthful in telling the truth.\n\nSome of this may appear to you to be small. It does to me also; but the truth is that it totals up to why the road is difficult. Maybe after the war, we shall be able to secure good, reliable, Christian workers who are not altogether in it for the sake of the dollar; but have as their chief objective the welfare of the Indian girls and boys. And also, maybe, when the Indians again settle down to having a hard time making a living, they will appreciate the school that cares for and educates their children.\n\nBut in spite of it all, I am not ashamed of what we have given to the work during the last three and a half years. And I rather think, if you paid us a visit, you would be somewhat proud of our children, as you see them in school.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nIr Philip Ihelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, March 3, 1945.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nAs you are probably aware, more pupils are required at the St. George's Residential School in order that they may have their full quota.

After receiving Mr Indian Agent Taylor's letter informing me of four prospective pupils of the Ashcroft Agnd, I asked one of our missionaries Rev. J. Phelps to try and locate them during one of his visits there. After his return he informed me that two of the names were unknown, and the other two were across the river some distance in the mountains; and very difficult of access without proper packhorse equipment. I have written Mr Taylor regarding all this information.\n\nThe work here has taken up most of my waking hours; and I have had to work early and late in order to accomplish what must be done in the springtime. I have had to take on the Sr. Boys classroom most of the term. Tomorrow I have a young man coming from the University of B.C. to receive me of the teaching. My Farm Manager took sick with jaundice just when the most important part of the year began. I have done every bit of plowing on the place, and finished it yesterday. This had to be done, and meant working early and late. But it is all done, and I have also kept up the Sr. Boys' classroom regularly.\n\nDuring the month I have taken in five new pupils. I really think the Indians are feeling much more kindly toward the school; and appreciate the work we are doing.\n\nI hope the labour situation will improve in the near future. I don't think it can get very much worse.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nMr P. Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nRev. C.F.

The discharge of these pupils has not been recommended, for the reason they were not quite of age to leave school; and in talking the matter over with the parents, they seemed anxious that the school should have an oversight of the conduct of these pupils, in case they did not get along very well. I would now recommend their discharge. The numbers are as follows:\n\nNos. 383, 386, 403, 0243, 0248, 0261, 0329.\n\nRegarding pupils numbered 433, 440, 446, and 450. These pupils are at the Coqualeetza Hospital. I believe they are improving in health; and it is only a matter of time when they will be discharged from there to return here to school. I would recommend that their names remain on the roll for the time being.\n\nPupils Nos. 0312, 0313, 0360, 0361 are four sisters, whose father thought he could look after them, and let them attend day school near to where he was working. About three months ago the mill, where he was working, closed down, and he brought back the girls to school. Their attendance will show on the present Quarterly Returns.\n\nPupil No. 424 is attending a day school, and appears to be doing very well. I would recommend his discharge from the roll of our school.\n\nFor some reason I cannot explain, pupil No. 0332, Rona Thelma Thomas has been left off the Returns since 1943; although she has been in residence continuously since that time. Her name will appear again in the present Quarterly Returns. It is to be regretted that this mistake has been made, for we can ill afford to lose the grant.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nA.

I wish to recommend this girl for higher education as she has done splendid work and completed the seventh grade. She particularly excels in drawing and her work in this respect is most commendable.\n\nLloyd Milton, Kitwancool, aged 8. The parents of this boy have not lived together for several years and the mother, with whom he stayed has been in Hospital since November last suffering from tuberculosis and cancer. I would recommend that this case be given favourable consideration.\n\nOlive Russell, Kitegukla, age 9. Owing to the father of this child working in a lumber camp too far away from the nearest Day School this child has attended school very irregularly and I feel that it would be to her advantage if she could enter the Residential School, which I would recommend.\n\nRita Pearl Campbell, Hazelton, age 12. The only parent living is the father of this child whose occupation keeps him away from the Reserve, in consequence of which this girl stays with different relatives and attends school very irregularly. I recommend her admission to Alberni.\n\nRose Rita Turner, Hazelton, age 13.\n\nRiley Elijah Turner, Hazelton, age 10. The parents of these children suffer from tuberculosis, although the father appears to be recovering from the disease. If\ntheir physical condition will permit I would recommend that they be kept away from their parents and enter the Alberni School.\n\nLawrence Percy Brown, Hazelton, age 14. Due to the death of the boy's father last year the mother has had to move around finding work and is finding it difficult to keep the boy in regular attendance at the Day School. I recommend his admission to Alberni.\n\nRavina Louisa Smith, Kitwancool, age 10. The mother of this girl is often employed where it is impossible to send Ravina to school. I would recommend the girl's admission to Alberni.\n\nSamuel Evan Derrick, Kitwanga, age 10. The parents of this child are not living together and the father has a difficult time finding someone to care for the boy as his employment keeps him away from the Reserve. I recommend this boy's admission to a Residential School.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent\n\nSM/GM\nencl.\nOttawa, August 8, 1945.\n\nMr. S.

This boy was away when the applications of his sister and brother were submitted on August 1st. Both parents of the boy are tubercular and I would recommend Delbert's admission to Alberni in order to be away from them.\n\nWilfred Stanley Wale, Hazelton, age 15. I wish to recommend this boy for higher education which has the approval of Mrs. Bird, late teacher of the Hazelton Indian Day School. His school record has been particularly good and he is worthy of consideration. He would have completed Grade 6 had he not suffered from a ruptured acute appendicitis in January last which kept him away from school for some months.\n\nFreddy Raymond Wale, Hazelton, age 13. If there is a vacancy at Alberni I would recommend that this boy be admitted. His teacher, Mrs. Bird, approves this action and reports that it would be to his advantage if he could commence this year. The father of this boy and the one previously mentioned is very ambitious (he was teacher at Kisgegas a few years ago) and wants his children to receive the best education possible.\n\nShould the Department approve these applications will you kindly advise me by air-mail, and oblige?\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nAIRMAIL\n\nOttawa, 17th August, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Mallinson, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 10th instant, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the Alterni Indian Residential School:\n\nDelbert Rudy Turner\nWilfred Stanley Wale,\nFreddy Raymond Wale\n\nI suggest that you communicate with the Principal immediately and have him reserve accommodations for these children mentioned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Department of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 159-1-10.\n\nFurther to my letter of August 27th and your reply of September 6th, I have communicated with the Principals of the Alert Bay Indian Residential School and the Crosby Girls' Home at Port Simpson, and find that there are no vacancies at the former and, although I have nothing definite from the latter school, it would appear from the Principal's letter, that there is some doubt as to there being any vacancies.\n\nI have therefore communicated with Canon C. F. Hives, Principal of St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, who would be very glad to have all the boys and girls already approved by you. However, as this school is so far away, I do not think any of the parents or guardians would be willing to pay the full fare and some of the parents and guardians could not pay anything. May I ask if the Department would approve of all the children mentioned in my letters of August 1st and August 10th going to Lytton, and if full fares for some and part fares for others would be paid by the Department.\n\nShould the Department approve the foregoing, would it not be advisable to send an escort with these children? I am certain arrangements could be made to do this with a Salvation Army worker who can obtain the Missionary rate of fare.\n\nCanon Hives has mentioned having vacancies for further pupils, and there are two or more who should enter a residential school. However, arrangements have not been finally made regarding these and in order to save time, could you kindly give me authority to send these children, should approval be received from the parents and the physical examination by the doctor passed?\n\nA reply by Air Mail would be appreciated.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part II)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nOttawa, 30th October, 1945.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C.,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nI have been in correspondence with Indian Agent Wallison with regard to certain pupils in his Agency which he considers require institutional care. He tried to obtain admission for them at the Alberni School but was unable to do so and later endeavoured to place them in either the Alert Bay or Port Simpson Residential Schools. He now advises that there are no vacancies in either of the latter named schools.\n\nThere are vacancies in the St. George's Residential School in Lytton, B.C. and I would like to have your opinion regarding the placing of these children in that school from a place so far north as this Agency. I was talking to Mr. Hoey and he thinks this is something that should be allowed to stand until a new School Inspector has been appointed.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 159-1-10\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of October 30th regarding the proposed admission of Indian children from the Babine Agency to the St. George's Indian Residential School, I may say that the suggestion originated from this office as a result of some criticism offered of the assistance extended by the Indian Agent to Joyce Brown, an orphan child of the Glen Vowell Band.\n\nThe matter was recently discussed with Rev. Hives who informs me that he has accommodation for approximately forty boys and ten girls at the school and if there are a number of children from the Babine Agency who would benefit by attending a Residential school I am of the opinion that it would be advisable to arrange for their admission to St. George's, particularly as the location of this school is no more distant from the Babine Agency than the Alberni Residential School. If there are a number of children to go to the St. George's Residential school, no doubt Mr. Mallinson can arrange for an adult Indian to escort them to Lytton.\n\nFor D. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nOttawa, 9th November, 1945.\n\nMr. S. Mallinson, Indian Agent, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nI desire to refer to your letter of October 13th with reference to placing certain children in your Agency in the St. George's Residential School. The delay in replying to your letter is due to the fact on consulting the Director we thought it advisable to communicate with Indian Commissioner MacKay before sending Indian children to such a great distance from their home.\n\nIt has now been decided to approve the admission of the following children to the St. George's Residential School:\n\nRosabelle Douse - Samuel Evan Derrick\nLloyd Milton - Delbert Rudy Turner\nOlive Russell - Wilfred Stanley Hale\nRita Pearl Campbell - Freddy Raymond Wale\nRose Rita Turner\nRiley Elijah Turner\nLawrence Percy Brown\nRavina Louise Smith\n\nIn the fourth paragraph of your letter of October 13th, you state that there were two or more children in your Agency who should be placed in a Residential School. If you still consider such arrangements necessary and they are physically fit, you may send them with the others. The Department is prepared to pay the cost of their transportation also the return fare of escort. Please let me know when you have placed these children in the St. George's School. You should of course notify the Principal, Reverend Canon Hives regarding the date and time of their arrival at\nLytton in order that he may be prepared to accept them.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name:\nAge:\nName of Band:\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid:\nFather's full name and No:\nMother's full name and No:\nParents living or dead:\nState of child's health:\nReligion:\nDoes applicant speak English?\nPreviously attended school for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNorm\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI recommend the admission of the above child, who is of good moral character and is eligible to be admitted as a grant-earning pupil.\n\nFORM No. 1-A 406\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 11)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\n\nAgency: [illegible] Band: [illegible]\nChild's name: [illegible] Age: 6 Weight: [illegible]\nHeight: [illegible] Is child undernourished?

Sharpe\nIndian Agent.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ontario.\n\nI wish to advise you of two regrettable incidents in connection with some of the children sent from this Agency to St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, B.C.\n\nOn or about December 21st, I received information from the parents of two children, namely, Elijah Turner, and Ben Woods, regarding articles lost by their respective daughters, Rita Turner, and Lulu Woods. The information I received was to the effect that these articles had been \"taken\", but it was found, according to the Rev. Canon Hives' reply, that the two articles belonging to Rita Turner were lost through her own carelessness. However, all articles lost at the school were found and returned to the rightful owners.\n\nBetween December 21st and December 31st, three parents, namely, Elijah Turner, Ben Woods, and Arthur Mowatt, informed me that their children were not receiving sufficient food, one of them stating that they did not receive milk, and that they were losing weight. I asked these parents to wait until I had received a reply from Canon Hives, about which subject I intended writing him. However, the day Elijah Turner informed me as above, he again visited this office and stated that he intended driving down to Lytton to take out his three children from that school, in spite of my remonstrating with him to wait until I had heard from the Principal. I therefore gave him a letter addressed to Canon Hives, which I now confess, should have been sent by mail.\n\nAll the information I received - which it was my duty to investigate - has been definitely found to be untrue, and I am writing Canon Hives, regretting the trouble that has been caused by my letters written in all innocence, and conveying my full confidence in him and in his school, in regard to the welfare of the children.\nof this agency. I am also enclosing a copy of this letter to Canon Hives.\n\nAs the three Turner children and Lulu Woods have now returned home, will you kindly give me your advice as to whether these children are eligible for the Family Allowances. I may state that the Hazelton Indian Day School is still closed, having no teacher appointed.\n\nS. Mallinson,\nIndian Agent.\nOttawa, February 1, 1946.\n\nMr. A. Strang, Indian Agent,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nThe Department approves the admission\nof Flora Jane Paul and Stephen Maurice Paul to the\nSt. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 1, 1946.\n\nMr. G. E. Sharpe, Indian Agent,\nMerritt, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 15th instant, the Department approves the admission of the following children to the St. George's Indian Residential School:\n\nEstelle Evelyn Wilson,\nFreddie Washington,\nEddie Boston.\n\nThe Department also approves the admission of Wainwright Shuter and Phyllis Marie Wilson.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, February 1, 1946.\n\nMr. S. Mallinson, Indian Agent,\nHazelton, Ont.\n\nI have your letter of the 8th instant, in reference to certain complaints that you received regarding the St. George's School. It is noted that you have now ascertained that the complaints were unfounded.\n\nI do not understand the statement made in the last paragraph of your letter, that the three Turner children and Lulu Woods have returned home. When children are placed in a residential school, discharge can only be allowed when the official approval of the Department has been given. Our file does not indicate that any approval for the discharge of these children was either requested or authorized.\n\nI cannot understand why the Principal allowed the children to go home.\n\nOn reviewing our file I find that for some unaccountable reason no reply was made to your letter of December 3. The Department approves the admission of the children whom you mention in that letter and whose admission to the school you recommended. It is possible that you have visited the St. George's School, but if you have not done so, I believe it would be advisable for you to pay a visit to the school whenever your other duties will permit. As there are children from your agency attending the school it is important that you should have first hand information regarding its whole operation. I am certain that the Principal would appreciate a visit from you. Please let me hear further from you.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Divisi\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nNovember 15th, 1945\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Residential School, to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child:\nEnglish name: Jennie M.

C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nJuly 10, 1946  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThe following names of pupils have attained to the age of sixteen years. They have done very well in school, in their classes of instruction etc. They have conducted themselves in a very creditable manner. While at school, they have been industrious, decent and clean in themselves and with other pupils. I have never known any of the pupils named below to run away, and I feel sure that I am right in recommending their discharge. They can be of very great value to their parents, who are anxious to have them home.\n\nThe names are as follows:\n\nNumbers. 372, 382, 396, 397, 408, 411, 415, 430.\nHarry Swaken, Nathan Spinks, Stanley Joe, Clarence Angus, William Charlie, Willoughby Dunstan, Ranger Bustace, Bert Seymour.\n\nNos. 250, 255, 259, 273, 285, Mae Dunstan, Hilda Oaten, Dorothy Swartz, Edna Frank, Evelyn Spike.\n\nI would recommend honorable discharge for the above.\n\nI would also recommend that the following be taken off the roll.

Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nJan. 10, 1947  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are a number of names on our School roll of pupils who have not returned; and from what I can gather of their activities, would be just as well off the roll as discharged pupils. They are as follows:\n\nNos. 405, 412, 426, 436, 455, Billy Swakem, Gordon Jumbo, James Swakem, Sandy Munro, Francis Joe Thom respectively, are living and working at their home. Most of them are helping on ranches, and riding horseback most of the time; which is very much more interesting to them than being in a classroom. I would recommend their discharge.\n\nNos. 484, 488, 489, Lawrence Brown, Max Woods, Sam Derrick respectively, are Hazelton boys. I understand their people were not in a position to buy their fare back to school. I have written the Indian Agent about them, but I believe the Agency has recently had a change there. I would recommend their discharge. I would also recommend for the same reason, Nos. 0386, 0390, 0395, Mona Wright, Theresa James, Mary Hance respectively.\n\nNos. 0294, 0305, 0318, 0335, 0348, 0363, Anna Phillips, Jane Sampson, Rose Spinks, Phyllis Johnnie, Hilda Ruddy, Alice Lewis. Respectively have not returned, and on enquiry, their parents say they are needed at home. I would recommend their discharge.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, February 5, 1947.\n\nRev.

C.F. Hives, Principal, St. George's Indian Residential School, Lytton, British Columbia.\n\nWith reference to the March Quarter Return of the St. George's Indian Residential School, it is noted that pupil No. 0274 Amy Edmunds was absent during the December Quarter but ninety days grant was requested in the March Quarter. What was the date of her return to school?\n\nPupil No. 0333 Lily George was in hospital. Kindly forward the date of her admission and discharge.\n\nYour attention is also directed to the fact that the Return was added incorrectly and this will make a difference in the average attendance.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part II)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\nDear Mr Phelan:\n\nI have your letter of the 5th inst., in reference to March Quarterly Returns. Sorry I made a mistake in the adding. I was under doctor's orders to go easy at that time. In fact, he warned me I would have to give up, until I went to a Heart Specialist in Vancouver, and got his O.K. But that does not excuse my making mistakes.\n\nIn regard to Amy Edmunds. As perhaps you are aware, the Ashcroft Reserve is a poor place, and seems to be nobody's baby, from the agency standpoint. It is about sixty miles away from us, and not an easy road. I made several trips to get Amy, but she seemed to have the knack of evading me. Then the Indian Agent phoned me at the beginning of January, and said he had her in custody, or the police had, and she was sent to us at that time. Toward the end of March, I found a home for her, for she is not a good influence here in school. She was in Police Court several times during the Summer for drunkenness etc. If she is able to give a good account of herself, I would like to ask for her discharge from school.\n\nLily George was admitted to the Coqualeetza Hospital on Mar. 6th. But she was in the Lytton Hospital a week or two before that. I have not asked for her discharge at the present time because she has no mother, and her father is serving a life sentence for murder. If she is cured at Coqualeetza Hospital, she would have to return here.\n\nYours faithfully\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMr. Phillip Phelan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs, Ottawa.\nOttawa, May 22nd, 1947.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWith reference to your letter of the 12th instant, the Department approves the discharge of Amy Edmunds, No. 0274 from the St. George's Residential School.\n\nWith reference to Lily George, No. 0333, her name may be retained on the return, but no grant should be requested for her while she is in hospital.

The suggested monthly charge per girl is $15.00, or a total cost of about $90.00 for all three children for the summer holidays.\n\nLouis Frederick of the Lytton Agency has offered to board the children, and Rev. Hives has visited this man's home and satisfied himself that it is satisfactory for the children to stay there.\n\nAs there is insufficient time to receive the necessary authority before the end of the school term I am writing the Principal to send the children to Louis Frederick's home, and have him send his account to this office.\n\nAs this expense is apparently unavoidable will the Department please authorize same?\n\nR.H.S.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nAttached is a copy of a letter just received from Indian Agent Sampson.\n\nThe three Quash girls were admitted as pupils of the St. George's Residential School some months ago. Presumably the home conditions are unsatisfactory and consequently they could not be sent back to their home for the summer holidays.\n\nWe frequently have similar cases arise in the residential schools in the East and in all such cases the pupils are kept at the residential school during the holiday term. Will it not be possible to follow the same procedure at the St. George's School? Why is it necessary for the Department to incur the expense of placing these three children in a private home for the months of July and August?\n\nAn early reply would be appreciated.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/MGD\n## ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT St. George's\n\n| No. | Name          | Date of Admission | Age on Admission | No. of Ticket under Child's Authority is paid | Band |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|------|\n|     |               |                   |                  |                                             |      |\n\n## DISCHARGE OF PUPILS\n\n| No. | Name          | Date of Discharge | Periods in the School | State of Education | Trade or Industry Taught and Proficiency in it | Remarks Upon Discharge Reasons for Same |\n|-----|---------------|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| 413 | Patrick Stewart | April 9 16        | 8                     | nil               | Grade VI                                      | Admitted to Coqualeetza Hospital 1943   |\n| 448 | Frank Draper  | \u2022\u2022                | 14                    | \u2022\u2022                | \u2022\u2022                                            | \u2022\u2022                                      |\n| 457 | Leonard Peters| \u2022\u2022                | 13                    | \u2022\u2022                | \u2022\u2022                                            | \u2022\u2022                                      |\n| 469 | Pierre Basil  | \u2022\u2022                | 10                    | \u2022\u2022                | \u2022\u2022                                            | \u2022\u2022                                      |\n| 0850| Patsey Swakem | \u2022\u2022                | 10                    | \u2022\u2022                | \u2022\u2022                                            | Sent home at advice of doctor           |\n| 0359| Lorna Dunstan | \u2022\u2022                | 9                     | \u2022\u2022                | \u2022\u2022                                            | \u2022\u2022                                      |\n\n**NOTE:** One or more of these forms should be forwarded with each quarterly return and full particulars should be given regarding all pupils either admitted or discharged during the quarter.\n\n---\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES ARCHIVES PUBLIQUES CANADA\nOttawa, July 16, 1947.\n\nRev.

June 5, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. McKay, Indian Commissioner for B.C., Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWith reference to your correspondence with the District Inspector of Schools concerning the suggestion of the Reverend Canon C.F. Hives that fares of pupils of this Agency to St. George's School should be subsidized, I wish to express complete agreement. Even when all Day Schools are in operation, there are a great many children whose unsatisfactory home environment prejudices their proper education. If a residential School for Protestant children had been available in this area during the past school year, I venture to say that more than fifty children might have sought admittance. It does not seem fair that those who seek better education and discipline for their children should have to pay approximately $60 per capita annually in fares. I would suggest that the Department might agree to pay a child's fare to a Residential School in future, leaving it to the parents to pay the fare home for the holidays. There are other cases where the parents would be unable to afford transportation in either direction and this applies particularly in several overcrowded homes where the health and welfare of the whole family would benefit by the removal of some of the children to a Residential School.\n\n\"J.V.

Devey, District Inspector of Indian Schools,\nc/o Indian Agent's Office, Hazelton, B.C.\n\nI am enclosing a copy of a letter dated May 25th from Rev. Canon C.F. Hives. It is thought that while in Hazelton you might wish to give consideration to the Rev. Principal's suggestion that a number of children from that district attend the St. George's Residential School. It should be borne in mind that such attendance would depend on the accommodation available in the day schools in the district and the home conditions of the children.\n\nD. M. MacKay,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\n[Signature]\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 12)\nDear Major MacKay:\n\nWe are just having a visit from an Indian and his wife, Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Nowett of Hazelton, who have two children here at school. They appear to be very pleased with their children, and everything connected with the school. I asked them about school conditions there at Hazelton, and they informed me that things had improved considerably during the last year. I then asked them if they were considering having the two children home after holidays, in order to attend the day school there, and they said a decidedly \"No.\" That their children were well taken care of here, and they knew they were safe, and under good influence, which they were afraid of at home. But their one worry was the transportation fare. Last year, they paid for their children both ways, and they found it heavy. I think it was something like sixty dollars the round trip each.\n\nDo you think the Department would consider paying one way? Under the present circumstances, St. George's is the only school available, and we are a long way off. They are excellent children, and worthy of all we can do for them. I would like very much to have two dozen of them, for they help our children quite a bit, and our children help them.\n\nI would be very much obliged if you would look into this matter, and if possible, secure some financial assistance for them, in order that they may send more of their children here.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Ches.

Davey\nDistrict Inspector of Indian Schools\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nI am enclosing copies of the file of correspondence, including a copy of Memorandum dated July 11th, from District School Inspector Davey in connection with the payment of transportation costs for pupils at St. George's Indian Residential School who return to their homes during the summer holidays.\n\nIt is my understanding that the Department pays the initial cost of transportation to the school, and that, in cases where the parents wish to have the children home during the holidays, either they or the school are required to pay the transportation both ways.\n\nThe Reverend Principal of St. George's recently stated that he preferred to have the school entirely vacated of pupils during the summer vacation, in view of which it is thought that the school should pay the transportation costs of pupils.\n\nI would appreciate the Department's views and a statement of their policy in the matter.\n\nD. M. MacKey,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nEncs.\n\n-ms.\nST. GEORGE'S INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nLytton, B.C.,\nJuly 11, 1947\n\nDear Commissioner MacKay:\n\nI am replying to your letter 13-11-1, relative to the three Quash girls of the Stikine agency.\n\nDuring the month of November last, I received a letter from Mr. Indian agent Samson, asking me to try and find a home for these three girls during the holiday months, rather than send them back to their old home. He also added that if I would send him an account of the expenses in the matter of board, he would see that it was paid for. Last year we had just one of the girls, and I found a reliable family who were anxious to take her in, and I paid them at the rate of $15.00 per month. I was quite prepared to do the same again this year for the three.\n\nFor various reasons I would recommend that no pupils should be in this school during the two holiday months. Those who know the Fraser canyon will appreciate how like an oven this flat top building becomes when the temperature reaches 117 degrees, as it frequently does. Children become terribly disappointed at being left in school when all the others are going home. We are also anxious to have the building free of pupils, so that as much painting and repairing as possible may be done.\n\nI have no doubt the Department will let me know if they decide that the expense of boarding these children is our responsibility.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n\"Chas F. Hives\"\nPrincipal\n\nMajor D. M. MacKay,\nCommissioner of Indians for B.C.,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. of Mines and Resources, Ottawa.\n\nYour File 165-0-10 (WT 1)\n\nWith reference to Mr. Phelan's letter of July 5th in connection with the three Quash girls, pupils of the St. George's Indian Residential School, I am enclosing a copy of the Rev. Principal's letter of July 11th from which you will note that for the reasons stated he considers it inadvisable to keep any pupils in the school during the two holiday months, which raises the question of responsibility for maintenance of the pupils who do not return to their homes during the holidays. I appear to have little information with respect to the home conditions of these three girls but apart from this it would hardly be feasible for them to travel all the way from Lytton to Telegraph Creek and return.\n\nI should appreciate receiving information with respect to the Department's policy in the matter of maintenance of Residential school pupils who do not return to their homes during the summer holidays. It is presumed that if the schools receive the per capita grant for these pupils maintenance costs should be met from school funds but if not the expense of placing the children in private homes should, I believe, be met by the Department.\n\nD.

Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of the 14th instant with reference to payment of transportation costs for pupils of the St. George's Residential School who returned to their homes for the summer holidays.\n\nIt has been our usual practice to expect the parents to provide this expenditure and if not, the school management. However, if you consider that special consideration should be given towards the transportation costs of any particular school we would be pleased to consider your suggestion.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\nOttawa, July 23rd, 1947.\n\nMajor D.M. MacKay, Indian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70, Vancouver, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 14th instant\nwith reference to the three Quash girls, pupils of the\nSt. George's Residential School.\n\nIn practically all residential schools\nthere are a few children who cannot be sent home for\nthe summer holidays due to parental indifference or\nbad home conditions.

Neary\nSupt. of Welfare & Training.\n\nPP/MGD\nIndian Affairs Branch, Dept. M. & R., OTTAWA, Ont.\n\nI am enclosing herewith copies of letters to the Principals of the Alberni Residential School and the St. Georges Residential School, respectively, relative to enrolment of Protestant pupils from the Babine Agency. The letters are self explanatory and you will note that in almost all cases these children are from large and most indigent families who could not be expected to bear the expenses of the fares to school. I would, therefore, ask that the initial fare be paid by the Department on the understanding that if the children are to return for the summer holidays next year the parents must bear the cost of passage. Completed application forms in all of these cases will be forwarded in due course. Meanwhile an early reply is requested in order that I may make the necessary arrangements with the transportation companies concerned. I also wish permission to provide transportation for Joyce Brown, who was returned to Hazelton by the Principal of Lytton school and who has now no means of returning; in this matter kindly refer to your letter of September 23, 1946, your file 165-0-10 (W.T.l).\n\nIn all the above cases so far as St. Georges school is concerned the Principal has expressed his willingness to accept these applicants with the single exception of Hazel Green. The Principal of Port Alberni school has not yet been able to give me a definite answer.\n\nJ.V. Boys,\nIndian Agent.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOttawa, August 29th, 1947.\n\nMr. J.V. Boys, Indian Agent,\nHazelton, B.C.\n\nWe have your letter of the 13th instant enclosing copies of letters that you have directed to the principals of the St. George's Residential School and the Alberni Residential School with reference to placing children from your agency in those institutions.\n\nWe realize that owing to unsatisfactory home conditions it is often necessary to place children in residential schools. However, if home conditions are satisfactory we prefer that the children attend the day school on the reserve.\n\nWe also know that some of our day schools have been closed owing to shortage of teachers. I particularly refer to Kitsegukla. In this connection I would point out that on August 16th we notified Indian Commissioner Mackay that we approved the appointment of Mrs. A.M. Evans as teacher of this school and, consequently, it will be in operation for the coming academic year and any children whose home conditions are satisfactory should attend this school, rather than go to a residential school.\n\nFrom past experience we have found that it is a mistake to send children to a residential school located at a very great distance from their homes and to a locality where conditions are altogether different from their homes.\n\nThe question of summer holidays always arises\nand it has not been our practice to pay transportation expenses for holidays for pupils whose homes are a considerable distance from the residential school they are attending.\n\nWith reference to Joyce Brown, the principal of the St. George's Residential School at Lytton had no authority to send her home unless he was assured that her parents or guardian would provide the cost of her return trip. I am writing him to this effect and no doubt he will send you the money to bring her back.\n\nWith the above in mind we are prepared to favourably consider applications for admission to residential schools for children whose home conditions are unsatisfactory and on whose reserves schools will not be operated during the coming academic year. However, as intimated above, we hope to secure teachers for all our day schools as soon as possible and this will obviate the necessity for sending several children to residential schools.\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nPP/mgd\nOttawa, August 29th, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nWe have a letter from Indian Agent Boys in which he states that Joyce Brown was returned to Hazelton for the summer holidays and is now applying to the Agent for the funds to pay her return fare.\n\nAs you are aware, it has not been our practice to pay transportation costs of children in residential schools to permit them to go home for holidays if their reserves are situated a long distance from the residential school. This applies in the case of Joyce Brown.\n\nWe did not give any authority for her to go on holidays and under the circumstances it is felt that her return transportation should either have been guaranteed by the parents or guardians at the time or payment made from school funds.\n\nNo doubt you will communicate with Mr. Boys with reference to having her returned to the St. George's School.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan\nChief, Training Division.\n\nRev.

Mines & Resources, Ottawa, Ont.,\n\nIn reply to your letter of August 29th, please find enclosed applications for admission for a number of pupils to Alberni Indian Residential School and to St. Georges Indian Residential School. In connection with these applications I would refer you to my letter of August 13th and copies of letters to the Principals of these two schools explaining the family circumstances of the new applicants. In addition to these the following applications were accepted by the respective Principals:\n\nALBERNI INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nGeorge Cyril Harris, Gloria Louise Harris and Vera Evelyn Harris: These are the children of Jeffrey Harris of Kispiox whose children have made good progress in school. The parents were very concerned at the time of application that no teacher had been found for the Kispiox school and for this reason these applications were submitted to the Principal of the Alberni School who agreed to take them. A teacher has recently been appointed at Kispiox.\n\nNorma Margaret Morrison: This is the foster daughter of Moses Morrison, councillor at Kispiox, whose wife recently underwent a serious operation following chronic illness of long duration. Because the mother will not be able to care for the child permission was asked to send her to Alberni and Mr. Caldwell agreed to accept her.\n\nOf the other children mentioned in my letter to Mr. Caldwell, Roy Phillip Wesley and Allen David Wesley were unable to go with the children from this Agency owing to sickness at the time of departure.\n\nST. GEORGE INDIAN RESIDENTIAL SCHOOL\n\nOf the children listed in my letter to the Principal, Ralph and James Lattie were not sent, Norman Green was not physically fit and Angel Green was not acceptable to the principal. In place of these children the following were sent: Leonard Ivan Sexsmith, this boy's father is dead and his mother has, for a long time, been a patient in Hazelton Hospital. He is not receiving proper care and was therefore admitted to St. George's school. Marjorie Harris; this child has for some years been a hospital case suffering from Potts disease of the spine. Recently discharged from hospital, the doctor asked if provision could be made to have her placed in a Residential school, particularly in view of a somewhat unsatisfactory home environment.\n\nI trust that all these applications may receive your approval for in all cases the best interests of both the children and their families are being served by sending them away to school.\n\nJ.V.

I have not heard if he is doing so; but as he has not returned, I would recommend that he be given an honorable discharge from St. George's.\n\nNos. 402, 0273, 0295, 0284, 0321, 0332, 0310, 0364, 0290, 0309. Gerald Thom, Edna Frank, Agnes Frank, Eileen McKay, Rose Hall, Rhona Thomas, Rhoda Spike, Bessie Paul, Marjorie Smith, Nancy Hance, respectively, have not returned to school since vacation. The respective parents of these pupils have expressed their need of them at home, and I would recommend that they be given their discharge from this school.\n\nNo. 0347, Rachel McKay is a patient in the Coqualeetza Hospital. I would recommend that her name be dropped from the roll of this school.\n\nNos. 452, 497, 505, 506, Archie Blankinship, Adam Blankinship, Horace Jack, Jimmie Jack, respectively, are attending day school. I would recommend that their names be dropped from the roll of St. George's.\n\nPupils Nos. 0383, 0281, 0298, 0330, 0331, 0418, 0414, 0296, 0345, Annie Edwards, Mary J. Charlie, Maggie Dick, Matilda Drynock, Gloria Drynock, Alice Harry, Evelyn Drynock, Alana Dick, Doreen Charlie, respectively, belong to the class of people, whose parents make many demands and many complaints. We have had to almost beg them to send their children, and they, on their part have considered they were doing us a tremendous favour by allowing their children to come. Their children have not yet returned to school. Others have taken their place. I feel the school will not only be better off...\nwithout them, but a slight feeling of independence on our part is good tonic for the school. We have 150 pupils in residence at the moment. Some have to sleep on the floor on matresses, but that will be remedied as soon as the new promised beds arrive. I would recommend that they be allowed to stay home for the time being.\n\nPupils Nos. 0378, 0411, 0311, 423 are pupils whose health is a menace to other pupils, and whose parents are not willing for them to be sent to the hospital. I would recommend their discharge from our school. They are Mabel Phillips, Dillys Phillips, Dora Hance, Francis Lachelle respectively.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nOttawa, October 17, 1947.\n\nDear Mr. Hives:\n\nWe are in receipt of your letter of October 6th.

Canon C. F. Hives  \nPrincipal\n\nJan. 5, 1948  \nLytton, B. C.\n\nDear Sir:\n\nThere are several explanations required to be made in connection with the quarterly returns.\n\nPupil No. 0259 Dorothy Swartz has been away from school for over a year. While in school we found her to be a very satisfactory pupil, and she passed her eighth grade while here. At that time there was no Continuation school in Lytton. There is now, and our pupils are invited to attend as they reach the educational standing. Dorothy Swartz wished to attend, but she would be greatly handicapped if she remained home; so after talking the matter over with Mr. Indian Agent Strang, I took her in. I don't think we made any mistake, and would recommend that she be recognised by the Department as a Grant earning High School pupil. I have also left Pupil No. 432 Hector McIntyre on the school roll, though he is attending High School, and living at home.\n\nPupil No. 452 Archie Blankinship was allowed to stay home at the commencement of term, with the understanding that he attend the Public School in Merritt. I recently received a letter from the Merritt Indian Agent asking me to take him back, as they could do nothing with him. I have therefore admitted him, and would recommend that he continue as before on the roll. His brother, Adam Blankinship 497 has just been under tonsil operation, and I expect he will have to return to us when he is well.\n\nI would recommend the discharge of Nos. 485, 486, Fred Wale, Victor Lowatt. These are Hazelton boys, and I understand they are now attending the day school from their own home. The same applies to 0384 Pearl Lowatt.\n\nI would also recommend the Discharge of Pupils Nos. 0304, 0307, Hazel Munro, Helen Machelle. These two girls are required at their respective homes to help mothers with large families.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs, Dept. of Mines & Resources.\n\nIndian Affairs (RG 10 Volume 6466, file 888-10, part 12)\n\nPUBLIC ARCHIVES\nARCHIVES PUBLIQUES\nCANADA\n## ADMISSION OF PUPILS AT St. George's SCHOOL DURING Oct.

Last term we had thirty-one pupils from that district; and their transportation expenses, amounting to over four hundred dollars, was shared by the parents and St. George's School.\n\nI am most anxious to have these pupils return to us again at the beginning of the Fall term; and from letters received from parents, pupils and the Indian Agent, it would appear that they are anxious for the pupils to return. Moreover, I am of the opinion that, on account of the difference in language, our Lytton Indian pupils, along with those from the Coast, learn to talk better English, because English must be their common form of speech.\n\nHad we not taken in these children, it is not likely that they would have attended any school last year, and they are at the age when it is very necessary that they should receive an education and training. It is therefore the responsibility of the Department that they should have access to either a day school or a residential school.\n\nI would, therefore, respectfully ask that the Department assume the cost of transportation one way; and as the return home, at the commencement of holidays was shared by parents and school, so the transportation expenses from home to school again, under the circumstances referred to above, be assumed by the Department.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources, Ottawa.\nAugust 13, 1948.\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res. School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWe have your letter of the 6th instant regarding the pupils from the Prince Rupert district who attended St. George's Residential School last year.\n\nWe note that you suggest that we provide $400. for their transportation back to the school. We feel that this matter should have been brought to our attention before the children left for holidays.\n\nIn residential schools in Eastern Canada, it is the general practice to retain at the school during the summer holidays those children whose home reserve is a considerable distance from the school concerned.\n\nThese children only went to the school last year and in any case, we would not consider allowing a heavy expenditure for transportation after such a short sojourn in a residential school.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nBernard F. Neary\nSuperintendent of Education.\n\nPP/MGD\nDear Colonel Neary:\n\nIn reply to your letter 165-0-10, received today, and relative to transportation expenses of Prince Rupert children from home to school.\n\nYou will, no doubt, recall my speaking to you about this matter in your office during my visit there in May. You say, in your letter, that children, who are so far distant from home, should remain in school during the holiday months. I wonder if you know, or realize the kind of a place the Frazer Canyon is during those months. Quite frequently the temperature rises to 110 degrees, and our building becomes an oven unbearable to sleep in, or have children living in. We have absolutely nothing in the way of a swimming pool, or place where boys or girls can find access to bathing beaches. And the Fraser river, which is an attraction to any boy in the hot weather is treacherous and unsafe. Moreover, we are trying in every way possible, to stimulate the family and social life of these people. You cannot do that if you are going to deprive them of personal social intercourse by keeping them apart for years.\n\nThe matter, as I see it is this: If the pupils from Prince Rupert, who have no access to educational facilities near to their own homes, come to St. George's School, the school should not be expected to meet their transportation expenses. The parents are willing to pay one way. Either they must pay both ways, or we must receive financial assistance from the Department in returning them to school after holidays. I do not think this school can finance this matter out of the grant earnings.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nColonel B. F. Neary,\nSuperintendent of Education,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAugust 26, 1948.\n\nAIR MAIL\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Res.

Both these children (Leonard Sexsmith and Joyce Brown) were travelling to St. George's Residential School, Lytton, B. C.\n\nJ. V. Boys\nIndian Superintendent\nDear Sir:\n\nReferring to the September Quarterly Returns, there are several matters I would comment on.\n\nNearly all pupils, shown in the returns, were in residence within four days of the 1st of September. Other years they have come dribbling in, some as late as December. Those who were late this year found their room filled up with new comers, and had to return home. I am sorry this has happened, for I am afraid they will not receive the proper care they should this winter, and they will miss their classroom education. Last year, we had similar conditions. One family of three girls did not arrive until late, and they had to return home for lack of accommodation here. They were amongst the first to be on hand this year. Next year I expect there will be few if any tardy ones.\n\nDuring the month of August I wrote you, asking for four hundred dollars for the purpose of transportation of pupils from Prince Rupert to our school. You very kindly sanctioned that amount. All pupils came from Prince Rupert to our school with no expense to school or Department. In my experience, that is one of the biggest things for good that has happened, and shows they are beginning to appreciate what we are doing for them.\n\nThere are several pupils whose discharge from our school I would recommend: No. 407 Wesley Munro, 16 yrs' old, required on his father's farm. 431 Dennis Seymour kept at home for the same purpose. 460 Alonzo Williams home for the same purpose. 464 Elmer Casimir, whose guardian Grandmother is a Roman Catholic, stayed away until our school was filled up, and is now attending St. Mary's School at Mission. I would recommend that he be admitted to that school. Adam Blankinship, 497, Clifford Kirkpatrick, 494, Florence and Gloria Kirkpatrick, 0407, 0435 are all attending day school near their respective homes. 514, 518, Robert Stevens & Fred Lincoln respectively did not return. 0275, 0279, 0312, 0317\nAngeline Edmunds, Thelma Raphael, Ruth Samson, Loretta Smith respectively, are at home with their parents.\n\nPriscilla Isaac, who was attending High School last year secured a fairly good situation during the holidays, and is staying with it.\n\nI would recommend that the above pupils be discharged from our school.\n\nThe other pupils who are now absent owing to lack of accommodation when they came late, will most likely be on hand in good time next term. In this respect I may say, we shall not have accommodation for all who wish to be admitted. Our classrooms at present are greatly overcrowded, owing to more of our pupils attending full time in the classrooms. The classroom accommodation was originally intended for the half day system. If we are to meet the demands of the full day in classroom, we must have much larger accommodation. This is a matter which requires careful and immediate attention.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nSecretary,\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDepartment of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nJanuary 22nd, 1948\n\nSir,\n\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the St. Georges Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child\nEnglish name Rosalie McKay\nAge 7 yrs.\nName of Band Lytton.\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\nFather's full name and No. Daniel McKay\nMother's full name and No. Anna McKay\nParents living or dead living\nState of child's health\nReligion Ch.of Eng.\nDoes applicant speak English? yes\nPreviously attended no.\n\nschool for years\n\n(Signature of father)\n\nNOTE\u2014If mother or guardian signs, agent must forward full explanatory note.\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nSignature of Missionary or other Witness\n\n*Principal or other official of the school must not sign as witness.\n\nNOTE\u2014All the above particulars must be fully given, especially the \"Name of Band,\" \"No. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid\" and \"Religion.\" The minimum age for admission is seven (7) years, except in the case of an orphan, destitute or neglected child.

Some pupils returned from holidays with measles. We isolated these as soon as we possibly could, but not before they had broadcasted the germs amongst the other pupils. I am happy to say that we have no serious cases.\n\nMore than one hundred and fifty pupils returned before the first day of September, and the balance within two days after. This is an entirely different state of affairs from what it was seven or eight years ago. At that time I almost had to go on my knees begging parents to send their children to school, and the school had been in the habit of chasing around after them. This year, they came of their own accord without any effort on our part. For over five years we have had no runaway children from school, and during that time I have given no corporal punishments. If we took in all the children whose parents are asking for their admission we would be greatly overcrowded. None have come in from Hazelton, although there are two dozen at that agency waiting for word from me to take them in. I understand they have no teacher at the day school there.\n\nYou will note that we have sixteen pupils on this roll with High School standing. Three of these have been accepted to take their training in the School of Nursing Aides in Calgary, and have to report there on the morning of Oct. 24th. We shall then have thirteen attending High School. Three of these are attending from their homes, and which are in close proximity to the school. Most of these pupils are most anxious to take courses in the Industrial Arts, Motor Mechanics, Home economics etc. The school at Lytton gives only those subjects that would prepare pupils for University. My opinion is that there is a very small percentage of pupils normally fit to take a University course, and the large percentage fall by the way. But if and when they manage to get through, they have great difficulty competing for a livelihood in the professional world.\n\nWe must have either a High School at Lytton teaching the Industrial Arts etc., or our pupils should go to some place where is situated a Technical High School, such as the one in Sault Ste. Marie. I anticipate having seven or eight more pupils from Grade VIII next year, seeking advanced education. This is a serious matter; for one thing, by these pupils continuing here, deprives little Indian children from entering our school. I am definitely of the opinion that if children are to enter the residential school,\nLast evening, I attended a meeting of the Board of Trade, recently organized in Lytton. The matter of the need of a modern High School building came up for discussion, and it was generally agreed that a school with combined instruction in Industrial Arts etc., would best meet the needs of the community. The present building is the abandoned school house, which is inconvenient, uncomfortable, and over-crowded. The reason I am interested in this matter is because St. George's School would, in the future, provide a large percentage of High School pupils. A committee was appointed, of which I am one, to investigate the matter from all angles, and to report at the next meeting. I am convinced that it is a situation which will have to be met, and dealt with properly. I am also convinced that nothing will be done unless Indian Affairs gives a substantial financial assistance to this important matter. If such a building did materialize, then we should need a hostel for St. George's School to accommodate thirty High School pupils, with quarters for a married couple, who would care for them, and give assistance in their home work.\n\nThis matter is not a small venture, but an important one, and will have to be faced and dealt with accordingly. May I report to you again on this matter?\n\nI would recommend the discharge of the following pupils:\n\nNo. 433 Herbert Jumbo. Needed at home\n440 Francis James.

I suggest two possibilities: First, the discharge of a sufficient number of those pupils who do not require institutional care so that space is available. Or second, the provision of some space from the area of the school now used as sewing rooms.\n\nI would also request that you do not make at this time or any later date any discharges without first consulting the Superintendent of the Agency to which the pupil belongs.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR. F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools in B.C.\nBoys' sewing & mending room\n\nSmall boys' dormitory\n\nProposed change\nDear Major Davey:\n\nThis should have been written last night, as I promised to do, but on my arrival home, I found things on the farm pretty much at a standstill, for my Farm Manager was ill in bed, and the insilage cutting at rest, and the potatoes not in. So I have been very busy at these things, and making them safe before Winter comes on.\n\nWith reference to the matter of making accommodation for more pupils, I have gone into this, and have a recommendation to make to you. The two top rooms of the main, or centre part of the building, were originally intended for dormitories, but have never been used as such. One has been used as a girls' sewing and mending room; and the other as a boys' sewing and mending room. Part of the boys' dormitory was taken off and used as a spinning and weaving room, and is now occupied by looms which are never used. I am enclosing plans of the rooms, as they are now, and as I would recommend they should be.\n\nIf these rooms are used as dormitories, some accommodation will have to be found for the sewing and mending department, which is a very important one in this school; for all girls' clothing is made, and much mending is required with two hundred girls and boys. We can manage this with the girls, as we have a room on the ground floor, which can be used for that purpose. It is 23'x16' and would require proper and convenient furniture in the way of shelves, cupboards and lockers. By the second plan, which is a recommendation, you will notice that I would advise taking half the other room on the top floor for a boys' sewing and mending room. This also would have to be properly furnished with shelves, cupboards and lockers. When this building was handed over for occupation after it was built, no provision was made in the matter of shelves, lockers and cupboards. In the rooms which now accommodate the sewing and mending, we have old cupboards taken out of the old school, and very roughly made shelves.\n\nYou will also note that a certain amount of partition would have to be built, and one wall pulled out. But this would not entail very much work or expense. We here can do all the wood work, if we have the proper lumber for\nmaking shelves, cupboards and lockers. We can put up the studding and lath for the partitions, but would require a plasterer to do the finishing.\n\nBy estimation of the cost of this would be twelve hundred dollars.\n\nAs you are aware, our dormitories at present are over-crowded. With the opening up of the top centre dormitories, we could take in a total of 215 pupils. I would put the smallest of the girls and boys in the two dormitories. You will note there is a toilet of each dorm.\n\nIf we are to increase our pupilage, we would require more accommodation for classroom work. And if we had a classroom block, I would recommend that we allow all children living within the three mile limit of the school, to live at home and attend school here. That would mean a school bus service, and we would have to provide mid-day meal for the ones who would come by bus. At present we could count on, at least, twenty four pupils who could live at home, and attend school by bus service.\n\nThis is a matter worthy of consideration, and one which might work out alright. The thing is, we, at St. George's School must have more accommodation or another school similar to this should be built in the north to relieve us of the northern children.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor R.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.,\nVancouver.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa.\n\nRe: St. George's Residential School\nLytton\n\nAttached is a letter received from Reverend Canon Hives of the above-mentioned school, in which he proposes certain alterations in order to provide increased dormitory space at his school. These changes have been discussed with Inspector Devey who feels that the work should be undertaken.\n\nIt will be noted that the Reverend Principal estimates the cost of this work at $1200.00, but before recommending this expenditure I wish to have more definite information regarding the materials that will be required. I am writing to the Superintendent of the Lytton Agency requesting a breakdown of the bill of materials.\n\nThe present dormitory space is taxed by the number of pupils now enrolled and these alterations would alleviate the overcrowding which exists in several of the dormitories. It will be noted that the Reverend Principal suggests that the enrolment at his school could be increased to 215 pupils, but I am doubtful if the total space, including that made available by the alterations, would justify the enrolment of this number. I have also asked the Superintendent to check the cubic air space in the dormitories, including the additional space which it is hoped to make available. When this information is received I shall write again.\n\nIn the meantime, I shall appreciate the Department's comments on this proposal.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\nRev. Canon C.

I have already written to Mr Superintendent Boys of Hazelton, telling him that his children will receive first consideration when our dormitory accommodation will allow us to take them in.\n\nWe have an authorized pupilage of 100. At present, we have in residence 106. These children are all, according to their respective agent & superintendent in need of institutional care and training.\n\nI assure you that we shall take in the Babine children just as soon as we possibly can; and that will be when the Department give their sanction to go ahead and make the necessary changes in dormitory and sewing rooms; as well as providing more beds for the dormitory.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\n\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor R.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVancouver, B.C.\nOctober 8, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon, C.F. Hives,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nI understand from Mr. Webster that you are considering a trip to the Hazelton area in the near future. If it is at all possible, I should like to have the opportunity of seeing you before you make this trip. I shall be in the office for the next ten days and if there is any likelihood of your being in Vancouver during that period, I should like you to call at the office.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nR.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools for B.C.\nIndian Commissioner for B.C., P.O. Box 70, VANCOUVER, B.C.\n\nI wish to advise that I am unable to obtain any satisfaction regarding pupils from this Agency attending St. George's Indian Residential School at Lytton, who should have returned to that school early this month.\n\nOn the 27th August I received a telegram from the Principal as follows - \"PLEASE DO NOT LET CHILDREN RETURN UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME WILL WRITE YOU AFTER END OF MONTH. CHAS S HIVES, PRINCIPAL\". We accordingly informed parents to this effect and awaited Canon Hive's letter.\n\nIn the early part of September I was obliged to absent myself from the Agency Office in order to take Dr. Galbraith's X-ray unit to Fort Babine but on my return I wrote Canon Hives on 9th September informing him that I had not received the promised letter and asking for the reason for the delay as to when these children should leave. I have received no reply.\n\nI now learn that Mr. Anfield's children were not subject to the same request from Canon Hives and returned to school early in September.\n\nAmong the children was one Norma Wale, whose home environment was such that I had asked Canon Hives before during the summer holidays of 1948 and again this year, that he keep the child at Lytton throughout the holidays. I learn today that without any notification to this Office whatsoever, Norma was discharged from St. George's school on 14th August 1949 and is now living with a couple in Prince Rupert who are living common law.\n\nThis high handed treatment of pupils of this Agency by Canon Hives is just not good enough and I would ask that an immediate investigation be made. At least I should be informed what is his grievance, if any.\nIt is true that in the past year or two since my arrival in this Agency we have been forwarding children whose home environment demanded that some provision be made for them in a residential school. This applies both to Lytton School and to Alberni, the difference being that Mr. Caldwell has co-operated with us and offered us the utmost accommodation available.\n\nThe following is a list of children who have been deemed attending St. George's school for the past year or more:\n\nHerbert Clarence Johnson\nRalph Johnson\nHomer Muldoe (Shanoss)\nEssie Muldoe (Shanows)\nRennie Green\nLeonard Sexsmith\nMarjorie Harris\nNorma Wale\nJoyce Brown\n\nOf these it is possible that the Muldoe children have gone down since their mother has been in Prince Rupert during the summer and it is rumoured that they were sent direct from Prince Rupert. The remainder are still awaiting word to return.\n\nIn addition to these there are a number of other children in this Agency who very definitely must be placed in residential schools for their own sakes. Their home conditions being such that they can never be expected to progress in education or health if left where they are. These were the subject of a letter to Canon Hives on 9th August, a copy of which is enclosed. These children are all Anglican or Salvation Army in religion.\n\nWill you kindly have this matter investigated and some satisfactory arrangements made for the benefit of the children of this Agency without delay.\n\nJ. N. BOYS\nIndian Superintendent\n\nJVB:BMH\nBabine Agency\n\nRev. Canon C. F. Hives,\nSt. George's Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Canon Hives,\n\nAgain this year we have a number of new applicants to attend your school. All of them, more or less, urgent cases. They are as follows:\n\nTAYLOR, Henry Harris, born July 17th, 1934. This boy has completed Grade 8 and wishes to attend High School. There are no facilities available near his home; he therefore wishes to reside in your school to attend High School in Lytton.\n\nHILSON, Norah Deanna, born September 2nd, 1941. No schooling so far. Living in a very poor foster home.\n\nGREEN, Peggy, born July 19th, 1943. Mother unmarried. Very poor home.\n\nGREEN, Larry, born November 8th, 1941. Home broken up. No schooling for either of these boys so far. Brothers of Ronnie David Green.\n\nJOHNSON, Ronald Cedric, born January 23rd, 1940. Mother unmarried. Home overcrowded.\n\nHESLEY, Dorcas, born March 6th, 1936. Mother widowed. Large family. Poor home environment. Both in Grade 3.\n\nLATTIE, James Kerr, born November 26th, 1939. Poor overcrowded home.\n\nJOHNSON, Arnold Rodger, born August 3rd, 1942. Father deceased. Mother living with another man who does not care to support her children. Very poor home conditions. Brother to Ralph and...\nHerbert Clarence Johnson, at present attending St. George's School.\n\nWill you please let me know, as soon as possible, if you can take these children so that we may complete documentations and other arrangements.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nJ. V. Boys,\nIndian Superintendent.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Mines & Resources,\nOttawa\n\nRe: St. George's Residential School\n\nI attach herewith a file of correspondence between this office and the principal of the above mentioned school. Also attached are copies of letters from Mr. Superintendent Boys to this office and to the Reverend Principal, which gave rise to our correspondence with Canon Hives. It will be noted that Mr. Boys lists in his letter of Sept. 30th the names of nine pupils attending the St. George's Residential School in the past year. Of this number it is understood that two have returned to the school. The others were not returned at the beginning of the school term, at the specific request of Canon Hives in his telegram of August 27th to Mr. Boys. Mr. Boys rightfully assumed that this request of the principal was merely for a delay in sending the pupils down. On our receipt of Mr. Boys' letter dated Sept. 30th Inspector Davey wrote to Canon Hives requesting that he visit this office. Canon Hives visited Inspector Davey on October 12th and I also had an opportunity of speaking to him. Both Inspector Davey and myself made it quite clear to the Principal that first priority on admissions to his school should be given to necessitous cases. It was also made clear to him that the principal of the school did not have the right of discharging pupils without first consulting the Agent concerned. Immediately following receipt of Canon Hives' letter of October 18th, Inspector Davey called him by telephone and pointed out that it was absolutely essential that the pupils who should not have been discharged from his school be returned immediately and that accommodation should be\nmade either through the discharge of pupils not requiring institutional care or through the use of dormitory accommodation presently occupied by the sewing classes. These suggestions were apparently not acceptable. Canon Hives gives as his reasons: (a) The school cannot afford the cost of transporting the children from Hazelton to Lytton. (b) The sewing room is absolutely essential to the successful operation of the school. You will note from the attached diagram prepared by the principal that the sewing classes occupy a space 34 x 36, which in the opinion of this office, is out of all proportion to the school's requirements. Apparently the main objection of the principal is on the grounds of cost. It was pointed out to him that two years ago a grant of $400.00 was made by the Department for transporting pupils, which amount he returned to the Department and has not requested further assistance.\n\nThe attitude of the principal is clearly indicated in one specific case mentioned by Mr. Boys in which a girl whose home environment was such that he had requested the principal to keep the child during the summer holidays was released from the school without any notification to the Superintendent. The girl is now living in Prince Rupert with a couple who are living in common-law.\n\nIn spite of Inspector Davey's conversation with Canon Hives he still has no assurance from the Reverend Principal that these very necessitous cases formerly enrolled at the residential school will be re-admitted.\n\nOur latest action is indicated in the attached copy of Inspector Davey's letter to the Principal dated October 19th. I shall report later as to whether or not these instructions have been carried out. I am informing you fully at this time in anticipation of the principal referring the matter direct to the Department.\n\nW.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner for B.C.\n\nencls.\nAIR MAIL\n\nOctober 26th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S. Arneil,\nIndian Commissioner,\nP.O. Box 70,\nVancouver, B.C.\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School. Your File 16-11-1 (159)\n\nWe have your letter of the 19th instant with reference to the admission and discharge of pupils at the above school.\n\nWe concur fully in the action you are taking, and if you do not receive a satisfactory reply from the Reverend Principal, you should write to us again.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nPP/ST Chief, Education Division\nDear Mr. Helen:\n\nI have a matter on my mind which is causing me some concern or worry. It is in regard to increased pupilage. You are aware of the circumstances surrounding St. George's, and the difficulties arising from prejudice which seemed to be in the minds of the Indian parents against this school eight years ago. You remember how difficult it was to persuade parents to send in the children, and in consequence the small grant allowance we received.\n\nThere were lots of children around, but the parents didn't want to send them here. That condition has changed, I think, perhaps, one of the factors which brought about the change was the admitting of the Prince Rupert area children. After they began to come in, and find satisfactory conditions here, then the parents in this district began to take up so that now our dormitories are overcrowded, and there is quite a waiting list.\n\nMr. Indian Superintendent Amfield asked me how many could be taken again from his district, and I told him the same number as last year. These, along with some from our vicinity, totalling 150, arrived here two days before the term officially started. The balance of two hundred arrived two days after. I was therefore unable to bring in all the Hazelton children, who were here last year. This has brought about rather an unpleasant feeling in the mind of the Indian Superintendent at Hazelton and Inspector Davy. I did not realize that our own people could rush their children in so quickly, and, other years, the one thing that the pupils lived for was their discharge from school. This year, several returned, when I hardly expected, with the hope that they may attend the Junior High School next year.\n\nWe could take in more pupils if the two top dormitories in the centre part of the building were opened up for that purpose. They have never yet been used as such, but have been used as sewing rooms. No other provision has ever been made for sewing rooms. We could accommodate sewing rooms in other similar rooms if they were fitted up properly. But they would require proper shelves, cupboards and lockers. We can do the work as a Manual Training project, but we would\nrequire the material, lumber and hardware. We would also require twenty small beds, mattresses and bedding.\n\nWe have not used very much of the sanctioned amount for repairs allotted for our school. I estimate that $1,500.00 would be required to do the necessary work in fitting up sewing rooms and purchasing beds etc.\n\nI believe this matter has been placed before you by Commissioner Arnold. I would be very much obliged if you would consider this as favourably and as soon as possible.\n\nI went up to Hazelton two weeks ago, just to compare conditions there with those of our Indians here. The Indians at Hazelton live in places as compared with our poor little shacks. And they make a great deal more money there than do our Indians. They also have three schools, which are within a quarter of a mile of any of the children. But they also have some very poor family conditions. Broken homes through drink etc. I have promised to take back six of the children, who are desperately in need of institutional care, just as soon as we have accommodation for them.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n[Signature]\nPrincipal.\n\nTo Philip Melan,\nChief, Training Division,\nIndian Affairs,\nOttawa.\nAIR MAIL\n\nDecember 9th, 1949.\n\nRev. Canon C.F. Hives,\nPrincipal,\nSt. George's Indian Residential School,\nLytton, B.C.\n\nDear Canon Hives:\n\nWe have your letter of the 20th ultimo in connection with St. George's Indian Residential School.\n\nWe are submitting an extract from your letter to Indian Commissioner Arneil. I refer to that portion of your communication which explains taking children from Hazelton. I am under the impression that some children for whom institutional care was necessary could not be accommodated, although others less deserving were accepted.\n\nWe already have a communication from Indian Commissioner Arneil with regard to renovating the sewing room in order to provide more dormitory space. We have not yet made any decision on this particular matter.\n\nI note in your letter that you state that not much of the sanctioned amount of $1,500.00 has been used. Our records show the following:\n\nMaterial for Fencing........$206.34\nPaint and turpentine..........$299.50\nRepairs to the boiler.........$73.30\nRequest from Indian Commissioner Arneil for plumbing fixtures..$900.00 (approx.)\n\n....2\nThese items amount to slightly over $1,479.00.\n\nYours sincerely,\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nChief, Education Division\nAIR MAIL\n\nDecember 9th, 1949.\n\nMr. W.S.

The two girls from Grouard were placed at Miller Bay Hospital, Prince Rupert, to be employed as maids and a tuition grant obtained for one, who was to enroll at the St. Joseph's Academy to undertake a commercial course, when the term commenced the following month.\n\nUnfortunately both girls became involved in liquor offences and brought before Prince Rupert Juvenile Court on two separate occasions. As a result, one girl was discharged from Miller Bay Hospital as unsuitable and her sister barred from admission to St. Joseph's Academy. There were no alternative other than return these two young girls to Telegraph Creek. Both were motherless and their father's whereabouts unknown. They have been placed under the care of a reliable guardian and issued regular monthly assistance from this office.\nAPPLICATION FOR ADMISSION\n\nTo the\nDirector of Indian Affairs,\nOttawa, Canada\n\nSir,\u2014\nI hereby make application for admission of the undermentioned child into the Kanloops Indian Residential School; to remain therein under the guardianship of the Principal for such term as the Minister of Mines and Resources may deem proper:\n\nIndian name of child ...............................................................\nEnglish name ...............................................................\nAge ...............................................................\nName of Band ...............................................................\nNo. of ticket under which child's annuity is paid ...............................................................\nFather's full name and No. ...............................................................\nMother's full name and No. ...............................................................\nParents living or dead ...............................................................\nState of child's health ...............................................................\nReligion ...............................................................\nDoes applicant speak English? ...............................................................\nPreviously attended ...............................................................\n\nschool for years\n\nWilliam Tom\n(Signature of father)\n\nI hereby certify that the above application for admission has been read over and interpreted to the parent or guardian and that the contents were understood by him or her and that I witnessed his or her signature to this document.\n\nFr.

This is quite an expensive item, as there are twenty-eight pupils, and I feel it is a bit too much to expect the parents to bear all the expense. The fare from Lytton to Prince Rupert by rail and boat with escort amounts to $772.20. And with incidentals in the way of meals in Vancouver, while awaiting all day to board the boat at night, would bring the total to $800.00. While I feel that the parents should be responsible for a part of this; yet in view of the fact that these children must come to us until such time as facilities are available for them near home, or miss their education and training entirely; and that many are from poor homes, I feel justified in asking the Department for half the amount, or four hundred dollars.\n\nThe matter of allowing them to stay here during the holidays should not be considered. These children are Coast children. To a large extent they are living for their Summer holidays, when they will be home; no matter what their home conditions are, and they will see and smell the sea again.\n\nI would, therefore, be very much obliged if you would place this matter before authority, and recommend that we receive the amount of $400.00 toward the cost of transportation of pupils from St. George's School at Lytton to Prince Rupert. I would then ask the Prince Rupert Superintendent to take a hand in asking the parents to do their part in paying the balance.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\n(Sgd.) Chas. F. Hives,\nPrincipal.\n\nMajor R.F. Davey,\nInspector of Indian Schools,\nVancouver, B.C.\nIndian Affairs Branch,\nDept. of Citizenship & Immigration,\nOttawa, Ontario.\n\nRe: St. George's Indian Residential School - Lytton, B.C.\n\nAttached please find a copy of a letter received from Canon Hives, Principal of the above named school, requesting an allowance in the amount of $400.00 to assist in the matter of transportation costs for children returning home to the Prince Rupert area for the summer holidays. The distance involved is in the neighborhood of 1000 miles, but the St. George's School is not alone in this respect as the same conditions prevail in the case of the Edmonton, Alberni, and to a lesser extent, Alert Bay Schools. I believe that in the majority of cases the parents can very well pay the cost of transportation and should be made to assume some responsibility with regard to the education of their children.\n\nThere are undoubtedly some children from this area who should not be discharged from the care of the Residential School at all. However, because I feel that a consistent policy should be enforced and in view of the fact that several schools in British Columbia receive assistance, particularly the St. Mary's Residential School at Mission, where the distances from which the pupils are transported are a fraction of those in the case of the schools mentioned above, I am referring this matter to the Department for a decision.\n\nMy recommendation in this matter is that no assistance be granted to any school in the matter of children returning home for holidays.\n\nW.

We have been particularly requested to reduce the amount spent for travelling expenses, and consequently, it has been decided not to allow any amount during the summer of 1951 for travelling expenses of children going home from residential schools or returning to residential schools in British Columbia.\n\nIt would be appreciated if you would notify the Superintendents in whose agencies residential schools are located, so that they in turn may advise the Principals concerned.\n\nPhilip Phelan,\nA/Superintendent of Education\nOttawa, April 20, 1951.\n\nMr. D.M.

This boy is an orphan with both parents deceased. He has been in the foster care of Alfred and Constance Stewart for many years. This summer, Alfred Stewart was drowned in a fishing accident and his widow, Constance Stewart, will be making her home with her brother, Jeffrey Benson and his family. This is going to create a housing situation, and it is felt that Jacob Silas Rush might be better in school, whilst an attempt is being made to work out the future of the widow and her one son, Alfred Cedric Stewart, presently registered as a pupil of the Edmonton Residential School, and whose return to that school is awaiting decision from the Department.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that this boy, Jacob Silas Rush be permitted to return to the Lytton School for the coming academic year only. He will be doing grade 8.\n\nF. Earl-Anfield,\nIndian Superintendent.\n\nFEA/ay\nAugust 9, 1951.\n\nMr. F.E. Anfield,\nSupt.
